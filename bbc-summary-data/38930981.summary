The 26-year-old former Crewe trainee joined the Clarets for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal.
The midfielder spent four-and-a-half years at Villa, who were relegated from the top flight last season.
"It was quiet in January and I was ready to travel to Brentford with Villa," he told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"[Aston Villa boss] Steve Bruce pulled me in and said they'd accepted a bid from Burnley and I was more than happy.
"It was a big shock. Obviously there were rumours in the summer but it didn't quite happen, but thankfully it has come and I'm absolutely delighted to be here.
"I wanted to give it one more go at Villa because I felt I deserved to try and get them back up, but it wasn't meant to be,"
"Thankfully the gaffer here has come in for me and as they say rescued me and I'm back in the top flight now."
