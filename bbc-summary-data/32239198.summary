Dale Whillans, 18, was a passenger in a black Seat which left the road and landed in a field at 14:00 on Monday.
The amateur footballer from Hawick died in Edinburgh's Western General Hospital on Thursday.
In a statement his family said: "It goes without saying that Dale was taken from us at far too young an age. We cannot put into words the devastation we are all feeling."
"Dale was a very popular and happy young man. He was such a big part of all of our lives and will never be forgotten.
"We are all deeply saddened by his death and would ask to be left to grieve in private at this sensitive time."
In a post on Facebook, Hawick Legion AFC also paid tribute to Mr Whillans, describing him as a "very popular lad who always had a smile on his face".
The statement said: "Dale had not long returned to our club but made a huge impact in that short time.
"A gifted footballer, he displayed a maturity on the ball that belied his young age."
The teenager had previously played with Hawick United and was in a second spell with the Border Amateur League side.
The statement added: "At times like this football fades into the background, Dale will be sorely missed not just by everyone at the club but by the town of Hawick as a whole."
A second passenger was also badly hurt in the crash on the A698 road between Hawick and Kelso, at Timpendean.
The 18-year-old driver received minor injuries in the accident.
Inquiries into the incident are ongoing and police have appealed for information.
Officers are particularly keen to hear from drivers who may have seen the vehicle shortly before the collision.
