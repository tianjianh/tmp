A senior detective with Humberside Police raped a woman after a Christmas party, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Det Ch Supt Colin Andrews, 57, is accused of carrying out the rape in a hotel room, in December 2003.
Mr Andrews, who retired earlier this year, was "controlling and bullying", Manchester Crown Court heard.
He denies rape, two counts of common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, stalking, harassment and witness intimidation.
The former murder detective was also described as "manipulative", the jury was told.
On the opening day of what is expected to be a four-week trial, the court heard the attack came months after another incident in which he pushed the woman in the stomach, causing her to fall backwards, hitting her head, and leaving her very scared.
The father of one, from Brough in East Yorkshire, is also accused of pursuing a campaign of stalking and harassment against another woman in the summer of 2013, during which he sent thousands of unwanted text messages and emails, the court heard.
Prosecutor Owen Edwards said Mr Andrews "was good at his job as a police officer and he is described by many as a charming man".
He said: "He is also obsessive, jealous and controlling and sought to dominate the lives of women. He is a control freak who resorted to physical, and at one stage, sexual violence."
While suffering a "significant and sustained mid-life crisis", events were said to have reached a climax in August last year when Mr Andrews was confronted in the street by a stranger while having an argument.
As the concerned passer-by began to phone the police, Mr Andrews hit him in the face and then threatened him, the court heard.
The trial continues.
