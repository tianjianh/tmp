Cumbria pylon route 'could threaten economy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An organisation which represents 2,500 businesses in Cumbria claims plans for new pylons could "threaten an already fragile rural economy".

The 50-metre high structures would connect a proposed nuclear power station to the electricity network.
National Grid agreed to bury cables within the Lake District National Park, but for parts of the route the pylons would be close to its boundaries.
Cumbria Tourism said this would impact nearby scenic areas.
The organisation said it did not oppose the National Grid's development plans in principle and welcomed the revised plans to bury them within the national park boundaries.
However, it fears those pylons close to the national park might have a detrimental effect on the tourism industry.
A public consultation on the proposed route from Moorside, to Heysham, Lancashire, is under way.
Jeanette Unsworth, from National Grid, said: "What's very important to this project is the cost we pass on to the bill payer.
"This project isn't paid for by National Grid, it's paid for by all of us through our electricity bills, so we've got to strike a balance between protecting those environments and keeping energy bills affordable for our users."
