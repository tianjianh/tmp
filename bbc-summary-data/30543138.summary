Israel dismisses Palestinian peace deal plan as 'gimmick'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Israel says a Palestinian effort to set a three-year deadline for it to end its occupation of Palestinian territories is a "gimmick".

A draft resolution, submitted by Jordan to the UN Security Council, also calls for a peace accord within a year.
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that without Israel's consent, nothing would change.
Jordan has indicated it will not seek a quick vote, opening the way for further discussion.
The US - which has vetoed previous resolutions it considers hostile to its ally Israel - said on Thursday it would not support the move.
US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said they would not support any action that would prejudge the outcome of negotiations.
"We have seen the draft, it is not something we would support and we think others feel the same and are calling for further consultations," she said.
Mr Lieberman said the draft resolution would only deepen the conflict.
"Certainly this will not hasten an agreement because without Israel's consent, nothing will change," he said.
"It would be better if the Security Council dealt with matters truly important to the citizens of the world, such as the murderous attacks this week in Australia and Pakistan... and not waste time on the Palestinians' gimmicks."
Despite Israel's objections, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would pursue consultations "with brothers and friends" at the UN.
The draft text says a negotiated solution should be based on several parameters including the boundary between Israel and the West Bank that existed before the 1967 Six Day War, security agreements and "Jerusalem as the shared capital of the two states".
It urges both parties "to abstain from any unilateral and illegal actions, including settlement activities, that could undermine the viability of a two-state solution".
Another draft resolution, being put together by France, is expected to call for a return to talks on a final treaty with the aim of achieving a two-state solution to the conflict within two years.
It does not mention an Israeli withdrawal, but does lay out some of the parameters of a permanent peace deal.
Direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians brokered by the US collapsed in April.
