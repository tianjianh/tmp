[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dominic Chappell, 49, admitted to driving 63.9mph (102.8km/h) in a 40mph (64km/h) zone in Andover on 6 April.
He was disqualified from holding a licence for six months, at Aldershot Magistrates' Court.
Chappell made headlines when he denied that the £2.6m package he took from BHS, including a £600,000 salary, had contributed to the demise of the brand.
Chappell, of Blandford Forum, Dorset, already had 10 points on his licence for three speeding offences in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
At the time of his speeding offence, he was driving a Range Rover on Churchill Way.
After being pulled over,  he told police: "This will cost me £25,000. I've been driving since I was 18 and have never had an accident.
"I drive an average of 35,000 miles a year and I used to be a race car driver."
The former Formula Three driver bought the collapsed retail giant for £1 from Sir Philip Green though his company Retail Acquisitions in March 2015.
