[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 3-0 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York's horrendous run of form extended to 16 without a win in all competitions after a convincing defeat at Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Holland advanced from the back to give the Ravens the perfect start, flick-heading Blair Turgott's free-kick across the diving Kyle Letheren.
York's wretched run of luck was then emphasised by Charlie Cooper's header, which came back off the inside of the Bromley post.
Before half-time, George Porter broke down the left and fired in from an acute angle to double York's trouble.
After the break, Turgott was again the provider as Neil Smith's men secured victory. The winger's corner was headed in nicely by substitute Adam Cunnington.
