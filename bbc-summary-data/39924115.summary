Pedro Caixinha has revealed he is on the verge of making his first signings as Rangers manager.

The Portuguese coach is targeting midfielders but said speculation linking him with a move for Hearts' Alexandros Tziolis is "pure rubbish".
"We are about to get one deal, or more than one deal, done in those positions, so we know what we want," he said.
"We know exactly what we are looking for and things are going in the direction we want."
Rangers beat 10-man Hearts 2-1 on Saturday thanks to goals from Joe Garner and Barrie McKay.
Reports surfaced that Caixinha held talks with 64-times capped Greek midfielder Tziolis inside Ibrox following the win over the Tynecastle outfit.
But the Rangers boss, who was assistant manager at Panathinaikos while Tziolis was a player there, insisted he was simply catching up with the 32-year-old.
"He's a good friend of mine," Caixinha said of Tziolis. "We worked together 10 years ago at Panathinaikos, but if you are referring to what came out in the news I just need to say to you it is pure rubbish.
"If I don't comment on news from the papers then I'll comment even less on rubbish.
"Alexandros is a fantastic guy. After Panathinaikos he went to Werder Bremen and did great. He's had a great career. But that's all I can tell you after that.
"He's a good friend of mine because I had this chance to create good bonds with the players as I was an assistant coach when I was with Panathinaikos. When the players give everything to you, you have very good relations.
"Even after 10 years I go there and salute him and ask him to come in and have a glass of good Portuguese wine.
"But he's Hearts' player, not ours."
Caixinha also revealed he is hoping to have former Liverpool midfielder Jordan Rossiter back in time for next season.
The 20-year-old, who moved to Rangers last summer but has been injured for almost the entire season, has resumed training with the Ibrox side.
