A Daily Telegraph report included a film of Wright apparently accepting money in return for allegedly helping persuade Barnsley to sign players.
Speaking before the 50-year-old's dismissal, Heckingbottom told BBC Radio Sheffield: "We have do things properly.
"We have to speak about it at the right time because it's not nice for anyone."
As part of an ongoing investigation into alleged corruption in football, the newspaper claims Wright accepted Â£5,000 at a meeting in Leeds in August.
The Championship club initially suspended Wright "pending an internal investigation" into the allegations.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Wright has said: "Any suggested acts contrary to criminal law or those of the Football Association and Fifa are categorically denied."
Barnsley, who were promoted to the Championship last season, play Leeds United in a Yorkshire derby on Saturday.
"We have to stay strong and focused," said head coach Heckingbottom.
"I can't talk about that. There will be time for me to speak about it later on. The club and myself can make statements later because there are still things ongoing.
"At this moment everything I am doing is focused on the players and the team just as it always is.
Heckingbottom is hoping for a swift resolution, but added: "It is out of my hands. People are dealing with it. It is a big issues and people are following the correct procedures. It ends when it ends."
