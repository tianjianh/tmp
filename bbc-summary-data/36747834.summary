Owens, Cpt Hannah Winterbourne, the Army's highest-ranking transgender soldier, and novelist Dr Sarah Waters will be honoured by Cardiff University.
Maj Gen Susan Ridge, the Army's highest-ranked woman, and former chief medical officer for Wales, Ruth Hussey, receive theirs from Bangor University.
Honours are for those with "outstanding recognition in their field".
Owens, who is from Mynyddcerrig, Carmarthenshire and began officiating as a teenager, made his Rugby World Cup debut in France in 2007 and took charge of the 2015 Rugby World Cup final.
In June, he was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours.
Dr Waters hails from Pembrokeshire and shot to fame after publishing her first novel, Tipping the Velvet, in 1998, which was made into a drama series for the BBC.
Prof John Hughes, vice-chancellor of Bangor University, said: "We are proud of the achievements of all our graduates and celebrate their success, especially those who will graduate this year.
"Our graduation ceremonies also provide an opportunity for us to take pride in the success of others in our community or to honour those who have a close relationship with the university."
