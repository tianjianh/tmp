[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some 200 staff work in Cardiff on factual shows including X-Ray, Bargain Hunt and Crimewatch, and on dramas filmed at the Roath Lock studios in Cardiff Bay.
It is understood factual will suffer most of the losses.
BBC Studios has announced plans to cut around 300 staff across the UK as part of an efficiency drive.
Director of BBC Studios Mark Linsey said: "A strong, creative and competitive BBC Studios is crucial to maintaining the BBC's role as one of the world's great programme makers - and we are committed to delivering the best content in all our genres.
"These plans will ensure we can compete successfully in the future."
