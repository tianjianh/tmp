Scarlets back Rhys Patchell has been called up to Wales' training squad as they wait to discover the extent of Phil Dollman's injury.

Dollman suffered a knee injury in Exeter's Premiership final win over Wasps and will have a scan on Tuesday.
Ospreys prop Rhodri Jones has also been called up to the training squad as cover for Scarlets' Samson Lee.
Scarlets prop Rob Evans has been ruled out of the summer tour and has been replaced by Ospreys' Gareth Thomas.
"We have to accept that injuries are part and parcel of rugby at the very top level," Wales head coach Robin McBryde said.
"We will wait medical opinion following scans to Samson and Phil on Tuesday before making any further decisions."
Exeter's uncapped 32-year-old full-back Dollman had been called up by Wales in midweek to replace injured Cardiff Blues teenager Rhun Williams.

He scored Exeter's second try against Wasps but limped off the field early in the second half after suffering a knee injury.
Scarlets prop Lee hurt his knee in Saturday's Pro12 final and will have a scan this week.
Wales will be without Scarlets forwards Jake Ball and Evans for the Tests against Tonga and Samoa.
Lock Ball is out with a shoulder injury while prop Evans suffered a hand injury in the Pro12 final victory over Munster.
Wales are training in Colwyn Bay before facing Tonga in Auckland on 16 June and Samoa in Apia on 23 June.
They face WRU National Cup winners RGC 1404 in a warm-up match at Eirias Park on Friday, 2 June.
"We are looking forward to a good week's training together as a squad at the fantastic Parc Eirias facilities and Friday's match will be an important part of our preparation before facing Samoa and Tonga," McBryde added.
