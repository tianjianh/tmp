German centre-back Mertesacker, 31, is to miss the start of the Premier League season after picking up the injury in Friday's pre-season draw with Lens.
Wenger has signed Rob Holding from Bolton but will likely now pair Laurent Koscielny and Gabriel at centre-half.
"We have to look for an option," Wenger admitted ahead of Arsenal's two-match tour of the United States.
"With Per being out, we are a bit short on the experience front and we are looking to bring somebody in."
Mertesacker, who joined the club in 2011, played 24 times for Arsenal in the Premier League last season as they finished runners-up.
On Thursday, Wenger's side face an MLS All-Star team in California.
