Condor Ferry passengers demand compensation over delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Passengers who suffered travel delays over the weekend are demanding compensation from Condor Ferries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sailings between the Channel Islands and the UK were cancelled on the high-powered trimaran Liberation because of steering problems on Friday.
Passengers had been due to be transferred to the Clipper ferry, but that broke down on Saturday morning.
Condor apologised and offered full refunds, but some passengers are seeking further recompense.
Kit Ashton, a passenger from Jersey, was one of a number of passengers who had been moved to the Clipper ferry to Portsmouth - having originally been booked on Condor's Liberation service to Poole.
But following a ramp failure on the Clipper, 110 people and 44 cars were stuck on the ferry for more than 12 hours.
Mr Ashton said: "More than 12 hours after arriving in Portsmouth I was finally able to disembark from the Clipper and begin my drive to Exeter.
"I eventually arrived at my final destination at 1am - about 24 hours after I would originally have arrived."
For the "huge disruption, inconvenience and lost time", Mr Ashton has asked Condor for a full refund plus 50% of the ticket price as compensation for "two failed journeys".
A spokesman for Condor said: "We adhere scrupulously to EU passenger rights directive which means that we not only refund passengers a proportion of their fare as set out in the regulation, but also that we look after them at our expense during the disruption."
Condor services have since resumed.
Mr Ashton says he has not yet received a response from Condor.
