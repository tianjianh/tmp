Shaun Beeley: Barrow promotion ambition key to drop into non-league

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow defender Shaun Beeley says his move into non-league was a 'no-brainer' as the club set their sights on promotion to the Football League.

Beeley, 27, turned down a new deal with League Two Morecambe at the end of last season to join the fifth-tier side.
The full-back, who made 93 League appearances for the Shrimps over a two-year spell, accepted the Bluebirds' offer straight away.
"In my eyes it's definitely a move forward," Beeley told BBC Cumbria.
"The gaffer Paul [Cox] was interested, it was a bit of a no-brainer for me."
He continued: "Barrow are a team that will be going for it, they want to achieve promotion.
"The quality of the lads that we've got and the manager himself, I don't see why we can't push for promotion this year."
