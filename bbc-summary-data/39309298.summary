Hamilton, 22, has been the Edinburgh club's first choice goalkeeper this season, having made his debut in August 2014.
Defender Souttar, 20, was signed from Dundee United on a three-and-a-half year contract in February 2016.
Currie, 19, made his Premiership debut in November and has scored once in nine appearances.
"This is positive news and shows that this club continues doing what it has always done, in committing to and excelling in the development of young Scottish players," head coach Ian Cathro told the club website.
"These are three players who are at different stages of their development but have all had a positive impact at first-team level.
"Our priority is to always work to improve the squad, we will work collectively across all number of markets to try and do this, however as this club has shown many times before - it's commitment to and focus on the development of its own players -  and of young Scottish players -  will always be of the greatest importance."
