Florence and the Machine and Nas will headline the two-day event in Toronto, Canada.
It will be held at Hanlan's Point Beach, Toronto Island on 12-13 June.
Bestival organiser Rob da Bank said: "To say that we are excited at Bestival HQ about launching our very first Bestival outside the UK is a serious understatement."
Jamie xx, Robin Schulz and Clean Bandit will also perform.
"We've spent 12 years working up to this moment and are so proud to be teaming up with Toronto to launch the good ship that is Bestival overseas," says Radio 1 DJ Rob da Bank.
He has praised the "typically diverse headliners", which includes Florence Welsh, who first performed at Bestival in 2008 in front of a few hundred people.
Four years later, she headlined the event.
In Canada, Florence and the Machine will perform songs from their next album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, along with some of their biggest hits.
Rob da Bank has also given a special mention to, what he calls, some of the "best leftfield acts around", referring to the likes of Caribou, Omar Souleyman and Flosstradamus.
"I really hope you can join us on the ferry to Toronto Island in June. See you on the beach."
Bestival began in 2004 and is now held across four days on the Isle of Wight.
The Chemical Brothers, Tame Impala and The Jacksons are among the first acts to be announced for this year's festival, which takes place in September.
Sister event Camp Bestival was launched in 2008 and takes place at Lulworth Castle in Dorset on 30 July until 2 August.
Underworld are also headlining that event, alongside Kaiser Chiefs and Professor Green.
