[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roarie Deacon ensured the battle of the FA Cup giant killers ended all square with a stoppage-time equaliser as Sutton drew with National League leaders Lincoln.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Substitute Elliott Whitehouse thought he had won it for the Imps with 10 minutes remaining but Deacon, the star of Sutton's memorable run to the fifth round, pegged the visitors back to leave them top on goal difference alone ahead of Tranmere Rovers.
Just over a fortnight after their cup adventure came to an end with a 5-0 quarter-final defeat at Arsenal, Lincoln ran out at Gander Green Lane - the scene of Sutton's loss to Arsene Wenger's side in February.
Sutton created the better chances in the first half and captain Jamie Collins controlled the ball and spun in front of the same goal he scored the penalty which knocked out Leeds, but skied his effort from 10 yards.
Bedsente Gomis then headed narrowly over from Kevin Amankwaah's long throw-in moments before half-time.
Early in the second half Sean Raggett, Lincoln's goalscoring hero against Burnley, almost repeated the trick with a downward header which was deflected up on to the crossbar.
Burly Imps striker Matt Rhead was then frustrated by a fine reaction save from Will Puddy, who kept out a fierce volley at the far post.
Lincoln got their noses in front when Sam Habergham swung in a late corner which Whitehouse rose highest to nod home.
But the final word went to Deacon, who charged at a tiring Lincoln defence before lashing the ball high into the net from the edge of the box.
