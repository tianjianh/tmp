The home of Londonderry councillor Gary Donnelly has been searched by police in connection with shots being fired in the city last week.

A police investigation was launched after masked men fired shots over the coffin of veteran republican Peggy O'Hara.
Mr Donnelly was one of those present when the incident occurred.
The search operation in Creggan is being led by the Police Service of Northern Ireland's Serious Crime Branch.
Mr Donnelly said he was woken by police in his home at 09:00 GMT.
"A number of armed members of the PSNI entered my home, I was in the bedroom at the time and the bedroom door opened and I was confronted by maybe five or six members of the PSNI who informed me that my home was to be searched under the terrorism act looking for mobile phones, laptops and other storage items."
Mr Donnelly said he did not know why his home had been searched.
"They haven't told me but there's speculation that it may be in connection with the funeral of the late Peggy O'Hara.
"At no stage have the PSNI ever contacted either myself or my legal representation."
Unionist politicians had condemned a show of strength at Peggy O'Hara's wake and funeral as paramilitary thuggery.
Her family defended the republican presence, saying she had organised it before her death.
Mrs O'Hara was the mother of INLA man Patsy O'Hara, who died in the 1981 hunger strike.
The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) is a republican paramilitary group believed to have been responsible for more than 120 murders between 1975 and 1998.
