Registers of Scotland (RoS) research found the market had largely weathered the financial crash of 2007-08, with average prices now at their highest level in 10 years.
However, the volume of sales is down by 35% over the decade.
The report also shows that the number of cash sales has increased.
The RoS data details trends in the property market during the period between 2005 and 2015, and covers detached, semi-detached, terraces and flats.
RoS is the government department responsible for compiling and maintaining registers related to land and property.
Key findings in the report include:
RoS director of commercial services Kenny Crawford said picture over the last 10 years was one of "highs and lows".
He added: "Activity in the property market gives us an insight into what's going on in the Scottish economy, which is possible thanks to Registers of Scotland's digital land register."
Last month, Office for National Statistics figures found house prices in Scotland had experienced their highest annual increase since 2007.
