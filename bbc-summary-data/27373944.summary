Public toilets: Where are the best loos in Wales?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spending a penny in Wales need not be just a matter of convenience.

From spectacular views to Victorian period features, a visit to the loo can be an enlightening experience.
Take Skokholm Island off the south west tip of Pembrokeshire.
It is known for its wildlife - particularly its puffins - and its flora but its many visitors can now enjoy a new attraction.
The loos on the island have never been bog standard due to their location and art work from wildlife enthusiasts, but they now boast a stained glass window.
The toilet is also in the process of being twinned with one in Africa which will be on a migratory route for some of Skokholm's birds.
Here are some of the interesting loos in Wales.
Closed last year to save Cardiff council £120,000, the Victorian underground toilets on The Hayes in the city centre are set to reopen under new ownership.
The operators of a nearby snack bar will now look after the Grade II-listed loos.
The highest toilets in Wales with what must be the most spectacular setting, located on Snowdon in Gwynedd, in the visitor centre.
The Hafod Eryri building on the 1,085m (3,560ft) peak opened in 2009 and receives around half a million visitors a year.
These loos at the South Stack beauty spot on Anglesey certainly deserve a mention not only for their stunning views but also because they were auctioned for £87,000 last year.
They are within an area of outstanding natural beauty and of special scientific interest which, according to the RSPB, is "one of the best places for wildlife in the UK".
But they are no longer in use after being sold with planning permission for conversion to a residential dwelling.
The conveniences at the Wales Millennium Centre already have an advantage being located in one of Cardiff Bay's major landmarks.
But they have more to offer than just location and picked up an honour in last year's Loo of the Year awards.
They were judged as the best toilets in the UK in the entertainment venue category.
Another loo of the year winner in Wales was the colourful convenience at the Gypsy Wood activity park in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, which won in the visitor attraction category.
