[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hull City 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship leaders Hull City played out a goalless draw with play-off chasing Sheffield Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Owls had the better of the first half, with Fernando Forestieri thundering a shot against the woodwork from 30 yards out.
Sam Clucas hit the post for the hosts after the break before Tigers defender Curtis Davies headed just wide.
Forestieri was shown a late red card, his second in a week, after being given a second yellow card for diving.
The former Italy Under-21 international seemed to be harshly done by as replays showed Hull defender Michael Dawson did impede the Owls forward.
The dismissal means Forestieri has now been sent off in successive appearances, having been shown a red card at Preston on 20 February, and he will now serve a two-game ban.
It was a second draw between the two sides this season and there was little between the teams for most of the game.
Steve Bruce's side improved after half-time but Forestieri's red card came too late to have any real impact on the course of the match.
Hull manager Steve Bruce told BBC Radio Humberside:

"In the grand scheme of things, we'll take the point but we're disappointed we didn't get the three.
"In the second half in particular, we were the dominant side but we missed the opportunities we had.
"There comes the frustration because we've created chances, we've played well enough, and it just wasn't our night in front of goal."
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal told BBC Radio Sheffield:
"It was a good point. They started to move the ball well in the second half and we had more problems then.
(On the red card) "I think it was a bad decision. You can see from the reaction of the players and the Hull player apologised to the referee. It was a big mistake.
"There's nothing I can do about it because we can't appeal against it."
