[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 0-0 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Daniel Bentley's stoppage time penalty save helped Southend halt their slump by claiming a point at Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers keeper pulled off a fine stop to keep out Chris Forrester's penalty after Posh substitute Marcus Maddison had gone down in the box.
Bentley had also impressed when tipping over from Erhun Oztumer before keeping out a Lee Angol header.
Southend also had a chance to nick victory when Jack Payne dragged wide and Tyrone Barnett steered a shot over.
The draw nevertheless brought to an end a run of three consecutive defeats for Phil Brown's visitors, leaving them three points off the final League One play-off spot that is occupied by Peterborough.
