The non-league side, who knocked the Gills out of the Cup in 2013, took control early on thanks to goals from Alex Gudger and Jimmy Armson.
Frank Nouble pulled a goal back, then fired in his second of the game just before half-time.
Both sides struggled to create chances after half-time as Brackley kept their hopes of a second round place alive.
Gillingham are now without a win in eight games, and face the prospect of an away tie if they are to advance beyond the first round for the first time since 2012.
They were stunned when Gudger headed home an inswinging corner and Armson curled a 25-yard effort in off the crossbar.
Nouble, however, converted Jay Emmanuel-Thomas' square pass to ease any jitters and the pair combined again for his second.
