[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man on a moped has serious facial injuries after being attacked by two youths in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man in his 20s had been driving his moped behind two male youths, one on a moped and the other on a mini moto, on Russell Road on Wednesday at 20:35.
They all stopped near the railway bridge and the youths attacked the man before riding off on their moped when other motorists stopped to help.
The mini moto, stolen from a Greenbank house, was recovered at the scene.
Police are appealing for witnesses.
The youths, in their mid-teens and of slim build, both spoke with local accents.
One was about 5ft 7in and was wearing a white helmet, grey hooded top, blue jogging bottoms and white trainers.
The second youth had a shaved light brown hair and was wearing a black and yellow helmet and a grey hooded top.
Det Con Kevin Walls, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a particularly violent attack which thanks to the presence of passers-by, was prevented from becoming even more serious.
"We are very grateful for the assistance of those drivers but still want to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the assault, in particular the driver of a dark coloured Nissan X-Trail which was in the area at the time.
"The mopeds rode along Dundee Street, Henderson Terrace, Murieston Road, Murieston Place and Murieston Crescent prior to the assault on Russell Road.
"The mini moto was stolen from the Greenbank area at about 20:15 so I'm also keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the youths in these areas too."
