Wrexham Maelor wards closed due to norovirus outbreak

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five wards at Wrexham Maelor Hospital have been affected after patients suffering from norovirus were admitted.

Admissions to three have been suspended while restrictions have been placed on another two wards to stop it spreading.
The move comes after 30 hospital patients showed symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting.
Chirk Hospital has also had four cases and one ward is not accepting new patients, while advice is being offered to visitors.
It is the second time this year hospitals in Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board's area have been affected after an outbreak in January.
