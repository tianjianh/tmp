Abby Holmes' foul on Dan Carter gave Williams her first chance from the spot, only for Rachael Laws to save and Vicky Losada to follow up and score.
Jordan Nobbs' finish with the outside of her boot made it 2-0 at the break.
Dan Carter added a third from close range before Williams beat Laws with her second penalty attempt.
The England international returned to make amends for her earlier miss after Danielle van de Donk was brought down by Danielle Brown.
Arsenal have now beaten Sunderland three times this season, having put five past the Black Cats in the Women's Super League in June after previously thrashing them 7-0 on the way to collecting a 14th Women's FA Cup trophy.
Sunderland Ladies defender Hayley Sharp: "Arsenal are an excellent team, they have some great players and a lot of internationals.
"They are probably the best footballing team in the league and it's good to have finished with them for this season.
"We've now got to pick ourselves up and go again."
Arsenal Ladies midfielder Jordan Nobbs: "I'm glad to have got a goal, but I was proud of the girls today for the way we played.
"Every game counts for us and we're creeping around the back door.
"We need the other teams to drop points but at the moment, we're putting in great team performances."
