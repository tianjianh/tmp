Man 'planned to kill US serviceman and tried to join IS'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 24-year-old man has appeared in court charged with planning to kill US military personnel based in the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Junead Ahmed Khan is accused of plotting to run over a serviceman, possibly from an US air base in East Anglia, and then kill him with a knife.
Mr Khan was also charged, along with his uncle Shazib Ahmed Khan, 22, both from Luton, over attempting to join Islamic State in Syria.
Both men were remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 10 August.
The men appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with being involved in preparation with the intention to commit acts of terrorism, dating between 1 August 2014 and 10 May 2015.
The additional count faced by Junead Khan dates between 10 May 2015 and 14 July 2015.
It is alleged Junead Khan - a delivery driver for TRG Logistics in Luton - planned to stage a car accident and then kill a US serviceman, a method of attack that has echoes of the murder of Lee Rigby two years ago.
The two men, of Marlow Avenue, were arrested a week ago in an operation involving officers from the national counter-terrorism network, and have been held at Southwark Police Station.
Another man, in his 30s, was also detained. He was released without charge on Monday night.
Searches were carried out at two addresses in the Luton area.
