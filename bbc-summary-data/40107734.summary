Champions Trophy 2017: Ben Stokes unlikely to bowl full 10 overs

Ben Stokes is set to bowl in England's Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh, but his workload will be determined by a fitness test on Thursday morning.

All-rounder Stokes, 25, has been suffering from a knee problem but bowled in practice on Wednesday.
"I certainly see him bowling," said England captain Eoin Morgan.
Morgan also confirmed Chris Woakes is fit and Jason Roy will retain his place opening the batting.
All-rounder Woakes missed the final two matches of the 2-1 series win against South Africa with a muscle problem, while Roy has been struggling for form.
However, Morgan stated that the Surrey batsman will be playing on his home ground of The Oval and that he "cannot see it changing" throughout the tournament, despite the recent good form of Jonny Bairstow.
Stokes showed signs of his knee problem in the first ODI against South Africa last week and despite making a century in the second ODI, only bowled three overs.
He then sat out the final game at Lord's on Monday as England were thrashed by seven wickets.
"It's a very strange injury in that it's only in his delivery stride that he feels the pain," added Morgan, who said that Stokes would play as a batsman alone if he was not fit to bowl.
The Irishman also stated that Stokes is unlikely to bowl 10 overs, but the Durham man has only bowled his full allocation in an ODI on three occasions in the past two years.
England, who have never won a global 50-over trophy, begin the eight-team tournament as favourites with the bookmakers only 15 months after a shambolic World Cup campaign that saw them eliminated in the first round.
They are joined in Group A by Australia and New Zealand, the two World Cup finalists, with the top two teams progressing to the semi-finals.
Since that tournament, Morgan's men have lost only three of their 11 one-day series, with their success based heavily on a powerful batting unit that has posted totals in excess of 300 on 21 occasions.
"We need to bring our 'A' game in order to win. If at the end of it we're holding the trophy then we will have played really well," said Morgan. "It's about delivering in every game."
England's World Cup exit was confirmed by a defeat against Bangladesh in Adelaide, and the symmetry of facing the same opponents in this tournament was acknowledged by Morgan.
"Since then we have been on a huge upward curve," he said. "We have had a group of players that have bought into a way of playing and have executed it really well.
"It's been an absolute pleasure to work with this group of players."

Bangladesh are playing in the Champions Trophy for the first time since it was trimmed to eight teams in 2009.
They qualified through the International Cricket Council's ODI rankings, denying West Indies, and have since climbed to sixth on that list - only one place behind England.
"We have played good cricket over the past two or three years," said captain Mashrafe Mortaza. "Our cricket is moving in the right direction and we have to continue the good things that we are doing.
"We know on our day we can beat anybody. We have to start well."
The pace bowler admitted his side were facing a different England to the one they beat in 2015, but said that more pressure would be on the hosts.
"England are a totally different team. Over the past two years they have won almost everything. At home they are a serious side," said Mortaza.
"They feel more pressure than us because they want the trophy, especially with this happening in their home."
