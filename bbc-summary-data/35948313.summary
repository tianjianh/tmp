Serbia's Djokovic, the five-time champion and world number one, beat Belgian David Goffin 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 on a hot afternoon.
Japanese sixth seed Nishikori beat Australian Nick Kyrgios 6-3 7-5 in the evening session.
"It's going to be tough," said Nishikori, who has won just two of eight matches against Djokovic.
"We just played in Australia and I lost in straight sets, so I need to do something better."
Djokovic, 28, will try to match Andre Agassi's record haul of six Miami titles, and become the first man to win the Indian Wells-Miami double three years in a row.
Djokovic bent down and kissed the court after finally seeing off 15th seed Goffin in a gruelling two hours and five minutes.
"It was evident that we both struggled with conditions," said the Serb.
"Physically, it was a great battle. I think we were both trying to catch some breath after some points. It was windy, it was warm, it was humid."
The top seed came back from a break down in the first set, before Goffin missed a golden opportunity with the open court gaping at 4-4 in the tie-break.
"I was on the back foot in that point, he was dictating," said Djokovic. "He came to the net and I anticipated where he might smash the ball, he framed it a little bit.
"I had to defend well, which I think I did at the end of the tie-break."
Kyrgios had shown off his firepower in beating Milos Raonic on Friday, but he could not handle Nishikori's pinpoint accuracy from the baseline.
The Australian dropped serve with a  double fault in game three, and did the same on set point six games later.
Nishikori looked to be faltering when he failed to hold for 3-0 in the second set, but the Japanese player avoided the need for a tie-break with a lunging volley on his second match point.
"It was tough. When he plays me he plays so aggressive, doesn't let me dictate points," said Kyrgios.
"I felt rushed out there, I was really looking for answers. I've been struggling on my serve all week, so to come this far without having my best weapon is a pretty good effort."
Nishikori, 26, is through to his first Miami final and second at the Masters 1000 level.
