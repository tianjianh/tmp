Operation Respect will see more police patrols in evenings at licensed premises and taxi ranks.
During daytime, plain clothes police officers will target shoplifting.
Operation Respect will also involve Inverness Business Improvement District security workers, street pastors and British Red Cross volunteers.
The initiative will also highlight Police Scotland's national Campaign Against Violence on 19 Friday.
Insp Anne Urquhart, from Police Scotland's Inverness community beat unit, said: "Christmas is a time to celebrate and have fun but for some it can provide opportunity to take advantage of those who are vulnerable and susceptible to crime.
"Police Scotland is once again delighted to work with our key partners to ensure that people gain the maximum enjoyment from the city over the next few weeks and remain safe in doing so."
