Tom Bristow: Bristol sign Wasps loosehead prop on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premiership club Bristol have signed loosehead prop Tom Bristow on loan from Wasps for the remainder of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bristow signed for Wasps in 2015 and has made 11 appearances this season.
The 25-year-old, who has also played for London Welsh and Leicester Tigers, has been added to the squad as cover for injuries in the loosehead position.
Bristol coach Mark Tainton told the club website: "It was important to bring in someone of Tom's ability to bring us a bit of depth there."
Meanwhile, Bristol have loaned hooker Chris Brooker, 30, to Bath until the end of the season.
