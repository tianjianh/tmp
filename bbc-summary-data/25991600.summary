UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wants Mr Bloomberg to "raise political will and mobilise action" on climate change, a UN spokesman said.
He will also work to bring "concrete solutions" to a major climate summit in New York in September.
As New York City mayor, Mr Bloomberg accused US politicians of a failure of leadership on climate change.
He later hinted at a link between Hurricane Sandy and global warming.
Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, welcomed Mr Bloomberg's appointment, posting on Twitter: "Mayor @MikeBloomberg knows how to get things done. We need more leaders like him here @UN."
Mr Bloomberg, a former news tycoon, made combating climate change a major focus of his 12 years as mayor of New York City.
The UN will host a one-day climate change summit in New York on 23 September 2014.
