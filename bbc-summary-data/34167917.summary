Fiona Hyslop said the total, almost £12m up on 2013, revealed a "growing appetite" for filming in Scotland.
Arts body Creative Scotland supported a number of high-profile movie and TV projects.
They included the adaptation of the classic novel Sunset Song, written in 1932 by Lewis Grassic Gibbon.
Other major projects have included The Legend of Barney Thomson and Sunshine on Leith, as well as the big-budget TV series Outlander.
Ms Hyslop announced the record production spend ahead of a visit to the set of Bannan, a Gaelic drama series commission by BBC Alba, currently being filmed on Skye.
She said: "This rise in production spend is a strong indication that film producers have a growing appetite to base their productions in Scotland.
"With our stunning, iconic landscapes, rich culture and heritage and skilled and talented crew, the £45m production spend total for 2014 demonstrates that producers around the world recognise that Scotland has much to offer.
"These productions generate significant income for Scotland through the use of Scottish talent, crews, locations, transport, accommodation and through the impact they have on tourism."
Ms Hyslop added: "The Scottish government and our agencies are firmly committed to growing the economic impact of our screen sector and continuing to promote Scotland as a premier and competitive location to produce great films and TV shows - as underlined by the £162m public funding awarded to the sector since 2007/08, during a period of tough budgets.
"But we recognise we need to do more. That is why this week I announced a new £1.75m production growth fund to provide an additional incentive for major international productions to come to Scotland, as well as increasing funding available for Scottish productions."
Sunset Song, directed by Terence Davies, is due to premiere at the Toronto Film Festival at the weekend.
Peter Mullan and former model Agyness Deyn star in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's tale, which was shot on location in Aberdeenshire, New Zealand and Luxembourg.
A second series of the television drama Outlander is currently being filmed.
It tells the story of a nurse from 1946 who travels back in time to 18th Century Scotland.
