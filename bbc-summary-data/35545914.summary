BT to divert nuisance calls for free

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BT has said it will launch a new service later this year to divert nuisance calls within its network before they ring on customers' phones.

It said it will use huge computing power to root out 25 million unwanted calls a week.
Currently, BT customers can buy special phones that block nuisance calls, or pay to stop calls getting through.
But the new service will identify some of the 5 billion unwanted calls made each year before they arrive.
They will then be diverted automatically to a junk voicemail box.
Customers will be able to add numbers they don't want to hear from, for free.
The hope is that action from BT will turn the tables on nuisance callers. The company is following the lead from Talk Talk, which already bars calls for free and blocks millions centrally.
However, experts warn that this is a battle that is likely to rumble on, because firms hassling people will be able to switch numbers and use pretend numbers to hide who they are.
Many fraudsters and malicious callers targeting individuals will still be able to get through, they say.
