Lewis Hamilton said he was still confident of winning the Brazilian Grand Prix despite being beaten to pole by team-mate Nico Rosberg.

The world champion, who lost out to the German by just 0.078 seconds, is keen to win in Brazil for the first time.
"My main job is done this year, so it's not the most important thing but that's the target," said Hamilton.
"Last year I was strong in the race. I hope to be able to carry that through and see if I can make the difference."
Rosberg's pole was his fifth in a row and he appears to have turned around the qualifying deficit he had to Hamilton in the first part of the season, which saw the Englishman take 11 poles from 12 races, the foundation of his championship-winning campaign.
But Rosberg has turned only one of those pole positions into victory - at the last race in Mexico two weeks ago.
"If there are any cracks anywhere I will try to find them," said Hamilton, who also started second in Brazil last year and spun while trying to make up time to pass his team-mate at the pit stops.

Hamilton added that he did not believe the change was a result of his relaxing, having tied up the title, saying: "I don't believe there has been a drop in intensity."
Rosberg could not give a reason for the turnaround in qualifying form.
"It was an area I had to work on so I have been working on it through the season, but I don't have a direct explanation of any precise thing that's now different. I'm just happy it's going that way. It's better this way, but I don't know why," he said.
Before the race, following Friday's attacks in Paris, governing body the FIA has organised for the drivers to wear black armbands on their parade lap "as a sign of mourning and tribute to the victims of the Paris tragedy and as a gesture of solidarity with their families and loved ones".
The FIA added in a statement: "A French flag decorated with a black ribbon will be carried on the truck used during the drivers' parade.
"The same flag will be displayed on the world television feed, as will 13/11/2015, the date of the tragedy."
A capacity crowd is expected at the Interlagos track in Sao Paulo, one of F1's most historic venues.
The Brazilian Grand Prix is live across the BBC, with coverage starting on BBC One at 15:20 GMT and the race starting at 16:00.
