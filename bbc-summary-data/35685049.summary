The Irish short film Stutterer has won an Oscar, becoming the only Irish winner at this year's ceremony despite a record number of nominees.

The 13-minute film, portraying a lonely man with a severe speech impediment who is searching for love, took home the Best Short Film (Live Action) Oscar.
It was written, directed and edited by Dublin filmmaker Benjamin Cleary.
Accepting the award, Cleary said: "Every day is a proud day to be Irish, but today even more so."
However, there was disappointment for his fellow Irish nominees, such as Michael Fassbender, who lost out to Leonardo DiCaprio in the Best Actor category, and Saoirse Ronan, who had been nominated for Best Actress for her role in Brooklyn.
Dublin-born Lenny Abrahamson, who was nominated in the Best Director category for the abduction drama Room, lost out to The Revenant's director Alejando Gonzalez Inarritu.
Room was adapted from the best-selling book by Dublin author Emma Donoghue, who also missed out on the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.
However, Donoghue's story helped American star Brie Larson win the Best Actress Oscar.
In a statement, Irish President Michael D Higgins said: "The nominations in a number of categories are a recognition of the talent that now exists in Ireland's film community.
"It is now accepted internationally that Ireland has an accomplished film industry, providing a great return from the investment in film - made over recent decades - through highly skilled jobs and an enhanced international reputation.
"I send my warmest congratulations to Ben Cleary and the team behind 'Stutterer' and to all the Irish nominees and those who are travelling with them."
