South African batsman Richard Levi has signed a new two-year deal with Northants for all formats of the game.

Levi, 27, first joined to play Twenty20 cricket in 2013 and next season will be his fourth at Wantage Road.
"I'm really excited to be part of next year's squad and looking forward to continuing my success with the Steelbacks," he told the club website.
Levi played 13 Twenty20 internationals for the Proteas in 2012 but signed for Northants as a Kolpak player last year.
Kolpak contracts are signed by foreign players, using a European Court ruling so they are not counted as an overseas player.
Since the end of the 2015 English season, Levi has played for South African side Cape Cobras as an opening batsman.
He boasts the second highest number of sixes in any T20 international innings, hitting 13 on his way to 117 not out against New Zealand in 2012.
