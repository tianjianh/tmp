Marina Bandres Lopez-Belio, 37, who was Spanish, died with their seven month-old son Julian Pracz-Bandres, in the Airbus A320 crash.
Pawel Pracz said the couple had been living in Manchester for seven years.
He said his wife had been travelling back from her uncle's funeral on the flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf.
"I'm with my closest family in Manchester, and in close contact with our family in Spain at this very difficult time," said Mr Pracz.
"Marina was visiting her family in Spain for her uncle's funeral, she bought the tickets at the last moment, and decided to return to Manchester quickly as she wanted to return to her daily routine as soon as possible.
"We are devastated and would like to request that we be allowed to grieve in peace as a family without intrusion at this difficult time."
He said his wife was an editor and colourist and both worked in film and video post-production.
Richard Hellawell, her former tutor at Futureworks School of Media, Manchester, described her as a "model student" who was "exceptionally talented and hard-working."
He said: "One of the nice bright lights of the world has gone out."
Mr Hellawell recalled a barbecue he held for his students at his house after their graduation, saying: "She had never been to my house, she had no idea about my family and she turned up with presents for my two little kids - that says everything about what she was like."
Ricky Wong, from Warrington, who studied with Ms Bandres Lopez-Belio at Futureworks, said: "She was very introvert and very shy but once you got to know her she was very creative.
"It is such a shame her future has been taken away from her."
In a tweet, Manchester restaurant El Rincon said: "We are devastated to learn of the death of Marina Bandres Lopez-Belio and her son Julian.
"Marina worked with us for many years and was much-loved by both staff and customers at El RincÃ³n.
"Our thoughts are with her family, friends & colleagues at this extremely difficult time."
One hundred and forty-four passengers, including 16 schoolchildren and two teachers, along with six crew perished on Germanwings Flight 4U 9525, after it went into an eight-minute descent before crashing near Digne in the French Alps.
