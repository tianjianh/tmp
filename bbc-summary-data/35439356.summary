Atletico, who started the day level with the defending champions, took an early lead when Koke fired home.
But Messi slotted in the equaliser after 31 minutes and Suarez raced clear to score his 19th league goal of the season eight minutes later.
Atletico had Filipe Luis and Diego Godin sent off for bad challenges.
With a game in hand and a three-point lead at the top of the table it looks like Barcelona's title to lose now.
Luis Enrique's side have won five of their six league games since the winter break and are beginning to look unstoppable with 17 games to go.
Their remaining fixtures do not look too demanding, bar a visit from Real Madrid, who are now seven points back, at the start of April.
This may have been Atletico's last chance to stay in the hunt but they have now not won in 10 league attempts at the Nou Camp and with Barca doing the double for a second successive season, there may be no way back for Diego Simeone's men.
Atletico's lack of discipline may have cost them their last tilt at the title after Luis and Godin were both sent off for needless challenges.
Luis' dangerous lunge at Messi just before half-time was as crude as it was reckless by the former Chelsea defender.
Barcelona coach Enrique was furious but Messi managed to avoid injury and his side was handed a one-man advantage.
Atletico were not out of it and still managed to create chances as they looked to fight back from 2-1 down.
But another wild challenge from Godin on Suarez, which could have earned him a straight red rather than a second yellow, left them too much to do as they played the final half-hour with only nine men.
Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo: "It was a tough game because they were very strong, but we came out on top in the duel and that is thanks to our work in the week."
Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone:  "Even with nine men we maintained our way of playing. In a game you can win or lose, but I always prefer to lose in this way."
Barcelona continue their quest for a treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey when they meet Gary Neville's Valencia in the first leg of their Spanish Cup semi-final next Wednesday night.
They return to league action at bottom club Levante next Sunday, while Atletico's next match is at home to Europa League hopefuls Eibar in La Liga next Saturday.
