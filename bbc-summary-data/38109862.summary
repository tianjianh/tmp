[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nice 1-1 Bastia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nice moved back to the top of Ligue 1 - although their lead is now only one point - after drawing the Mediterranean derby with Bastia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Monaco went top of the French league on Saturday with a 4-0 win over Marseille.
Nice, without injured striker Mario Balotelli, took the lead through a Alassane Plea header, with Enzo Crivelli equalising from 20 yards.
Plea should have won the game late on, but hit the bar with the goal gaping after rounding keeper Jean-Louis Leca.
Nice are one point above Monaco and champions Paris St-Germain, who beat Lyon 2-1 on Sunday evening with Edinson Cavani scoring twice.
