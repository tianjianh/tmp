Organisers of a music festival are hoping for heavy snowfalls in time for this year's staging of the event.

Groove CairnGorm, which made its debut in 2016, has been set up along the lines of continental snowsports music festivals Snowbombing and Snowboxx.
It is held in partnership with CairnGorm Mountain ski centre and Badaguish Outdoor Centre.
However, mild and windy weather has delayed the start of Scotland's latest snowsports season.
The festival is to take place on 24 and 25 February.
The organisers of Groove CairnGorm said that while snow was not essential for the event, it would be a bonus.
Skiers, snowboarders, hillwalkers and climbers are among those who attended last year's inaugural event, which featured performances by DJ Grandmaster Flash, Niteworks and Spring Break.
This year's acts include Basement Jaxx, Blonde, Craig Charles' Funk and Soul Club and The Lafontaines.
A spokesman for the event said: "Although even in the worst case scenario and the weather doesn't improve we are very fortunate that the Cairngorms have a wealth of other outdoor activities to keep people entertained throughout the day."
He added: "The whole team are taking part in morning and evening snow dances to encourage the white stuff, so fingers crossed."
