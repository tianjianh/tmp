Lesley Griffiths confirmed they would be resettled in four local authority areas, with details not being revealed.
She said all 22 councils were keen to welcome refugees although 18 were still preparing services for their arrival.
Ms Griffiths added the UK government had vowed that all refugees would be "thoroughly vetted" before arrival to ensure they were no security risk.
"Wales has a proud history of welcoming refugees from all over the world, including Syrians, who have come to the UK and claimed asylum," she said.
"I want to send out a strong message that refugees and asylum seekers are welcome in Wales."
Welsh ministers have created the Syrian Refugee Taskforce to handle people arriving in Wales under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has previously suggested between 500 and 600 refugees could be settled in Wales over the next five years, based on the UK taking 10,000.
With up to 20,000 refugees now expected, Wales' share is likely to be around 1,000.
The Welsh Refugee Council has told BBC Wales the taskforce should expand to deal with around 3,000 asylum seekers and refugees already in Wales.
The Welsh government has said it is consulting on ways to help all seeking sanctuary.
