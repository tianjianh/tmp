A song featuring Zayn Malik without the rest of One Direction has been taken down, less than a day after it was shared on Twitter.

Producer Naughty Boy posted a link to the track early on Tuesday, with the words "let the music do the talking".
It came less than a week after Zayn confirmed he was quitting 1D.
Earlier on, the band's Louis Tomlinson accused Naughty Boy of being "inconsiderate" to fans after he retweeted a video about Zayn.
The pair argued on Twitter hours before the demo was made public.
Zayn quit One Direction last week saying he wanted to be a "normal 22-year-old", but early on Tuesday Naughty Boy tweeted a link to his first solo song I Won't Mind.
The track on SoundCloud is now unavailable, but it included the caption: "There is nothing but love for what was left behind. That's why we don't mind. ;) #zaughty #zinabad."
Naughty Boy, whose real name is Shahid Khan, has previously worked with Emeli Sande, Tinie Tempah, Ed Sheeran, Leona Lewis and Rihanna.
The producer tweeted the song hours after having an argument with Zayn Malik's former One Direction bandmate Louis Tomlinson.
Louis accused the producer of "trying to wind the fans up" after he retweeted a video saying "Zaughty will rise", a reference to working with Zayn.
Louis later tweeted: "Wow @NaughtyBoyMusic you're so inconsiderate pal, seriously how old are you? Grow up! #masterofallwisdom."
So far, Zayn hasn't commented on the solo material.
As the band carries on as a four-piece, Zayn has been removed from the video montage which plays at the beginning of One Direction's shows.
Fans in Johannesburg, South Africa, noticed Zayn was missing from the footage at the band's show on Sunday.
