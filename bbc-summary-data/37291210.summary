[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US comedian Amy Schumer has described anyone who is not a feminist as an "insane person".

She was speaking in an interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis which aired on Tuesday.
"I think anyone who is not a feminist is an insane person. I think they don't know what feminism means," she said.
Schumer also joked she would learn Spanish and leave the country if Donald Trump is elected US president.
"My act will change because I'll need to learn to speak Spanish because I will move to Spain, or somewhere. It's beyond my comprehension if Trump won. It's too crazy."
She said many who criticise Hillary Clinton do so unfairly.
"I haven't had a conversation with anyone who doesn't like Hillary where they've had anything meaningful to say. I think she's caught so much flack for so long now, because she isn't what they think of as a woman."
"They were mad she wasn't making cookies, but she was like, 'Oh no, I'm getting healthcare for every mother in the country'."
"They don't like how she speaks or dresses. It's everything except how she would be as a president."
Schumer, who is currently in the UK as part of a tour, said she is comfortable being described as a feminist and a comedian.
"It just means equality for women. But I think that word has a whole different meaning for different people. So someone will say to me: 'You're not a feminist are you?'... Of course I am. Of course I want equal rights for women.... Feminism is just about women having social, political and economic equality," she said.
"I feel very comfortable speaking about myself as a comedian and a feminist because those are two things that I completely am. Those are two words that definitely define me."
The comic also spoke of how she sometimes feels introverted and needs to take a break from socialising.
"I have sat in a Starbucks bathroom and just sat on the floor and taken a minute... Just to take a break and not have to talk. I don't mind talking to someone one-on-one. I like it. I really like it - that's what I do.
"But yeah, it's super taxing to me and to some people. I'm not that much in the minority. I think a lot of people would do better if they realised they were introverts and they altered or modified what they were expecting of themselves."
She has won a number of awards for her TV series, Inside Amy Schumer, including an Emmy for best variety sketch series and Critics' Choice award for best actress in a comedy series.
The star has just released a book - The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo - and says she is hoping to slow down from her hectic schedule soon.
"I'm really proud of what I've done, and so I am planning on slowing down - to a geriatric degree!"
