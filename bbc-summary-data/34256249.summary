Aberdeen terror accused Yousif Badri 'made fringe nutters retweet'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man on trial for terrorist offences in Aberdeen retweeted two weeks before he was arrested that the murderers of soldier Lee Rigby were "fringe nutters", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yousif Badri, 29, is accused of being involved in conduct "with the intention of committing acts of terrorism".
The medical student denies charges under the Terrorism Act.
The High Court in Glasgow heard Mr Badri retweeted a message about the killing of Fusilier Rigby.
The soldier was murdered as he returned to his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013.
Defence QC Murdo Macleod produced Mr Badri's twitter feed from that time.
He retweeted a message which stated: "The murderers in custody tonight are about as representative of Islam as the EDL is representative of the white community. Fringe nutters."
The court was told that Mr Badri was arrested by police the next month.
The court also heard that Mr Badri's mother and father, who came to Britain in the 1990s, were both doctors, and one of his sisters received a commendation for her work as a police officer with West Yorkshire Police.
The offences are said to have been carried out at two places in Aberdeen - Mr Badri's former flat in Ashgrove Road, and in Berryden Retail Park.
The trial, before judge Lord Turnbull, continues.
