The 27-year-old's body was found after officers were called to his home on Central Promenade in Douglas, Isle of Man at 09:00 BST on Thursday.
Det Insp Iain MacMillan said: "There remains no reason to view the circumstances as suspicious."
Mr Baggs' family have been informed of the outcome, he added.
An inquest date is yet to be confirmed but inquiries will continue in order to inform the Coroner of Inquests of the full circumstances.
He said: "Mr Baggs' family have asked that their privacy is respected at this, the most difficult of times".
The Plymouth-born entrepreneur lived in the Isle of Man for most of his life and ran a telecommunications company.
At 21 years old, he was the youngest-ever candidate when he appeared on the BBC One show in 2010.
Baggs, who was fired in the semi-final, became famous for his one-liners which included: "Everything I touch turns to sold" and "I'm Stuart Baggs the brand".
The Apprentice boss Lord Sugar led tributes: "Terrible news Stuart Baggs has died. My sincere condolences to his family and friends RIP one of the stand out characters of the apprentice."
