Froome, who climbed back to third in stage 10, narrowed the gap on overall leader Nairo Quintana to 54 seconds.
Spain's Alejandro Valverde has fallen to third, with Briton Simon Yates in seventh place.
"Quintana is really strong and I'm trying to do as much as I can day by day and trying to get close to him," Froome said.
"After the season I've had it is really tough for me at the moment".
Froome, who is aiming to become the first man in 38 years to win the Tour de France and the Vuelta in the same season, had previously been 58 seconds behind Quintana.
