China media: Hong Kong's 'social order'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mainland papers say pro-democracy protests are "seriously disrupting" Hong Kong's social order.

In the past three days most Chinese-language mainland papers have offered little or no coverage of the protests, but that appears to have changed.
Several papers, including the Beijing Times, the Southern Metropolis and the overseas edition of the People's Daily, have reprinted Xinhua News Agency's reports on the protests.
Noting the "disruption" in the city, the papers say that "all sectors in Hong Kong are calling for order to be restored".
Breaking its silence on the protest, the People's Daily's domestic edition, in a commentary, blames a faction of people "for holding an "illegal assembly" which is "seriously disrupting" Hong Kong's social order and the economy.
The paper urges "everyone to treasure, maintain and promote a democratic system that is suitable for the realistic situation of Hong Kong".
The Guangming Net agrees with the view, urging the people of Hong Kong to "respect the law".
An article in the Global Times' Chinese edition accuses the US of "attempting to hold a colour revolution in Hong Kong" and supporting the protests.
Despite the apparent ease in reporting restrictions, some websites appear to have deleted commentaries after publishing them.
The Legal Daily's article on the protests appears to have been removed. However, it is available on the South China Daily's website.
The article, entitled "One country- Two systems faces huge challenges", points out that "external unfriendly forces and domestic opposition camps" are pursuing the Western system and that they are using the issue of electoral system to "create trouble" and seek "independence in disguise".
"Now that the system is facing a serious test, if the central government loses its political grip under the pressure of the opposition, Hong Kong will sink into political turmoil like countries in other parts of the world and, if the oppositions gain control, the central government's power will certainly weaken or even run out of control," it says.
Though confident that the "majority of Hong Kong residents hope for stability" and that the opposition will not gain support, the article warns that the central government is "ready" to deal with "massive riots" that arise.
"If the opposition gains more support, provoked by external unfriendly forces, and tries to create massive riots... the Hong Kong government will adopt resolute measures and the central government will also roll out several measures to deal with it," it warns.   ã€€
Meanwhile, pro-Beijing and pro-democracy media outlets in Hong Kong continue to trade accusations over the protests.
Pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po blames the protesters for "causing the situation to become uncontrollable".
The editorial urges activists to "bear the responsibility of putting a stop to the campaign".
"Seeking their cause through illegal violent actions to paralyse Hong Kong will hurt the interests of the people, and is against the mainstream opinion. The Occupy Central participants should calmly evaluate the consequencesâ€¦ and use legal avenues to discuss political reform," it urges.
An article in the Hong Kong Economic Journal criticises Beijing for adopting a "Friends-or-Foes mentality" in pushing forward a "China-style election".
The massive movement has also gained wide attention in Taiwanese media outlets.
Supporting the protests, an article in the Liberty Times states that the people in Hong Kong "have awakened to get rid of the dictatorship of the Communist Party of China (CPC)".
"Strike down the CPC and the Kuomintang Party," exclaims the article, voicing displeasure over the ruling Kuomintang Party's close relations with the CPC.
"Taiwan is now becoming a part of China, this is the task given by the CPC for the Kuomintang to execute. But no matter how the two conspire with each other, people of the free and democratic Taiwan will strike down the Kuomintang with their votes in the election system that the Hong Kong people are fighting for," says the article, referring to the year-end mayoral elections on the island.
And finally, Hong Kong's health authorities have warned of "pollution risks" and advise the general public to reduce time outdoors.
The South China Morning Post observes that air pollution threat "had been low due to less traffic since the demonstrations began".
However, the Post notes that the Environmental Protection Department has changed its health risk forecast to "high" and "very high" in the city on Tuesday, due to "different sources of pollution".
Protesters interviewed by the paper, however, insist that the poor weather will "not undermine the protesters' determination to seek democracy".
"I don't think rain and bad air quality will dampen or deter protesters' will and confidence," one said. "We have raincoats ready to hand out. We also have big umbrellas for protesters to share."
