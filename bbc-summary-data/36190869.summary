[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old from Laxey died in hospital on 19 April after sustaining serious head injuries during a crash at the Oliver's Mount Spring Cup.
An escorted lap of the Mountain Course will depart from the TT Grandstand at 12:00 BST on 13 May.
His family said well wishers are invited to take part in the procession.
Redmayne was a serving member of the Parachute Regiment who had served three tours of Afghanistan.
He will receive a military funeral at Douglas Crematorium.
The Laxey racer won the Junior Manx Grand Prix in 2015 and was regarded as one of the brightest prospects in the sport.
He had been set to make his debut at both the North West 200 and Isle of Man TT races this summer.
