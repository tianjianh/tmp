Laura Graham from Kilkeel, who finished 10th overall, crossed the line in 2:41.53.
The 30-year-old was over three minutes clear of silver medal winner Caitriona Jennings.
Donegal woman Jennings posted a time of 2:44.59, with last year's national champion Pauline Curley taking bronze.
Graham, who has competed in just five marathons before, said: "I only first did a marathon because my dad had a heart attack.
"I still don't think I am good enough to be an elite athlete.
"I knew I had to go steady and think smart for a change, because I didn't do that in London last year."
Charity fundraiser Pat O'Loughlin, 79, completed his 36th Dublin Marathon on Sunday - a record in terms of runners from Northern Ireland.
The Castlederg man, who turns 80 in December, crossed the line in 6:47.
Nambia's Helalia Johannes won the women's race outright in a sprint finish with Bizuayehu Gebireyes.
Helalia clocked 2:32.31 a second ahead of Gebireyes.
Dereje Debele produced a front running display to take the men's title in 2:12:18 in an Ethopian 1-2-3 with Dereje Beyecha second in 2:14.37 and Legese Bekele third (2:15.00).
Sergui Ciobanu, the marathoner who just missed out on Rio 2016 selection, took the men's Irish title in 2:17:39, just 39 seconds outside the qualifying time for the 2017 World Championships in London.
Paul Pollock and Mick Clohissey have already secured the qualifying standard of 2:17.00 for London 2017.
