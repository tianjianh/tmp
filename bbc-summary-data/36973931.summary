NHS Grampian 'has too many vacancies' despite recruiting 186 new staff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Grampian has recruited more than 180 new nursing and midwifery staff in the last year but says it still has too many vacancies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 186 extra staff have been found.
However, NHS Grampian's board has heard that 400 posts still need to be filled.
The search is continuing across the UK and abroad, but the high cost of housing is seen as a barrier to attracting staff to the area.
Dr Annie Ingram, director of workforce at NHS Grampian, said: "We've made huge progress over the last year but, like other public sector organisations in Grampian, we face challenges in recruiting."
