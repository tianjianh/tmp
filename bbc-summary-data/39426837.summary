[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swansea City v Tottenham Hotspur

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea striker Fernando Llorente is doubtful with an ankle injury and faces a late test to see if he will be fit enough to be named as a substitute.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wayne Routledge is set to return in place of Luciano Narsingh after missing the last game due to personal reasons.
Tottenham's Harry Winks is out for the season after injuring his ankle against Burnley and Victor Wanyama will be assessed after also limping off.
Kyle Walker should return after being rested at Turf Moor.
However, Harry Kane, Danny Rose and Erik Lamela are all unavailable.
MOTD COMMENTATOR'S NOTES
Steve Wilson: "Having cut the gap to Chelsea at the top to seven points, Spurs simply must win this one and hope for a favour from Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.
"It may not be that simple though. For all that they have impressed so thoroughly this season, their win at Turf Moor on Saturday was only their fifth away league win - the same number as Crystal Palace and half as many as enjoyed by Chelsea and Manchester City.
"Swansea boss Paul Clement has seen his side take just one point from their last three games, and has spoken of the tension at the Liberty Stadium during Sunday's draw with Middlesbrough. No wonder, sitting just a point above resurgent Hull is not a comfortable place to be."

Swansea City head coach Paul Clement: "They have been challenging for the last couple of seasons and Mauricio Pochettino has done a really good job.
"He has a good, young squad who play exciting football. The Chelsea result at the weekend has probably given them belief that they can take the title race right to the end of the season.
"I think it will be an interesting game for us. They will want to win here and we need points too."
Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino: "We reduced the gap by three points but it's still a big gap, seven is a massive difference.
"For us it's about being focused and trying to improve on last season in terms of numbers.
"Nothing is impossible in football and that is our idea, our philosophy."
Swansea are just starting to stutter a little bit, but Spurs just seem to keep going.
