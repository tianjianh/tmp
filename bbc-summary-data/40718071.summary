Larroyer was sin-binned after the incident, known as a "squirrel-grip" tackle, and later apologised to team-mates, adding it was "not intentional".
He entered an early guilty plea to a charge of "other contrary behaviour".
Larroyer, 28, will miss the first two games of the Super 8s competition.
Castleford went on to win Saturday's match 32-24.
The Tigers finished top of the Super League table after 23 regular-season matches and need just one win from seven Super 8s games to guarantee themselves a semi-final spot.
Meanwhile, Widnes will be without Alex Gerrard for the first two matches of their Qualifiers campaign - in which the Vikings will be bidding to retain their Super League status - after he pleaded guilty to Grade C dangerous contact in their defeat by Warrington on Thursday.
