[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jedburgh Sheriff Court heard that 67 videos were found on Mark Ross's laptop following a police raid at a house in Creel Court, St Abbs.
They predominantly featured boys aged between eight and 12.
Ross, 49, from Gateshead,  admitted possession of indecent "pseudo photographs" of children between November 2010 and December 2013.
Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the videos had been found after police received information that someone had been accessing images of child abuse through the internet.
The court was told that Ross was a full-time carer for his mother and his lawyer Ross Dow added that his client had been fully co-operative with the police.
Sheriff Peter Paterson said: "These are not victimless crimes.
"But I do detect a significant degree of shame about your involvement."
Ross was also given a three-year community pay back order involving work with a Northumberland sex offenders programme.
