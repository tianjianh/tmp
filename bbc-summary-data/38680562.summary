The Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King, colloquially known as Paddy's Wigwam, will mark its golden jubilee with celebrations starting in May.
Events include an anniversary Mass on 4 June celebrated by Crosby-born Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales.
More than 350,000 visitors visit the cathedral each year.
Other events include a floral tribute, a golden jubilee dinner, and the first performance of a musical piece which was commissioned but not finished in time for the cathedral's consecration in 1967.
The long-awaited Liverpool Mass - by electronic music pioneer Pierre Henry - will finally be performed at the Bluecoat arts centre.
Canon Anthony O'Brien, Dean of the Cathedral, said: "This will be a very special year in the life of our cathedral as we mark this golden milestone of our history in a building that means so much to so many people."
