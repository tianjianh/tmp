[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 21-year-old was attacked in Minshull Street at about 02:00 GMT after she refused to give a man her phone number.
Police think the man, in his late 20s or early 30s, had previously attacked two other women in recent weeks.
He was said to be Asian, wore a bubble coat and was carrying an umbrella with the logo of clothing firm Blacks on it.
The umbrella the suspect was carrying had the logo of the outdoor clothing company and "was about nine years old and quite rare", according to police. He ran off towards Canal Street.
A 22-year-old woman was attacked in Kent Road West at about 04:00 on 6 February. The man approached the victim from behind and sexually assaulted her.
On 30 January, the man put his arm around a 19-year-old woman on Oxford Road and assaulted her. He then followed her into Whitworth Street and attempted to assault her again.
She pushed him away and ran off.
Anyone with information about the incidents is asked to contact police or Crimestoppers.
