Maurice McCloughan and Killian Doherty died following the crash on the main road between Omagh and Ballygawley.
The crash happened near a meat factory on the A5 just after 08:00 GMT on Saturday.
Mr McCloughan's family said he was their "golden boy" and "never without an infectious smile".
They also said that Mr Doherty was "another fantastic young man that didn't deserve to go so soon and leave behind another shattered family".
"We have laughed together, cried together, danced together and now, without our centrepiece, our baby, we have to mourn together," said the family's statement.
"Maurice was the life and soul of every party and loved a good jump about the dance floor.
"He was always up for a laugh, had terrible taste in music, was never without that infectious smile and never had any problem 'pulling the chicks'.
"Although our lives are falling apart, we have become aware of how many lives have been touched by Maurice and just how many people this will affect.
"We as a family will get through this together and we open up our hearts to all of those who were friends, teammates and classmates.
"It gives us some comfort that Maurice has Killian up there with him."
Father Kevin Mullan said it was impossible not to like Mr Doherty.
"It's heart-breaking and as you can see from the lads at the laying of the flowers, the pain is tearing them apart," he said.
"They're big men and men don't do that kind of thing, but they do.
"He was just such a loveable little man and we saw him growing up, had him in school, saw him going to school, and work, and you couldn't not like Killian."
Ryan McCallion senior manager of Drumquin GAA club said: "The whole team is devastated, the club is devastated and the whole town is devastated.
"Killian was a big part of Drumquin not only as a footballer but as a person. He was well liked, a vital part, a vital cog in Drumquin."
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Glenn Campbell said there had been a "great outpouring of grief" from young people and the GAA community in the area.
"Both young men were prominent members of their respective GAA clubs and I know the clubs will be a great source of support to their family and friends in the time ahead," said Mr Campbell.
