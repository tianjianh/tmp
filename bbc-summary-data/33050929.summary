The bizarrely-dressed suspect is wanted in connection with two break-ins in Skelmersdale last month.
Lancashire Police said she is thought to be in her 40s, with greasy, dyed purple hair, scabs on her face and a tattoo of the name Evelyn on one hand.
She was also wearing a yellow Minions rucksack, a padded jacket and carrying a black sleeping bag.
The burglaries happened on 23 May on Inglewhite.
During the first incident, which happened between 08:00 and 15:00 BST, a property was entered through a back door and keys to the house and nearby allotments were stolen.
A second home was later entered in the same way between 11:30 and 12:00 BST, and keys to the house and car keys were taken.
PC Hanif Patel said: "The woman was seen in the area by a number of witnesses and we are keen to trace her as soon as possible."
