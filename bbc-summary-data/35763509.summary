State broadcaster RTÉ has reported that gardaí (Irish police) are focusing on a gang linked to David Byrne who was shot dead at a boxing weigh-in event in February.
The raids were focused on financial activities and homes of known gang members, as well as accountants and solicitors offices are being searched.
The searches began at 07:00 local time.
The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) co-ordinated the operation and a total of 12 homes and six commercial properties were searched in the west of the city.
It is understood that more than 60 armed officers were involved in the operation, as well as officials from Customs and Revenue.
A total of 29 cars including Mercedes, Lexus, Jeeps, and other SUVs have been loaded onto trucks to be taken away.
Police said a number of items of jewellery "which are believed to be of considerable value" and more than €30,000 of cash (£23,268) have been seized.
The authorities are looking for evidence which will enable them to identify the proceeds of gang crime, such as cash, documents, computers and files.
In a statement, the Garda Siochána said: "The searches are being conducted as part of an on-going investigation into organised crime groups which has been under way for some considerable time. "
