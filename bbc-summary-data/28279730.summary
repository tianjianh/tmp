The 23-year-old, who plays for Monaco, scored six goals in five matches as his side reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to hosts Brazil.
Rodriguez finished ahead of Germany forward Thomas Muller, who netted five goals as his side won the tournament.
Argentina's Lionel Messi, who won the Golden Ball for the tournament's best player, was in a tie for third.
His four goals were matched by Brazil striker Neymar and Netherlands forward Robin van Persie.
Rodriguez's goals helped Colombia progress further than they had before at a World Cup.
He scored against Greece, Ivory Coast and Japan as they topped Group C before netting twice, one a sublime volley, during the 2-0 last-16 win against Uruguay.
Rodriguez's final goal was a late consolation from the penalty spot as Colombia lost 2-1 to Brazil.
Germany's Manuel Neuer, 28, won the Golden Glove awarded to the best goalkeeper at the tournament, while France's 21-year-old midfielder Paul Pogba won the best young player prize.
