At least 15 drivers were initially caught filming or taking pictures after four HGVs smashed into each other on the A14 in Cambridgeshire on 28 May.
But the number identified has since risen to 24, police have said.
They are being sent letters informing them about court proceedings.
No-one was badly hurt in the crash, at about 05:45 BST on the westbound carriageway.
Lorry driver Ron Norris, from Northumberland, had to be cut out of his cab by the fire service, but escaped with minor injuries.
"I was totally stunned. I think it hit me a little bit when I was sat on a stretcher facing my truck and I just broke down in tears," he said.
"I couldn't help but think how on earth I'd got away with this."
Asked what he thought about drivers taking photographs of the accident, he said: "They deserve to get prosecuted.
"I could have died. The other driver could have died.
"If they were on their mobile phones when the crash happened, they could have died as well."
About 16 miles of road between junctions 31 and 36 was closed for several hours while the wreckage was cleared.
Two of the lorry drivers were taken to hospital with minor injuries.
