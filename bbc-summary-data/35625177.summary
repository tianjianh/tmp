The men, all aged in their 90s, were given the Légion d'Honneur during a ceremony held at Yorkshire Air Museum in Elvington, York.
The honour is in recognition of their roles in France and Europe's liberation from the Nazis.
They all served with either the British Navy, Army or Royal Air Force on the D-Day invasion of Normandy in June 1944.
Several similar ceremonies have taken place since the 70th anniversary of D-Day in 2014.
D-Day was the first stage of the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe, changing the course of the war.
Following the 70th anniversary, French President François Hollande pledged to honour all those British veterans who had served in his country during the war.
What is the Legion d'Honneur?
Robert Hall, from Harrogate, said he was "absolutely surprised" to hear he was going to be a recipient.
He said: "Two years earlier, I got hinted that they might be passing medals on to certain people.
"I feel very honoured actually. It's not just for me really, it's for the whole unit that I was on."
The Legion d'Honneur is France's top accolade for an elite group of people who distinguish themselves through civilian or military valour.
It was initiated by the then First Consul of the French Republic, Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1802.
