League Two side Swindon Town have signed Wigan Athletic forward Kaiyne Woolery for £350,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the Wiltshire club.
He helped Forest Green Rovers clinch promotion last term with 16 National League appearances in a half-season loan deal, and Rovers were interested in signing him on a permanent basis.
"I got a promotion last year and I came here to get another one," Woolery told Swindon's club website.
The former Notts County loanee made one league appearance for the Latics after signing on a free transfer from Bolton in 2016.
