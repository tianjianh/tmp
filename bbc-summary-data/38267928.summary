Anti-fracking activist Tina Rothery spared £55k legal bill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An anti-fracking campaigner who failed to comply with the courts has been spared a £55,000 legal bill.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tina Rothery was fined after taking part in a three-week protest at a field in Lancashire, which was earmarked for shale gas exploration, in 2014.
She initially refused to provide her financial details "on principle" and was found in contempt of court.
A hearing earlier heard she had no money or assets. Energy firm Cuadrilla decided not to pursue costs.
The mother-of-one said she was "delighted" as she left Preston Crown Court to the cheers of 150 fellow protestors.
Ms Rothery was hit with the £55,000 bill after opposing an injunction by the company and landowners while occupying land near Blackpool.
The activist told earlier hearings she would defend her actions, but then failed to provide a defence at subsequent hearings.
She was fined for wasting court time and was further found in contempt after declining to provide the court with details of how she would pay the bill.
The 54-year-old eventually complied after being warned she could face a 14-day prison sentence.
Cuadrilla said it would not pursue costs while she "clearly has no assets to make any payment."
Prior to the hearing, Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood called on the company to drop the case.
