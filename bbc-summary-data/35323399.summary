Watford's Nigeria international striker Odion Ighalo says he feels "humbled and honoured" to be named Premier League Player of the Month for December.

"It's true I scored some goals but I could not have done it all by myself, " the 26-year-old told BBC Sport.
"This award is only possible through God and everyone connected to the club because without them there will be no award for me to receive."
Ighalo scored five goals in December to take his tally for the season to 13.
Two of his goals came in the 3-0 home win over Liverpool on 20 December -  part of a run of three consecutive victories from the start of the month. Watford also drew with Chelsea before falling to a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham on 28 December.
The sequence also earned Hornets boss Quique Sanchez Flores the Manager of the Month award.
Watford had never previously had a recipient of a Premier League monthly award.
Although Watford have been unable to carry their end-of-year form into January - after three successive defeats they have slipped to 10th in the table - Ighalo is optimistic for the rest of the season.
"The team really worked hard and those defeats only reminded us how tough it can be in the Premier League," he said.
"We will continue to work harder to turn things around because our collective desire is to return to winning ways."
