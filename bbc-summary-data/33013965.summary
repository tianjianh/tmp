Most of those who died in the raid were students and the attackers singled out Christians to be killed, while sparing Muslims.
The names of the 148 killed were all read out in a court in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, the AFP news agency reports.
Judge Daniel Ogembo remanded the accused in custody until 11 June when the court will rule on their bail application, it reports.
