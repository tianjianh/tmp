The Tigers have issued a statement saying they have "not accepted any offers or received any bids".
But BBC Sport understands Jakupovic is set to join the Premier League club.
The 32-year-old would sign as an understudy to Kasper Schmeichel, with Ron-Robert Zieler's future unclear.
Jakupovic, who has played international football for both Switzerland and Bosnia, has a year left on his deal.
He played 22 Premier League games last season as Hull were relegated.
Leicester, who confirmed Craig Shakespeare as manager on 8 June, completed the signing of defender Harry Maguire from Hull in a £17m deal on Thursday.
