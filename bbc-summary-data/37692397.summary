US Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton called to face media in Austin

Lewis Hamilton has been called to appear at the drivers' news conference for this weekend's US Grand Prix - two weeks after he criticised its format.

The Mercedes driver came under scrutiny over his behaviour at the same media event in Japan, during which he gave short answers and played on his phone.
He also said fans and not journalists should ask the questions and walked out of a post-qualifying Mercedes briefing.
Hamilton trails team-mate Nico Rosberg by 33 points with just four races left.
The 31-year-old was upset by criticism of his behaviour in the pre-Japan news conference by some in the media, and after qualifying on Saturday told a group of journalists that he was "not here to answer your questions".
He added: "I don't really plan on sitting here many more times for these kind of things." He has since blocked a number of F1 journalists on Twitter.
However, his resolve on this issue has been quickly challenged by governing body the FIA heading into the Austin weekend, as attendance at the six-driver Thursday news conference is mandatory under the sport's regulations.
Hamilton's Mercedes commitments also appear to be unchanged.
According to the media schedule released by the team, Hamilton is due to fulfil his written media obligations after qualifying and the race.
Hamilton finished third in Suzuka as Rosberg picked up his ninth win of the season.
Rosberg can now afford to finish second to Hamilton at the remaining races and still claim a maiden world title.
