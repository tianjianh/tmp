The UK's best selling bottled ale, thought by many people to be from Cornwall, is not brewed in the county at all, it has been revealed.

Despite its Cornish branding, bottles of Sharp's Doom Bar have been made in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, for the last two years.
Only the cask version is made at the main brewery site in Rock, Cornwall.
Sharp's, which is owned by US company Molson Coors, said it did not have the room to bottle the ale at Rock.
The labels on bottles of Doom Bar contain seven references to Rock Cornwall, but none to Burton-upon-Trent, but the small print reads "brewed in the UK".
Molson Coors bought Sharp's in 2011. Measured by value of sales, Doom Bar is now the most popular bottled ale in the UK.
Former publican Chris Parsons said: "I assumed it was made from the local waters. I wouldn't buy it anymore and think it is a complete and utter con."
Liz Fletcher, landlady of the Devon and Cornwall Inn, said: "I can kind of understand it because Doom Bar is now so so huge and so so popular we're limited with space and logistics in Cornwall."
Sharp's spokesman James Nicholls said: "We have been established in Rock since 1994 and the majority of Doom Bar, more than 80% or about 1m pints a week, is brewed at Rock.
"But we do complement that with brewing operations further afield and that is the spirit of collaboration that we've seen in the brewing market places where beer is brewed under licence in other locations.
"We are using the expertise of specialist operations further afield to make sure that product is a good as it can be. Doom Bar is brewed in Rock and was conceived in Rock and we are very proud of that."
