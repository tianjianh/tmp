Birmingham City: Michael Morrison says the players have taken boss's criticism on board

Captain Michael Morrison says the Birmingham City players have accepted the criticism aimed at them by manager Gary Rowett after their draw with Preston North End.

Rowett was furious after his side lost a two-goal lead to be held 2-2 at St Andrew's to end any hope of making the Championship play-offs.
"We've held on to leads at lot better this season," Morrison told BBC WM.
"We're probably far too open - we need to get that bit between our teeth."
Rowett called his side "unprofessional" and "lacking desire" after seeing Clayton Donaldson's brace cancelled out by two goals in the last 17 minutes, with Greg Cunningham's equaliser coming a minute from time.
"We need to see the game out, especially at home - they had no right to get back into it," said 28-year-old Morrison.
"It was very disappointing and a few choice words were said.
"Early on in the season, we had a tighter shape and people were working harder maybe to be more difficult to beat."
Blues went into the game with only a mathematical chance of finishing in the top six but the result has now extinguished their promotion hopes.
"It's a difficult time after such a good season and it turning out the way it has," added Morrison.
"It is an anti-climax, the fans are disappointed we're not still chasing the play-offs and that does affect the players but we're still going to put 100% in."
