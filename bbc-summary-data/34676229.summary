An Iranian-American businessman has been detained by authorities in Iran, reports say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Siamak Namazi was held earlier this month while on a visit to Tehran, sources told BBC Persian.
He was detained by intelligence agents and is being kept in solitary confinement at Evin prison, according to a source quoted by Reuters.
If confirmed, it would be the latest of several detentions by Iran of people with dual Iranian-American nationality.
The US state department said it was looking into the reports of Mr Namazi's arrest.
It comes despite a thaw in relations between Iran and the West - including a deal on the country's nuclear programme.
Iran is also attending talks on the Syrian civil war for the first time this week.
Mr Namazi - who was said to be based in Dubai and to have been working for a UAE oil and gas company - was barred from leaving Iran in July, the Reuters report said.
He was questioned regularly before being detained in mid-October, it added.
It is unclear what charges, if any, he faces.
Other cases involving men with dual American and Iranian nationality include:
