[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire's lower-order batsmen frustrated Surrey before the visitors were bowled out for 287 at The Oval.

The home side reached 50-0 in reply at the end of day one to trail by 237.
Sam Curran (4-61) dismissed opener Luke Procter early on and then returned to remove Alviro Petersen and Steven Croft during a middle-order collapse.
The visitors slipped to 99-5, but Jordan Clark (56) led the recovery and, with help from the tail, Arron Lilley's brisk 38 earned two bonus points.
Given the tight nature of the Division One table, third-placed Surrey and fourth-placed Lancashire could either mount a challenge for the title or slip into a relegation battle in the final month of the season.
Surrey, who have played at least one game more than the other eight sides in the division, appeared well in control until Lancashire's fightback.
Teenager Haseeb Hameed, who scored a century in each innings in Lancashire's previous match against Yorkshire, made 26 before he gloved an attempted pull shot off Stuart Meaker to wicketkeeper Ben Foakes.
After losing three wickets for 18 runs in 25 balls shortly after lunch, Clark and debutant Rob Jones (25) rebuilt the innings and it took a brilliant diving slip catch by Kumar Sangakkara to remove Clark, ending their sixth-wicket stand of 85.
Lilley hit four sixes in his 28-ball knock, while Nathan Buck (24 not out) and Simon Kerrigan (25) put on 48 for the last wicket.
Rory Burns (33 not out) passed 1,000 first-class runs for the season as Surrey's openers made it to the close unscathed, although he was dropped by Jones in the final over of the day.
