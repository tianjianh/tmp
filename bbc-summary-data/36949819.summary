[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 0-1 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tammy Abraham scored his second goal in two Bristol City games to help the Championship side overcome League Two club Wycombe Wanderers in the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Chelsea loanee's neat turn and low finish in the first half was enough to send the visitors into round two.
The hosts thought they had levelled but Adebayo Akinfenwa was ruled offside.
Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth, missing players through injury, had named himself on the bench but was an unused substitute as his side suffered defeat.
Match ends, Wycombe Wanderers 0, Bristol City 1.
