[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crystal Palace remain without forwards Wilfried Zaha and Bakary Sako against Manchester City despite their Africa Cup of Nations involvement ending.

Striker Fraizer Campbell and goalkeeper Steve Mandanda are back in training, but Scott Dann (hamstring) and Julian Speroni (knee) are doubts.
City captain Vincent Kompany, who has not played since November because of a knee injury, is fit.
Teenage Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus is in contention to make his first start.
City beat Palace away in the league in November, with Yaya Toure scoring twice on his shock return to the team - in Kompany's most recent appearance.
The Londoners are 18th in the table, two points adrift of a position of safety.
"It was a really tough game," City boss Pep Guardiola said. "It was one of the worst games that we played this season but we won and when that happens everything is perfect, but we didn't play good.
"We expect a tough game in the FA Cup. Every game is complicated, so it will be tough - the stadium, Palace's situation, because it's away."
Palace boss Sam Allardyce said: "We're not converting chances at the moment. My priority is stopping the goals going in the net.
"Whatever team Pep puts out will be full of international players of the highest calibre. It will be a hugely difficult game. The key to beating any big side is what you do after defending well, what you do with your possession."
