[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jordan Rhodes scored twice, including an injury-time winner, as Championship leaders Middlesbrough came from behind to beat already-relegated Bolton.

Josh Vela fired Bolton in front from eight yards after Emile Heskey laid Dean Moxey's long throw into his path.
But Boro equalised when Rhodes, who was about to be replaced by David Nugent, drilled home from close range.
Rhodes then headed in Middlesbrough's second stoppage-time winner this week from three yards.
Minutes earlier, Boro's big-money transfer deadline day signing from Blackburn had hit the post and headed wide from six yards as the Teessiders sought a winner, while substitute Gaston Ramirez also scooped a shot over from close range.
Relive Middlesbrough's win at Bolton
But Rhodes was in the right place at the right time to nod in Nugent's cross in the first minute of injury time and leave Boro two points clear at the top after promotion rivals Burnley, who they face on Tuesday, won 2-1 at Birmingham.
Boro, who have now won six successive games, also scored an injury-time winner to beat Reading in midweek and this late show secured only their second victory at Bolton's current home.
Middlesbrough face promotion rivals Burnley and Brighton in their closing four games and, as such, have their fate in their own hands as they bid to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2009.
Aitor Karanka's side dominated the first half in terms of chances as Stewart Downing hit the bar from 25 yards, while Adam Forshaw, Daniel Ayala, Albert Adomah and Ritchie de Laet all failed to hit to target.
Mark Davies' backheel forced Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos into a save from Bolton's best first-half opening.
Wanderers looked set for only their fifth win of the season after Vela put them in front but Rhodes had the final say to the delight of Boro's 4,302 travelling fans.
Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka:
"I told him [Rhodes] after the game that a goalscorer can't forget to score goals in two months.
"Always one day it would arrive that he would score goals and it was today - two important goals.
"I don't think it's been easy for him. He's not a strong character, you can see it in his face. The reason I am pleased for him is because sometimes when you do your best and you're unlucky you are going down. He was always trusting himself.
"Today, the most important day, he arrived and he was there to help the team."
Bolton interim manager Jimmy Phillips:
"That's [the level of performance] got to be the case from now until the end of the season.
"We encourage players to get on the ball, show as much in possession as they could, to be confident with it, because our league fate has been decided but also retaining a real competitive edge and defensive shape.
"There's still areas to work on, definitely, hopefully if we can achieve better ball retention, become harder to beat and still work hard that will set the players up for next season for those that are going to be here."
