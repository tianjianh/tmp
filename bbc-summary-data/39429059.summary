The 22-year-old from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, won two golds and broke two world records in Brazil in 2016.
"I didn't quite achieve what I wanted in Rio - I set out to get three golds," Hynd told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"I want to keep winning, that's what excites me."

Hynd, who won his first Paralympic gold at London 2012, has won four world, six European and one Commonwealth title in his career so far and says he was not completely happy with his performances in Rio.
"Funnily enough, no - my goal was three golds and five medals, but I got a silver and came fourth twice so it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for," he said.
"The goalposts haven't really changed going forward. It's just about setting goals that are exciting that's what I want to do in Tokyo.
"Although, I've very proud of what I've done in my career from London through to Rio, it's now about what's next."
When asked whether he is, effectively, chasing perfection in 2020, Hynd is happy with that target.
"Yeah, pretty much," he said. "I'm laying it all out from the get-go. In three years' time, I'll be ready to go again, that's for sure."
