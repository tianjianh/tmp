[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Abu al-Faraj al-Masri died in Idlib province, according to the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham group, which was known as the Nusra Front when linked to al-Qaeda.
The Egyptian national and veteran al-Qaeda cleric was a member of the group's consultative Shura Council.
The Pentagon confirmed it had "targeted a prominent al-Qaeda member in Syria".
"We are assessing the results of the operation at this time," Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said.
He provided no further details.
Who are Jabhat Fateh al-Sham?
Reports suggest that al-Masri was killed when the vehicle he was travelling in was hit near the Turkish border.
Jabhat Fateh al-Sham is one of the most powerful jihadist rebel groups fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.
It broke from al-Qaeda in late July, changing its name from the Nusra Front.
Al-Masri, whose real name is Ahmed Salama Mabrouk, appeared alongside leaders in the video announcing the change.
Jabhat Fateh al-Sham is considered a terrorist group by the US, as well as by Syria and Russia.
Russia has accused the US of sparing the group and failing to separate it from more moderate rebels.
Last month, a senior Jabhat Fateh al-Sham commander was killed near the Syrian city of Aleppo, rebel sources reported.
