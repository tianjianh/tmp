When I Grow Up, a song from the Grammy-nominated musical Matilda, features Grace Lee in the title role, alongside Filan as Miss Honey.
Grace, who has had 10 procedures to treat her congenital heart disease, said she wanted to help other children.
Hospitals in Dublin and Belfast will benefit from the proceeds.
The single, which Filan said was about "dreams and what you want to be when you grow up", was recorded in one take at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre in Dublin.
Grace, who performs with 200 other children, added: "It was amazing to be asked to play Matilda and help to raise money for charities who help Manx children."
The 10-year-old Alder Hey ambassador, who also has Chronic Lung Disease, added: "I want to use my singing to say thank you to all the people who have helped me."
Grace was chosen after performing the role with the Matilda West End cast thanks to ITV's Surprise Surprise programme.
A spokesman said she "epitomises everything that the song stands for - courage, resilience and, above all else, hope".
The single will raise funds for both the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children and the Children's Medical Research Foundation at Crumlin in Dublin.
A spokesman for the former said they were "delighted" by the project.
Australian musician and comic Tim Minchin, the creator of Matilda the musical, has also given his backing.
