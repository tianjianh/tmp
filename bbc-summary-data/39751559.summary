The youngster was walking home from school in East Kilbride with a friend when they were targeted by the thief at about 16:15 on Thursday.
Police said the man threatened the boy and took his mobile phone after kicking his 13-year-old companion.
Neither of the boys were injured in the incident, they added.
PC Louise Bern said the man responsible was aged between 16 and 19 and had a balaclava covering his face.
She added: "Thankfully neither of the boys, who were on their way home from school, were injured but it was terrifying for them to experience.
"Although the man did not brandish the hammer at the boys, for him even to be carrying it and to threaten the children is shocking."
The incident happened as the boys walked along the underpass at St Lawrence Park, near Falkland Drive.
The man ran off with the phone towards St Lawrence Park.
PC Bern said additional patrols were in the area and appealed for help to trace the man.
She said: "St Lawrence Park and Falkland Drive are residential and officers have been in the area carrying out door to door inquiries as well as checking CCTV, however, we would still like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident.
"It's possible that someone may have seen the suspect hanging about the area or running off."
The suspect was white and between 5ft 5in and 5ft 7in tall. He was wearing the balaclava, a grey Adidas hooded top and dark jogging bottoms.
