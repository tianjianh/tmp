The ceremony, a 255-year-old tradition, sees buns thrown from the roof of the county hall to crowds below to mark royal occasions.
Each of the 4,500 currant buns fired into the crowd on Saturday evening was marked with a 90.
Organised by Abingdon-on-Thames Town Council, the last bun-throw was in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee.
The buns were thrown by council members into the crowds below who tried to catch them.
The Mayor, Councillor Alice Badcock, who started the event of by throwing the first bun, said: "Bun throwing is a major event for Abingdon.
"It does not take place every year and therefore people very much look forward to taking part when there is a royal event to celebrate."
Buns marked with the letters 'C' and 'W' were also thrown in 2011 to celebrate the Royal Wedding.
