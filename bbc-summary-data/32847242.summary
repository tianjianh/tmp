An animal welfare charity has launched an appeal to locate the owner of a dog found wandering on the top of the highest mountain in England.

The black and tan male collie cross was picked up at the summit of Scafell Pike in the Lake District on Saturday by a couple of Scottish holidaymakers.
Concerned about its wellbeing, they took it home and handed it to the Scottish SPCA rescue centre in Glasgow.
The charity now wants to locate the owner of the dog, nicknamed Scafell.
The dog, which had not been microchipped, is believed to be aged between five and eight years old.
Described as "petrified and nervous" when found, it took the couple, from Maybole, South Ayrshire, about half an hour to coax it over to them.
Anna O'Donnell, from the Glasgow centre, said: "At this stage it's all a bit of a mystery but we believe Scafell may have been taken up the mountain by his owner and become lost.
"There is also a chance he was abandoned and made his own way up to the top.
"It would be fantastic if we are able to reunite him with his owner if he has gone missing. If not, we will find him a loving new home in Scotland."
At 978m (3,209ft), Scafell Pike is the highest peak in England.
