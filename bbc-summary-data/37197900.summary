[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood the deal for the 31-year-old could be worth up to Â£5m, depending on add-on clauses.
The Scotland international made 280 appearances for the Bluebirds after arriving from Norwich City on a free transfer in 2009.
He is the first senior player to join the Tigers since they secured promotion back to the Premier League in May.
Cardiff executive director Ken Choo said that the club were "saddened to see him go", but added that "we felt it would be wrong to stand in the way of him moving back to the Premier League."
Marshall could make his Hull debut against Burnley on 10 September.
