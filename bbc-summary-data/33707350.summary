A woman who strangled her Staffordshire Bull Terrier to death with its own lead and taped her muzzle has been jailed for four months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hayley Cowan, 22, was banned from keeping animals for life after burying her dog Beau in a garden in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester.
She admitted causing unnecessary suffering when she appeared at Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court.
The court heard she told people she had "only buried some toys."
Cowan, of Sale Road, Tyldesley, kicked Beau in the face on 14 October 2014, and the next day she strangled the animal using the dog's collar and lead.
She put duct tape around her muzzle and buried her at an address on Lynton Road.
RSPCA inspector Vicki McDonald said that witnesses had taken Beau from Cowan after seeing her kick the dog in the face.
She was returned later that night after Cowan promised the dog would not be harmed.
Insp McDonald said: "The next morning, Cowan called them and said Beau had run off. They searched for Beau, but found no trace.
"A couple of weeks later, Cowan admitted that she had killed Beau and buried her in the garden."
Bruising to Beau's neck and lungs suggested she had been held down, the RSPCA said. She was dug up and a post-mortem examination was carried out.
Insp McDonald added: "It's difficult to imagine what this poor dog went through at the hands of someone she trusted.
"It was a heartbreaking case to investigate and mainly made possible by witnesses coming forward."
