[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steven Fletcher's injury-time penalty gave Sheffield Wednesday victory over Championship strugglers Rotherham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With just seconds remaining Richard Wood was sent off for fouling Lucas Joao in the area and Fletcher slammed home from the spot.
Joao had earlier forced a good save from Millers keeper Lewis Price before Rotherham skipper Lee Frecklington had an effort blocked.
Fletcher headed straight at Price in the final minute before the late drama.
The result was harsh on the Millers, who remain 12 points adrift of safety.
They had the ball in the net in the first half but Tom Adeyemi's effort was ruled out for a foul.
Wednesday improved after the break and looked set to be left ruing Fletcher's missed chance when he headed straight at Price when unmarked.
But his late penalty gave Carlos Carvalhal's men victory and moved them up to sixth in the table.
Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal:
"It was not an easy game; it was a local derby and Rotherham had a lot to play for.
"It has been a long time since we beat Rotherham here. The players had a very good attitude. We broke a wall that Rotherham put up and we don't win a lot of those games so I am very happy.
"We never know in this competition whether it will be easier playing the bottom of the league or the top of the league. Rotherham caused us a lot of problems."
Rotherham caretaker manager Paul Warne:
"It was more a case of the player winning the penalty. Would I be happy if my striker did that in the 93rd minute to win the game? Yes I would.
"But I don't know how that is a sending-off; I am going to speak to him about that. I thought the rules had changed with the double jeopardy.
"For the (disallowed) goal, I've watched it back numerous times and I cannot see where the foul is - I can't even see where it might have been. I will go and speak to the referee and he will tell me something I didn't see.
"To lose at such a late stage is bitter pill to swallow, but I will still go home pretty proud. We couldn't give any more."
