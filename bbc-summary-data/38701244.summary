[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solihull Moors 2-0 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull Moors claimed an impressive 2-0 win at Damson Park that saw Maidstone drop back into the National League relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts hit the front early as George Carline's shot was parried by Lee Worgan and Joel Kettle pounced to net his first goal in professional football.
Carline did get himself on the scoresheet to double the Moors' advantage on the half-hour with a neat header from an Omari Sterling-James corner.
Liam McDonald's men remained in charge in the second period and Sterling-James nearly put the home side 3-0 up when he whipped in a corner that hit a post.
The Stones have managed just two wins in their last 16 games.
