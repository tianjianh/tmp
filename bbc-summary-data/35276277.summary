London Underground drivers are considering three days of strike action in a row over the Night Tube, the BBC understands.

In an internal document seen by the BBC, the train drivers' union Aslef proposes 24-hour strikes on 27 January and 15 and 17 February.
The union's executive committee will meet on Monday to consider the action.
The Night Tube, which was due to begin in September, will see 24-hour services on five lines on Fridays and Saturdays.
In the document, Aslef said it had been left no other choice than to call a strike as, it claims, London Underground had refused to speak with it since their last meeting on 10 November.
London Underground has offered a four-year pay deal to its workers as part of the Night Tube changes and said it will hire part-time drivers to staff an all-night service at weekends.
But unions have been seeking assurances for months about terms and conditions for their members.
The Aslef document said: "We genuinely regret the inconvenience that will be caused but the behaviour of London Underground's senior management team have left us with no other choice.
"We want to see an all-night service introduced and we are not opposed to the recruitment of part-time staff  but we will not accept a zero-hour's culture being introduced and working conditions undermined."
The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has also said it will be considering its own report into the "total breakdown of negotiations" at an internal meeting on Monday.
An RMT spokesman said: "That report will include a number of recommendations for action in support of our members in this dispute."
London Underground is yet to comment, but has started the process of recruiting 180 part-time train drivers.
A 24-hour service on the Jubilee, Victoria, Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines had been due to start at weekends on 12 September.
