Dundee United 2-2 Raith Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Kevin McHattie thunderbolt from 25 yards earned Raith Rovers a point against Dundee United at Tannadice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Willo Flood opened the scoring for the home side with a 20-yard drive and Cammy Smith looked to have given Ray McKinnon's side control when he scored United's second from the penalty spot.
But Jordan Thompson reduced the deficit seven minutes before the break with a rising shot past Cammy Bell.
And McHattie earned Gary Locke's side a point with a glorious strike.
This was McKinnon's first match against his old club since leaving the Kirkcaldy side in May and his players began the game in whirlwind fashion.
Simon Murray and Flood both came close to an opener before the Rovers defence was breached after 17 minutes.
A free kick into the box was nodded away by Jason Thomson but Flood showed great composure as he guided his shot from 20 yards into the bottom corner.
And five minutes later the home side doubled their advantage and again Flood played a major part.
The midfielder was brought down inside the box and Smith dispatched the spot kick beyond Conor Brennan.
Raith had won their opening three league matches but had barely been in the United half and at this stage they looked down and out of the game.
Darren Jackson, first team coach at United under Jackie McNamara but now at Raith, was sent to the stand by referee Craig Thomson much to his dismay.
But Raith suddenly looked energised and a magnificent volley from Thompson pulled one back just before the break.
The goal gave the Kirkcaldy side new impetus and after a constant spell of pressure in the second half they drew level.
A cross into the box was cleared out as far as McHattie, who thundered a shot beyond Bell.
Both sides had half-chances before the end but the crowd of almost 7,500 were thoroughly entertained by both teams who will fancy their chances of promotion.
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "I would have to say that was two points dropped.
"From 2-0 up, to draw the game is disappointing for us. When you are in that position you should certainly win the game.
"We should have just kept the steam up on them. We didn't and a little bit of slackness crept in and it cost us a goal.
"I thought we were absolutely dominant for 30 minutes. The first 10 minutes of the second half was pretty disappointing. We should be battling harder than that then another wonder strike grabs them a point."
Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: "I was disappointed with the first 20 minutes because we looked like a team that didn't believe in ourselves. We gave them too much respect and sat off them.
"We made a tactical change and it got us back into the game. A great strike by Jordan Thompson but for a good hour of the game I thought we were outstanding."
