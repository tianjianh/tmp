England v Australia: Eoin Morgan says hosts have ODI momentum

Eoin Morgan says the momentum is with England as they head into the one-day series finale with Australia on Sunday.

The captain hit a run-a-ball 92 at Headingley on Friday in a three-wicket win that levelled the series at 2-2.
The tourists won the first two matches, at Southampton and Lord's, before England chased down 300 for just the fourth time in their history to back up Tuesday's 93-run win at Old Trafford.
"If momentum does exist I think it is with us," Morgan, 29, said.
"I think we managed to steal a little bit of it in Manchester last time and we are going into Sunday with guys full of confidence."
Morgan hopes England can take that confidence back to Old Trafford, where the series concludes.
"The attitude this group of players show, I think, is outstanding," he added.
"It's certainly not about experience because we're a young side, it's just a 'let's take it on attitude' which is brilliant.
"We've had a little bit of success this summer and hope that continues because I think it will accelerate our learning."
Australia rested left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc in Leeds and may recall him for Sunday's decider.
The world's top-ranked one-day international bowler has had a heavy workload in a summer that saw England win the Ashes 3-2 and the solitary Twenty20 international by five runs.
Fellow quick bowler Pat Cummins is hoping to line up with the 25-year-old once again in Manchester.
"He's still here so I hope he's going to be available for Sunday," said Cummins.
"Obviously it would be pretty handy having the number one bowler in the world back in our side.
"He's not been put on a flight, so hopefully he's playing on Sunday."
Glenn Maxwell took a stunning catch to dismiss England's Liam Plunkett at Headingley, but says he disagrees with the laws regarding boundary catches.
The Australia all-rounder caught the ball, then released it before his momentum took him over the boundary, steadying himself and jumping to take the catch back inside the rope.
Before a law change in 2013, it would have led to a 'not out' verdict, because players had to catch the ball while within the field of play.
"I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense," Maxwell said. "I think you should have to get back into the boundary.
"If you look at the basketball rules you have to jump from inside to throw it back in, you can't jump up in the air and catch it on the way back in.
"You've got to make sure your feet have landed inside the court and I think it should be the same in cricket.
"While we're taking catches on our side it doesn't really bother me, but I know if I was a batsman I'd be pretty upset if that was the dismissal."
