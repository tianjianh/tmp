The 23-year-old can play at right-back, centre-half or in a deep midfield role and had a year to run on his deal at the newly-promoted Championship club.
O'Connor made 24 Burton appearances last season, scoring once.
"His versatility made him very attractive to us," manager Derek McInnes told the club website.
"He has a good defensive edge to his game and he has good experience for someone so young.
"He has a good maturity about his game so I am very pleased we now have him on board. I think he is someone who will prove to be really important to us over a campaign.
"Anthony is good in both boxes and also good in the air. He is another in the squad with a bit of height and presence."
O'Connor began his career at Blackburn and had loan spells at Torquay and Plymouth before joining Burton last summer.
The Dons have not revealed the length of contract O'Connor has signed but he will be eligible to play in next week's Europa League qualifier with Fola Esch of Luxembourg.
