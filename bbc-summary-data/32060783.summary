Northampton Town East Stand work to resume after 'dispute'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The redevelopment of a stand at Northampton Town's ground is to resume following a "contractual dispute".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work on the improved East Stand at Sixfields started in March 2013 but ceased in November.
The club says a new contract has been signed with developers Buckingham Group Contracting, which will return to work "immediately".
Club chairman David Cardoza said: "I am delighted we can draw a line under this matter."
The scheme, part-funded with a Â£12m loan from Northampton Borough Council, includes a directors' box and 10 corporate boxes.
It will increase the ground's capacity from 7,653 to 10,000.
The club previously said "legal matters" prevented it from expanding on the cause of the dispute.
Mr Cardoza said: "We have been in active, constructive dialogue with Buckingham Group for a while, and we are really looking forward to working with them again to help give this club facilities it has never had before.
"We are looking forward to having the new stand open during the early weeks of next season."
Paul Wheeler, chairman of Buckingham Group Contracting, said he was "delighted" the issues had been resolved.
"It is excellent news for the club, the supporters and the local area," he said.
