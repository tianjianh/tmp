The show will feature personal memorabilia and a short film the 83-year-old's life.
He told the BBC: "I'm chuffed, especially to have it in my home town. It will be marvellous. I'm very proud."
One of the most recognisable figures in cricket for decades, he umpired 66 Test matches between 1973 and 1996.
Among the items on show are Bird's umpire bag, his OBE and MBE and a ball from the 1973 England and West Indies test match at Edgbaston.
Councillor Roy Miller, from Barnsley Council, said: "When thinking about cricket you inevitably think about one of the sport's best loved characters, 'Dickie Bird'.
"Dickie has not only achieved great things in his career he has also been a great supporter of the town.
"For this reason there is no better place to host this fascinating exhibition."
The free exhibition runs at Experience Barnsley from 18 February to 14 May.
