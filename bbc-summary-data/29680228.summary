[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers said the suspect visited the victim repeatedly at her home in Wolfe Road, offering to carry out work on her property.
But no work was undertaken at the house.
Police said the man had taken a five-figure sum of cash from the victim.
The suspect is described only as being white and in his 40s.
Sgt David Ferguson said: "This has only just been brought to our attention and sadly a significant sum of money has already been taken from the women.
"Anyone who remembers seeing any suspicious activity around Wolfe Road or who can help us trace the male responsible is asked to contact police immediately.
"The public are reminded never to allow cold callers access to their home or provide them with any cash or goods for services unless entirely certain of their authenticity."
