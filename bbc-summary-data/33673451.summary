The number of women using a Cardiff-based female genital mutilation (FGM) support service has more than trebled in a year, a charity has said.

Charity Bawso received enquiries about FGM from 788 people in Swansea, Newport and Cardiff between April 2014 and March 2015.
It received 249 inquiries the previous year.
A recent report found victims of FGM are likely to be living in every area of England and Wales.
The study, funded by charity Trust for London and the Home Office, concluded that all areas of England and Wales needed services and strategies to meet the needs of FGM victims.
Dr Mwenya Chimba, Violence Against Women Director at Bawso, believes people are becoming more aware of FGM.
She said: "The FGM summit in London last year really raised the profile.
"We have been approached by women where it happened a long time ago and they require support psychologically.
"We are contacted by women  who have undergone FGM themselves and fear if they return home their child would be at risk.
"We also work one-to-one with families when we feel  a child could be at risk. We speak to mothers and fathers to try and raise awareness."
FGM, sometimes called female circumcision, refers to procedures including the partial or total removal of external female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is illegal in the UK.
The NHS says FGM is prevalent in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and is carried out for "cultural, religious and social reasons". It can cause issues including severe pain, infections, pregnancy complications and even death.
