Eight Scots have been named in the British swimming team for this summer's Olympic Games.

Hannah Miley, Camilla Hattersley, Robbie Renwick, Ross Murdoch, Stephen Milne, Dan Wallace, Duncan Scott and Craig Benson will travel to Brazil.
It means that Scottish swimmers make up 31% of the Team GB swim team for Rio.
Wallace, a wildcard pick after falling short of the qualifying standard, Murdoch, Scott, Milne and Hattersley will be making their Olympic debuts.
But, as expected, there is no place for Michael Jamieson, the 27-year-old who won a silver medal in the 200m breaststroke at the 2012 Olympics in London and had moved back to Edinburgh in a bid to make the team.
Renwick and Miley will be competing in their third Olympics.
Miley, who competed in Beijing and London, said: "It's quite hard to put into words what it feels like to be selected for my third Olympics.
"I still love my sport as much as I've always done and to reach my third Olympics just highlights the dedication that me and my family have put into the sport."
"It's another fantastic opportunity to put myself out there against the very best in the world - in the biggest event in the world - and hopefully I can come out on top."
The 26-year-old, from the Garioch club, is hopeful of winning her first Olympic medal.
"I feel a lot more confident, centred and happy this time around," said Miley.
"My previous experiences have been great in Beijing and London, but I feel different heading into Rio and I'm confident that will help me to perform.
"I'm more mature and more experienced and I'll approach this one differently to the previous two."
Murdoch will swim in the 100m breaststroke after failing to qualify for the more favoured 200m event.
"It's bittersweet I didn't qualify in that event I was very close to but I was touched out by my team-mate Craig Benson, who I can say I'm absolutely delighted for," said Murdoch.
This will be Murdoch's first appearance at an Olympic Games - but after winning bronze in the 100m breaststroke at the recent World Championships in Russia he's aiming high in Rio.
"The time that I swam during the trials would be good enough to qualify for every Olympics final in history," he explained.
"As I showed from Kazan all you need is a lane and I was in lane eight and I managed to get myself a bronze medal so at the minute my focus is to get myself through the rounds as easy as possible, get myself into an Olympic final and then anything can happen.
"I'm really, really please to be selected as part of Team GB for this summer. It's a bit of relief for me as I made the consideration time not the outright qualifying time. I was pretty confident I would go, but now I know."
Renwick will also be eyeing a medal having won gold as part of the 4x200m freestyle relay team at the World Championships.
For Stirling University team-mate Benson, it is a second Olympics having been the youngest member of the GB team in 2012.
