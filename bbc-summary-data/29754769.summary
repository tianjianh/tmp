The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (IOMSPC) has announced extra sailings from Liverpool and Northern Ireland during next June's TT races.

The company said it has chartered additional P&O Express sailings to assist with "high demand".
Manannan will operate an extra five return trips from Liverpool and an additional four return sailings from Larne.
Bookings for the additional sailings will open at 08:30 GMT on 3 November.
The IOMSPC will also increase capacity for motorcycles travelling to the island for the road-racing festival by building a mezzanine deck on the Manannan.
Chartered freight vessel MV Arrow will also be in service, freeing up the Ben-my-Chree to accommodate additional vehicles.
Chief executive Mark Woodward said: "There was a marked increase in demand when bookings for the 2015 TT opened in May, with first-day bookings up 41% on the previous year.
"We are delighted that the charter of P&O Express has allowed us to add additional sailings from Northern Ireland and on the popular Liverpool route."
