Leading 6-2 after the opening session, China's Ding defended his advantage in the second and now needs just three frames to progress when play resumes at the Crucible on Monday at 13:00 BST.
Ronnie O'Sullivan is 9-7 behind against Barry Hawkins and John Higgins leads Ricky Walden 10-6.
Both of those second-round matches resume on Monday at 19:00 BST.
Kyren Wilson needs just two more frames to reach the quarter-finals after opening up a 11-5 lead over Mark Allen.
Shanghai Masters champion Wilson took the opening frame on the black and the Englishman made further breaks of 50, 93 and 103 to give him a 7-0 advantage, but Northern Irishman Allen snatched the eighth to avoid a whitewash.
He then made back-to-back centuries to take four frames on the trot closing to 7-5, but Wilson took the next four himself - including the 16th on the black - to move closer to victory.
They play to a finish on Monday from 13:00 BST.
In a repeat of the 2011 semi-final, Englishman and world number five Trump made 85 and 106 as the first four frames with Ding were shared.
At the mid-session interval, Trump - a former world number one - responded to a critical tweet by beaten qualifier Dominic Dale by calling him "clueless" after Dale had said his cue ball control was not as good as his opponent's.
Ding - an 11-time ranking title winner and also a former world number one - took charge from that point, winning the next four frames thanks in part to breaks of 112 and 79 to lead 6-2.
In the second session, qualifier Ding maintained his advantage at 8-4 as Trump showed his concern by shaking his head while sitting in his chair.
With Trump losing focus and missing balls, his opponent capitalised by going 10-5 in front, but Trump took the last to stay in contention.

O'Sullivan looked to have the perfect start in the second session in his match with a break of 68, but lost position and opponent Hawkins nicked the frame on the black.
The five-time world champion recovered to make breaks of 118 and 82, in between Hawkins' composed 74, to remain two frames adrift at 7-5.
Hawkins made 65 in the 13th to extend his advantage, but O'Sullivan hit back with 89 as well as the next. Crucially, though, Hawkins remained in control by taking the last frame.
