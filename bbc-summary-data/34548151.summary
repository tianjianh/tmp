A number of neighbourhood teams have relocated into nearby local community bases with "lower running costs".
The new sites, which are based in the "heart of the community", are "better value for money", the force said.
The buildings up for sale include Market Street and Pilgrim Street in Newcastle, which were replaced by a new Â£38m complex in Forth Bank in 2014.
Other sites include an office in Bentinck Road which has been empty for several years and one in Bellingham, the force said.
A Northumbria Police spokesman said: "Many of the older police buildings have been expensive to run and it's important the force gets value for the money and all savings are reinvested back in to policing."
