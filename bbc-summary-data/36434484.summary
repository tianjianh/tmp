The dead man's name has not been released by police.
On Facebook, Mr Wood said the death had come as "shocking news" and he had removed the video "out of respect for his family".
Mr Wood describes himself on Facebook as a "hunter" who wants to "make a stand" against the grooming of children online.
An Essex Police spokesman said the force was aware of videos "filmed and published by a third party" on social media "purporting to show an encounter between the arrested man and a member of the public".
It declined to comment further.
