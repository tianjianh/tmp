The tree was cut down in Rochford, Essex early on Sunday, on the eve of a festive lights switch on.
District councillor Heather Glynn praised the town's "amazing community spirit" after people responded to a social media appeal to put it back up.
Police said the boy, from Rochford, was due to appear at Southend Youth Court on 17 December.
