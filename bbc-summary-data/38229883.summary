Dyfed Powys Police now doubt if anyone did fall into the water at Cardigan Bridge after a major operation was launched at about 13:15 GMT on Sunday.
RNLI lifeboats, Coastguard teams, specialist firefighters and a search and rescue helicopter helped in the "thorough and methodical search".
Police said they have not received any reports of missing people in the area.
A spokesperson said "nothing suspicious" had been found in the search of the waters between Cardigan Bridge and the mouth of the estuary.
"No further information or evidence has come to light, and we are content that we have exhausted all possibilities in respect of searching the river," said Chief Insp Peter Roderick.
"As such we have therefore stood specialist resources down, these including the marine unit, victim recovery dogs and police divers."
Officers have appealed for information "relating to the sighting of a female or person" on Cardigan Bridge at around 13:00 on Sunday.
