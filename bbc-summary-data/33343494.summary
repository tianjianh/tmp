Rail travellers are facing a second day of disruption amid fears the tracks could buckle under the searing heat.

Speed restrictions have been put on lines in the Thames Valley area by Network Rail to protect track points.
From midday to 20:00 BST there will be no direct trains between London Paddington and Henley-on-Thames or Bourne End.
Passengers travelling to Henley Royal Regatta will have to take slower services to the event via Twyford.
Network rail said additional services were being put on for the regatta, which attracts over 300,000 spectators each year.
The speed restrictions are brought in when the air temperature reaches 30C (86F) as the rails can reach 50C (122F) resulting in a risk of buckling.
Temperatures are set to hit 32C (90F) in parts of the Thames Valley, the Met Office said.
