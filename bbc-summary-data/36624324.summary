Updates on this story and more from Derbyshire
Det Insp Graham Prince, from Derbyshire Police, said many of Maling's assaults had gone unreported and were unknown to Ms Gough's family.
"By pleading not guilty Maling subjected Amy's family to a full trial, where they had to listen to details of what happened to Amy and how she died," he said.
"Amy was a young woman with her life ahead of her. Sadly, Amy's history is similar to many domestic abuse cases we come across where victims suffer in silence."
