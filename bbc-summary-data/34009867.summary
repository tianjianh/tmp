Derek Serpell-Morris, who has played sets at Glastonbury under the name DJ Derek, was reported missing by his family on 23 July.
He was last captured on CCTV leaving the Criterion public house in the city in the early hours of 11 July.
Officers now think he used his bus pass on the number 78 bus which left Bristol for Thornbury at 10:32 BST that day.
Det Ch Insp Matthew Iddon said: "I am appealing directly for anyone who regularly uses the number 78 bus on a Saturday morning from Bristol to Thornbury to have a look at the photo of Derek and see if you recall seeing him."
He added that the search continues "unabated" and officers "are continuing to fully investigate all lines of enquiry".
Previously DJ Derek's great niece, Jennifer Griffiths, said she was losing hope of finding him alive.
He is described as a white male, of average height, of slim build with grey hair. He also wears glasses.
DJ Derek is known to thousands of people and has played hundreds of sets at local clubs and pubs, as well as at the Glastonbury festival.
The former accountant, a resident of St Pauls in Bristol since 1978, has played across the UK and appeared at the Big Chill.
He also released his own compilation album, worked with Massive Attack and appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video.
