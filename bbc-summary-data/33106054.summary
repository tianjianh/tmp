More than 50 arrests have been made for drug-driving in Wales, new figures have revealed.

It follows new legislation introduced on 2 March in England and Wales.
But statistics for the four Welsh forces are varied - with one force arresting 34 people and figures suggesting another force had yet to make any arrests.
The figures were obtained by the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) in a Freedom Of Information request.
North Wales Police topped the figures in Wales, making 34 arrests up until 20 May.
In South Wales, officers arrested eight people while Dyfed-Powys Police made five arrests up until 30 April.
Sgt Matthew Jacob, from South Wales Police's roads policing unit, said drug-driving offences remained a "priority" for the force.
"We will continue to educate motorists and do all we can to target those who break the law on our roads and put the lives of others at risk by drinking or taking drugs and getting behind the wheel of a motor vehicle," he said.
A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman said both drink-driving and drug-driving were taken seriously.
"We will continue to use the new roadside screener now available in our roads policing toolkit, and build on targeting those who would put the lives of others at risk by drinking or taking drugs and getting behind the wheel of a motor vehicle," the spokeswoman added.
According to the figures, Gwent Police had made no arrests during April, but the force said it had arrested 10 people since the new law came into force.
Attempts were made to contact North Wales Police for comment.
