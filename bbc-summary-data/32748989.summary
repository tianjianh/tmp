Steven Gerrard's exit from Liverpool will not be permanent, according to manager Brendan Rodgers.

The captain, 34, will make his final Anfield appearance on Saturday when the Reds host Crystal Palace (17:30 BST).
He is joining LA Galaxy in the USA's Major League Soccer (MLS) this summer.
"He's somebody I'd love to have working with me when he has finished playing. That opportunity for him to come back will be there for as long as I'm here," said Rodgers.
Rodgers said that Gerrard returning to Anfield for a loan spell during the MLS off-season "may be a possibility later down the line" but it had not yet been discussed.
Previously, Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre said a loan move for Gerrard next January was "conceivable".
Gerrard has made more than 700 appearances for Liverpool since his debut in November 1998 and has won the Champions League, Uefa Cup, two FA Cups and three League Cups with his club.
"I asked members of staff if they could describe Steven in one word, what word would that be," added the Reds' manager.
"It's Liverpool. Not just Liverpool as a football club but Liverpool the supporters and Liverpool the city.
"What Steven has given to this city, politicians haven't given to this city. He's a wonderful symbol for the people here and is an icon of the club."
"For me, he is a fantastic player. He has remained loyal to his club for his whole career. You don't see that a lot, especially for that kind of quality player.
"It is also a special day for English football because he was a great player for the national team."
