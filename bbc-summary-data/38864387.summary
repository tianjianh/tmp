[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 1-1 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Elliott scored a dramatic late equaliser before being sent off as AFC Wimbledon held Charlton Athletic to a draw in an ill-tempered derby at Kingsmeadow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wimbledon's pressure finally paid off with almost the last kick of the game when Elliott finished superbly - only to be shown a second yellow card for over-celebrating the goal.
Ricky Holmes' excellent free-kick looked to have been the difference between the two sides as he curled home expertly after Joe Aribo had been fouled.
Aribo almost doubled the Addicks' lead five minutes later but his effort curled just the wrong side of the post.
The hosts finished the half better and goalscorer Holmes was lucky not to see red after a horror tackle on Lyle Taylor was deemed only a caution by referee Carl Boyeson.
Lee Novak spurned a glorious chance to double Charlton's lead just after the break, a miss he was made to pay for as Elliott popped up for his 12th goal of the season in dramatic circumstances, only to be sent off before the final whistle.
