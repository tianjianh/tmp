The National Trust is on a sales mission to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Guangzhou this week.
China's outbound travel is expected to increase by 15% to 114 million trips this year and estimated to reach 20 million trips by 2020.
The aim of the mission is to increase awareness of Ireland as a destination.
Then trust will be meeting 320 Chinese tour operators and travel agents.
Alexandra Mehaffy, National Trust tourism development manager for the Giant's Causeway and north coast, said: "Our Chinese visitors are able to hear the stories and mystery of the Causeway landscape explained to them in Mandarin through an audio-guide and a welcome map is also available in Mandarin.
"They are very impressed by our World Heritage site and the natural beauty of the north coast."
It is the third year that the National Trust has taken part in a sales mission in China.
The Giant's Causeway is Northern Ireland's only World Heritage site. It is made up of 40,000 hexagonal basalt stones.
