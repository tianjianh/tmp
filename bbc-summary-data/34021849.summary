Liverpool 'bombed out church' views sought by council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool residents are being asked for their views to "guide future proposals" for the city's bombed out St Luke's Church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The building, on the corner of Leece Street and Berry Street, was severely damaged in a 1941 air raid.
Liverpool City Council said Â£150,000 of urgent structural repair work will take place shortly, but the site now needed a "longer term vision".
The consultation aims to assess how the public would like to see the site used.
St Luke's Church, owned by the council, was built in 1831 by John Foster and John Foster Jr and continues to stand as a memorial to those killed in the war.
The walls and gates of the church are Grade II listed.
Recently, the site has been used for community and public arts projects managed by local volunteers.
