The event will be held on 24 and 25 July at East Kirkcarswell Farm, Dundrennan, in Dumfries and Galloway.
Singer songwriter Tom Odell has also been lined up to perform at the festival.
It is the first Wickerman since the death of its founder, Jamie Gilroy, from gunshot wounds last December.
Example and DJ Wire will also perform on the main Summerisle Stage.
The festival, which is in its 14th year, will feature a cinema, funfair, circus entertainment, grass sledging, mountain biking and arts and crafts activities.
Every year a huge 40ft Wickerman is set alight in a spectacular finale on the Saturday night.
Grainne Braithwaite, of promoters Synergy Concerts, said: "Both the Waterboys and Tom Odell give amazing live performances and it's this combination of talent and showmanship which we believe will really unite the crowds."
She added: "Our aim this year is to book the best emerging and established artists to make Wickerman the must-attend for music lovers.
"We are really looking forward to announcing a diverse line-up of brilliant acts over the coming months."
