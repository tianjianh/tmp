Officers raided Garlands on 12 February while 200 people were inside. Drugs were found on the premises and it was shut down.
The council had ruled the club could reopen provided it followed new strict conditions, which have been met.
These included new door staff and security and a new drugs policy.
More than 2,500 people had signed an online petition calling for the club to be saved.
Garlands co-owner John Cummings said: "In society today, people use drugs. You have to do your best to stop them taking drugs in your premises.
"I wasn't surprised they found drugs because you'd probably find them in most places. But I'm glad now we have got these new conditions to enable us to try and stop them as much as we can."
Liverpool City Council's licensing committee had allowed the club to reopen, but with certain conditions that included:
The club has changed the security firm, upgraded CCTV provided a drugs amnesty box and introduced ID scans on the door.
UV lights have been installed at the entrance of the unisex toilets, which police had described earlier as a "sweet shop for drugs".
The toilets have also been separated into single-sex toilets.
Christine Banks, chair of the licensing committee said: "Don't come back to the table with any of those conditions broken because we won't be lenient.
"They are there for the protection of the public from harm. We're here to say no not acceptable and your licence could be revoked."
