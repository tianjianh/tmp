The 20-year-old will link up with the Republic of Ireland Under-21 squad for qualifiers against Italy and Slovenia.
It comes after an eye-catching brace for the U's against Barnet on Saturday.
"It's the third time I've gone away after scoring," he told BBC Radio Oxford. "But I'll be fully buzzing when I come back for the run-in."
Oxford-born O'Dowda was named runner-up for the Republic Under-21 player of the year award on Sunday behind Preston midfielder Alan Browne.
And he believes international experience has aided his development as a player.
"I spoke to the manager (Michael Appleton) when I last went and he said it's only going to benefit my game," O'Dowda said.
"Being with a different manager and a different team broadens your experience.
"There's a lot more one-touch passing involved in international football and there's a real structure of play in terms approaching the game."
