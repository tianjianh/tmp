East Park School in Maryhill, which supports children with additional needs, has been given £513,906 to help with a planned £3m campus development.
Glasgow City Council's "Connect 2" project, to help 16 to 19 year olds into employment, education and training has received a grant of £540,800.
St. George's and St. Peter's Community Association will use £540,321 to expand a community help club for the elderly.
Big Lottery Fund Scotland chair, Maureen McGinn, said: "Today's funding will make a huge difference to people of all ages living in and around Glasgow.
"In Maryhill, our investment will help East Park create a first class facility for children who have the most complex additional needs; while over in Easterhouse, it will help bring isolated older people together to enjoy a range of activities.
"I'm also delighted that young school leavers will benefit through intensive one to one support to help lead them on to employment and training opportunities."
