Centuries from Joe Burns and Steve Smith helped Australia dominate New Zealand on day two of the second Test in Christchurch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 57-1 after Brendon McCullum scored the fastest Test century off 54 balls on the opening day, Australia reached 363-4, trailing by seven runs.
Opener Burns made 170 - his third Test century - and captain Smith 138, his 10th hundred in his past 32 innings.
They shared a third-wicket stand of 289 but both fell late on to Neil Wagner.
Australia, who lead 1-0 in the two-match series, need only draw this match to regain the number one Test ranking.
Burns and Smith came together in the fourth over of the day after Usman Khawaja edged Trent Boult to McCullum at first slip to leave Australia 67-2.
Playing his 10th Test, Burns successfully overturned a caught-behind decision off Matt Henry on 35, when replays showed the ball brushed arm rather than glove.
Burns brought up his hundred off 191 balls, and had hit 20 fours by the time he pulled Wagner to Martin Guptill at square-leg seven overs before the close.
Although Smith fell in almost identical fashion in Wagner's next over, having struck 17 fours off 241 balls, the day belonged to Australia.
