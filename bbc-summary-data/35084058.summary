Great Britain rounded off their World League Final campaign with a 5-1 defeat of South Korea in Argentina.

The result means Britain finish seventh in the eight-strong competition after a 2-1 quarter-final loss to New Zealand eliminated them on Thursday.
Nicola White scored twice, with other goals coming from Ellie Watton, Hannah Macleod and Helen Richardson-Walsh.
Britain's women had already secured their place at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the summer.
Before the match, a minute's silence was held for young player Tom Wilson, who died after a freak accident in training in the UK earlier in the week.
Britain had expected to challenge for a medal in Rosario after securing Olympic qualification and then winning European gold - as England - in August.
But although clearly disappointed by their early exit, GB played with freedom and never looked under any real threat from South Korea.
White drove GB into the lead in the first quarter, striking the ball between the keeper's legs following impressive build-up play from Hollie Webb and Watton.
Alex Danson, who won her 250th international cap earlier in the tournament, produced a dazzling dribble before the break to create an open goal for Watton - who doubled GB's advantage.
Danson was instrumental in Britain's third with Macleod's nifty flick guiding the ball over the line early in the third quarter.
White grabbed her second by deflecting captain Kate Richardson-Walsh's penalty corner in the final quarter.
Helen Richardson-Walsh then completed GB's scoring with a penalty stroke before Korea grabbed a consolation.
Germany play New Zealand and Argentina face China in the semi-finals later on Saturday.
Two-goal hero Nicola White told BBC Sport: "We were so disappointed not to win that quarter-final, but we re-grouped really well and were dominant out there which is exactly what we wanted.
"It is important going into next year that we really review what's happened here and hopefully put things right at our next tournament."
Crista Cullen, who made her GB return at the tournament after retiring three years ago, added: "It was important to go out there and show people what we're truly about.
"South Korea are a counter-attacking team so you have to be resilient throughout the 60 minutes and testament to the girls they did that and got the 5-1 scoreline."
