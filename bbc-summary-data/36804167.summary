Officers found the body inside a property in Kenmure Street in Pollokshields at about 09:50 on Thursday.
Police have named the person who lived at the flat as Gordon Bolam.
Detectives from Police Scotland's major investigation team said they were trying to identify the body and to find out when the person died.
Officers are conducting door-to-door inquiries and collecting CCTV footage from the area.
Det Supt Duncan Sloan said: "It is a priority for the investigation team to confirm the identity of the deceased and we are trying to establish the last known movements of the householder Gordon Bolam.
"It is important any sightings of Mr Bolam are reported to police to confirm his wellbeing. The time of the death  is unascertained at present however we believe that the death may have occurred within the last two to three weeks.
"Any information on Mr Bolam's last known movements is essential to this inquiry, and I would ask anyone who knew Mr Bolam, or who remembers seeing him in the last few weeks to come forward to police as a matter of urgency, as they may have details that will assist this investigation."
