The 24-year-old had to have three operations after injuring his ankle during England's 3-2 win over Germany in a friendly last March.
Butland played the full 90 minutes against the Seagulls, who won 2-0.
"Really comfortable being back out there," he tweeted.
"So happy to be back on the pitch again."
Lee Grant has been deputising for Butland in the Stoke first team this season, keeping nine clean sheets in his 29 appearances.
