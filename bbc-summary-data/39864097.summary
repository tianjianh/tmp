Sean Maitland: Saracens winger may miss Scotland's summer tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Maitland has emerged as a doubt for Scotland's summer tour as Saracens head coach Mark McCall has revealed he has suffered ankle ligament damage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The injury puts him out of Saturday's European Champions Cup final against Clermont Auvergne at Murrayfield.
The 28-year-old winger was named as part of Gregor Townsend's first Scotland squad on Monday for matches in Singapore, Australia and Fiji.
"Sean is unfortunately out for the rest of the season," said McCall.
"It may or may not need surgery, but we won't find out for a few days. It's cruel luck for a player who has been in such great form."
Scotland will play a Test against Italy in Singapore on 10 June before facing Australia in Sydney on 17 June and Fiji in Suva on 24 June.
New-Zealand-born Maitland joined Glasgow Warriors in 2012 from Crusaders and qualified to play for Scotland through his Glaswegian grandparents.
He scored on his Scotland debut against England at Twickenham the following year and has gone on to score five tries in 28 international appearances.
