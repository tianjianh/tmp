The Â£80m facility, near Bristol Parkway station, will house the new InterCity Express Trains which will run on the Great Western route later this year.
Hitachi Rail Europe (HRE) said it wanted to recruit people with a "wide range of experiences and backgrounds" ahead of its fleet coming into service.
Four apprentices a year will also be taken on once the site is operational.
The first wave of new trains is being built at HRE's UK train manufacturing facility at Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.
Work carried out at the Stoke Gifford depot will include readying trains for passenger services, inspecting the fleet and servicing it.
Gary Martin, Stoke Gifford depot manager, said as well as building new trains and depots it was also "investing in a new generation of rail workers".
"We want the widest range of talents and skills as we gear up towards the new trains coming into service later this year," he said.
