The 22-year-old was due to be at Pittodrie until the summer and has been an ever present in the first team, keeping 11 clean sheets in 29 matches.
"Naturally we are disappointed Liverpool have opted to recall Danny," said Dons manager Derek McInnes.
"We thank Liverpool for believing Pittodrie would be a good platform for Danny to continue his development."
Ward's final appearance for Aberdeen was in a 1-0 loss to Hearts in the Scottish Cup on Saturday.
He leaves with the club sitting second in the Scottish Premiership.
"His progression has been clear for all to see and he's demonstrated to everyone what a capable keeper he is," added McInnes on the Aberdeen website.

"Everyone at AFC would like to thank him for all his efforts during his time here and wish him all her very best in his future career."
Capped at youth level, Ward has been an unused substitute for Wales in recent months and is hopeful of being in the squad for Euro 2016.
Scott Brown has been providing cover for Ward on the Aberdeen bench this season, while Danny Rogers is out on loan at Falkirk.
