Deplagne, 25, was hurt late in Friday's Ligue 1 game and was substituted.
After the match, he was joined by some of Montpellier's backroom staff to search for the missing tooth but their efforts were in vain.
"Mathieu lost a tooth and we went to look for it, but we couldn't find it," Montpellier boss Frederic Hantz said.
Algeria international Ryad Boudebouz scored twice to give Montpellier a 2-0 lead at half-time.
An own goal by keeper Laurent Pionnier reduced the deficit before Steve Mounie sealed the points for the hosts.
Montpellier moved to 12th in the table, level on points with 10th-placed Marseille, who have won once in five Ligue 1 games.
Marseille's team included winger Florian Thauvin, who is on loan from Newcastle United, and on-loan Tottenham forward Clinton N'Jie.
