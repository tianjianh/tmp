Federico Fazio lashed them into the lead with Dzeko setting up Mohamed Salah's lobbed second.
Former Manchester City striker Dzeko tapped a third into an empty net in the second half to complete the scoring.
Roma are back within six points of leaders Juventus - with the two sides to meet in the capital three weeks from the end of the season.
Elsewhere in Serie A, AC Milan overtook rivals Inter into sixth place with a 4-0 win over struggling Palermo.
Milan led 3-0 at the break, with Gerard Deulofeu, on loan from Everton, scoring the sole goal of the second half.
Inter slipped a position after a surprise 2-1 defeat at Crotone, with Diego Falcinelli scoring twice for the hosts, who have now won two games in a row after losing seven of their previous eight.
On a high-scoring Sunday, Udinese beat Genoa 3-0 and Torino beat Cagliari 3-2. Torino striker Andrea Belotti scored his 24th Serie A goal of the season, keeping him joint top with Dzeko in the golden boot race. Sampdoria and Fiorentina drew 2-2 earlier in the day.
