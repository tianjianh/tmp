Christy George, 38, hit a lorry that crashed into the central reservation between junctions 21a and 22, Leicestershire, in November 2014.
Leicester Crown Court heard that George had deleted a record of mobile phone calls made during her journey.
It was also revealed that she had a previous conviction for reversing into an eight-year-old boy.
Murray Simpson, from London, died in the crash, while another driver - Liese Bowers-Straw - broke her neck in two places.
George, a nurse, who was driving to a Coventry hospital to work a night shift, had denied causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice, but was found guilty of all charges after a trial in June.
During sentencing, Judge Robert Brown said deleting her phone call history had been a deliberate act.
"Before the dust had even settled and the noise had left the air she deleted her call record," he told her.
"You did this trying to divert suspicion away from yourself."
The court heard George's use of her phone involved unlocking and pressing icons to connect her calls, although she claimed she spoke and listened through a hands-free speaker system.
It was revealed that George, of Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, had a previous conviction for careless driving after hitting an eight-year-old boy while reversing from the driveway of her home.
George, who also was not insured because her policy did not cover her journey to work, was banned from driving for 10 years.
