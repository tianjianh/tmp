He was shot a number of times in his house at Glenwood Court, Poleglass.
The attack was reported to police at about 20:15 BST on Thursday and a murder investigation has been launched.
It is understood a second man who was in the house was tied up by the gang. The shooting was the second in the small estate in less than a week.
Last Sunday, another man was shot several times in the leg in a paramilitary-style attack in Glenwood Drive and on Wednesday a man was shot in the leg in Dungiven, County Londonderry.
Neighbours of Mr Reilly rushed over to try to help on Thursday night.
They described the victim as a quiet man who rarely left his home.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann said there were "distressing scenes" as his family members arrived at the police cordon on Thursday night.
She said: "This brutal killing has achieved nothing other than plunging another family into grief and despair.
"This is a good community and there's no support for this."
Speaking to Good Morning Ulster about the murder, SDLP MLA Alex Attwood, said: "A gunman or gunmen turned up at a house and at least two shots were fired.
"The result is that one man is dead. His family are in deep distress and the community is tangibly shocked and shaken."
He said those involved "brutally undermined the rule of law".
Alliance MLA Trevor Lunn said he "totally condemned" the murder.
He said: "This follows another shooting in the same area last week and has now left a family without a loved one through the evil actions of others.
"My deepest condolences go to the family and friends of this man. The local community will be rightly shocked by this murder."
People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said he was "deeply disturbed by this senseless and unjustifiable attack".
Police said they were still trying to establish a motive for the murder and have appealed for witnesses.
