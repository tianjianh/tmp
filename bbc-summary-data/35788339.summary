Arjo Huntleigh: Belfast man admits £1m fraud against medical firm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An east Belfast man has pleaded guilty to carrying out a £1m fraud against a major medical equipment supplies company where his wife was employed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samuel Noel Savage, of Kincora Mews, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on a total of 13 charges.
The 60-year-old admitted making an arrangement with his wife Dolores Savage to acquire and convert criminal property totalling £1,045,030.
The property was allegedly stolen by his wife from the firm Arjo Huntleigh.
Mr Savage denied acquiring criminal property and eight charges of dishonestly retaining wrongful credit in his bank account.
The offences took place between June 2006 and December 2013.
Mrs Savage, 59, also of Kincora Mews, denied entering into an arrangement to acquire criminal property with her husband.
She also pleaded not guilty to obtaining a money transfer by deception and fraud by abuse of her position within Arjo Huntleigh.
A defence solicitor for Mr Savage told the judge that his client's guilty pleas to two changes "represents the totality of his culpability".
He said the charges he denied were "duplicitous to what he has already pleaded guilty to".
A prosecution lawyer said he would need to a time to "take instructions on Mr Savage's not guilty pleas to the remaining charges".
Mrs Savage will stand trial later this year and the case is to be reviewed next month.
The couple were released on continuing bail.
