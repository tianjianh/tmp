Carrickfergus rider Alastair Seeley is set to rejoin his former Tyco BMW team for this year's North West 200.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Hutchinson has already signed to race for Tyco this season and Seeley, 37, is expected to be his team-mate.
Seeley holds the record for number of wins at the North West with 18 and previously won a British Championship with Tyco.
He will ride Gearlink Kawasaki bikes in the supersport races at the North West 200 which takes place from 8-13 May.
The Northern Irishman parted company with the Briggs Construction BMW outfit at the end of last year's British Superbike campaign.
