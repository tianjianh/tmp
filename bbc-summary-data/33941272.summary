Tottenham Hotspur striker Roberto Soldado has apologised to fans for failing to meet expectations after Spurs revealed they have agreed to sell him to Villarreal.

Soldado, 30, moved to Spurs for a club-record Â£26m fee from Valencia in 2013.
But he struggled to make an impact and is now set to return to Spain.
"These two years have been difficult for me but I wouldn't change this experience for anything in the world," Soldado tweeted.
Soldado signed a four-year contract when he joined Tottenham.
But he managed just seven goals in 52 top-flight appearances.
In a farewell message to Spurs fans, Soldado added: "I am sorry for not being able to meet the expectations that Tottenham had put on me.
"Thanks for the elegance and treatment received from all the staff, from my team-mates and the fans.
"They didn't stop cheering and supporting me every second I was on the pitch."
Soldado was born in Valencia but began his career at Real Madrid, scoring 63 goals in 120 league appearances for their B side, Real Madrid Castilla.
Villarreal finished sixth in La Liga last season.
They will compete in the Europa League this season along with Tottenham.
