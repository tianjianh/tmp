[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin McIndoe, 34, was arrested after police targeting an organised crime gang raided a flat and garage in East Kilbride in May last year.
McIndoe admitted being concerned in the supply of both drugs.
His co-accused, 31-year-old Ross McMillan, was jailed for three years after he admitted being concerned in the supply of cocaine.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how both men were caught as part of an investigation by the former Strathclyde Police into the large-scale importation and distribution of cocaine and cannabis.
McIndoe came under surveillance as part of the operation and on 13 April last year was seen  driving from East Kilbride to the car park of the Malletsheugh Inn at Newton Mearns for a drugs handover.
A private hire taxi pulled up beside him and he was seen leaning into the vehicle as he delivered a carrier bag.
The taxi was followed and stopped at Housewoodhill Road, in Glasgow, and almost a kilo of cocaine, with an estimated street value of £40,000, was found.
McIndoe was then seen on 19 May at a block of flats in Gullion Park, East Kilbride.
Another man who drove off from the flats was later stopped by the former Grampian Police force on the A90, near Stonehaven, and found to have cocaine worth about £29,000.
Officers later raided the flat in East Kilbride which had been let to McIndoe, where they found him with a bin bag containing more than three kilos of cocaine, worth about £130,000.
Inside the flat, they discovered two pneumatic presses for compressing cocaine into blocks, along with equipment for cutting the drug.
Almost £7,000 in cash was also found hidden in a cooker hood.
Officers later found 40 kilos of cannabis resin, with a street value of about £327,000, at a lock-up garage McIndoe used nearby.
The 34-year-old, who is currently serving a prison sentence for another drugs offence, admitted being concerned in the supply of the drugs, with the offence aggravated by a connection with serious organised crime.
Jailing him, judge Lord Turnbull told McIndoe: "You have pled guilty to being concerned in the supply of very large quantities of two different forms of controlled drugs."
The judge said he had played "a prominent role", including making arrangements for the pressing and packaging of drugs and having responsibility for delivering valuable amounts to lower-level dealers.
Lord Turnbull told him it was clear a "substantial" prison sentence was required and said he would have been jailed for eight years, but for his guilty pleas.
