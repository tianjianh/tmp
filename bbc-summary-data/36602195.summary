Arthur James Cook was general secretary of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain from 1924 until 1931, which included leading the miners during the 1926 General Strike.
The unveiling of the blue plaque is taking place at Rhondda Heritage Park on Saturday.
The council said it would be "displayed in a prominent place for all to see".
Born in Somerset in 1883, soldier's son Mr Cook spent his childhood growing up in the west country before moving to Porth in the Rhondda Valley aged 18 and later to Merthyr Tydfil to work in the coal mines.
He became involved in politics while working at the Lewis Merthyr Colliery in Trehafod, coming to prominence during the 1910 miners strike.
As well as becoming general secretary, Mr Cook's other roles included becoming secretary of the International Miners' Federation.
He died in 1931, aged 47, after a battle with cancer.
Councillor Joy Rosser, cabinet member for prosperity, wellbeing and communities, said: "Rhondda Cynon Taff has been the home of so many influential people in history and it is fitting that a blue plaque in honour of A J Cook is unveiled at Rhondda Heritage Park, the place where he once worked."
The plaque has been funded by the Association of Friends of Rhondda Heritage Park.
