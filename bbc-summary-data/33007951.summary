SAS selection deaths: Recruit 'tried to save' hopeful

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A recruit tried for two hours to save a colleague who had collapsed in "freaky" warm weather during an SAS selection march, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, of Conwy, died during the Brecon Beacons exercise in 2013, despite resuscitation attempts.
He was found lying on the ground convulsing, the West Midlands hearing was told.
L/Cpl Edward Maher and Cpl James Dunsby died in hospital after collapsing while attempting the same march.
The soldier, known as 1D to protect his identity, said L/Cpl Roberts was lying down and vomiting when he found him before the last course checkpoint.
The reservist pressed his emergency button and shouted his name but there was no response.
L/Cpl Roberts stopped breathing and his colleague began trying to resuscitate him before other recruits, responding to the emergency call, arrived after 20 minutes.
A medic arrived and performed a tracheostomy - a procedure in which a tube is inserted into the windpipe to help someone breathe - and fitted a drip.
Reservist 1D told the hearing the recruits worked for "two hours to get him back", before it was agreed they should stop.
He said: "The weather was just a bit freaky that dayâ€¦ we weren't used to training in those conditions. I don't think fitness had anything to do with it. Craig was a really fit guy."
The hearing has previously been told the exercise took place on one of the hottest days of the year on 13 July 2013, with temperatures expected to hit 27C (80.6F).
The inquest continues.
