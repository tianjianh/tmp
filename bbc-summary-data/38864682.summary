[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 0-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury ended Scunthorpe's 26-game unbeaten home run with a 69th-minute strike from Freddie Ladapo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was the fourth goal in six games for the Crystal Palace loanee, who produced a clinical finish at the near post after an excellent run down the left by Tyler Roberts had created the opening, and stretched Shrewsbury's own unbeaten league run to six games.
After a lacklustre first half, Scunthorpe boss Graham Alexander tried to shake things up with a double substitution, replacing Tom Hopper and Kevin van Veen with Paddy Madden and Ivan Toney.
But Shrewsbury left-back Junior Brown tested goalkeeper Luke Daniels with a good effort, and they eventually opened the scoring through Ladapo.
Scunthorpe finally stirred in the closing stages with a shot from Duane Holmes which was deflected just wide.
But their hopes of rescuing a point disappeared in the closing minutes when a close-range header from substitute Craig Davies was brilliantly kept out by Jayson Leutwiler.
