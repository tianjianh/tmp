Foley's treble and a double by another new recruit, Andy Mitchell, the league's leading scorer last season, ensured that Glenavon have maximum points from their two fixtures.
Josh Carson broke down Cliftonville's resistance to sweep home the opener five minutes after the berak at Ballycastle Road and Jamie McGonigle doubled the Bannsiders' advantage.
John McGuigan nudged Glentoran ahead six minutes into the second period at the Oval, with Curtis Allen shooting home left-footed for his third of the campaign to seal the success for Gary Haveron's men.
After a goal-less first half at Taylor's Avenue, an own goal by former Ballymena defender Denver Gage saw Ballymena go 1-0 up, but Andrew Mooney beat the offside trap and slotted in to ensure that both clubs picked up their first point of the season.
Ben Roy squandered a great opportunity to clinch all three points for Carrick when he fired his penalty wide of the post.
