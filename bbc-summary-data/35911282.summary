The 7kg haul was found in a search at Coolquay in the city on Sunday. Gardaí said it was "a significant blow" to organised crime gangs.
"It will seriously disrupt the illegal sale and supply of cocaine in the Dublin region," a spokesman said.
No arrests have been made and investigations are continuing.
