Guide dog Joey, who mainly flies between London Luton and Paphos in Cyprus, has notched up 35 flights with owner Jan Gibson and her husband Roger.
Mrs Gibson, from Swindon, said: "The crew and passengers often fuss over Joey and take photos as it's not often you get to see a dog on a plane."
Guide and assistance dogs are the only animals allowed on EasyJet flights.
Mrs Gibson, who has had the dog for five years, said: "Joey enjoys flying and will usually sleep at my feet through most of the flight, although he does go for a walk halfway through."
EasyJet group director Peter Duffy said: "With 35 flights under his collar, he must be one of the most travelled dogs in the country and we are really  pleased Joey, Jan and Roger have chosen to fly with us again and again."
