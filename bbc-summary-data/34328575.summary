[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A labour ward in Carmarthenshire "is not fit for purpose", a report into maternity service changes has said.

The report criticised the ward at Glangwili Hospital, Carmarthen, after care for complex births was moved from Withybush Hospital in Pembrokeshire.
However, it said a survey of 500 patients was "overwhelmingly positive".
Hywel Dda health board chief executive Steve Moore said the report gives the opportunity to "assess where we are".
Glangwili labour ward was described as "too small, with insufficient facilities and provides a poor environment for women and staff.
"The increased numbers of women using the unit, including those with high-risk pregnancies from Pembrokeshire, has put additional pressure on the staff with two culturally very different teams learning to work together in cramped and difficult conditions."
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "It [the report] concludes that, despite all the persistent claims to the contrary, the changes are safe, sustainable in the long-term and have led to improved outcomes for mothers and babies.
"There is also better compliance with professional standards and more women are being cared for in the Hywel Dda area than under the previous arrangements.
"These findings will provide reassurance to people in Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire.
"It makes it clear that it would make no clinical sense to return to the previous arrangements."
The interim report, led by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: "The current services are working well and the commitment and willingness of almost all the staff to overcome the challenges of change should be celebrated and encouraged by the board and senior team.
"We found services in general to be safe with improving outcomes and better compliance with professional standards."
The findings will be discussed at a meeting of the health board in Llanelli on Thursday and Mr Moore said he expects "a clear action plan and timescale to be drawn up following this".
A survey of 500 women who used the maternity service after the changes were introduced showed "overwhelmingly positive responses" the report said.
