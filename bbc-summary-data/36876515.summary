[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evans, who faces a retrial over rape allegations in October, has joined the League One side on a one-year deal.
The Wales striker, 27, was sent to prison in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman, but had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in April.
Evans, who has always denied the charges, was released in October 2014 after serving half of a five-year term.
The striker's last professional game was with Sheffield United in 2012.
