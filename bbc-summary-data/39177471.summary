A birthday card which has been passed between a father and daughter for 33 years has gone missing in the post.

Claire Fuller has been exchanging the card with her father after she first sent it to him in 1984.
Stephen Fuller posted the card, which has a picture of a glum yellow duck wearing red wellington boots, in Thame, Oxfordshire, on 10 February.
Ms Fuller, from Winchester, said her 78-year-old father felt "gutted" after it failed to arrive.
The pair started sending the card back and forth after Mr Fuller added a message to it and returned the card to his daughter for her 18th birthday in 1985.
"I sent it back the next year and we just carried on," she said.
"It's very flimsy - we squeeze in message every year - but round the duck it's getting tighter and tighter with the writing getting smaller and smaller.
"We both feel so sad it's gone missing."
An appeal to find the card has currently been liked 2,630 times and had more than 3,980 retweets on Twitter.
A Royal Mail spokesman said: "Every item of mail is important to us. We appreciate the sentimental value of this card and are seeing if we can trace it.
"We would always advise customers sending valuables or cash through the post to use a tracked service."
