[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A century from Australian George Bailey helped Middlesex bat out a draw with Surrey in the Championship at Lord's.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Surrey added 32 runs in four overs in the morning to declare on 266-7, with Ben Foakes ending unbeaten on 65.
Middlesex slumped to 82-5 chasing an unlikely 389 to win, as Zafar Ansari took 4-63 including Nick Compton (22).
But Bailey (110 not out) and James Franklin (70) shared a sixth-wicket partnership of 174 as Middlesex secured the draw on 278-6.
Middlesex are now 13 points clear of second-placed Somerset, who beat Durham inside three days on Saturday.
Surrey's maximum bonus points means they take a healthy 13 points from the game and are now 23 clear of the relegation places, although they have played a game more than Nottinghamshire and Hampshire.
Middlesex lost half their wickets with only 82 on the board and looked in real trouble.
Compton, playing his first Championship game since being omitted from England's Test team in June, spent nearly an hour and a half at the crease before being stumped by Foakes off Ansari.
Bailey hit 20 fours in his 199-ball unbeaten knock to complete his first century for Middlesex and ensure a 13-point lead at the top.
