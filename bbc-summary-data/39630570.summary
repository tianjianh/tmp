Derby serial sex attacker Ilija High pleads guilty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A serial sex attacker has pleaded guilty to assaulting three women, one of whom he raped three times.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ilija High attacked two of the women on a secluded footpath in Spondon, Derby, and the other near a nature reserve in the city's Darley Abbey.
He was caught following a high-profile appeal, which saw thousands of leaflets handed out. One of the attacks was also featured on the BBC's Crimewatch.
The 23-year-old from Chaddesden was told to expect a significant jail term.
At Derby Crown Court, High admitted three counts of rape, three attempted rapes and assault by penetration.
More on this and other stories from across the East Midlands
In the first attack, on 27 September 2014, he tried to rape a teenage girl on a footpath between West Park Road and Acorn Way in Spondon.
A year later, on 7 September, he raped a woman three times and tried to rape her a fourth time in Darley Abbey.
And on 22 December that year, he returned to the same area of Spondon, where he tried to rape another woman.
After High admitted the charges, Judge Robert Egbuna called for a psychiatric report and warned him to expect a "significant" sentence.
He was remanded in custody to appear at Derby Crown Court in June.
