Conygar wants to develop land at Cross Hands West which was previously earmarked for a Sainsbury's store.
The scheme is made up of 10 units, including a food store, a variety of shops, a pub and restaurant.
The application was recommended for approval, but a decision was delayed due to a late legal challenge on a nearby application.
Conygar said its development would create the equivalent of 260 full-time jobs and more than 100 jobs during the construction phase. It had hoped to start construction this year.
A separate planning application from Leekes was also deferred at Thursday's meeting.
The department store wanted permission to build a retail unit on the site of a nearby overflow car park, but Conygar challenged a report prepared for Leekes on alternative sites for development.
Carmarthenshire council's head of planning, Llinos Quelch, said the challenge required "further assessment" as it was based on "recent case law".
