Ms O'Neill said she had asked Ms Truss to press the EU for an "increase in its intervention threshold".
It follows farmers' protests over the milk price slump.
"We had a frank and constructive discussion with Liz Truss today," Ms O'Neill said.
"It was very important for her to understand the difficulties facing farmers in the north.
"Farm gate milk prices are now below the cost of production and I asked the Secretary of State to support me in pressing for more effective EU support.
"This cannot be solved at local level. It needs concerted action. That is why we are working with the banks and representatives of the dairy and retail sectors."
Ms O'Neill said Ms Truss had acknowledged that there was a "unique and extreme set of circumstances facing dairy farmers" in Northern Ireland.
"She said that she was committed to taking action and I will meet her again next week - along with Scottish and Welsh ministers - to continue to press her to take that action," Ms O'Neill added.
"There was also recognition at the meeting that volatility of prices affected other sectors too."
Ms O'Neill said she had also raised the issue of prices and the need for proper EU support with EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan.
She said she planned to attend the EU ministers of agriculture meeting in Brussels on 7 September to "press for a review of the current intervention price, which was last reviewed in 2008".
"Today, I asked the Secretary of State to support me with ensuring that this vital safety net for our farmers is set at a realistic level," she added.
Ms O'Neill was joined at the meeting in London on Tuesday  by Ulster Farmers Union president Ian Marshall and Northern Ireland Director of Dairy UK, Mike Johnston.
