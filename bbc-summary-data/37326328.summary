[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 0-1 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Miller was once again the difference for Dover as they beat York City at Bootham Crescent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Miller gave the Whites a deserved lead in the 24th minute, beating the offside trap to fire low and hard across goal past Kyle Letheren - his seventh strike of the season.
The striker was a threat throughout but York were able to restrict him to shots from distance as time went on.
The hosts pushed forward in the second half with Jack Higgins and Matty Dixon going close.
York could have equalised in stoppage time but Steve Arnold blocked Kaine Felix's effort from point-blank range.
