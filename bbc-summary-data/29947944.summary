Flooding hit parts of south west and mid Wales following heavy rain overnight into Friday morning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 20 properties in Cardigan, Ceredigion, have been affected by "significant flooding" with a hotel hit for the second time this year.
Eleven flood alerts include north, west and south Pembrokeshire and Lower Teifi and the Western Cleddau.
The Met Office has issued a "be aware" warning as more heavy rain is expected across Wales on Saturday morning.
In Cardigan, St Mary Street was reported to be knee-deep in flood water in places.
The Angel Hotel which was hit for the second time this year. Heavy rain sent surface water pouring through the hotel's ground floor from front to back.
The hotel had only recently been repaired after flooding at the start of this year.
Fire crews began pumping water out of properties after the alert was raised at 08:00 GMT but no property was evacuated.
Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service had crews from Cardigan, Crymych, Fishguard, Newcastle Emlyn and Llandysul dealing with the incident.
Ceredigion council said the county's flood plan has been put into operation and St Mary's church hall in Cardigan had been opened to residents.
It said: "The rainfall experienced in the south of the county this morning was exceptional with rainfall intensities of 32mm per hour reported by the Met Office.
"The highway surface water systems are designed to accommodate expected rainfall intensities but perhaps not the very exceptional rainfall circumstances as experienced earlier today."
Pembrokeshire council said it took more than 100 flood-related calls, with the north and north east of the county the worst affected, particularly St Dogmaels, Newport and Dinas.
Fire crews were called to pump out water at five of the properties in Dinas, Solva and St Dogmaels.
Natural Resources Wales had issued a flood warning for Solva but this has since been stood down.
In a statement, Pembrokeshire council said: "Roads were reported flooded up to knee high in several places, and there were road closures at St Dogmaels and Devonshire Drive, near Tenby.
"Many of the road flooding issues have been caused by debris dislodged in the heavy rain causing culverts to block.
"Other problems have been caused by vehicles driving through deep water, causing 'bow waves' to wash into and flood properties.
"Several of the flooded roads have had drain covers dislodged."
Surface water was reported on The Square at Fishguard, between West Street and High Street.
Flooding and poor driving conditions were reported between Fishguard and Eglwyswrw as well as elsewhere on the A487 at Newgale and Roch.
Dyfed-Powys Police said there were many other reports of flooding in Ceredigion, and conditions on the A487 were "particularly bad".
There is a Met Office yellow alert for rain across most of south Wales for Saturday and in the meantime there are likely to be isolated heavy showers.
