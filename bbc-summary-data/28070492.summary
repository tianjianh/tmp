Banks Renewables withdraws Killington wind farm plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals for a three-turbine wind farm in Cumbria have been withdrawn ahead of a planned public inquiry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plans for the 430ft (132m) turbines at Killington, near Kendal, were approved by South Lakeland District Council earlier this year.
But the application was called in by the government and a public inquiry was scheduled for September.
Developers Banks Renewables said the likely costs of the inquiry meant it had no choice but to scrap the plans.
