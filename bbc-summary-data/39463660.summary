[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 3-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kal Naismith was on target again to help Portsmouth move eight points clear of fourth-placed Luton as they beat Yeovil 3-1 at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The away side almost took the lead in the fourth minute but Tom Eaves could not direct his free header on target.
However, Yeovil were punished for the missed opportunity 10 minutes later when defender Bevis Mugabi caught Pompey's Gary Roberts in the area to concede a penalty.
Gareth Evans confidently stepped up to tuck the spot-kick into the bottom corner, sending goalkeeper Artur Krysiak the wrong way.
But Yeovil drew level six minutes after the interval when Francois Zoko looped his effort over the head of goalkeeper David Forde.
Naismith restored Pompey's lead in the 68th minute as he drilled an effort past Krysiak to take his tally to 11 goals in all competitions this season.
Substitute Jamal Lowe added a third two minutes after coming on to open his Portsmouth account and edge them closer towards League One.
