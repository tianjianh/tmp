Interserve cleaning contract in Leicester ends early

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A private firm's contract to run cleaning, catering and maintenance for the NHS has been ended early.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Interserve won a seven-year Â£300m contract to manage NHS buildings in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.
The company was issued a formal warning last year after a row over cleanliness at the city's three hospitals.
In a joint statement, the firm and the NHS said the contract is "no longer appropriate" and will end three years early.
The agreement saw Interserve take on more than 2,000 staff and 550 buildings for NHS Leicestershire County and Rutland, which runs mental health services, and the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.
But last year hospital bosses ordered the firm to stop combining cleaning and catering duties following reports of blood stains in the corridors and bins not being emptied.
A joint statement issued by the trusts and Interserve said: "The original contracts were designed over five years ago and though they have delivered the intended savings it has become apparent that the contracts are no longer appropriate to the needs of the Trusts today."
It adds that the contract will end on April 30 and staff will be transferred back to the NHS shortly after.
Cleaning and catering will be carried out "in-house" although the firm will continue to work with the trusts on construction, including the new emergency department in Leicester.
