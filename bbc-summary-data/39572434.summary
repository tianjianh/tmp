Dortmund's chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke said: "There has been an attack with explosives on the team bus.
"The whole team is in a state of shock - you can't get pictures like that out of your head."
Windows were broken on the bus, which was six miles from the stadium at the time of the incident at around 18:00 BST, and former Barcelona centre-back Bartra was sent to hospital.
Police said the cause of the explosions, at Hochsten outside the city, was unclear, but added there had been no evidence of any threat to supporters.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy tweeted his support, wishing Bartra a quick recovery, as did his former club.
The night's other quarter-final between Juventus and Barcelona kicked off as scheduled.
Dortmund president Reinhard Rauball added: "Of course this is an extremely difficult situation for the players.
"But they are professionals, and I am convinced that they will put that away and will bring their performance on Wednesday."
