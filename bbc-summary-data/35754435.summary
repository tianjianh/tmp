County cricket: ECB changes to schedule for 2017 'clear and strong'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From 2017, the English summer cricket schedule is to change again.

Less County Championship cricket, a change of numbers in the two-division structure, a more attractive school summer holidays time slot for the T20 Blast and a Lord's one-day knockout final in July are the key outcomes.
The aim is to ensure that cricket retains its popularity beyond the time when the current ageing generation which watches Championship cricket has gone - by making it more attractive to the supporters of the future.
BBC Sport's county cricket expert Kevin Howells
"As someone who earns a lot of his living watching Championship cricket, it's expected that I would fight tooth and nail for it to remain totally unchanged. I can't do that, no matter how much good people feel angry about the reduction in games.
"The reason is simple. There is too much cricket being played and, despite the best efforts to develop a more user friendly 'appointment to view' schedule, we have still been left with too many competitions all mixed up. It has felt a mess.
"The new schedule is clear and strong. Of course, for every positive, one can argue a negative. I could list things I personally would change, such as unequal games between teams in Division Two. But that misses the point of what's trying to be achieved. Over the season, the best teams will be crowned champions of their respective leagues.
"One small reservation would be to what extent the Championship might have a stop-start feel to it? There will be a decent start in April and then generally two major blocks mid-season and most importantly at the end of the summer. Until we are in that season, I reserve judgment.
"My suspicion is that the T20 schedule is county cricket's last chance to prove it can work before a city franchise is given a green light. The authorities have done what they can and are to play it when families have free time in the summer holidays but the weather remains the biggest player in its future.
"Finally, the One-Day Cup should receive much-needed profile. I'm really looking forward to a Lord's final in July, where it belongs."
ECB director of cricket Andrew Strauss, a member of the eight-strong group that devised the changes, said: "Last year a county player could change between formats as many as 24 times over the summer. Next year, that could be down to as few as six.
"This will help develop skill levels and create a better narrative to the summer. An improved structure gives us a better chance to develop our players and encourage more people to play. A successful England team helps to attract new followers."
Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes the T20 Blast should be seen on terrestrial television and not shown exclusively on Sky, as is currently the arrangement.
"I really do believe that it needs to be seen by more," he told BBC Sport. "Whether it's mixed in with a pay-per-view, that's probably the way that it could go to structure it better. I just think more people need to see it."
In Short: County cricket needs a new tournament - Vaughan
