The chief executive of a hospital criticised by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) for its "bullying culture" is to step down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anna Dugdale had held the post at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for six years.
In a statement, she said she took full responsibility for serious criticisms raised by the CQC and has tendered her resignation.
Its report raised particular concerns about the hospital's leadership.
It said there was a disconnection between staff and the leadership team and "serious concerns" were raised over board effectiveness and a bullying culture within the management.
Earlier this month, Ms Dugdale said the NHS staff survey results put the hospital in the bottom 20% nationally for bullying and harassment.
In a statement announcing her decision, Ms Dugdale said the last year had been "one of the most challenging" but as chief executive she had to "take responsibility" for the problems.
She praised a "fantastic" team of staff, saying it was a "truly great hospital".
Chairman John Fry said she had played a "huge role" in developing the hospital and owed her an "enormous debt".
A Unison spokesman said staff would likely have "mixed feelings", but "accumulating pressures" had made life "particularly difficult" during the past two years.
Following the resignation, a whistleblower told the BBC that Ms Dugdale was the "invisible chief executive".
"She forgot the most important aspect of her job - and that was to communicate to the most valuable resource in the hospital, and that was the staff," they said.
"The only communication was by email."
