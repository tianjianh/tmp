The 42-year-old Manchester United legend left his role as assistant boss at Old Trafford in July after a 29-year association with the club.
The Football Association of Wales (FAW) has rejected an approach by Hull to speak to their manager Chris Coleman.
Asked if he was interested in the Wales job, Giggs replied: "No. Chris Coleman is doing a fantastic job."
Former Fulham and Coventry boss Coleman's stock is high after he guided Wales to the semi-final of Euro 2016.
Reports on Sunday claimed Hull were prepared to make an improved offer to Coleman, and that Giggs was a likely replacement if he was to leave.
But the FAW reiterated their position that Coleman was remaining to guide Wales in World Cup 2018 qualifying.
Speaking on BBC Five Live Sport, Giggs - who made 64 appearances for Wales - refused to get involved in speculation.
"They've [Wales] got a fantastic team, but like I say Cookie's [Coleman] the manager so until something happens I can't answer the question," he said.
"It was a brilliant summer and I was over in France to witness it. For a country like Wales who hadn't been involved in major championships for so long to get to that stage of the Euros was unbelievable.
"But at the moment Cookie is the manager and is doing a fantastic job."
Giggs says he is in no hurry to get back into football after leaving Manchester United following the appointment of Jose Mourinho as manager.
He made a record 963 appearances for United and spent two years as assistant to Louis van Gaal after retiring as a player.
Cardiff-born Giggs has his Uefa Pro Licence, a mandatory qualification for managing in the Premier League.
"Ultimately I want to be a coach, I want to be a manager. I want to have my own team," he said.
"I've had a tremendous education. I had a great two years working under Louis (van Gaal) - a fantastic experience for me as a young coach to see someone like that up close first hand - seeing how he works.
"And of course I've got my own ideas, I've got my own thoughts on how the game should be played but I'm in no rush.
"I'm enjoying life at the moment, how long that will last I don't know if I miss it.
"I don't miss it at the moment but ultimately I want to get back in the game as a manager."
