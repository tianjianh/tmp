Hull's K6 telephone boxes return to streets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Several historic cream-coloured telephone boxes are being put back on Hull's streets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eight of the so-called "K6" boxes will replace modern ones following a Â£25m revamp of Hull city centre for the City of Culture arts festival.
The cast-iron kiosk was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott to mark the Silver Jubilee of King George V in 1935.
Unlike the red ones elsewhere, Hull's boxes are cream coloured as the local phone company is independent from BT.

Adam Fowler, from the City of Hull and Humber Environment Forum, said he welcomed the return of the K6.
"Cream telephone boxes are instantly recognisable as uniquely Hull," he said.
"They are a proud symbol of the city and an expression of our culture."
Mr Fowler added that a number of the existing K6 boxes in Hull are Grade II-listed "as buildings of national architectural and historic importance".
Cathy Phillips, from phone operator KCOM said the company was asked by Hull City Council to reinstate the "iconic" kiosks.
