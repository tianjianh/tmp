Six Nations 2013: Italy make three changes for Ireland clash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Italy coach Jacques Brunel has made three changes from the side narrowly beaten by England for Saturday's final Six Nations clash against Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Veteran prop Martin Castrogiovanni is forced out with a thigh injury and is replaced by Leonardo Cittadini.
Simone Favaro is drafted in at open-side flanker for Robert Barbieri while Andrea Lo Cicero replaces Alberto De Marchi at loose-head prop.
De Marchi is the only player from those changes named in the replacements.
The Italy backline remains unchanged from the 18-11 defeat at Twickenham.
Italy, who stunned France in Rome on their opening Six Nations match this  year, sit second from bottom of the table with two points, one more than Les Bleus.
However, after their stirring display against Grand Slam chasing England, the Italians will fancy their chances of achieving a first ever Six Nations win over Ireland.
The Irish have won all 13 previous Six Nations clashes between the two countries.
Andrea Masi; Giovanbattista Venditti, Gonzalo Canale, Gonzalo Garcia, Luke McLean; Luciano Orquera, Edoardo Gori; Sergio Parisse (capt), Simone Favaro, Alessandro Zanni; Joshua Furno, Quintin Geldenhuys; Leonardo Cittadini, Leonardo Ghiraldini, Andrea Lo Cicero
Replacements: Davide Giazzon, Michele Rizzo, Alberto De Marchi, Antonio Pavanello, Francesco Minto, Paul Derbyshire, Tobias Botes, Tommaso Benvenuti
