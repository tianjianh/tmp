Weeden trailed Dudgeon by nine seconds entering the final lap but took the lead at the Bungalow and held on to win by just 0.674 seconds after 151 miles.
The 22-year-old from Kent said: "I'm lost for words. I am so happy to win."
Joe Akroyd completed the podium finishing 32.491 seconds down on Manx racer Dudgeon.
Dudgeon, who won Wednesday's Junior race, held a slender 1.088 second advantage over Weeden after the first lap of the Mountain Course.
He steadily built his lead to 7.886 seconds at the halfway pit-stop where Michael Evans and Jamie Hodson both retired.
The Ramsey racer continued to build a gap over Weeden and started the final lap with a nine-second buffer.
Weeden, from Kent, then produced a flying final lap of 121.062mph to take the lead which he held to the chequered flag.
The winner added: "I want to thank so may people - especially my dad. I hope I have made him proud."
Dudgeon said: "I gave it everything. I hit a bird with my arm at 160mph on the final lap."
Richard Wilson, Mike Moulai and Royce Rowe completed the top six places.
