South Yorkshire Police names second interim boss in week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Yorkshire Police has appointed its second interim chief in the wake of the Hillsborough inquests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Yorkshire Chief Constable Dave Jones steps in following David Crompton's suspension after the jury concluded the 96 victims were unlawfully killed.
Mr Crompton's initial replacement, deputy Dawn Copley, stood down after her appointment was criticised.
Mrs Copley had been investigated over her conduct with another force.
As agreed with North Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Julia Mulligan, Mr Jones will remain in post until a permanent appointment is made, Ms Mulligan's South Yorkshire counterpart Dr Alan Billings said.
"I am confident that he will be able to move the force forward to a position where trust and confidence in the force can begin to be restored," said Dr Billings.
David Crompton, who was due to retire in November after four years in the post, was suspended after what Dr Billings described as "an erosion of trust and confidence in South Yorkshire Police".
Mr Crompton and the force have faced continuing criticism not only in relations to Hillsborough but also over its handling of investigations into child sexual exploitation.
Mr Jones began his career in Greater Manchester and was Assistant Chief Constable for Police Service Northern Ireland until moving to North Yorkshire in 2013.
He said he realised he was taking the post at a very difficult period and said he wanted to make a difference.
"First and foremost, I will engage with those communities both inside and outside of South Yorkshire who have been let down by the police service," Mr Jones said.
"I want to understand how their confidence in policing has been affected, and work with them to build it back up and restore pride back into the police service."
He added he would be seeking support for a full review of South Yorkshire Police.
The Deputy Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Tim Madgwick, has been named as the temporary chief of that force.
