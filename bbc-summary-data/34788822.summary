[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Man law chief fails to sue Lieutenant Governor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Attorney General has failed in his bid to sue the Lieutenant Governor Adam Wood over disciplinary proceedings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Harding was suspended three years ago over allegations of perjury and acts against public justice pending an internal probe by the Crown.
The 54-year-old, who was acquitted of all charges in 2014, lodged a legal bid to "prohibit disciplinary proceedings".
But a court said it was "unjustifiable" to interfere in a process which was in the public interest.
Mr Harding had claimed that the investigation would be a breach of his contract and the delays getting started were "unfair" and "against natural justice".
But Deemster Murray Rosen said Mr Harding had himself contributed to the delays.
"By waiting until the final hour before issuing his present claim he has caused otherwise avoidable cost and delay," continued the Deemster.
Mr Harding, who was suspended on full pay of about Â£160,00 a year, brought proceedings against the Crown- hence Mr Wood- who is currently the Queen's representative on the Isle of Man.
A doctor's report, read out in Douglas Court House, said that prolonged stress over the past four years had caused Mr Harding to become "severely depressed"- an illness which left him "physically and mentally fatigued".
The court heard that disciplinary proceedings against Mr Harding are now expected to resume with a preliminary hearing in late November.
