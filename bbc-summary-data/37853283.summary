Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho said it was a "human and professional decision" to allow midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger to rejoin first-team training this week.

The former Germany captain, 32, has trained alone or with the under-23 side since Mourinho took charge this summer.
Schweinsteiger last played for United in March, under Mourinho's predecessor Louis van Gaal.
"Schweinsteiger is back," said Mourinho.
The Portuguese, whose side face Fenerbahce in the Europa League on Thursday, suggested fewer players taking part in training influenced his decision.
He said Schweinsteiger may play for United again despite recent reports suggesting he will leave in the January transfer window.
"If he stays with us he becomes one more option," said Mourinho. "In this moment we have no problems in midfield like we do in defence."
Schweinsteiger, a 2014 World Cup winner, was named in United's Premier League squad for this season, but left out of their Europa League squad.
He has made 31 appearances for the club since his Â£14.4m move from Bayern Munich in July 2015.
