The event is now in its 27th year and organisers have predicted the display will be the biggest yet.
There was an opening ceremony on Friday evening with an aerial display, fireworks and live music.
Weather permitting, attractions over the weekend will include the Red Arrow Display team, parachutists, and a Battle of Britain memorial flight.
Sunderland City Council said that last year the airshow drew an estimated one million visitors over its three days.
