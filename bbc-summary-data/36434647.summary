Wadge sang from a platform 262ft (80m) up the original Severn crossing at dawn on Friday.
She was accompanied by a massed choir including Only Men Aloud situated on the English bank of the river.
As well as BBC Music Day, it is also the 50th anniversary of the bridge being built, which the song - called The Bridge - celebrates.
Wadge's songwriting partnership with Ed Sheeran saw her collect a prestigious Grammy Award in February for the track Thinking Out Loud.
She lives in Pontypridd but is from Bristol and said her heritage was crucial in writing a new song to celebrate the bridge.
"It's quite a big thing for me because I live in Wales and I'm from Bristol, and that whole connection of the two places seems to be quite a huge thing to be writing a song about," she said.
"Anything that celebrates music and the coming together of loads of different voices, then I am always going to want to be a part of it because it's my job and I love my job.
"So hopefully people will get in to the spirit of what we are trying to do."
Radio Wales editor Steve Austins said: "BBC Music Day is all about collaboration and working together and the bridge symbolises that spirit.
"As someone who has her heart in both Wales and England this is a project close to Amy's heart and Only Men Aloud, Renewal and Gospel Generation are looking forward to bringing her words to life."
BBC Music Day will also be marked with a special send-off for the Wales football team, as the BBC National Orchestra of Wales hosts a sing-a-long of football anthems and songs made famous by the fans.
Songs including Salt 'n' Pepa's 'Push It' and 90s dance hit 'Kernkraft 400' by Zombie Nation have been adapted for the orchestra, which will be joined by BBC football commentator Rob Phillips and will be broadcast on BBC Radio Wales on Friday 3 June, and on BBC Two Wales on 8 June.
