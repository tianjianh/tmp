The Dutchman, who joined United as a 16-year-old, has made 12 league appearances for his parent club.
The 19-year-old, who has also played in midfield, signed a new contract at Old Trafford in October that runs to 2020.
"I still have a lot to learn and therefore getting the opportunity to play more games on a regular basis will help my development," said Fosu-Mensah.
He was previously a youth player at Ajax under new Palace boss Frank de Boer, who said he intends to play his compatriot as a right centre-back or full-back.
Palace have already signed Chelsea and England Under-21 midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek on loan until the end of the season.
