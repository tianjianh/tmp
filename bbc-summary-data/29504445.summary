Shove off! Football's top five touchline spats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They are two of football's most successful managers, but that didn't stop Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger scrapping on the touchline at the weekend.

They had to be separated after the Arsenal boss shoved Mourinho in the technical area on Sunday.
Tensions between the pair have been simmering for a while.
The Chelsea manager previously called Wenger "a specialist in failure" and a "voyeur".
However, seeing the two men re-enacting a schoolyard scrap got us reminiscing about the top five touchline dramas.
Here's our countdown (note: certain names feature quite heavily):
Oh, look who it is. Our favourite French manager and he doesn't just have a problem with Mourinho.
His long-term feud with Mark Hughes has been very well documented over the years.
The highlight though has to be when Manchester City beat Arsenal 3-0 in the Carling Cup quarter-final in 2009.
The two managers were at loggerheads on the touchline throughout the game, with Wenger accusing Hughes of leaving his technical area.
(Yes, that technical area again - it gets a lot of action.)
A victorious Hughes offered his hand to Wenger at the final whistle, but he refused it.
When it was later put to Wenger that a handshake was "professional courtesy", Wenger replied: "I have no professional courtesy."
Oh, look who it is. Our favourite Portuguese manager and he doesn't just have a problem with Wenger.
One day in October 2011, a match between Real and Barcelona really kicked-off.
As players scrapped on the field, their bosses, who really should have been setting a better example, decided to get in on the action when Mourinho poked Barca's new coach Tito Vilanova in the eye. Yes, really.
Mourinho was suspended for two games, while Tito was banned for one match for gently shoving Mourinho back.
The then Real manager issued a letter apologising for his behaviour, but in true Mourinho fashion only addressed it to Madrid supporters.
Remember when Alan Pardew got into trouble on the touchline? No, not with David Meyler (that's a clue for later on), but back in 2006 when he was in charge of West Ham.
His side were playing Arsenal and manager Wenger seemed to take offence when Pardew enthusiastically celebrated a goal which meant his side clinched a last minute 1-0 victory.
Wenger pushed Pardew and (once again) refused to shake hands with a manager at the end of the match.
Pardew later admitted he may have been a little antagonising but we're guessing that was not much comfort for Wenger, who was fined Â£10,000 by the FA.
Now it's hard to believe but at number two we have a squabble that doesn't involve Wenger or Mourinho. Step forward Celtic boss Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist, Rangers' then assistant manager.
The men went to shake hands following Celtic's fiery 1-0 Scottish Cup win, where three Rangers players were sent off.
But Lennon reacted angrily to a comment by McCoist and things took a turn for the worse.
It's not known what was said but McCoist later denied he challenged Lennon to a fight.
Sorry Wenger and Mourinho, this is one competition you won't win.
The top touchline tiff is the moment Newcastle manager Alan Pardew headbutted Hull City midfielder David Meyler.
Newcastle went on to win 4-1 but all eyes were on Pardew as he was shown a red card.
After the match Pardew said (with a straight face) that he had not "had too many problems" while on Tyneside.
Well, if memory serves us correctly he did abuse Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini and then there was that two-match touchline ban for pushing an assistant referee in 2012.
But let's stay focused on the matter in hand.
For the headbutting Pardew was given a record breaking seven-match suspension, banished to the stands for weeks and fined Â£100,000.
