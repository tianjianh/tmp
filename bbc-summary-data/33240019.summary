[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Spooner, 59, from Girvan, South Ayrshire, raped the 61-year-old woman at a house in the town in January 2014.
The High Court in Glasgow heard the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, repeatedly told Spooner to stop but he ignored her.
Judge Johanna Johnston QC also placed Spooner on the sex offenders' register.
The judge told him: "Rape is one of the most serious offences to come before the courts.
"This was a cowardly and extremely nasty attack on this woman. She is extremely traumatised by it."
