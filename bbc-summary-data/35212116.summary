Ben Whitfield set up Luke Maxwell to put Harriers ahead after three minutes before scorer turned provider, teeing up Harry White to double their lead.
Harriers old boy James Constable then scored twice in eight minutes, poking into the bottom corner before levelling from Luke Coulson's delivery.
But Arthur Gnahoua put Harriers back in front with a fine solo effort.
Harriers' second victory in four days lifts Colin Gordon's side above Torquay United on goal difference, but they are still 10 points from safety in the National League table.
Harriers boss Colin Gordon told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"Nobody can doubt our spirit. Look at the honesty and the endeavour. The back four were throwing their bodies on the line for the team.
"We were playing against a very good team with an extremely good budget. They've got experience and took advantage of our naivety, causing us a lot of problems in the second half.
"But I was delighted with them, particularly in the first half. We started with a great intensity, passed the ball and played the game how I want to play it. I think the fans could see that. And what a brilliant goal to win a game."
