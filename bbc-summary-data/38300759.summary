Newtownards man Nixon, who made a record 792 appearances for Glentoran, was manager of H&W Welders U20 side.
Nixon's work with the Ards Academy, which included a spell as head coach, was a factor in the club's decision.
Currie left the Bangor Fuels Arena club to take over as boss at bottom side Portadown last week.
"The board of directors considered Colin's past involvement with our Academy, and the knowledge of our club that he would have gained, as well as his considerable knowledge of Premiership football, including relationships with managers and players throughout the league," said the club.
"A Uefa A Licence holder, Colin is a vastly experienced coach, whose most recent role was that of manager to Harland & Wolff Welders U20s.
"For some years he enjoyed involvement with Ards through our Academy, eventually being appointed to Academy head coach in 2015."
Nixon's brothers Alan and Darren, a former team captain, both played for Ards.
John Bailie will remain as part of the first team coaching staff, while Nixon is seeking to bring in an additional coach.
Ards are ninth in the standings and Nixon's first game in charge will be against Coleraine on Saturday.
