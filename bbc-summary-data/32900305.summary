McGregor will talk about the Last Days in the Desert during the festival, where his Trainspotting co-star Robert Carlyle makes a debut as a director.
Carlyle's film, The Legend of Barney Thomson, sees a barber with a dull life from Glasgow turn into a serial killer.
The festival runs from 17 to 28 June.
Other highlights include:
Alongside McGregor, Live and Let Die actor Jane Seymour and Clockwork Orange star Malcolm McDowell will be giving talks for their starring roles in Bereave, a film about a fatally ill man and his missing wife.
Festival director Mark Adams said there was "something for everyone".
And Scottish culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said the festival showcased Scottish talent alongside "some of the best" of world cinema.
She said the festival had an "important role" to play in developing skills to support Scottish film in future.
Earlier in the month it was announced that a drama featuring the island of Iona will close this year's festival and receive its world premiere.
