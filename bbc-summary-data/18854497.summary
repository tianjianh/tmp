Yeovil Town's revamp 'breaches planning policy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to expand Yeovil Town Football Club are contradictory to national planning guidelines, South Somerset District Council has said.

The club wants to upgrade its stand, facilities and build a new supermarket at the Copse End of Huish Park.
But the council says the plans breach national planning policy framework as an out-of-town store would impact on the vitality of the town centre shops.
Yeovil Town FC said it did not wish to comment.
Council leader Ric Pallister said: "There is a presumption from central government we shouldn't grant planning permission to out-of-town superstores."
The application was due to be discussed in May, but the date was cancelled after further paperwork was needed from the football club.
No date has been set for the plans to go before the planning committee.
Mr Pallister said: "The land upon which they wish to seek planning permission for is indeed public open recreation space so selling that will mean we also have to re-provide that somewhere else.
"It is probable that it will end up in an appeals situation, but even if we were to grant it there is a very strong chance that the secretary of state would call in the whole matter for him to determine because it breaches government planning policy."
Parish councils and the town council, which have been consulted on the plans, have already objected to the expansion.
