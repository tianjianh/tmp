England forward Sam Burgess says he was "extremely lucky" to avoid a serious neck injury after being carried off and taken to hospital during South Sydney's loss to St George Illawarra on Sunday.

The 27-year-old had a clash of heads with fellow Englishman Mike Cooper.
He lay prone on the pitch for several minutes, while receiving medical care, before being taken off on a stretcher.
Burgess later wrote: "Initial scan results are positive.... feeling extremely lucky tonight."
He was playing his third game since returning to rugby league after a nine-month stint in union with Bath and England.
He lowered his head as he ran with the ball but immediately fell to the ground after the collision.
The Rabbitohs were trailing 8-6 in the NRL fixture at the time and no more points were scored following the incident in the 58th minute.
