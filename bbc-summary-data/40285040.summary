[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has overturned a decision by Bristol City Council to refuse planning permission for a McDonald's drive-through.

McDonald's planned to open a two-storey restaurant in Fishponds in 2014.
There was fierce opposition from a campaign group over congestion and childhood obesity concerns.
The planning inspector said there was little evidence the "proposal would result in any significant increase in obesity".
Mike Jempson from the Say No To McDonald's campaign group said he was "appalled and astounded" by the decision, which he claims was taken "with scant regard to the wishes and concerns of local residents".
He said: "Disgracefully, he [the inspector] dismisses the 495 written objections received by the council, the 1,667 signatories to the No McDonald's In Fishponds petition, and 617 signatures of families in the streets most directly affected by the scheme."
He added that the group will consider its options before deciding whether to challenge in the High Court.
A McDonald's spokesperson said: "We are pleased that our application has been allowed but will now be taking time to review the inspector's decision.
"We strongly believe that we will make a positive contribution to the local community, not least through the creation of 65 new jobs for local people."
