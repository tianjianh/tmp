Four round-robin games involving the Scottish men and women's rinks will be shown, along with the semi-finals and finals of both competitions.
Skip Eve Muirhead - the 2013 world champion and 2014 Olympic bronze medallist - is looking to improve on last year's silver medal.
And Tom Brewster leads the men's team.
Brewster is joined by Glen Muirhead, Ross Paterson and Hammy McMillan, while the women's rink will be completed by Anna Sloan, Vicki Adams and Lauren Gray.
Sweden are defending the men's title at Braehead Arena, while Muirhead's team lost out to Russia in last year's final.
The top eight nations in each competition will qualify for their respective World Championships next year, with the women's event in Beijing between 18-26 March and the men in Edmonton, Canada, from 1-9 April.
"We know there will be huge interest in the fortunes of both Scottish teams so we're delighted to show many of the leading matches," said BBC Scotland Sport's Grigor Stirling.
"As it's being played on home soil we know there will be a terrific atmosphere at Braehead and it should make for exciting viewing."
