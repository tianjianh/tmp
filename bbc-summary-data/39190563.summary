The partner of Sarah McClay, who was killed by a tiger at South Lakes Safari Zoo, hopes the attraction can stay open after its owner was refused a licence.

Cumbria Zoo Company Ltd (CZCL) wants to buy the zoo and end its connection with David Gill, who founded it in 1994.
On Monday, Barrow Council refused Mr Gill a licence to continue running it, amid concerns over animal welfare.
David Shaw said he hopes CZCL, which took over operational control in January, will succeed with its plan.
The zoo remains open but could close within 28 days, unless Mr Gill appeals against the council's decision.
CZCL has been operating the zoo through a six-month leasing agreement with Mr Gill, who remained only as landowner.
It has submitted its own licence application, which is due to be inspected later this month.
In it Mr Gill will have no management, operational or other role.
In a social media posting CZCL said: "Despite the short time in which we have had sole operation of the site, we have developed and mitigated many of the welfare concerns that were inherited when we took over."
Mr Shaw said of CZCL: "They've come a long way, they have the right enclosures, they mix the right animals and they're looked after in the right way.
"Provided they can prove they do it in a safe manner, the enforcement legislation will require them to do it in a way that's suitable for the animals."
