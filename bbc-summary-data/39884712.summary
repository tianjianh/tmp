Goals from Tr√©sor Mputu Mabi and Rainford Kalaba were enough to give the holders a win in Lubumbashi on Sunday.
It means Mazembe are top of Group D, following SuperSport United's 2-2 draw with Horoya on Friday.
16 teams feature in the Confederation Cup group phase.
Zambia's Zesco United kicked off their Confederation Cup group campaign with a slender 1-0 victory over Egypt's Smouha on Saturday in Group C.
The hosts left it late in front of their own fans in Ndola before Jackson Were stepped up to score from the penalty spot in the 73rd minute.
Zesco are aiming to become the first Zambian winners of the Confederation Cup having reached the Champions League semi-finals last year.
Also on Saturday, record three-time Confederation Cup winners CS Sfaxien of Tunisia found the going tougher than expected against group-stage debutants Mbabane Swallows of Swaziland, winning 1-0.
Having scored seven goals in two home qualifiers, the Tunisians had to settle for just one, from Alaa Marzouki on 31 minutes in Sfax.
Nevertheless, Sfaxien go top of Group B, after South Africa's Platinum Stars were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Mouloudia Alger of Algeria.
Former Confederation Cup winners FUS Rabat of Morocco were 3-0 winners over Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), the first Ugandan club to qualify for the group stage of a continental competition.
KCCA came close to shocking title-holders Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in the Champions League before being demoted to the Confederation Cup.
On Friday, Substitute Thuso Phala scored to salvage a 2-2 draw for SuperSport United of South Africa against Horoya of Guinea in the opening Confederation Cup group game.
It was a disappointing start to Group D for the Pretoria club, who had scored 11 goals in three home victories en route to the expanded 16-club mini-league phase.
SuperSport United's coach, Stuart Baxter, becomes South Africa boss later this month.
