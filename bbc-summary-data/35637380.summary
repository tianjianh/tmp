The centre-back met Ryan Ledson's cross, with Coulson's header taking a large deflection off Anthony Stewart to wrong-foot goalkeeper Ryan Allsop.
Stewart almost brought the away side level in the second half as Leon Legge cleared his header off the line.
United held on to pick up their third consecutive home win.
With 12 matches remaining, the hosts are three points off of seventh-placed Leyton Orient, while defeat saw Wycombe drop out of the play-off positions.
