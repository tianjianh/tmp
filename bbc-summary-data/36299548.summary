China's industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment all grew more slowly than expected in April, indicating the economy remains weak.
The Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.3% at 16,466.40, while the broader Topix gained 0.1% to end at 1,321.65.
Australia's benchmark ASX/200 rose 0.6% to close at 5,358.95.
South Korea's Kospi index ended flat at 1,967.91.
In China, the mainland's Shanghai Composite gained 0.8% to close at 2,850.86 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng wrapped the day at 19,883.95, also 0.8% up.
China's National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday that industrial output rose 6% year-on-year in April, compared with 6.8% growth the month earlier.
Fixed-asset investment grew by 10.5% in the January-to-April period, compared with an increase of 10.7% the year before.
Retail sales grew by 10.1% in April from a year earlier. They all missed market expectations.
Vishnu Varathan from Mizuho bank said the activity data raised concerns about China's renewed slowdown and exacerbated "woes about global demand deficiency".
