The 20-year-old left-back, who had two months on loan at Cambridge United last season, has signed to remain with the Sky Blues until 12 January, 2017.
Page is eligible to make his debut in Tuesday's EFL Cup first-round tie at home to Portsmouth.
The West Ham Academy player made his first-team debut for the Hammers in July 2015 in the Europa League.
"We have bought him in to create competition in the left-back area," Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire, "with Chris Stokes likely to be out with injury for longer than expected."
Stokes missed the final two months of last season after being stretchered off with a knee injury in City's 1-0 win at Blackpool.
City began their fifth consecutive season in League One on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat at Swindon.
