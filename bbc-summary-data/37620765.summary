[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An armed robbery at a shop in Fraserburgh is being investigated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A knife was believed to have been used in the incident at Spar in St Modans Place at about 05:55.
No-one was injured, and the man escaped with a three-figure sum of money and other items.
Police Scotland said the suspect was white, between 5ft 10in and 6ft tall, and was wearing safety glasses and had tape on his face. He was wearing a light grey jacket and dark trousers.
Det Sgt Martyn Thomson said: "Thankfully no-one was hurt during the incident, however the staff member who was in the shop at the time was understandably shaken.
"A full investigation, including speaking to witnesses and reviewing CCTV, is under way and I am appealing for anyone who was in the area around the time in question and saw anything suspicious to contact police.
"Likewise anyone who saw a person matching the description provided either before the time of the robbery or after should come forward. You may have vital information which could assist our investigation."
