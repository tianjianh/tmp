Reading manager Jaap Stam believes his three deadline day signings, Lewis Grabban, Reece Oxford and Jordan Mutch, will add "quality and experience".

The Championship side also strengthened their grip on third place with a 1-0 win at Birmingham City on Tuesday.
"We needed to have extra bodies in the squad when you look at the number of games towards the end of the season," Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"Maybe we will have injuries and suspensions that will stretch us."
Bournemouth striker Grabban, 29, West Ham defender Oxford, 18, and Crystal Palace midfielder Mutch, 25, have all joined on loan until the end of the season.
"We're always looking for quality players in the squad and I think every manager wants that," Stam said.
"Reece Oxford gives us an extra defender in the squad, he's a young and very talented player and he has the quality that we need in how we play.
"He's highly-rated and everyone is happy to have him in the squad. Jordan Mutch has the experience that maybe other players in the squad don't have.
"Maybe that will make my life more difficult or perhaps easier in terms of making selection choices."
