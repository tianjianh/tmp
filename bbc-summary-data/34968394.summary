Mr Bent said he captured the mobile phone footage in Centenary Way.
"He wasn't trying to be discreet," he said.
"He didn't seem to even be looking up from his phone.  He was just totally oblivious that we were at the side of him filming him."
Paul Murphy, for Nottinghamshire Police, said action was "taken swiftly".
"In advance of a formal interview, appropriate action will be taken to refer the officer to our driver training team for reassessment to drive police vehicles.
"Nottinghamshire Police officers and staff are not above the law."
