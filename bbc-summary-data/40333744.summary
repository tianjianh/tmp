The 18-year-old, who spent five months on loan at Reading last season, has made seven Premier League appearances.
Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl said: "Reece is considered one of the country's best young defensive talents.
"This loan deal gives us the chance to add a very interesting player to our squad."
Oxford was the second-youngest player to start a Premier League match when he played against Arsenal, aged 16 years and 198 days, in August 2015.
He signed a new four-and-a-half-year deal at West Ham in December 2016.
