Aston Martin DB4 fetches record auction price

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aston Martin road car has fetched a record price at auction in Buckinghamshire - where it was made in 1960.

The DB4GT Coupe sold for £3,249,500 in the Bonham's auction at Aston Martin Works in Newport Pagnell.
The car, which retailed for about £4,500 when it was new, had been restored at the works by its last owner.
Bonham's said bidding was rising at increments of £100,000 at a time.
Aston Martin Works said the previous record was for an Aston Martin DB5, which was used in one of the James Bond films, which sold for £2.5m in 2010.
The record is for road cars and does not take racing cars into account as they can go for over £10m.
This record-breaking car, called The Jet, was the last DB4GT off the Newport Pagnell production line and was the only one with coachwork by Italian designers Bertone.
The sale also featured three "barn finds" which had been hidden in storage for over 30 years - a 1966 DB6 Vantage Sports Saloon Project, a 1964 DB5 Sports Saloon and a 1963 DB4 Series V Vantage Sports Saloon.
They fetched £609,300 between them, while overall the auction of 197 lots sold for £10m.
James Knight, Bonham's motoring director, said: "I really did not think we could eclipse the record-breaking total achieved at this sale last year, but I am thrilled that  in Aston Martin's centenary year we have achieved just that.
"To sell every lot in an auction is almost unprecedented."
