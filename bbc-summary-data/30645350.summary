Sharon Campbell, 36, of Lawrence Hill, Derry, was found eating pizza in her partner's home despite a court order barring her from seeing him.
The High Court was told that Ms Campbell spent Christmas in custody after breaking her bail conditions.
She faces charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
The court heard that on 12 November, her partner was found in Central Drive, Londonderry, covered in blood. He needed 30 stitches. He said he had been attacked by Ms Campbell following a row about one of their three children.
She said she acted in self-defence as he was choking her at the time.
On Wednesday, a Crown lawyer said Ms Campbell had been released on bail, but had broken several of the  conditions.
On 13 December, her partner came home to find her sitting in his house eating pizza. She also broke her curfew on 16 December when she did not answer her door to police. She broke bail conditions again on Christmas Day by drinking.
The prosecuting lawyer said police believe Ms Campbell would not follow the conditions imposed by the court because of her alcohol problems.
Her defence lawyer said the bottle attack was self defence.
The lawyer said Ms Campbell spent six days in jail over the Christmas period. Perhaps a lesson had been learned, he said, adding that she was seeking treatment for her alcohol problems.
The judge granted bail but warned Ms Campbell to have "no contact, directly or indirectly" with the injured party. She was also banned from consuming alcohol, ordered to report to police on a daily basis and told to observe a curfew.
