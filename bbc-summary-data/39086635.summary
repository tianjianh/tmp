[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool picked up their first home win since November with a hard-fought victory in the Lancashire seaside derby against Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts went ahead after 14 minutes as Brad Potts' whipped cross from the right was glanced in from six yards by Mark Cullen.
Potts threatened again in the 28th minute, superbly controlling the ball inside the area before drilling a strike inches wide of the far post.
Morecambe missed a golden chance to equalise after 37 minutes when the unmarked Paul Mullin saw his mis-hit effort from eight yards saved by Dean Lyness.
Blackpool extended their lead after 54 minutes as Kelvin Mellor fed Potts inside the area and the midfielder stroked the ball home to round off a superb counter-attack.
Gary Bowyer's men should have been out of sight on 64 minutes when a stumble from Peter Murphy gifted Jordan Flores a one-on-one chance, but he was denied by visiting goalkeeper Barry Roche.
The advantage was extended 10 minutes from time as Bright Osayi-Samuel's shot deflected in off Ryan Edwards.
Morecambe grabbed a consolation goal three minutes later when Antony Evans thumped home from close range after a goalmouth scramble.
