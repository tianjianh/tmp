Asamoah, 35, has been with the Cumbrians on various contracts since an initial six-month deal in October 2014, and has scored 13 goals in 90 games.
"He's been a pleasure to work with," boss Keith Curle told the club website.
"He's at an age where he needs to be playing football and, with the players we have here now, I couldn't guarantee him the pitch time he wanted."
