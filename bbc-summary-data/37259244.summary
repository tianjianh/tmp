The event, a so-called silent disco, will see 160 people dancing to music while wearing headphones on Saturday evening.
The chamber at the north London site will also be open to public as the Regent's Canal marks 200 years.
Eight sets of lock gates on the Regent's Canal were repaired on replaced at a cost of Â£500,000.
The two-hour party will take place at Hampstead Road Lock 1A, with revellers able to book tickets for half-hour slots from 19:00 BST.
People coming to visit the lock during the day will get a chance to walk along the original timber flooring in the bottom of the lock chamber, and take part in events like free fishing session and canoeing.
Jeannette Brooks, development and engagement manager for the Canal & River Trust, said: "Never before has a music event taken place in the bottom of a drained canal so this is a world's first! We want people to come along and rock the lock at the silent disco!"
Graham Smith, construction supervisor for the Canal and River Trust, said: "Repairing all the lock gates at Camden (Hampstead Road Lock 1A and B, Hawley Lock and Kentish Town Lock) over the last few years has been challenging, but we're pleased with the work we've done and the gates shouldn't need replacing for a quarter of a century."
A gun was discovered in the drained canal bed which police believe has been in the water since the 1980s.
It is not in working condition and has "no forensic opportunities".
