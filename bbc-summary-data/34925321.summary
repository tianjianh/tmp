Eoin Morgan: England skipper supports plan to scrap toss

England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan believes plans to scrap the toss in some County Championship games next season will benefit the national team.

The England and Wales Cricket Board is considering the proposals, which are designed to encourage counties to produce a better standard of pitches.
"I'm all for playing on wickets where there's no advantage to batting or bowling first," said Morgan.
"It poses challenges for the batters, more so towards the end of the game."
Morgan, whose side are preparing for a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan, also believes the proposals - which are likely to be trialled in Division Two of the domestic four-day game - would encourage spin bowlers.
"If it's to improve the standard of wickets that we play on, and potentially produce a couple of wickets where spin might be conducive to that particular ground, I think absolutely," Morgan, 29, told BBC Test Match Special.
"The benefit in county cricket might not be at the very beginning, but potentially for younger guys coming through - they'll develop different skills which will in turn give them a greater base, if they do get picked for England, to play around the world and do it successfully."
England's Twenty20 side are beginning to focus on the World T20, which is being held in India in March, and play the first of three matches against Pakistan on Thursday.
They have only played twice in this format in 2015, but have beaten India, New Zealand and Australia in their last three matches.
They have a good record against Pakistan, winning seven of their 10 meetings against the 2009 world champions, and enter the contest having won the the one-day international series which preceded it 3-1.
"The formula we play with in ODI cricket, and the aggression we play with, actually complements our T20 team," said Morgan.
"There's not a great deal of change in personnel for this series which is encouraging because the cricket we have been playing in the ODIs will hopefully rub off on the T20 side. I like to think the skills are transferrable, especially with the bat.
"It's a learning curve for us and if we can start the series well, our learning will increase rather than if we have to chase results.
"We're in a times now where we can look at different players and see what they can offer. Growing the squad is a priority of ours and I think it should be in the future.
"The more opportunities we can give guys, the better."
Since the last World T20 in 2014, England have played only four matches in the shortest format and Morgan believes his players need more exposure against the best players in the world.
England's batsmen and bowlers have rarely figured in the Indian Premier League or the Big Bash because of a clash of schedules.
Morgan is one of the few to have played in the IPL and he said: "We need to recognise that we need to get our younger guys out to the IPL and Big Bash and get them playing as much as we can.
"They are the best domestic tournaments in the world, they attract the best players and the crowds they play in front of are similar to World Cup crowds.
"It's about experiencing that and taking it back to playing in an England shirt."
Pakistan are expected to give a belated debut to 39-year-old opener Rafatullah Mohmand, who is four years older than captain Shahid Afridi.
They too are in good form in the T20 format, and experienced all-rounder Afridi said: "We have won the last six games.
"We did make small mistakes, but we are going through a process and are trying some new players."
