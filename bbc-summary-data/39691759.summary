Bottlenose dolphins have been photographed hunting large salmon in the Moray Firth.
Whale and Dolphin Conservation field officer Charlie Phillips, who took the images, has been observing the firth's dolphins for more than 25 years.
The Moray Firth and North Sea provide habitat for the world's most northerly resident population of bottlenose dolphins.
The animals usually gather off Chanonry Point on the Black Isle in the Scottish Highlands to hunt salmon.
