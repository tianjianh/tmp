Cardiff City: Club 'must buy players' or risk the drop - Warnock

Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock says they must buy new players in January or they could slip into a Championship relegation battle.

With half of their Championship games played this season, the Bluebirds are 19th and four points from safety.
After dropping points late on against Barnsley and Brentford, Warnock accused some players of lacking desire and wants fresh faces as soon as possible.
"It's going to be a battle. I'm not kidding myself about that," he said.
With the transfer window opening on Sunday, Warnock revealed he was working hard to bring new signings in as soon as possible to ensure they do not repeat their defensive problems in the second half of the season.
"We are on 24 points, that means if we do the same in the second-half of the season we are right in the thick of a relegation battle. We've not got 50 points then," Warnock continued.
"We've got to improve in the second-half and we will only do that by an influx of players. When you look at the points we have thrown away we have to rectify that.
"We need some new blood in the squad. Two or three players will be sufficient until the summer. It's not got to be drastic measures. We have to be better and more disciplined in certain areas.
"I've enquired about three or four players, you are not going to get every player you enquire about. Clubs are coming back to me with a decision over the next few days. I've never worried about transfer budgets as a manager. I just want to balance the books and I work hard to do that."
The former Sheffield United and Rotherham United manager insists he will have the full backing of Bluebirds owner Vincent Tan in the January transfer window, but has not ruled out the need to sell a player or two if he needs more finances.
Striker Marouane Chamakh and Kieran Richardson both left the club on Thursday despite the pair only joining the Bluebirds in October.
Centre-back Bruno Manga is for sale, but Warnock said a deal might be hard to broker as Manga departs to play for Gabon in the African Cup of Nations after Cardiff's game with Aston Villa On Monday.
