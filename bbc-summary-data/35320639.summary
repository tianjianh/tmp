The neighbours announced on Thursday that they had agreed to re-schedule peace talks which were postponed after the attack on an Indian air base.
Islamabad has arrested some members of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group, which India blames for the attack.
Pakistani papers say the arrests saved the talks from breaking down.
The four-day assault on the Pathankot air force base in Punjab, close to the Pakistan border, started on 2 January, when a group of gunmen - wearing Indian army uniforms - entered residential quarters on the air base.
Some Pakistani papers urged Islamabad to take "tough decisions", adding that the arrests of some JeM members was "just the start".
The Express Tribune commended Pakistan's "constructive" response after the attack.
Echoing similar views, The Nation said the "efficiency" of the Pakistani government's investigation into the Pathankot attack was "unprecedented".
It added that India was still not ready to "trust" Pakistan despite the arrests of some JeM members, but this situation must "change" to establish lasting peace.
Pakistan Today wondered if Pakistan's "zero tolerance for terrorism will continue with the zeal being presently displayed".
Some papers argued that both India and Pakistan needed to work together to defeat terrorism.
The Daily Times remarked that militants were acting as "spoilers" in the India-Pakistan peace process.
It added that despite Islamabad's crackdown on JeM, it "had failed to dismantle the organisation which continues to operate openly in various districts".
Some Pakistan papers urged India to act "positively" after Pakistan's decision to investigate the Pathankot attack.
The News said the arrests of JeM members was an "important" step to improve Pakistan's ties with India. However, it added that it would be good to see some "cooperation" from India in "detecting outfits [groups] on its soil that operate within Pakistan".
Urdu daily Nawa-i-Waqt said India should react in a positive manner to the overtures made by Pakistan. It added that the onus was now on India to work towards the complete restoration of peace talks between the neighbours.
Another Urdu daily, Jang, argued that Pakistan had swiftly acted against the suspects of the Indian air base attack.
It added the move showed the "political and military establishment's pledge that the Pakistani soil won't be used for terrorism against India", and the neighbour must do the same.
