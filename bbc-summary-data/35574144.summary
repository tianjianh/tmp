[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have launched a murder inquiry after the death of a woman in a flat in Aberdeen's Union Terrace.

Officers were called to the property after the woman was found dead at 13:10 on Friday, 12 February.
A "major investigation" is now under way, with police reviewing CCTV and conducting door-to-door inquiries.
Det Supt David McLaren, from Police Scotland's major investigation team, said officers believe the woman may have worked as a prostitute.
He said: "There is no doubt that this incident will raise concerns in Aberdeen and the wider community but I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the public that a significant police investigation has commenced and all efforts will be made to trace the person or people responsible.
"A priority for us is establishing the woman's recent movements, identify who she may have been in contact with and ultimately determine what happened to her prior to her being found on Friday afternoon.
"Investigations are at a very early stage however a line of inquiry at this time is the suggestion that the woman may have been involved in prostitution and as such Police Scotland is actively engaging with support groups nationally.
"I am appealing for anyone who may have any information that would assist us with our inquiry to speak to us. We would ask that people remain vigilant and follow personal safety advice."
