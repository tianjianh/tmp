Super League: Catalans Dragons 16-14 Huddersfield Giants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catalans Dragons moved into second place in Super League with a hard-fought win over struggling Huddersfield Giants at the Stade Gilbert Brutus.

Danny Brough's 24th-minute penalty and Nathan Mason's try gave Giants an 8-6 half-time lead, with Catalans' reply coming from Louis Anderson.
Justin Horo and Tony Gigot touched down for the hosts and Catalans held on despite Jake Connor's score for Giants.
Catalans moved above Hull FC, level on points with leaders Warrington.
The Dragons, who were without Dave Taylor, Jason Baitieri and Vincent Duport, were helped by the return of influential half-back Todd Carney following a two-game absence due to injury.
It was a tight opening first half, but Huddersfield, who remain 11th in the table following the defeat, led 8-0 after Mason crossed under the posts after a quick Ryan Hinchcliffe offload.
After Anderson's score before the break, Horo put his side in front after ex-Giants player Jodie Broughton's fine set-up play and Gigot extended the lead after successive penalties.
Ryan Brierley set up Connor for the Giants to make it a nervy final 15 minutes, but they were unable to reach the highs of their last two games, when they beat rivals Leeds in the league before knocking the Rhinos out of the Challenge Cup.
Huddersfield were without Eorl Crabtree, who did not travel to France following the birth of his son.
Catalans coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"I am happy with the two points and that we were able to come back and show a lot of character. To be able to win that game with a player on his debut and with four big players for us missing is a great effort.
"Everyone can see what Todd Carney brings to our team. "He gives us good direction and gets people running off him which creates space.
"Defensively, I was pretty pleased too. We have some things to work on, but we have to be pleased to keep a team to 14 points. If we can do that every week then we give ourselves a chance of winning most games.
Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson told BBC Radio Leeds:
"Defensively, we were pretty good. We had a spell just after half-time but other than that we were pretty good. We can take a lot of positives out of that performance.
"I told the boys in the changing room exactly that. We just lacked a little bit of cohesion with the ball. Our effort was outstanding. We just lacked a little bit of presence and physicality.
"All the young blokes did a great job for us out there and they have in recent weeks too. We did some things that in the end cost us the two points but we're definitely heading in the right direction."
