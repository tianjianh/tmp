Swansea City still need to replace ex-captain Ashley Williams and striker Andre Ayew, says manager Bob Bradley.

Defender Williams, 32, played more than 300 times for the Swans after joining from Stockport County in 2008, but moved to Everton during the summer.
Ayew, 26, scored 12 Premier League goals for Swansea but was sold to West Ham after just one season at the club.
"All Swansea supporters know that they were important players last year," Bradley told BBC Radio 5 live.
"When players like that leave, not only do you lose the talent they had on the field, but both of those players were strong figures in the dressing room."
Bradley secured his first win as Swansea manager as they beat Crystal Palace 5-4 on Saturday in a dramatic game at the Liberty Stadium.
He says he has looked at what the club did right last year, instead of dwelling on their poor form this season.

The Swans are 19th in the Premier League, only a point ahead of Sunderland.
"I spent some time during the international break a few weeks ago watching a few games from last season where I thought the team played well," said Bradley.
"I am trying to give a simple message that helps them feel good about the football Swansea has played in the past and use that to get our feet on the ground and move forward.
"I looked at what Francesco Guidolin did with some of the line-ups and formations, but then when you arrive you've got to try and put it all together quickly."
Bradley says he would like to add some players to his squad in the January transfer window, but ruled out any drastic changes.
"I don't think we need surgery but, like many teams, I think we need to use January to improve ourselves," he said.
"We've had some good discussions already and without a doubt I think we can add a couple of important pieces."
