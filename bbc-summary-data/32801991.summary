[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Crime Agency has become fully operational in Northern Ireland.

Sometimes referred to as the British FBI, it can seize assets from criminals and carry out a wide range of activities to tackle organised crime.
Its powers have been extended to Northern Ireland as of midnight.
Northern Ireland's Justice Minister David Ford said this "milestone" would have a significant impact in the fight against organised crime.
PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said agreements are in place to ensure the agency can only mount operations in Northern Ireland with the approval of the police.
"We will be working closely with our new colleagues to ensure opportunities are maximised to tackle serious and organised crime and apprehend offenders," he said.
"At the same time, I will ensure that the accountability arrangements being agreed with the Policing Board are factored into every aspect of operational activity to deliver both public confidence and community safety."
The NCA began operating in the rest of the UK in 2013, but up until now its full powers have not been extended to Northern Ireland because of opposition from nationalist politicians.
In February, MLAs at Stormont voted to extend the NCA's powers after the SDLP changed its position and supported it.
Sinn FÃ©in criticised the move.
Both parties originally opposed the NCA's extension because of concerns over the agency's accountability.
However, the SDLP has now said that a series of new measures proposed by the UK government means they can back its full introduction in Northern Ireland.
Its acceptance required cross-community support at Stormont.
