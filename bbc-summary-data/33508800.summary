Ministers 'kept in dark' over rail scheme delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Network Rail decided in March that rail improvements might have to be halted within weeks of the general election, but failed to tell the government until after polling day.

The BBC has learned that despite having "direct oversight" of Network Rail, and pledging extra electrification in the election campaign, ministers were kept in the dark about the rail operator's plans.
Sources at the Department for Transport said a Network Rail minute revealing a decision would have to be taken soon after polling day was not sent to the government until 22 May.
The sources said neither ministers nor officials were informed.
It means Conservatives made a rail manifesto pledge to electrify rail routes in ignorance of Network Rail's plans.
However, Labour insisted the news showed ministers must have known rail electrification projects would be paused in June, and that they had misled voters.
The Conservatives pledged to electrify rail routes in their manifesto, only to put plans for electrifying two lines on hold shortly after polling day.
Minutes of a Network Rail board meeting from March show the board agreed to a plan that included making "decisions required jointly with the DfT re enhancement deferrals from June".
"Enhancement" is industry jargon for upgrade. "Enhancement deferral" refers to delaying upgrades.
It is understood rail executives had judged that taking any longer to pause struggling projects would incur extra costs.
The government has had "direct oversight" of Network Rail since September last year.
One senior rail executive has told me further delays are expected of major projects in the north of England.
Network Rail's plans there had become a "standing joke" the executive said.
Rail schemes were at the heart of George Osborne's election promise to create a "northern powerhouse".
Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said: "This revelation shows ministers must have known before the general election that vital rail electrification projects would be shelved.
"It is becoming increasingly apparent ministers deliberately decided to cynically mislead people during the general election campaign that key rail lines would be electrified in the Midlands and the North, knowing full well that they would then renege on these commitments after the election. "
Minutes from Network Rail board meetings as early as November reveal there were concerns about the "deliverability" and affordability of upgrades.
