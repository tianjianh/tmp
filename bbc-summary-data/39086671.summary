[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Bromwich Albion v Crystal Palace

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom winger Matt Phillips is a slight doubt with a hamstring strain and a decision will be made over his inclusion on Friday.

Craig Dawson has recovered from a head injury and should retain his place at right-back.
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce has no fresh injury concerns and looks set to name the same side that beat Middlesbrough.
Pape Souare, Loic Remy, Mathieu Flamini and Connor Wickham remain injured.
Simon Brotherton: "It's Crystal Palace who need the points in this one, but Tony Pulis will have his West Brom team fully focused against the former club he's still in dispute with.
"Albion are unbeaten in the last five and are currently enjoying their best season in the Premier League. It's a different story for Palace, who secured a much-needed win over Middlesbrough last week yet find themselves in the relegation zone after six defeats in eight games.
"The arrival of Sam Allardyce clearly hasn't produced the immediate bounce that Palace would have hoped for.
"But, like Pulis, 'Big Sam' has never been relegated from the Premier League and there's still time to maintain that record."

West Bromwich Albion head coach Tony Pulis on his dispute with Crystal Palace: "The lawyers have told me not to say anything, and when the situation is concluded then I will have my say on it.
"I'll let the lawyers do their work. I'm not so sure the Palace fans will be (different towards me). They can make their own mind up.
"They were fantastic to me and what has happened off the pitch has been really disappointing, but I can't go into it."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce on Christian Benteke: "He's scored 11 goals this season: in a struggling side that's a pretty good return.
"He hasn't scored recently and he was terribly frustrated last week he didn't score towards the end when Andros [Townsend] could have fed him. He lives on goals; he's a goal machine.
"We need our players to put him into good positions and give him the right type of ball so that he can score more goals."
I am going to go with a draw here, because I think Crystal Palace will get something on the back of last week's win over Middlesbrough.
Prediction: 1-1
