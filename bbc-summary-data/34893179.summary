Real Madrid boss Rafael Benitez is concerned about his side recovering mentally from their 4-0 home thrashing by Barcelona in El Clasico.

Real could have gone top of La Liga but are now six points behind Barca after two goals from Luis Suarez, one from Neymar and another from Andres Iniesta.
Isco was sent off for the hosts.
"We need to get over this and focus on the next match as soon as possible," said Benitez, who was managing in a Clasico for the first time.
"What I'm most concerned about now is getting the team to recover mentally in time for the next match."
Benitez gave starts to forwards James Rodriguez, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, who have all recently recovered from injury.

"With the match now over, we can clearly say that the line-up didn't work," said Benitez.
"I pick my teams by trying to manage the group as best as possible. The players who started have enough quality to do better than that.
"We made mistakes and paid dearly for them. We lost possession a few times and when you do that against a good team you're made to suffer.
"Rather than analysing the game, which of course we will do, what matters most now is lifting the group's spirits quickly and getting everyone to see the importance of the upcoming fixtures."
Real are away in their next three matches - at Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League, Eibar in La Liga and Cadiz in the Copa del Rey.
