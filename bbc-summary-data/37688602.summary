The visitors dominated the first half, but England defender Lucy Bronze went closest, heading wide from a free-kick.
France's Sandie Toletti forced Karen Bardsley into a save with a long-range strike, but England failed to work keeper Sarah Bouhaddi.
Toni Duggan had a late goal ruled out for handball for the Lionesses who have not beaten France since 1974.
Mark Sampson's side have not scored against the French in their last four meetings, but can take heart from a solid defensive display, leaving the opposition with limited chances.
England's last defeat came in the SheBelieves Cup in March when they lost 2-1 to Germany. They then went through six Euro 2017 qualifying games without defeat.
Their next friendly match is against Spain in Guadalajara on Tuesday, 25 October.
Former England striker Sue Smith on BBC TV:
"There have been some excellent defensive performances for England but Lucy Bronze was solid, made two excellent recovery blocks and did nothing wrong. Going forward she gave them something else and did not get a pass wrong.
"In the second half, England had the opportunity from Toni Duggan, it was chest at most but the referee thought it hit her hand. They showed patches of good play and when they play France again, they will feel mentally they can beat them.
"These are the games they need to play, the likes of France, Spain and Netherlands. They will give them different problems and can play different personnel in those games to work out the problems."
