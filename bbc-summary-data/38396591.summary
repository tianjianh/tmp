William first arrived at Invernevis House in Fort William earlier this year.
He had previously been found neglected in Cyprus by a couple from Keith in Moray who were visiting the island.
Residents and staff at NHS Highland-run Invernevis House have raised Â£8,000 for the operation.
William, who is five, is set to have his operation in February.
However, he needs to be clear of an ongoing infection for at least a month before it can take place.
Invernevis House manager Kit Cameron said: "William is a huge favourite with the residents here and puts a smile on everyone's face.
"However, it hasn't always been a life full of love for William."
