Wigan forward Yanic Wildschut has handed in a transfer request after the club rejected "a succession of bids" from two Championship rivals.

The 25-year-old has scored 14 goals in 65 games since joining, initially on loan, from Middlesbrough in 2015.
Wigan said they have rejected bids at the weekend and on Monday, with Norwich and Derby both linked with the player.
"This is not the way to repay the faith we have shown in him," said Latics chairman David Sharpe.
"I've always had a good relationship with Yanic and I feel he has let the club, his team-mates and our supporters down by taking this action.
"Yanic is a very important player to us and we do not have a desire to sell our best players.
"That said, every player has a value and we will not be put under pressure to sell a player for less than our valuation."
