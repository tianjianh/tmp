Cavendish, who won omnium silver at Rio 2016, will be joined by Steve Cummings, Ian Stannard and Geraint Thomas in the men's road race on 16 October in Doha.
The Manxman won the world title in 2011 and is among the favourites for victory with a sprint finish expected.
Reigning champion Deignan (nee Armitstead) is aiming to become the first Briton to defend the world title.
Iain Dyer, head coach for British Cycling, said: "We have picked strong squads for the races we are entering.
"In the men's race, Mark is one of the clear favourites given the nature of the course and he will have a strong team around him.
"In the women's squad, we've got some real high-calibre contenders with a couple of riders having the capability to be competitive in a sprint finish scenario."
The nine-man men's squad will race 257.5km (160 miles), while the women's eight-strong team takes on a 134.5km (83.7 miles) course.
Five-time British time trial champion Alex Dowsett, who also won Commonwealth Games gold at Glasgow 2014, will take on the world's best against the clock over 40km on Wednesday, 12 October.
National road race champion Hannah Barnes will double-up in Doha, racing in the women's 28.9km time trial and road race.
National time trial champion Hayley Simmonds also takes on the clock in Qatar.
