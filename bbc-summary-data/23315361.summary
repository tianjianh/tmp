A community group has revealed plans to redevelop Bradford's former Odeon cinema into a music venue.

Bradford One wants to turn the derelict site, currently owned by the city council, into a concert setting with a capacity of up to 2,000 people.
Plans also include restaurants, bars and a new office within the building.
A campaign has been under way to save the 1930s landmark, which played host to acts including The Beatles, since its closure in 2000.
It was bought by regional development agency Yorkshire Forward in 2003, which later entered into a development agreement with Langtree Artisan.
That agreement, which would have seen the demolition of the building, was scrapped last September after the Homes and Communities Agency took over the site following the abolition of Yorkshire Forward.
Earlier this year, the building was bought by Bradford Council for Â£1.
The authority said it would now consider proposals for commercially viable developments which retain all or part of the building.
Bradford One said the redevelopment and use of the building would be funded in a mix of ways including grants, community funding and a community share scheme.
Another bid has also been unveiled by Bradford Live, which is also calling for the building to become a music venue.
