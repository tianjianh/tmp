The 22-year-old actress was in the Prestbury house with a female friend when thieves broke in on Tuesday night.
They locked the pair in a room while they stole jewellery and a mobile phone before escaping, police said.
Ms Flanagan's spokesman said she was "very shaken but unharmed". Police said they were investigating.
Earlier in the day, the actress had posted a message on social networking site Twitter to say she was looking forward to her boyfriend, Manchester City footballer Scott Sinclair, returning home.
Ms Flanagan played Coronation Street's Rosie Webster and also appeared on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! after leaving the soap last year.
