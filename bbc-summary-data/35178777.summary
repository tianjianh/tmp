The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) had 14 flood warnings and eight alerts in place on Saturday.
The Met Office has weather warnings in place for rain covering much of southern and eastern Scotland on Boxing Day.
Forecasters said a band of heavy rain would sit across the country until late evening on Saturday.
Premiership matches due to be hosted by Dundee United and Partick Thistle on Saturday were among five Scottish games postponed because of waterlogged pitches.
Stormy weather also forced the cancellation of an annual Boxing Day dunk in the North Sea.
Up to 200 people had been expected to take part in the Nippy Dipper fundraising event at Aberdeen beach.
Police in the Scottish Borders appealed for motorists to take extra care after heavy and persistent rainfall.
Response Inspector Bryan Burns, of Police Scotland, said: "The Borders has seen a significant amount of rain fall since Christmas day and this is set to continue.
"As such, there has been localised flooding and a number of roads are now closed including the A698 Denholm to Hawick , B6405 Denholm to Minto, along with various unclassified roads throughout the region and local diversions are in place.
"Unfortunately, a minority of drivers are choosing to ignore the diversions and are instead taking the chance of driving through flood waters."
He added: "Temperatures are expected to plummet this evening and ice will form on road surfaces making them treacherous during Sunday (Dec 27). Please reduce your speed and drive to the conditions."
The Met Office has also issued an early warning of strong winds for Tuesday 29 December.
The Tuesday weather event is expected to be named Storm Frank.
The Met Office said a rapidly deepening depression, passing to the west of Ireland and Scotland, was likely to bring a swathe of severe gale force winds, accompanied by heavy rain, across parts of western and northern Britain on Tuesday.
