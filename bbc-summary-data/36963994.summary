Apart from arranging repatriation, officials are trying to address workers' complaints about unpaid wages and end-of-service benefits.
Pakistan, too, has promised action.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office said Pakistan's embassy in Riyadh has set up a centre to provide food and medical help as well as dealing with claims for outstanding payments.
"We stand by our hardworking workers who are away from their homeland to earn a living for their families," the statement said. "They are our strength and pride."

"They have made arrangements to take care of the food of these workers," he told the BBC. "They've conveyed that they're willing to even carry those Indians on Saudi Arabian airlines back to India."
Millions of workers from Asian countries have found employment in Saudi Arabia and other gulf states, sending vital remittances home to their families.
