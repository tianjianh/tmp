Portadown's Colin Turkington secured two fourth-place finishes in the ninth round of the British Touring Car Championship at Silverstone on Sunday.

Starting from the back of the grid, Turkington made his way through the field to finish eighth in race one.
The 34-year-old improved by four places in the next two outings and lies seventh in the series on 241 points.
His strong performance means the Subaru driver has an outside chance of winning the title at the final round.
After being penalised at the previous round, Turkington was made to start at the back of the 31-car grid for the three races at Silverstone.
However, the 2014 champion cut his way through the field, picking rivals off one by one, as he took the chequered flag in 10th position.
He was promoted to eighth after MG drivers Ash Sutton and Josh Cook, who finished in first and second, were excluded for a technical infringement.
Turkington battled hard with team-mate Jason Plato in the second race, finishing just outside the podium places.
The Northern Irishman grabbed his second fourth place finish in the final race of the day as he nipped past a struggling Plato on the final corner to head to Brands Hatch 37 points behind leader Sam Tordoff.
There was joy for Charlie Eastwood in the Porsche Carerra Cup, as the Belfast driver claimed the rookie title and the Â£50,000 prize fund that accompanies it after he climbed from 11th to third.
Eastwood is now third in the overall standings, with English driver Dan Cammish sealing the overall championship with two races to spare.
Chris Smiley and Dan Harper had difficult weekends in their respective Renault Clio and Ginetta Juniors series, with both drivers finishing mid-pack.
