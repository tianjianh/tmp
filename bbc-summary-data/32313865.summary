Police in the northern Australian city of Darwin say they attended to a "disturbance" at an asylum seeker centre, amid reports of ongoing detainee protests.

A rights group says asylum seekers there are protesting against a move to transfer some of them to Nauru.
Australia has seen a number of protests among asylum seekers kept in detention centres in recent months.
Rights groups have heavily criticised conditions in such centres.
A Northern Territories police spokesman said they received calls around 1540 local time (0710 BST) about a "disturbance" at Wickham Point Detention Centre. She declined to give further details.
Ben Pynt of the Darwin Asylum Seeker Support and Advocacy Network told the BBC that he has received calls from dozens of detainees about the protest and apparent cases of self-harm.
He said at least 100 people have been protesting since Tuesday over the impending transfer of a group of about 20 asylum seekers, including babies, back to Nauru.
The group was originally housed in Nauru but were brought to Darwin for medical treatment.
Australia asylum: Why is it controversial?
Australia saw a lengthy protest by asylum seekers at Manus Island in Papua New Guinea in January, where hundreds reportedly went on hunger strike.
In February 2014, that same camp saw deadly riots where at least one asylum seeker was killed and at least 70 were injured.
In October, the Australian government ordered an inquiry into allegations that asylum seekers were abused in the Nauru detention centre.
It reported in March that there were "credible" claims of assault and harassment.
