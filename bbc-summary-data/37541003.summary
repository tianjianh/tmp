The Grecians are second-from-bottom in League Two and have not won at home since April, one of only two wins at St James Park in the whole of 2016 so far.
"I understand the dissatisfaction with a number of the supporters," he said.
"But it's important those people stay behind the team as this is a supporter-owned club, everyone's in it together and we have to have that mentality."
City conceded a late goal to lose 1-0 at Wycombe on Saturday - their eighth defeat in 11 league games after an injury-hit start to the season.
"There's a lot of will in the squad and a lot of effort and people behind them and we've just got to keep going with it," Tisdale added.
"We're going through one of those periods where that's all we can do.
"There's no point shirking it, but I believe in the players, they've put some real work in and we've just got to take that into next week."
