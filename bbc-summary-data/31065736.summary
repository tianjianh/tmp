Trading under the symbol SHAK on the New York Stock Exchange, investor demand pushed Shake Shack's share price up from $21 to $45.90.
Started as a hot dog cart by restaurateur Danny Meyer in New York City, Shake Shack now has 63 restaurants worldwide.
Mr Meyer is set to net some $140m.
Shake Shack has benefitted from the rise of so-called "fast casual" restaurants, like Chipotle and Panera, which still offer consumers food fast, but put greater emphasis on sustainable ingredients and on-site food preparation.
In addition to burgers and concretes - Mr Meyer's term for milkshakes - Shake Shack outlets also offer wine, beer and a rotating offering of seasonal specials.
