The band's manager said the singer and guitarist had been diagnosed with laryngitis after performing at Glastonbury Festival on Friday night.
They were due to perform on Sunday at the Nick Rayns LCR, but the gig has been rearranged for 16 November.
This was the band's first tour since the death of guitarist Rick Parfitt in December last year.
He died aged 68 from a severe infection after going to hospital with complications to a shoulder injury.
A statement said: "Francis was feeling unwell even before the band played a fantastically well-received headline set on the Acoustic stage at Glstonbury, but after that show it was obvious that there was a problem.
"Medical opinion was duly sought this morning, with the result that tomorrow's show cannot go ahead."
The band added that postponing a show was "always a last resort" but said the situation was "totally outside anyone's control."
