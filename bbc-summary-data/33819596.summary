The political satire will make its debut at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London in September.
It will focus on the true-life events of a family in Baghdad having dinner on the evening of the Allied bombardment when the Iraqi dictator turns up at the door.
Berkoff has played villains throughout his career, on stage and in film.
General Orlov in Octopussy, Lt Colonel Podovsky in Rambo II, and Adolf Hitler in 1980s TV series War and Remembrance are among his best known roles.
Berkoff was quoted in the Guardian as saying that he would happily keep making his way through all the powerful dictators of the 20th century.
"That would be wonderful," he said. "They are fascinating people and they are dynamic people, so I think it is a point of privilege that I could even be considered for such a role."
He called the new play the "best written political satire I have read in 30 years."
"No matter how evil a character is, if it is well written it makes you examine them with much more awareness and much more insight," said Berkoff.
"Before this play I loathed the man [Saddam Hussein], but Anthony Horowitz opens up the whole regime and the political system and all the tricks that were played to such an extent that you have a much wider field of vision.
"Although you hate him, you find him a fascinating character. As soon as I read it, this play astounded me and it will really wake people up to all the shenanigans that were going on back then."
Horowitz said the casting of Berkoff was an "extraordinary idea."
"Although the play is a comedy, it has quite a serious intent. The situations can be funny but the character is not and I think Steven will bring real menace and real understanding," he said.
His motivation to write the play came from wanting "to rekindle the anger around the whole invasion of Iraq."
"There are so many unanswered questions. Every day that passes without the Chilcot report coming out, it becomes more unbelievable that a mature democracy can behave in this way," he said.
Horowitz is the author of more than 40 books, including the bestselling Alex Rider series, as well as the creator of TV series Foyle's War and Midsomer Murders.
