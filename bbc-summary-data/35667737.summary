Hundreds of student flats could be built above a new shopping complex as part of a £50m plan in Swansea.

About 700 flats will be built, as well as a restaurant and cafe, on the site of Mariner Street car park.
This would be in addition to the £500m regeneration announced last month.
Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said: "This project will be a major step forward for the area's regeneration, building on all the great work that's already been done."
The council has agreed to sell its portion of the site to development company RDE Silex and agreements have also been reached with two landowners.
Network Rail has agreed to move the top deck of the High Street multi-storey car park.
A planning application could be submitted in March and, if approved, construction could start in the autumn with the project finished by summer 2018.
