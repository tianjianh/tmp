NHS patients will be able to have surgery in France under new contracts.

Managers at the South Kent Coast Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) have signed deals for patients in parts of Kent to be treated at hospitals in Calais and Le Touquet.
Under the plans, the NHS will pay for treatment but patients will pay for their own travel costs.
The public sector union Unison said it was a "gimmick" but the CCG said feedback had been positive.
Hazel Carpenter, from the CCG, said: "Our patient representatives have been to France as well as CCG GP representatives and tested the practicalities, ensuring that the scheme is viable."
She said the French providers had improved signage and ensured their staff have excellent English language skills.
Simon Bolton, from Unison, said it was an "admission of failure" by the NHS.
He said: "I dare say if you go to France you will get decent treatment, but if you need a hip operation, for example, how are you going to travel 22 miles? Who's going to visit you?
"Having failed to commission and plan care in Kent properly, they are now saying 'well you can go to France'. It's a gimmick and it's to cover their own backs."
Procedures to be carried out in France include orthopaedics, cataract surgery, and ear, nose and throat operations, possibly by the end of April.
Providers will give patients 24-hour access by phone to a member of the surgical team for 14 days.
Follow-up appointments will be by phone or video technology such as Skype, or patients can travel back to France to see their consultant.
The CCG said patients cannot be forced to travel to France and insisted it was an "additional choice".
They said patient confidentiality procedures would be the same as in the UK.
