A new £4m art gallery that would incorporate a tourist information centre and include a restaurant, could be built in Dorset.

Sherborne Community Arts Centre Trust hopes to create the venue on a site behind the town's Paddock Gardens on Newland.
The plans also include three gallery spaces, a coffee shop and a sensory or memory garden.
The town council wants a public consultation to be held over the plans.
An anonymous benefactor has agreed to fund the project which is expected to cost more than £4m, the trust said.
The group wants the main entrance to the venue to be created through Paddock Gardens, which is currently owned by the town council, and would involve removing one of its stone walls.
Up to five small "pod" galleries have also been proposed for the gardens.
The trust estimates the gallery could attract between 50,000 and 80,000 visitors a year.
The town council will discuss the plans at a meeting later in a bid to set up a public consultation at Digby Hall on Hound Street.
The town's current tourist information centre is based on Digby Road.
