Celtic's Leigh Griffiths ready to prove himself to Brendan Rodgers

Leigh Griffiths is ready to prove himself all over again if that is what it takes to be part of new manager Brendan Rodgers' plans at Celtic.

The striker scored 40 goals for the Scottish champions last season.
"Different managers have different opinions", said Griffiths as he picked up his third player of the year award; this time from SPFL sponsors Ladbrokes.
"The new manager will have his own philosophy and bring in new players but hopefully I'm in there."
"If not I'll keep working behind the scenes and when I get the chance I'll try and take it," he added.
After a successful loan spell at Hibernian from parent club Wolverhampton Wanderers, Griffiths was brought to Celtic by then manager Neil Lennon in January 2014.
After Lennon stepped down that summer, the striker initially found it difficult to force his way into new manager Ronny Deila's plans, often finding himself behind Anthony Stokes and John Guidetti in the pecking order.
However, 16 goals in the second half of the 2014/15 season cemented his place in the side, and laid the foundation for his goal-scoring exploits last season.
Now he must impress yet another new man in the Parkhead dugout, but Griffiths believes the arrival of Rodgers emphasises Scottish football is on the ascendancy.
"It's great not just for us but for Scottish football as well," he noted.  "It raises the profile - a big-name manager coming to Celtic.
"It raises the Scottish game. Everybody says its poor but the calibre of manager we've just brought in shows it's not poor."
Griffiths had already received the PFA Scotland and Scottish Football Writers Association player of the year accolades, and was happy to make it a hat-trick with the League sponsors prize.
"You never get tired of winning these awards. I got the phone call the other day to say I'd won it and it just tops off a great season."
