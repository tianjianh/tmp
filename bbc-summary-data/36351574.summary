It made landfall at noon local time (06:00 GMT) on Saturday, causing floods, landslides and submerging homes.
The storm system has since weakened but heavy rainfall is continuing.
Low-lying Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to flooding and has seen frequent deadly cyclones.
The authorities took over 500,000 people into shelters as Roanu hit.
Among those who died were a mother and daughter who were killed in a landslide in southern Chittagong district, which bore the brunt of the storm, AFP reported.
Several ports have been closed and power lines are down across the country.
The full extent of the damage is not expected to be known until Sunday.
