Secondary schools to close in education overhaul

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two comprehensive schools in Powys could close as part of an overhaul of secondary education in the county.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council is considering plans to close Gwernyfed and Brecon high schools and replace them with a Â£50m education campus in Brecon.
Under the plans, Welsh-medium education would be provided at a bilingual school in mid Powys, currently Builth Wells High School.
The measures are to address falling school rolls and financial pressures.
