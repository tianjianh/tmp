Temporary road opens on storm-hit A93

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A temporary road to replace part of the A93 which collapsed during the recent floods has opened to all traffic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A section of the carriageway, near Crathie in Aberdeenshire, was washed away following Storm Frank.
Work on the 20mph diversion route at Micras started on 6 January.
The reopening followed repairs to the nearby Invercauld Bridge, which left the village of Braemar isolated when flood damage forced its closure.
The temporary road near Crathie means motorists heading between Braemar and the rest of Aberdeenshire no longer have to take a 120-mile diversion via Blairgowrie.
The new section of road has been built on adjacent fields. Aberdeenshire Council said a permanent rebuild of the section would be completed in due course.
