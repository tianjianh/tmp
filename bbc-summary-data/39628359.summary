[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arthur Roy Taylor, from Lancashire, left his accommodation at about 09:30 BST on Saturday to take his boat out from Gwbert boat club in Ceredigion.
His dinghy was found on Sunday but Mr Taylor is "still unaccounted for".
Police have continued land searches on Tuesday.
Mr Taylor used to live in the Cardigan area before moving to Lancashire, but was a frequent visitor because of his association with the Teifi Boating Club.
Police have appealed for information from anyone who saw him Saturday morning before he left the boat club or while he was on the water.
While air searches have finished, police continue to patrol the land with coastguard staff ready to help if needed.
Sgt Gareth Jones of Dyfed-Powys Police called for walkers on the coastal path in Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire to keep an eye out for signs of the missing sailor.
He said anyone who "saw someone in distress" in the area at the weekend should get in touch.
