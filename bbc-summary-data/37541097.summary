His wife Claire went into labour several hours before kick-off, but Cushing chose to be on the sidelines as Man City won 1-0 after extra time.
After the win he said he did not know if his daughter had been born yet.
But Cushing had time to collect the silverware and get back for the birth.
Victory completed a domestic double for City, seven days after the club claimed its first Women's Super League title.
