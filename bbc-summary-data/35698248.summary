[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Widnes returned to the top of the Super League table after a convincing win over Hull KR, who named James Webster as interim boss after the loss.

Rovers opened the scoring through Maurice Blair but Rhys Hanbury showed quick hands to level.
The Vikings went ahead when Joe Mellor sped through, only for Thomas Minns to cut through the Widnes line and score.
Mellor restored Widnes' lead and Corey Thompson touched down twice, before a late Ryan Shaw score for Rovers.
Widnes failed to make the Super 8's last season but have started 2016 in fine fashion, beating Wakefield, Leeds and Salford before overcoming Hull KR.
Former Wakefield head coach Webster succeeds Chris Chester at Rovers, with the side sitting one spot and one point ahead of pointless Huddersfield at the foot of Super League.
Ex-hooker Webster spent three years as a player at Rovers and was the head of the  after he parted company as Wakefield head coach.
Widnes head coach Denis Betts:
"We scored some fantastic tries and we worked really hard. It was a good win in difficult conditions but there is still much more in us.
"Joe Mellor was the best player on the pitch by a country mile and it's good for us to play scrappy at times and still win.
"You have to win games that are messy but it was a real physical battle."
Head of rugby Jamie Peacock on the appointment of James Webster:
"James is very astute, punches above his weight and understands the DNA of this club.
"It's a great opportunity for him but Willie Poching and David Hodgson will stay as assistants."
Widnes: Hanbury, Thompson, Bridge, Runciman, Marsh, Mellor, Brown, O'Carroll, White, Dudson, Dean, Houston, Cahill.
Substitutes: Farrell, Manuokafoa, Leuluai, Whitley.
Hull KR: Cockayne, Sio, Salter, Thornley, Shaw, Marsh, Blair, Walker, Lawler, Tilse, Clarkson, Greenwood, Allgood.
Substitutes: Holker, Mulhern, Minns, Moran.
