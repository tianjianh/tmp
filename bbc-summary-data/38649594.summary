It is understood police officers went to a secondary school in Irvine on Monday as part of an investigation into Facebook messages.
A police spokeswoman said a 17-year-old boy had been detained in connection with an alleged offence under the Communications Act.
He was expected to appear at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court later.
The Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that on Monday, January 16, police received a report of an alleged offence contrary to the Communications Act 2003.
"As a result of police enquiries, a 17-year-old boy was arrested in connection with the incident.
"A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal."
A spokesman for North Ayrshire Council said: "As the matter is now subject to court proceedings, it would be inappropriate for the council to comment."
