Stornoway's HebCelt 'generated £20m in 20 years'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Hebridean Celtic Festival has generated £20m for the Scottish economy over the last 20 years, the event's organisers have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Since the first HebCelt 20 years ago, 202,000 people have attended the festival in Stornoway in Lewis.
Organisers calculated the economic impact by looking at takings at bars, restaurants and cafes and money spent on hotel bookings and transport.
The 20th anniversary festival will be held from 15 to 18 July.
