[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ulster v Glasgow (Sat)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ruan Pienaar makes his first appearance of 2017 for Ulster in Saturday's Pro12 home game against Glasgow Warriors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scrum-half has recovered from a knee injury and starts alongside returning Ireland internationals Craig Gilroy, Luke Marshall and Tommy Bowe.
Free-scoring Gilroy scored a 14-minute hat-trick for Ireland in last week's Six Nations win over Italy in Rome.
Glasgow back Peter Horne returns from injury while new signing Brandon Thomson makes his debut.
Mark Bennett and Simone Favaro return for the Warriors from international duty with Scotland and Italy respectively.

Stuart Olding and Charles Piutau are ruled out for Ulster while Pete Browne and Franco van der Merwe form a new second-row.
Sean Reidy replaces Robbie Diack in the back row, one of eight changes from last week's 24-18 victory over Edinburgh.
Callum Black replaces Andrew Warwick at loose-head with Kieran Treadwell dropping out of the second-row to provide cover on the bench.
Pienaar has not played since sustaining a knee injury in the New Year's Eve Pro12 fixture away to Leinster and his return is a massive boost as Ulster attempt to go ahead of Glasgow in fifth place.
Meanwhile, Thomson makes his Warriors debut after signing on loan from the Stormers this month. The 21-year-old is primarily a fly-half, but starts for Gregor Townsend's side at full-back in one of seven personnel changes from last Friday's home defeat by Scarlets.
Veteran Sean Lamont replaces Rory Hughes on the left wing, while Bennett comes in for the injured Sam Johnson in midfield.
Horne has recovered from the ankle injury he sustained in December and will take the place of Rory Clegg at fly-half, a day after signing a new three-year contract at the club.
In the pack, with Pat MacArthur injured, James Malcolm starts at hooker, and is joined in the front-row by Tonga tight-head Sila Puafisi.
The second-row duo of Scott Cummings and Brian Alainu'uese is unchanged, while Favaro replaces Chris Fusaro on the open-side flank.
"I've got the thank the medical team around me," Horne said of his return to action. "I've been pretty strict with my recovery and I always try to be. It's paid off and it's great to be back.
"I don't feel like I've rushed back, I probably could have played last weekend but we decided to be cautious. It's been a great week this week.
"I'm so excited to be back playing, I feel like my season has just never really got going. I'm really excited to get a clean bill of health.
"We pride ourselves on this time of year, when we do lose a lot of our internationals and teams maybe underestimate us a bit, but we always come out firing and as a group we get even closer, the boys that are here. We're desperate to make a big statement this weekend.
"I think we need to win six of our last eight games to even give us a chance of playing in the play-offs so this weekend is a massive fixture."
