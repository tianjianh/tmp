[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Under-strength Derry City missed the chance to move into second place in the League of Ireland table as they were held at home by Patrick's Athletic.

Barry McNamee's superb pass set up Rory Patterson to strike Derry into the lead in the 10th minute but Keith Treacy levelled 13 minutes minutes.
Lukas Schubert also hit the Pat's woodwork but Derry keeper Gerard Doherty made a series of great saves.
Derry stay third, a point behind Cork City, who have four games in hand.
Fourth-placed Shamrock Rovers are now only three points behind the Candystripes after they defeated Longford Town 2-1 on Friday night.
Despite losing ground to their nearest rivals, Derry boss Kenny Shiels is unlikely to have been overly perturbed by Friday's result.
The manager was forced to start without injured centre-backs Ryan McBride and Aaron Barry which led to call-ups for Harry Monaghan and Conor McDermott.
Monaghan's lack of experience in the centre-back role was clear in the first half as was caught out on a couple of occasions but McDermott produced an impressive full-back display to win his individual battle with former Derry player Mark Timlin.
Patterson's goal came after a brilliant build-up with Schubert, Aaron McEneff and McDermott all involved before McNamee's incisive pass was followed by an accomplished finish.
After Billy Dennehy almost levelled within a minute, Schubert headed against the Pat's woodwork two minutes later in probably the game's turning point.
Pat's were on terms by the 23rd minute as Republic of Ireland international Treacy finished to the net after McEneff conceded possession near halfway.
As Derry lost their way in the remainder of the opening period, goalkeeper Doherty had to make three brilliant saves before half-time to deny two Christy Fagan efforts and a Sean Hoare chance.
The second half was more subdued with the superb Doherty saving a Dennehy effort and Niclas Vemmelund spurning a late headed chance for Derry.
