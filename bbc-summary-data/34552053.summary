Firefighters and ambulance crews had to resort to using Google Translate to communicate with a Russian nanny after being called to a house fire in Surrey.

The fire broke out in Churchill Drive, Weybridge on Wednesday, but the only person in the house was the nanny who spoke no English.
The ambulance crew suggested using the mobile app to establish if anyone else was in the house.
However, the nanny had left her glasses inside, which then had to be retrieved.
Tony Pascall, from Surrey Fire and Rescue Service, said: "It was a kitchen fire and the whole cooker was ablaze, but the lady in the house, a nanny, did not speak a word of English.
"We were rushing around trying to find out if anyone was in the house and we were trying to ask how she was feeling and where were the house owners."
He said two paramedics came up with the idea of using Google Translate on their mobile devices.
"The nanny could not read the screen and had left her glasses in the kitchen, we had to go back in to get them.
"It was quite amusing in the end."
There was limited damage to the house, the fire service said.
