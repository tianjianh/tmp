Kristoffer Ajer says he has joined Celtic to show he can perform at a higher level.

Ajer, 17, will join the club on a four-year deal in the summer, after agreeing personal terms following a trial.
The midfielder has captained and been a regular for IK Start in Norway, but recognises he has to develop further to succeed at Celtic.
"I come here as a 17-year-old that surely no-one has heard about, so I need to prove myself," he said.

"I expect much from myself."
Highly-rated in his homeland, the Norway Under-17 cap revealed his decision to join the Scottish champions was influenced by the presence of his compatriot Ronny Deila as Celtic manager.
The midfielder did not seek assurances about Deila's long-term future at the club before committing to a contract, though.
"He's the manager now and that's what's important," Ajer said. "You don't know what will happen. Ronny's a great manager and I am really sure that he will be manager for a long time.
"Back in Norway, he won the Premiership and I will prove that I am good enough to play.
"I'm a full member of the A squad. I need to prove myself, develop and be good in training. Hopefully I will play a lot, that's my goal.
"I'm a holding midfielder that likes to be on the ball and win it back again. I've had many role models who I've seen on YouTube, such as Patrick Vieira - a great player in that position.
"At Celtic, there are holding midfielders who are so good that I need to learn from. I can't wait to start training with them and learn everything.
"I've played almost 50 matches in the Premiership in Norway and I felt I was ready to come to such a big club as this and develop as much as I can."
Ajer admitted other teams had been keen to sign him but that Celtic was his "number one club", explaining: "I wanted to come here.
"My parents have my whole life told me to keep my feet on the ground and never think you are better than someone else, you have to prove yourself," he added.
"I will [now return home to] take the driving licence and finish second grade at my high school, so I have many things to do back in Norway."
