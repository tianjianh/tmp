[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torquay United 0-1 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bruno Andrade's second-half goal was enough to end Boreham Wood's six-match run without a win as they clinched a 1-0 victory at Torquay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Torquay almost took the lead just before half-time when defender Sam Chaney was denied his first goal of the season as he struck a post.
That near-miss looked even more important when the deadlock was broken in the 62nd minute as Portuguese midfielder Andrade capitalised on a mistake in the home defence and slotted home his first goal in 11 matches.
Torquay had chances to equalise, but David Fitzpatrick curled a free-kick over the crossbar and Brett Williams fired over on the turn.
