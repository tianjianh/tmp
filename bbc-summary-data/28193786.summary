The FA Cup winners revealed the three designs they will use during the 2014-15 campaign at the main central London store of kit supplier Puma.
Arsenal's home strip remains in the club's traditional red-and-white colour scheme first adopted in 1933.
The away kit sports a familiar yellow-and-blue design, while a two-tone blue strip will be used for away cup games.
Southampton, West Ham United and Liverpool appear to have embraced the past with their new designs.
The Saints have returned to red-and-white stripes, while the new home shirt of the Hammers is similar to that worn in 1985-6.
Liverpool have gone for a yellow-coloured second away shirt and on Monday released a black and red third strip.
Everton's new home jersey features a retro collar, while promoted Queens Park Rangers have gone for thinner blue and white hoops.
Others to unveil this season's colours so far include Manchester United, Chelsea, Stoke City, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa.
Manchester United are in the final year of their agreement with Nike, who are thought to be one of three companies competing to win the new rights when the current deal expires.
