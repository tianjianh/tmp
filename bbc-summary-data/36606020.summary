County Championship: Ed Barnard hits 73 as Worcestershire rally to draw at Derby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nightwatchman Ed Barnard's career-best 73 helped Worcestershire escape with a draw against Derbyshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barnard shared a stand of 146 with fellow former Shropshire and England Under-19 team-mate Joe Clarke, who made 63, to help avoid an innings defeat.
Resuming on 24-1, still trailing by 279, opener Brett D'Oliveira was out in the first over of the day.
But Tom Kohler-Cadmore weighed in with 48, while Alexei Kervezee made 41 as Worcestershire closed on 294-6.
That denied Derbyshire a first home Championship win since the end of the 2014 season.
Derbyshire used seven bowlers but could not break the concentration of the two 20-year-olds Barnard and Clarke in their third-wicket stand.
Barnard completed the second first-class 50 of his career, while it was the fourth time England Lions batsman Clarke has gone past 50 this season, two of which he has turned into centuries.
The home side picked up 12 points to climb a place to seventh, while Worcestershire remain fifth, 19 points shy of top spot.
