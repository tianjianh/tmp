Division One's bottom side declared on 548-6 to lead by 478 runs, after Lancashire reached 70-1 at stumps.
Resuming 99 not out, opener Smith got to his hundred with a four off the first ball of day two and went on to his second first-class double century.
Ryan McLaren added 81 not out as Hampshire dominated for a second successive day at the Ageas Bowl.
Smith, leading Hampshire in the absence of England's James Vince, maintained his first-day patience as he batted over nine and a half hours for his first ton since September 2014.
After eclipsing his previous best tally of 201 not out (for Durham against Surrey in 2008), Steven Croft eventually had him caught at mid-off, by which time the home side were closing in on 500.
Lancashire paceman Saqib Mahmood took his maiden first-class wicket with the third new ball to end with figures of 1-115 on his Championship debut.
Gareth Berg had Tom Smith caught behind early in the visitors' reply but Haseeb Hameed and Luke Procter saw Lancashire through to the close with no further damage.
Hampshire captain Will Smith told BBC Radio Solent:
"I wanted to bat to give the team a sizable total and batting a lot of overs to put a lot of overs into their guys' legs is plan A work. It is always a grind with me, but they bowled well for the most part.
"To go so long without a hundred is pretty galling. I was annoyed not to get one last year. I have contributed ok this year with kicking on for whatever reason.
"We got a lesson from Surrey in the last game of how to go about a four-day game. They took the benefit of winning the toss to bat first. They executed their plan to a tee and we took inspiration from that."
Lancashire fast bowler Saqib Mahmood told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It is a flat wicket, but we stuck at it well and didn't let them get away. It isn't an easy wicket to take wickets on. Nicks are not carrying to slip and there isn't a lot of zip.
"I was saying to one of the lads when you dream about your first-class debut this isn't the wicket to make it on. But it will only make me a better player. It won't always be like this, there will be easier days.
"I have been working hard on some technical things and got a go in the white ball stuff. That went well so I think I have deserved my chance."
