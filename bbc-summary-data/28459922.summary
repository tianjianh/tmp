Duran Duran sue fan club company

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pop band Duran Duran have taken legal action against the US company charged with running their fan club over unpaid revenues, court papers have revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group claim they are owed $40,000 (Â£23,500) by the Illinois-based outfit WorldWide Fan Clubs.
The company had been charged with managing subscriptions and fan records for Duran Duran, with 75% of profits going to the musicians.
Its owners declined to comment when contacted by the Associated Press.
According to their legal action, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, Duran Duran also contend that the company - which operates out of the town of Glenview - failed to keep accurate accounts of fan club activity since they gained the contract for the work in 2010.
It also stated they have made repeated requests for the unpaid fees to be settled.
Part of their brief was to process subscriptions from fans, while their headquarters would also serve as a warehouse for the distribution of band merchandise.
They were entitled to keep 25% of proceeds for their activities.
Duran Duran were formed in Birmingham in 1978, with its core members Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and John Taylor still in the line-up today.
They have enjoyed a string of hits in both the UK and US, including Hungry Like The Wolf and Rio.
In 2012, they performed at a concert to mark the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in Hyde Park.
The band are currently at work on their 14th studio album.
