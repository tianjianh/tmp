High water levels have hampered the search for a missing man reported to have fallen into the River Nith.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called out at about 21:00 on Sunday after reports of an incident near the rowing club in the Greensands area of Dumfries.
Police have now confirmed the man involved is Bryan Cowie from the town's Queensberry Street.
Divers have been unable to return to the river after heavy rain but it is hoped they can resume on Wednesday.
Searches were carried out on Sunday night and throughout the day on Monday without success.
They resumed on Tuesday but without the involvement of police divers due to high water levels.
Police Scotland, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Nith Inshore Rescue Service and a coastguard helicopter from Prestwick have been involved in the operation.
Extensive searches have been carried out along the length of the River Nith downstream to the Solway Estuary.
