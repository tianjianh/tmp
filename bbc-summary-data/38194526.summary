Emergency services were called to the scene on Airdrie Road at about 10:45.
The boy was a rear seat passenger in a Ford Focus which was involved in a collision with a Mercedes outside a busy cafe and car wash.
The female driver of the Focus, aged 27, had minor injuries. The 35-year-old male Mercedes driver was not hurt.
Police said the boy sustained a serious head injury and was taken by ambulance to Wishaw General.
Airdrie Road was closed to allow officers to carry out crash investigation work.
Sgt Joe McGuckien said: "The crash happened just outside a diner and car wash on Airdrie Road - both of which at the time were full of people.
"A number of witnesses have already come forward and we have been checking CCTV in the area, however, we would still ask that anyone who saw the crash happen contact police."
