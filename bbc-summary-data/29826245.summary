The building was decorated with fake biohazard tape and warning signs.
The event was advertised as "Broad Street has been infected and is no longer safe!! All students must head to Bar Risa for Decontamination!!".
A spokesman for the club said the theme night, held on Wednesday, was run by a third party and management apologised for letting it happen.
"We will be donating all profits to Doctors without Borders and we wholeheartedly apologise to anyone we have offended," the spokesman said.
The event provoked both condemnation and praise on social media.
Some students called it "sickening" "outrageous" and "disgusting", while others claimed the theme was "only a bit of fun".
