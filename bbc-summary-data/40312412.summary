The operation is part of an investigation into the disappearance of a man over three years ago.
Allan Bryant, 23, had spent the evening at the Styx nightclub in the town on 3 November, 2013. His family believe he was murdered.
The new search, at a house in Barnton Place, was started on Friday. Uniformed officers are guarding the house.
Mr Bryant's father has said he hopes the search yields answers.
Allan Bryant Sr said: "My family have been waiting for something like this for a long, long time. We just hope there are some answers at the end of it.
"All we want to do is find out what has happened to our son Allan and get the closure we actually need, which we have been fighting for for over three-and-a-half years.
"The only thing that matters to us is actually finding out what has happened to Allan."
Mr Bryant's family have said from an early stage in the investigation they believe Allan was killed - and that his killer is still at large.
Det Insp Stuart Wilson, of Police Scotland, said when the search in Barnton Place began: "We remain committed to getting answers for the Bryant family and any information we receive from the community will be assessed and further action taken wherever appropriate."
In a post on social media, Mr Bryant Sr added: "To everyone who knows what has happened to our son Allan let this be a warning to you, the major investigation team and the police are doing everything to find out what has happened to our son."
