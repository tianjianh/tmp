The accident took place in the centre of the town of Rochefort in Charente-Maritime, at 07:15 local time (06:15 GMT) on Thursday morning.
French media report that part of a truck detached and sliced through the side of the bus, which was travelling from the Ile d'Oleron to Surgeres.
It comes one day after a bus crash in eastern France killed two children.
A boy aged 12 and a girl of 15 died on Wednesday when the driver lost control in snowy conditions near Montflovin in the department of Doubs.
As well as the six school pupils killed in Thursday's crash, two people have been taken to hospital, according to a statement from local authorities.
They have set up an emergency number for concerned relatives to call: 0811 000 617.
Family members of the victims have arrived at the scene.
According to regional news site Sud Ouest, the pupils on board were aged 16 to 18 and were travelling to school in Surgeres.
Both drivers have been taken in for questioning, it reports.
French President Francois Hollande tweeted about his emotion at hearing of Thursday's accident, and sent his condolences to the bereaved.
Emergency plans had been triggered and ministers Segolene Royal and Najat Vallaud-Belkacem were travelling to the scene, Mr Hollande's office said.
