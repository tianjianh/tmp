The alarm was raised at about midnight on Thursday when the men became stranded after their boat lost engine power.
Three lifeboats and a rescue helicopter went to the scene. It has been described as a "major recue operation".
Mark Barnett from the Lough Swilly lifeboat described it as a community effort.
"The fishermen had gone out in their boat around Malin pier and then decided to head a little east," he said.
"The fishermen are fine but had a lucky escape.
"They had been out for half an hour when the engine broke down and they started to drift.
"They had no mobile phone signal to raise the alarm."
