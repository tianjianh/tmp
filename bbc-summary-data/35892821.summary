The teenager was last seen near a deli on Saturday morning after setting off for her part-time hairdressing job.
Her body was found just off Great Western Road at lunchtime on Monday.
Police Scotland said a 31-year-old man had been arrested in connection with Paige's death. He is expected to appear at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Saturday.
Forensic teams are still present at the scene where Paige's body was found, just off the A82 Great Western Road, at about 12:45 on Monday.
Police Scotland said on Tuesday that they were treating her death as murder.
On Wednesday night, police cordoned off the Delicious Deli in Clydebank's Fleming Avenue where Paige had been last seen on Saturday morning.
They also searched and sealed off a flat in nearby Brown Avenue.
As forensic activity continued at both locations on Thursday, police confirmed that they had been following a positive line of inquiry and had arrested a 31-year-old man.
He is expected to appear in court on Saturday to face charges in connection with Paige's death.
The teenager's mother released a statement on Wednesday asking for the public to help the police investigation.
Pamela Munro said her family were "devastated" and called for public help in getting "justice" for her girl.
Paige's death has had a profound impact on the Clydebank community, with many people leaving floral tributes near the site where her body was found.
Two fundraising web pages set up to help her family had raised more than Â£18,000 by 16:00 on Thursday.
In memory of Paige, the landmark Titan Crane in Clydebank is being lit pink at dusk on Thursday until dawn on Friday.
West Dunbartonshire Provost Douglas McAllister said: "Our community is in shock at this tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with Paige's family and friends.
"This is a small gesture of support for everyone who knew Paige."
