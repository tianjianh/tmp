Newcastle United: Papiss Cisse fined and wished 'good luck' in relegation battle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United footballer Papiss Cisse has been fined for motoring offences by a magistrate who then wished him luck in his team's relegation battle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker's Senegal-issued licence was valid for one year in the UK, but he had been using it for three.
The 30-year-old, of Darras Hall, Ponteland, was given four points and fined Â£547 by Newcastle magistrates.
Chairman of the bench Carolyn Hyslop then said: "Good luck tomorrow."
Newcastle United play Swansea City at St James' Park on Saturday, in a game they look to have to win if they are to escape relegation.
The court heard how Cisse was stopped by police in Newcastle in February 2015.
Officers said the tinted front window of his black Range Rover was too dark, and ordered him to drive with it down.
At the time, police discovered Cisse's licence had expired and advised him to take a UK driving test.
However, he was stopped again in May and July, and was found to be still using the foreign licence.
Cisse admitted driving other than in accordance with a licence.
Nigel Hedley, defending the player, said there was some confusion over his driving licence, which he said had actually been issued in France.
Cisse had since been on holiday to France and passed a test there, he added.
