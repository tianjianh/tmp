[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 1-1 North Ferriby United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Chike Kandi's late goal salvaged a point for hosts Woking in their National League game with fellow strugglers North Ferriby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Woking's Fabio Saraiva shot just wide in the 35th minute after great work by Gozie Ugwu, but in first-half stoppage time Ferriby's Stephen Brogan curled a central free-kick over the wall and into the left of goal.
The hosts twice hit the woodwork in four second-half minutes, Keiran Murtagh seeing his shot deflected on to a post and Charlie Carter striking the bar from inside the six-yard box.
Rory Watson saved well to keep Ferriby ahead and the Villagers were boosted further when Max Kretzschmar's injury meant Woking played the closing minutes with 10 men.
But Kandi's long-range shot found the bottom corner in the 92nd minute.
