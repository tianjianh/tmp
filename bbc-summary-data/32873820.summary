In pictures: Shoot ball, not guns

Villa La Carcova is one of the most dangerous neighbourhoods in Argentina.

The area on the outskirts of the capital, Buenos Aires, is being fought over by two rival armed gangs.
Dozens of people are killed here every month. Gunshots have become part of everyday life, and children grow up hearing them.
But at a local church, children between six and 11 years of age are encouraged "to shoot ball not guns" as part of a social project.
Photojournalist Sebastian Gil Miranda documented the project at the Chapel Our Lady of Lujan.
His series of photographs won him first prize in the campaign category at the Sony World Photography Organisation this year.
Most of children who play football in the chapel's courtyard have siblings, parents or other close relatives or friends who are gang members, often on opposite sides.
And if nothing changes, they may well become the next generation to join the ranks of the gangs and face each other in future gang wars.
The project tries to offer them an alternative to allow them to escape a bleak future.
