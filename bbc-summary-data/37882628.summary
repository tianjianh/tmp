The Dane, who started the day six clear after shooting a course record 62 on Friday, had five birdies in his round.
England's David Horsey, who also carded a 68, is one of five players tied for second on 11 under par.
Masters champion Danny Willett struggled again as he bids to finish the season as European number one.
Willett needs to finish fifth to regain top spot in the Race to Dubai from Open winner Henrik Stenson but was joint 48th after a third-round 68.
