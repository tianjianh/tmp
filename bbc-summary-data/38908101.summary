Surrey Police: Children still need more protection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey Police is still not doing enough to protect children, an inspection has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A damning HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) 2015 report found the force to be inadequate.
A follow-up inspection reported "encouraging" improvements but advised more must done.
But Insp Zoe Billingham said: "The force [has] made a concerted effort to recognise and act on recommendations we previously identified."
Thousands of crimes 'not recorded properly'
During the latest inspection, Surrey Police was asked to rate its handling of 33 cases, based on HMIC criteria.
The force judged 22 to be handled well and 11 badly, but HMIC found the opposite; 22 were handled poorly and only 11 well.
Inspectors were still concerned about cases with clear risks of child sexual exploitation not being appropriately investigated.
In one case study, a missing child was found naked at a man's house, but there was no medical examination and no interview with the child.
The report found some vulnerable children were being labelled as "streetwise" and when they were reported missing "other enquiries and police work take priority over finding them".
Inspectors also said too many people were asked to attend voluntary interviews instead of being arrested, which "undermines victims' confidence in the police".
In most instances though, the report said the force had made concerted efforts to improve and just needed to follow through on change.
There were more staff but they needed more training, and relationships with partner agencies were better but the quality of information shared remained a concern.
Insp Billingham added: "I am very pleased that Surrey Police demonstrates a strong commitment to improving services for children in need of protection."
Police and Crime Commissioner David Munro said: "The road to recovery was always likely to be a long one.
"A solid action plan is being implemented and better leadership, resourcing and training has ensured that those key areas where failings were highlighted by the HMIC are being addressed."
