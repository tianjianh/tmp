[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers 0-1 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Cairney's injury-time goal gave Fulham a dramatic victory against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Rovers midfielder netted in the 94th minute after Ryan Sessegnon's cross was only half cleared.
In a match with few chances, Danny Graham beat the offside trap early on but the Rovers striker could only blast over the crossbar.
Cairney's late goal leaves Blackburn bottom of the Championship with just one point from five matches.
Fulham moved into second place in the table as they continued their unbeaten run in the league, but were lucky not to concede when goalkeeper David Button spilled Anthony Stokes' 20-yard shot before collecting at a second attempt with five minutes remaining.
Earlier, Whites debutant Neeskens Kebano was unlucky not to get on the scoresheet in the first half, as his rasping drive was tipped over by Jason Steele before his header from the resultant corner went just wide.
Graham squandered a golden opportunity at the start of the second half to put Blackburn ahead as his first-time shot was tipped just wide of the post.
And Fulham's persistence paid off as Cairney's left-foot strike, his second goal of the season, gave the away side a third win of the season.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"They're some very strong words but Tom Cairney can be a Premier League player. His quality, he's clinical.
"He's a player who doesn't lose passes. He normally completes around 90%. We know him, he played for this club though I'm not sure what style he played.
"We tried to find pace with the ball. We moved Blackburn from one side to the other side. We tried to dominate the game and I have to be happy and satisfied with what my team offered during the game.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle:
"I've been in the game long enough to know it can be a very cruel game and I think that happened. I thought our level of performance was terrific.
"We restricted them to very few opportunities. I thought, when we went, we had one or two chances ourselves.
"The disappointment of course is we've lost the goal that decides the game so late and we had opportunities to clear it.
"It's hard to take for the players and the fans because they were great, they got behind the team and really backed the players and created a good atmosphere.
"What I do know moving forward, if we perform like that and as we look to Wednesday to add to the squad, then I know it will leave us in a good place and a platform to drive ourselves up the Championship table."
