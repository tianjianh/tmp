[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull KR centre Darrell Goulding has been forced to retire at the age of 27 on medical advice after suffering a series of concussion injuries.

Goulding joined the Robins from Wigan ahead of the 2015 Super League season and played eight times for the club.
He said: "It's just sinking in at the minute but I've had a lot of great memories from over the years.
"I'm just upset I can't be part of the good times I'm expecting Hull KR to have here in the future."
Goulding, who made two appearances for England in 2010 and helped Wigan to a Super League and Challenge Cup double in 2013, is the second Super League player this season to announce their retirement because of concussion injuries.
St Helens half-back Lance Hohaia, 32, quit the game in April.
