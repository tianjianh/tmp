[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of Liverpool fans walked out of Anfield in protest at ticket prices as struggling Sunderland came from 2-0 behind to secure a crucial point.

Roberto Firmino headed the Reds in front after James Milner's clever cross before the goalscorer turned provider to allow Adam Lallana to tap home.
Fans were pouring out when Reds goalkeeper Simon Mignolet was beaten by Adam Johnson's curling free-kick.
Jermain Defoe completed the comeback after finishing from 10 yards.
Liverpool had striker Daniel Sturridge back on the substitutes bench after a damaged hamstring, but lost defender Dejan Lovren and midfielder Joe Allen to injury.

Reaction from Saturday's Premier League games
Reds boss Jurgen Klopp missed this game after an operation to remove his appendix.
His side's defending will not have done his health any good whatsoever as the Reds capitulated in the final eight minutes following the walkout by fans.
Mignolet was at fault after being beaten all too easily by substitute Johnson's set-piece before Mamadou Sakho allowed Defoe to turn and score.
It was the same old story for the Reds, who are still without a Premier League home win in 2016.
They are also still hunting a first top-flight clean sheet of the calendar year, having conceded 14 times in the past six games.
The Reds drop one place to ninth in the table, their inconsistent form not only testing the patience of fans but also hurting Liverpool's chances of qualifying for Europe.
Klopp's side will earn a place in the third qualifying round of next season's Europa League if they beat Manchester City in the League Cup final on 28 February.
However, their chances of qualifying via a top-five finish are rapidly diminishing.
They are 10 points off a top-four place and five adrift of fifth - having played a game more - after one win in six.
Sunderland remain four points from safety and have now gone 11 Premier League games without a clean sheet, longer than any other side currently.
But their late comeback will give manager Sam Allardyce and his side a huge lift for the remaining 13 games of the campaign.
The Black Cats still have to host Manchester United, Leicester City, Arsenal and Chelsea in addition to facing relegation rivals Newcastle and Norwich away.
However, Sunderland overcame the early loss of striker Duncan Watmore, who hobbled off injured, to claim a point that did not seem likely after Lallana's 70th-minute goal put Liverpool 2-0 in front.
Liverpool first-team development coach Pepijn Lijnders:
"In the last 10 minutes we dropped off too much and let them play longer balls.
"We felt that we were in control of the game and you see that one moment changes everything.

"There are still eight to 10 minutes where you have to be calm and play, keep moving the ball into the final third, so when you lose it you can counter-press and stay higher up the pitch."
Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce:
"You think your day is over when you are 0-2 down at Anfield. But we fought back with two quality goals and got a point by not giving up.
"It was never say die until the end.

"When we went two down it looked like the fear had left us and we played better with the ball. We created chances and it was the quality of goals that got us a point.
"We won't get goals back like that every game but today it was a precious point for us."
Liverpool are likely to make a number of changes for Tuesday's FA Cup fourth-round replay at West Ham United (19:45 GMT) before visiting bottom club Aston Villa (14:05) in the Premier League on 14 February. Sunderland host Manchester United in the league on 13 February (12:45)
