A new Brexit forum bringing together the UK and devolved governments met on Wednesday.
Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford represented the Welsh Government at the meeting, attended by UK Brexit Secretary David Davis.
Mr Davis asked for the governments to present their analysis to help shape negotiation priorities.
In return, he would share the UK government's "latest thinking".
Mr Davis also offered a commitment to hold Brexit meetings monthly.
"Naturally, there are different standpoints around the table, but the meeting was constructive and amicable. We will meet regularly and share our latest thinking as the UK shapes its negotiating strategy," he said.
The new forum was set up following an earlier joint ministerial committee meeting on Brexit in October.
At the time, leaders of the UK's devolved governments were told not to "undermine" Brexit negotiations.
Mr Drakeford said: "We have to be fair that today was a genuine opportunity to put our point of view."
He said the Welsh Government needed to understand how the content of such meetings was having an influence "elsewhere".
The finance secretary said he spelled out the Welsh Government's position on Brexit, calling for "full and unfettered access" to the single market.
Last week, First Minister Carwyn Jones told the Senedd the Welsh Government "will be a reliable partner" in the committee process.
He had said it was "disappointing, and damaging to confidence, that the UK government has been unable, so far, to offer a coherent outline of its broad approach to EU negotiations".
Mr Jones added: "The excuses for not doing so are running thin, and the credibility of the UK is not helped by prevarication and, it must be said, confused and mixed messaging."
