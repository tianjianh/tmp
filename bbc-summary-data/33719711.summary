Clark, 22, made his first-class debut against Hampshire last week after six limited-overs games, scoring 91 not out against Yorkshire in the T20 Blast.
The Cumbrian, whose brother Jordan plays for Lancashire, was Durham's second team player of the year in 2014.
"It's always been a goal of mine to play professional cricket," Clark told BBC Newcastle.
"Hopefully I can push on now and stake a claim to be a first-team player and a big contributor to the team."
