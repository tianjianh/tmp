[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Freeman scored a hat-trick as Jersey won their first-ever knockout match in the British and Irish Cup, beating Bedford 19-15.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flanker Freeman scored twice from mauls in the first half while Bedford wingers Pat Tapley and Dean Adamson went over to make it 12-12 at the break.
Bedford took a 15-12 lead thanks to Jake Sharp's penalty.
But with Camilo Parilli-Ocampo in the sin bin, Jersey took advantage as Freeman went over for the winner.
The islanders had never made the knockout stages of the tournament before this season, and will travel to either Moseley or Yorkshire Carnegie next week in the semi-finals.
Jersey were ahead within eight minutes at Goldington Road when Freeman rolled around the edge of maul to crash over.
The Blues, captained by former Jersey back Michael Le Bourgeois, were quickly level though when Tapley's superb run set fellow winger Adamson free to score.
Tapley's converted try in the corner soon after saw the hosts lead 12-5, but Freeman's second just before the half-hour mark made it all square again.
Sharp's penalty after half-time should have been cancelled out by Brendan Cope's penalty at the other end, but his seemingly straightforward kick went wide.
Bedford front-row replacement Parilli-Ocampo was shown yellow for an infringement at the scrum and four minutes later Jersey were ahead when Freeman was driven over from close range, with centre Lewis Robling then converting.
Blues had a chance to snatch the win in the dying seconds when full-back Piers O'Conor and Tapley broke with pace, but the ball was fumbled forward and the opportunity was lost.
Jersey know the prize on offer for a semi-final win will be a home final at St Peter in April.
