Vittek, 33, who is Slovakia's all-time top scorer with 23 goals, is injured.
Liverpool's Martin Skrtel is included in the squad after his injury-hit campaign in the Premier League.
Slovakia face Wales, Russia and England in Group B at the finals in France, with their first game against Chris Coleman's side on 11 June.
"The players' names for the nomination were clear so I had no reason to speculate," Kozak said.
