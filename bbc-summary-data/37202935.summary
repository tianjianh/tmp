[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 2-1 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Jones struck late to earn Crewe their first home success of the campaign as they beat Doncaster in a frantic finish.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Doncaster midfielder Tommy Rowe had cancelled out Ryan Lowe's first-half header with an 83rd-minute penalty in an open encounter at Gresty Road, but Crewe still claimed the points thanks to Jones's winner three minutes from time.
Crewe skipper Lowe raced in to head home in the 14th minute after strike partner Chris Dagnall delivered a superb cross to the far post.
After Lowe's strike, Steve Davis's side enjoyed a double let-off when Jon Guthrie sliced James Coppinger's cross onto the bar and then Rowe failed to finish Frazer Richardson's cross into an empty net.
Andy Williams also failed to apply a touch to John Marquis's cross as Doncaster were guilty of spurning their chances.
After being under the cosh, Crewe emerged brightly following the restart and Jones blasted inches over before Dagnall's shot was pushed away by visiting keeper Marko Marosi.
Yet they needed some brilliant work from Ben Garratt who clawed away Matty Blair's looping header away from the top corner.
Marosi was equally impressive when keeping out Dagnall's diving header.
Harry Davis was then penalised for a holding offence at a corner and Rowe duly beat Garratt from the spot to draw the teams level and seemingly earn Rovers a point.
But Crewe won it when midfielder Jones turned and fired in the winner in the 87th minute.
