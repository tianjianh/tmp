A children's football coach who took ecstasy for the first time died after falling into a Swansea river and drowning, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Miers, 21, was seen "confused and disorientated" after leaving a work's Christmas party in the city centre on 19 December 2015.
His body was recovered from the River Tawe almost three weeks later.
Acting senior coroner Colin Phillips recorded a conclusion of misadventure at the inquest on Thursday.
The inquest heard Mr Miers had drunk "the equivalent of three pints of beer" and had taken the MDMA ecstasy drug while on the night out.
He was seen with his "arms swaying" as he walked alone from the city centre towards his parents' home in Bonymaen.
Mr Phillips said: "It was Jordan's first timeâ€¦ and he would not have been used to the experience of taking drugs."
During the hearing, South Wales Police Det Con John Nicholls described the former Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bryn Tawe pupil as a "clean-living and popular individual".
As well as achieving 11 GCSEs and studying for a PGCE, Mr Miers coached children's football teams in the Birchgrove and Port Tennant areas of the city.
Det Con Nicholls said his interest in taking the drug had "come as a surprise" to those who knew him.
The inquest heard that the day before - on December 18 - Mr Miers had "an argument" with his girlfriend of four years and moved out of the flat they shared in Skewen.
Acting Coroner Mr Phillips said the post-mortem gave Mr Miers' cause of death as drowning while under the influence of MDMA and alcohol.
He told Mr Miers' parents Melanie and Christopher: "I am greatly saddened.
"It goes against the natural order to lose one's son ahead of his parents."
