The utility player, 31, will finish his on-field career with the Super League club and then take up a coaching role.
Currently with New Zealand Warriors, Leulaui previously spent six years with Wigan, winning the Grand Final in 2010 and the Challenge Cup in 2011.
"When I knew Wigan were interested, it was a no-brainer," he said.
"With my wife being from Wigan and us having a new-born baby, I thought for my family it would be better for us to be back in England.
"I've got a lot of close friends at Wigan and I really love the club and its history," he added.
