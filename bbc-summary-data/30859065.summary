If you believe her Twitter bio "never under estimate the Pricey" you would have seen this coming.

Katie Price has entered the Celebrity Big Brother house after Friday night's eviction of model Chloe Goodman.
She was brought in by producers after they removed Jeremy Jackson and Ken Morley  for separate cases of inappropriate behaviour.
When asked why she signed up Katie said: "There is always a price for the Pricey and the price was right".
The 36-year-old says the thought of winning hasn't even crossed her mind but what can we expect from the "businesswoman, model, author, singer,  TV star and proud mum" in the house?
"Hopefully they will see the real Katie Price, not the version of Katie Price a section of the press like to invent," said the mum of five who is currently recovering from a boob reduction.
She added: "That is why it's good when I do my reality shows.
"I haven't done one of those for a few years so it is a good chance for them to see that I am still the same normal down to earth person."
Katie said: "I don't really wear makeup and I am always casual when I'm not working.
"My hair will most likely be scrunched up on my head, no make- up, in my trackies or hoodies, that's me. I think people will be surprised."
Outspoken TV personality Katie Hopkins is also the house and she's had a few things to say about Price on Twitter in the past, including criticising the name of her youngest child, Bunny.
"That doesn't bother me, what she says about the name of my child, it's like, 'Whatever'," said the new housemate.
"But if they start picking on Harvey [who has autism, blindness, ADHD and Prader-Willi syndrome], like Frankie Boyle did, then that is a different kettle of fish.
"I might go in the House and become really good friends with Katie Hopkins; you don't know what is going to happen.
"I will take her as I find her and treat her accordingly."
