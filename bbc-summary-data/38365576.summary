Dundee FC has withdrawn its interest in a proposed £21m regional sports centre based at the city's Caird Park.

The new centre was to have provided training facilities for the club as well as being a training and competition venue for other sports.
The club said it was now working with Dundee City Council to find an alternative location.
An amended planning application for the sport centre is likely to be submitted early next year.
Dundee City Council leader Ken Guild said: "The football club withdrawing its interest has given us an opportunity to take another look at the site and see if there is another way to lay out the facilities that we want to have there in a more efficient and effective way.
"It will also offer an opportunity to locate the new facilities further away from potentially sensitive areas within the park.
"The eastern end of Caird Park is still an ideal location for this impressive centre where it will integrate with the existing athletics stadium and velodrome."
Dundee FC managing director John Nelms said: "The club maintains a good relationship with the council and we continue to work alongside them in relation to an alternative location for the club facility."
Sports including badminton, basketball, netball, rugby and volleyball will be provided for in the new building.
Objectors to the centre have highlighted concerns over protected species in the area.
