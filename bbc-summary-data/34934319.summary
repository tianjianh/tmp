[SN]TITLE[SN]
Irish Farmers' Association to challenge Pat Smith severance package

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior members of the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) have voted to challenge a severance package for its former general secretary, thought to be worth two million euros (£1.4m).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision to "use all legal avenues" to pursue the settlement for Pat Smith was made during a 17-hour emergency meeting of its executive council.
IFA president Eddie Downey resigned on Wednesday after more than 25 years with the organisation.
Two days earlier, he had agreed to stand back from his role while a review of pay within the organisation was carried out.
It had emerged that Mr Downey was earning 147,000 euros (£103,500) a year, while Mr Smith's annual pay was reported to be as high as 535,000 euros (£377,000) - a lump sum of one million euros (£700,000) followed by 100,000 euros (£70,000) a year over the next 10 years.
During Wednesday's meeting, motions were tabled seeking the resignations of the whole executive board, but it was agreed to delay any decision.
The IFA's former chief economist, Con Lucey, is to carry out a review of corporate governance and remuneration issues, and will report on his findings to the executive council on 15 December.
