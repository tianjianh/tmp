Super League: Salford Red Devils 12-26 Catalans Dragons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catalans Dragons maintained their improved Super League away form this season by winning at Salford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dragons led 12-4 at the break after scores from Tony Gigot and Eloi Pelissier either side of George Griffin's unconverted try for Salford.
After the first of Dave Taylor's two tries, home winger Greg Johnson then crossed twice in six minutes.
But they too went unconverted, while Pat Richards improved Taylor's second late try for his fifth kick of the day.
On top of the former Wigan Man of Steel winner's strike rate of three out of four conversions, his two penalties helped the Dragons stretch clear to win by a 16-point margin.
Pelissier needed a dislocated finger put back in place early in the second half but did not allow the injury to stop his all-action display, capped by his 26th-minute try when he strolled over to take advantage of casual marking at dummy-half.
After starting the season with a narrow defeat at Wigan, the Catalans' first win at Salford for five years - with former Reds scrum-half Richie Myler in the team - was this season's third straight away victory.
That is a marked improvement on last season's record when they won just once across the English Channel.
Salford's second home defeat of the campaign, on winter signing Gareth O'Brien's 100th career appearance, is their fourth loss in five matches.
Salford coach Ian Watson:
"We made a lot of fundamental errors and there were a lot of silly things out there. If we had completed our sets we could easily have won that game.
"We missed the jump on certain things and our organisation wasn't great. We did not get the opportunity to get to the right points and play the right system. We fell off what we have been doing.
"We conceded a couple of soft tries and that's a concentration thing."
Catalans coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"Our attitude and commitment were very good.
"It seems we have now found a way to win away from home.
"Eloi Pelissier, Greg Mounis and Remi Casty carried off from where they left off at Huddersfield five days ago."
