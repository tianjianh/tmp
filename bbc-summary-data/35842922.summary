The controversial MP looked relaxed during the hearing at a secure courtroom near Schiphol airport.
Mr Wilders is the leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV) and has often spoken out against Islam and immigration to the Netherlands.
His full trial is due to start on 31 October.
The charges date back to a rally in The Hague in March 2014.
Mr Wilders asked supporters if they wanted more or fewer Moroccans there.
When they chanted "fewer, fewer," Mr Wilders said: "We'll organise that."
Prosecutor Wouter Bos told the court that freedom of speech was of great importance, but it was not an absolute.
Mr Wilders's legal team is demanding an investigation into how its draft opening statement was leaked to a Dutch newspaper.
His lawyer told the judges that the case should be stopped so the investigation into the leak could be completed.
On his way to court, Mr Wilders tweeted: "No one will silence me. No terrorist, no prime minister and no court either."
In 2011, Mr Wilders was acquitted of incitement after being accused of encouraging hatred towards Muslims.
