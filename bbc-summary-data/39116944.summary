[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Down doctor struck off medical register

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Down doctor, who falsified clinical trials, has been struck off the medical register.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hugh McGoldrick, Crossgar Road East in Crossgar, County Down, has 28 days to appeal the decision.
Last April, the 59-year old admitted two charges of falsifying drug trials on patients with sleeping disorders.
He was jailed for nine months and fined Â£10,000 in June 2016, but appealed. His sentence was suspended and he was released from jail six days later.
The offences took place at McGoldrick's Pound Lane GP practice in Downpatrick between 2007 and 2008.
In a statement on Tuesday, his lawyers said he "does not accept the tribunal findings and has every intention of contesting them".
