Norwich's best hope of promotion this season is likely to be through the play-offs, boss Alex Neil has admitted.

The Canaries lost 2-1 to promotion rivals Huddersfield on Friday and are 15 points behind second-placed Brighton after the top two won at the weekend.
Norwich are currently four points outside the Championship's top six.
"The way things are going at the moment for us and the way they're going it looks highly unlikely we'll catch the top two," Neil told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"It looks as if the play-offs might be our best option."
Neil was speaking straight after Friday's defeat at Carrow Road, which came courtesy of two goals by Terriers winger Elias Kachunga, and said his side need to show real improvement to achieve an instant return to the Premier League following relegation last season.
The 35-year-old added: "It's going to be extremely difficult, it's a mammoth task and we're certainly going to have to raise our bar to be able to achieve it."
