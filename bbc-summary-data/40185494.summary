A Moray polling station has had to be changed due to flooding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The village hall for the twin villages of Garmouth and Kingston is believed to have suffered under-floor flooding due to the recent heavy rainfall.
Moray Council said Thursday's polling place would now be set up in the lounge of the Garmouth Hotel.
Polling will take place from 07:00 to 22:00 and signage will be in place at the village hall redirecting voters to the hotel.
