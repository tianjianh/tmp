Epsom Derby 2017: £1.625m purse for the Classic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2017 Derby at Epsom will be the richest race ever staged in Britain after two horses were added as late entries at a cost of £85,000 each.

The addition of Permian, who was successful in the Dante Stakes at York, and last week's Goodwood winner Khalidi, means the total purse for the Classic on 3 June will be £1.625m.
The John Gosden-trained Cracksman is the favourite.
Cracksman beat Permian in the Derby Trial in April.
Meanwhile, trainer John Jenkins has defended his owner's decision to run 1,000-1 outsider Diore Lia, where she will be ridden by apprentice Gina Mangan.
Diore Lia has made just two competitive appearances to date, beating only one rival on her Epsom debut late last month before finishing down the field at Lingfield.
Owner-breeder Richard Aylward is keen to let his filly take her chance to generate publicity and funds for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.
"If I didn't run her, someone else would. The owner is keen to run her and has set up a charity. He's there for the big day," said Jenkins.
"I had a runner in the Derby a long time ago. That was an outsider as well and it didn't finish last.
"Has there ever been a 1,000-1 winner of the Derby?"
