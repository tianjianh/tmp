Using nearly five-years of mapping data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the space agency has created footage showing what it is like on the far side.
The far side of the Moon is home to a scarred area known as the South Pole-Aitken.
It's one of the largest and oldest craters in the solar system.
