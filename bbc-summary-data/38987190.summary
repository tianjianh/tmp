Export data showed the overall value of food and drink sales to Japan rose by 9% in 2015 to Â£98.7m.
Whisky exports increased by 18% to Â£75.8m, making the nation Scotland's 14th largest market for whisky.
The figures were highlighted by External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop during a trip to Tokyo.
Speaking at a Scottish food and drink fair in the Japanese city, Ms Hyslop said: "Scotland has a fantastic larder of some of the world's best natural produce, a flair for innovation and a long-standing reputation for producing top-quality food and drink, so it is no surprise our food and drink industry is enjoying significant success in the Japanese market."
She added: "We are committed to building on this success and strengthening relationships with major food distributors and retailers across Japan."
