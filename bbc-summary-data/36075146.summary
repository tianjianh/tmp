Distiller Edrington to close Perth office and open Glasgow HQ

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major Scotch whisky distiller is to close its Perth office and move to a new Glasgow headquarters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up to 21 redundancies are expected at Edrington, the maker of The Macallan and The Famous Grouse.
A total of 90 jobs are being moved from Perth and more than 50 roles will move from the distillery and office in the west of Glasgow.
The new headquarters office has not been chosen yet, and the move is planned for early next year.
Edrington's existing site near Drumchapel is currently the base for its executive team.
When the new headquarters is set up, almost 200 people will be left working on productions and operations at the existing Glasgow site.
Eight jobs will be lost from the Drumchapel base while 13 redundancies are expected at the Perth office in West Kinfauns.
The move will bring onto one site the executive board, finance, legal, corporate affairs, human resources, management of global operations, and some information technology.
The company's other six sites across Scotland will not be affected while it continues to build a new distillery and visitor centre for The Macallan on Speyside.
Edrington's main whisky brands are Famous Grouse, Cutty Sark, The Macallan, Highland Park as well as Snow Leopard vodka and Brugal rum, made in the Dominican Republic.
The firm employs 3,000 people, 70% of them overseas, many with distribution operations and joint ventures.
The distiller was founded in Glasgow in 1861 by William Robertson and John Baxter. It is now the largest Scotland-based whisky distiller.
As a private, independent company, its profits go to the Robertson Trust, set up in 1961 by descendants of William Robertson.
The trust distributes them to Scottish charities, last year handing out more than Â£16m in 571 donations.
Chief executive Ian Curle said:  "This development will not only secure our position as one of Scotland's leading businesses, but also help us to continue investing in our premium brands at home and abroad, which in turn contributes to the on-going success of Scotch whisky, Scottish exports and the Scottish economy."
