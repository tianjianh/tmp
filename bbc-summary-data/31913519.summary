Ashley Young says Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has helped revive his hopes of an England recall.

Winger Young won the last of his 30 caps against Ukraine in September 2013.
But his form under Van Gaal has led to suggestions England coach Roy Hodgson might end that exile when he names his squad on 19 March for the games against Lithuania and Italy.
"The manager has been fantastic," said Young. "He gives you the confidence to play and confidence helps massively."
He added:  "I can only repay him with my performances on the pitch. That is what I have shown this season."
Young has been used as a full-back and at wing-back this season.
Van Gaal picked the 29-year-old former Watford and Aston Villa player in a more orthodox wide position in the 3-0 win over Tottenham.
Hodgson was at Old Trafford to watch one of United's best performances of the season - and a player who was an ever present at Euro 2012.
"Fingers crossed I can get myself back into the England team," said Young, speaking at a bwin event.
"I have always said I want to represent my country. It is an honour to play for England and hopefully I have done enough to get myself back into the squad.
"But I am concentrating on events at my club and we will just have to wait and see."
