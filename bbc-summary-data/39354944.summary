Massaro, the fifth seed and 2013 champion, defeated Egyptian qualifier Mayar Hany 11-5 11-1 11-9.
Matthew, who is trying to win his first British Open title since 2012, beat German Simon Rosner 11-7 11-5 5-11 11-3
Thirteenth seed Emily Whitlock upset eighth seed Alison Waters 11-4 11-7 11-9 in an all-English last-16 contest.
Massaro, 33, a former world number one, recovered from falling 4-1 down early on, saying: "She came out quite attacking and it took me a few rallies to calm things down.
"I needed to get some longer rallies into the game and I just tried to get on the volley, take the ball early and just keep the pace really high."
Whitlock, the world number 15, is through to the quarter-finals for the first time, and said: "I just didn't think I'd win. I'm pretty chuffed about it.
"I've beaten Alison once before in practice but it's never the same - tournament wins are just amazing."
