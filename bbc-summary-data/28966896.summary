The Bairns say they have received a club record fee for the 18-year-old, reportedly worth up to Â£1m.
McGrandles played 66 games in the Scottish Championship and has signed a three-year deal with the Canaries, with the option of a further 12 months.
"It feels brilliant to be here, a dream come true really. I never expected it to happen so quick," he said.
City's first-team coach Gary Holt is a former boss at Falkirk and managed McGrandles for 14 months.
"He was a big factor in me coming here. He told me all about the place and sold it really well," he said.
Norwich boss Neil Adams added: "He's a dynamic, combative player who can be used anywhere across the midfield, and he's already played plenty of games so he has the ability to compete at senior level."
