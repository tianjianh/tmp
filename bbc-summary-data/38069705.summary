The 10-day event runs from 20 to 29 January next year.
The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, Charlie Landsborough, Seth Lakeman and Hackney Colliery Band are the other acts to have been announced.
The festival will also see the return of the Le Haggis cabaret show which is now in its fourth edition.
Earlier this year, the festival announced a venue switch with the end of its Spiegeltent in Dumfries and the new use of the Easterbrook Hall.
Organisers said this year would see a "strong emphasis on family participation" with free tickets for some afternoon shows.
Lulu will perform a special Big Burns Supper show which will take place on 20 January.
Executive producer Graham Main said: "This year's programme offers something for everybody, with shows and events for all tastes and ages.
"We have tried to create a space where lots of different people can come together."
Proceedings will also see a carnival on 22 January on the theme of Tam O' Shanter with more than 2,000 people involved.
"Big Burns Supper is Dumfries at its very best - and we all play a part in that," said Mr Main.
"We encourage everyone to invite friends and family to come to the festival.
"We're having a party and the whole world is invited."
The full programme of events will be announced on St Andrew's Day at 17:59 - to reflect the year Robert Burns was born.
