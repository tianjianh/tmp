[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Villagers paying council tax are seeing their parish bills rise at a higher rate than the share they pay to larger authorities.

BBC News analysed the bills of more than 8,500 town and parish councils from 2013-14 to 2016-17.
Parish councillors say they are being asked to take on more responsibilities as their larger local authority counterparts make cuts.
The government said it expected parish councils to "demonstrate restraint".
BBC England's data unit and BBC Newcastle found:
Larger authorities are obliged to hold a referendum for any increases above 2%, although those responsible for adult social care are now allowed to increase bills by a further 3% for this purpose only.
Parish councils, which generally represent people with populations of less than 2,500, are not subject to the same cap.
Jonathan Owen, of the National Association of Local Councils, said: "England's 10,000 parish councils are being asked to do a lot more.
"They are being asked to do a lot more by their residents, by government, and indeed by larger councils who increasingly can't afford to run services they previously provided.

A Department of Communities and Local Government spokesman said it had consulted on extending the referendum principles to parish councils and would keep it under review.
He said: "Parish and town councils play a key role delivering services within the communities they serve.
"We expect them to demonstrate restraint when setting their precepts."
