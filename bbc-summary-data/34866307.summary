Alesha O'Connor, Rhodri Miller, Corey Price, all 17 and from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, and Margaret Challis, 68, from Merthyr Tydfil, were killed near Storey Arms, near Brecon, in March.
David Miller queried whether the accident could have been prevented if a "car had been sent to the party".
An inquest is to be held next year.
Coroner Andrew Barkley told family members at the hearing at Aberdare Coroner's Court the inquest could now go ahead as Dyfed-Powys Police had ruled out taking any criminal action.
Mr Miller said: "Apparently, there were three calls made to South Wales Police before the accident happened. A fair distance from where the accident took place.
"Could the accident have been prevented if a car had been sent to the party?"
The coroner said all issues would be addressed at the inquest.
He said the one-day hearing was likely to place next February.
An initial coroner's investigation in March was told the collision involved a green Volkswagen Golf and a black Volkswagen Golf estate.
The hearing was told Mrs Challis, a passenger, was in one car while the three teenagers were in the other car.
