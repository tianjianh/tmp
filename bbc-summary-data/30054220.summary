Inter Milan have sacked head coach Walter Mazzarri with the club lying ninth in Serie A, 12 points off leaders Juventus.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Napoli boss Mazzarri, 53, was appointed in May 2013 on a two-year contract.
But after steering Inter to a fifth-place finish in the table last season, Mazzarri has overseen just four wins from 11 league games this term.
The 18-time champions of Italy are unbeaten in the Europa League.
Inter Milan released a statement thanking Mazzarri for his "commitment, dedication and professionalism".
Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini, 49, has been linked in media reports with a return to Inter.
Mancini, who steered Inter to three successive Serie A titles during four years in charge between 2004-08,  left Turkish side Galatasaray after nine months in charge in June.
Inter's next match after the international break is the derby against AC Milan on 23 November.
