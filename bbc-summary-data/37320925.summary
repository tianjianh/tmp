Hull's caretaker boss Mike Phelan has won the Barclays Premier League manager of the month award after his side's surprise start to the season.

Phelan, 53, took charge of the Tigers when Steve Bruce resigned in July after a breakdown in his relationship with vice-chairman Ehab Allam.
He has yet to be handed the job despite winning two of his opening three games while using just 13 players.
Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling was named player of the month.
Phelan beat Jose Mourinho of Manchester United, Pep Guardiola of Manchester City and Chelsea's Antonio Conte to the manager award.
"It's an honour you don't expect, being caretaker manager," said Phelan. "It's a credit to the football club and to the players for all their endeavours that have given me this achievement."
Hull defeated Leicester on the opening day before winning at Swansea, and were only denied a point against Manchester United thanks to Marcus Rashford's injury-time strike.
Sterling, 21, had a poor Euro 2016 with England but scored twice against West Ham in August - the same number of goals as he managed in his previous 25 Premier League appearances.
Middlesbrough forward Cristhian Stuani won the goal of the month award for his 25-yard strike against Sunderland.
