Will UKIP Calypso get played on the Official Chart?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP Calypso, the political song performed in a faux Caribbean accent, has had a fair amount of airtime this past week.

Most, if not all of that, has been limited to news reports on radio and TV.
There is a chance though that the song will make the UK's Official Chart, leaving bosses at Radio 1 with an important decision to make.
To play it or not to play it?
A Radio 1 spokesman said: "The song is not currently on our playlist and, as the chart is compiled at the end of the week, we cannot say what will be in the Official Chart on Sunday".
The track's performed by former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read as an ode to Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP.
It was intended to raise money for the party, whose main political aim is for the UK to leave the European Union.
It includes the line: "Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10".
The song makes a number of politically-related statements, which we had a look over to fact check.
But following criticism that it was racist, Read asked the record company to withdraw the single.
"I am so sorry that the song unintentionally caused offence. It was never meant to, and I apologise unreservedly," Read said.
The song was number 21 in the midweek chart before it was pulled, meaning it's unclear whether it will actually chart in the top 40.
Excerpts of UKIP Calypso have been played on Radio 1's Newsbeat to discuss the controversy, but not the song in full.
The dilemma is not the first time Radio 1 have had to decide whether to play a song which throws up questions of politics, taste and decency.
In 2013, a clip of Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead was aired on the Official Chart. It followed an online campaign after the death of Baroness Thatcher.
