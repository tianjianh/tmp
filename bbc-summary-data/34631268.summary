More than 300 people entered Alternative Model of the Year with the winner being decided by judges in Newcastle on Saturday.
Vintage-fan Zoe Waters, 19, from Bishop Auckland, is a student at Newcastle University.
Ms Waters said she was shocked to be declared the winner. "I've always dressed a bit crazy," she said.
"I don't know why I wanted to be different, I guess I just always choose to wear what I like and look how I want to look rather than worrying about what's in fashion."
She said she now plans to pursue a career in modelling.
"I'm only 5ft 3in tall and I never wanted to look normal so I never thought I could actually be a model, I hadn't realised how big the alternative modelling world is."
Organiser Kieran Martin said: "There is a lot of prejudice and hatred for people from sub-cultures so we wanted to create something that would celebrate the different lives we have, we are proud of what we are achieving."
The final was held at Northumbria University in Newcastle.
