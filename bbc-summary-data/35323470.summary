A 90% increase in local taxes by councils in Cornwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some towns in Cornwall are almost doubling local taxes from April.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parish and town councils say they are forced into pushing up tax bills as they take on more services such as toilets and libraries previously provided by Cornwall Council.
Newquay Town Council has just agreed a 90% increase in its share of the council tax bill which will add about Â£100 to the average annual bill.
Cornwall Council said nobody was available to comment.
Money paid to Cornwall Council makes up the main part of the council tax bill in the county with additional components from the police and the town or parish council.
Carl Leadbetter, chairman of the finance and policy committee at Newquay Town Council, said the increase would "hurt some people" but was "necessary".
He said: "We need to build resilience against the cuts that are coming in local services from Cornwall Council."
Local authorities such as Cornwall Council can only increase their council tax bills by a maximum of 2% without triggering a referendum but there is no such limit on town and parish councils.
