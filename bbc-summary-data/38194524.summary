The body of 46-year-old Sharon Greenop was found by police in her home in the town on 10 November, after neighbours reportedly complained of a bad smell.
Earlier this week, following a post-mortem examination, police said they were treating her death as "suspicious".
The women were due to appear at Ayr Sheriff Court on Monday.
They were detained in police custody.
