Casino operator Crown Resorts says its employees who were detained in China last year have been formally charged with illegally promoting gambling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crown said in October 18 staff had been held after a police operation believed to target its marketing activities.
Among them were three Australians, including Jason O'Connor, a senior executive in charge of attracting Chinese high-rollers.
Casino gambling, and promoting gambling abroad, are illegal in mainland China.
The cases have been referred to Shanghai's Baoshan District Court, the company said in a brief statement made to the Australian Stock Exchange.
The Australian newspaper reported that the court has set a hearing date for 26 June.
Crown Resorts, controlled by Australian billionaire James Packer, said that with the matter now before the court it would not be making further comment.
