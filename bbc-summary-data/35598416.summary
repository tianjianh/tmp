Ex-England batsman Kevin Pietersen is not looking to play for South Africa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old has not played international cricket since being discarded by England in 2014 and could, in theory, be eligible to play for the country of his birth in 2018.
His friend and former England team-mate Darren Gough told Talksport: "I think he will be tempted, given how he has been treated over the past few years."
But BBC Sport understands Pietersen is not contemplating the move.
Since being told his England career is over, Pietersen has mainly played Twenty20 cricket in the various franchise leagues around the world.
He has appeared in county cricket for Surrey, including some first-class games in 2015 after England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves suggested he could be recalled to the national team, only for cricket director Andrew Strauss to reaffirm Pietersen's exile.
A total of 323 runs at an average of 40 in the 2015-16 Big Bash in Australia led to speculation the right-hander may be considered for the England World T20 squad, but coach Trevor Bayliss said Pietersen was not discussed.
