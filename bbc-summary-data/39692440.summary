[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Dave Jones has left Hartlepool United by mutual consent after the club dropped into the League Two relegation zone at the weekend.

Jones, 60, had seen his side pick up only 13 points from a possible 51.
Saturday's 2-0 home defeat by Barnet left them two points adrift in the bottom two, with two games remaining.
The decision came less than 48 hours after club president Jeff Stelling issued a message for Jones to leave during a live television broadcast.
Assistant managers Alex Armstrong and Kevin Cooper have also left, with defender Matthew Bates taking temporary charge of first-team affairs.
Striker Billy Paynter plus coaches Stuart Parnaby and Ian Gallagher will work as his assistants.
Jones returned to football to take on the Pools job after a three-year hiatus.
