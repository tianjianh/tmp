India v England: Liam Dawson targets all-rounder role

England debutant Liam Dawson said he wanted to be a genuine all-rounder, after making 66 not out on day two of the fifth Test in India.

Primarily picked for his left-arm spin, he made the highest score by an England number eight making their debut.
"I've never experienced this type of pressure before but I think I'm dealing with it pretty well," said Dawson, 26.
"It was a complete surprise to get the call-up, but I was happy to get it and I'm happy to do well."
Dawson, who has also played one one-day international and one Twenty20 for England, was added to the squad after the third Test because of an injury to fellow spinner Zafar Ansari.
He bats in the middle order for Hampshire and has scored eight first-class hundreds.
Indeed, with a first-class bowling average of 37.47 - higher than his batting mark of 34.17, the finger spinner said he will be looking to learn from India left-armer Ravindra Jadeja.
"The way Jadeja bowls is a learning curve for me," added Dawson, who bowled one over late on day two in Chennai. "I'll be looking to follow his type of speed and line.
"Becoming a genuine all-rounder is my goal. Batting is my priority but I was hoping I'd get at least an over to bowl this evening so that was great."
Dawson was struck on the head by India pace bowler Umesh Yadav from the second ball he faced and offered a leading edge past the grasp of Ravichandran Ashwin.
But he went on to share a partnership of 108 with Adil Rashid, the highest eighth-wicket partnership by an England pair in India.
"The first 20 balls were probably the most nervous I've ever been, but thankfully I came through it," he said.
"Whether you're playing in 50-over or Test cricket, it's still cricket. There are times when you have to adapt when playing domestic cricket in England, and you have to adapt to playing out here."
