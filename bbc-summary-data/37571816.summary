Work will begin at the old Waterside railway station site in about 18 months. It is hoped the project will be completed by 2020.
The station was chosen following the results of a public consultation in 2013.
Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard said it was "an exciting time" for the city.
"Over the last few years, much has been done to transform both sides of the Foyle," Mr Hazzard said.
"The new transport hub project will provide a train station that complements regeneration and transforms a historic building into one fit for use today and for generations to come.
"In about 18 months, some stage in 2018, we hope to be on site here and restoring this whole building.
"The project itself should take about two years and it is an exciting time for Derry," he added.
It is hoped that the new centre will encourage commuters to shift from car to public transport and enhance the local economy.
