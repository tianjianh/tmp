[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers went ahead on 24 minutes through midfielder Liam Noble, whose free-kick from the wing went all the way in for his first goal for the club.
Darren Carter doubled the lead when his left-footed strike left Chester goalkeeper Jon Worsnop helpless, giving the visitors much needed breathing space.
Chester pulled a goal back when Elliot Durrell finished from Jordan Chappell's through-ball with 11 minutes remaining, but it was not enough as Rovers overhauled Tranmere at the summit.
