[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anglesey councillors are calling on the National Grid not to erect more pylons on the island.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors were unanimous in their support to take cables underground as the company looks to connect the planned nuclear power station, Wylfa Newydd, to the electricity network.
The National Grid proposes using pylons between Wylfa and Pentir in Gwynedd with cables under the Menai Strait.
It is currently holding a public consultation on its plans.
A report to the council on Wednesday raised concerns about the potential visual impact of overhead lines on the island's tourism and local communities.
