The Royal Society of Biology wants to emphasise the "vital" environmental role played by the more than 20,000 species found in the UK.
It also wants to highlight the threats they face from pesticide use, habitat destruction and climate change.
Its experts have come up with a shortlist of 10 including the small tortoiseshell butterfly, the emperor dragonfly and the stag beetle.
The seven-spot ladybird, garden tiger moth, the marmalade hoverfly, black garden ant, buff-tailed bumblebee, large bee-fly and green shield bug are also in the running.
