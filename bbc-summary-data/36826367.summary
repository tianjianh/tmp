The Scottish SPCA said the birds may never be able to fly again after they were found outside its centre in Fishcross, Clackmannanshire on 12 July.
Staff are currently caring for the buzzards, which are believed to have been kept in the cage for "a considerable amount of time."
Taking the birds from the wild to be kept as pets is a criminal offence,
Centre manager, Colin Seddon, said: "The birds were in a filthy condition and, judging by the amount of faeces inside the crate, had been kept in there for a considerable amount of time.
"Sadly, the buzzards are unable to fly due to being kept in cramped conditions and at this stage it's too early for us to say if they will ever be able to fly again.
"It will take a significant amount of work on the part of our wildlife team to get the birds flying if this is possible.
"Then we will have to ensure they are in a suitable condition to fend for themselves in the wild."
