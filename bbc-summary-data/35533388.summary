The 2013 winner, who won Monday's opening stage, avoided a crash in the peloton but was beaten to the line by Norway's Alexander Kristoff.
Cavendish, riding for Team Dimension Data, takes a five-second lead into day three of the five-day race.
The second stage was a test event for October's World Championships in Doha.
"At the end of the day I was happy with how it went," said Cavendish.
"On that finish I can't be too disappointed losing to Kristoff, he is strong on that type of finish. I am happy to keep the jersey."
