League One side Gillingham have signed ex-Sunderland defender John Egan and Brentford striker Luke Norris.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both players are 21 and have signed two-year contracts with the Gills.
Egan came through the youth ranks at Sunderland but left the Stadium of Light earlier this summer after failing to make a senior appearance.
Norris turned down a new deal at Brentford and Gillingham are currently negotiating on a compensation package with the Championship club.
Norris, who joined the Bees in 2010 on a scholarship, made his senior debut in April 2012 and scored one goal in four appearances for the west Londoners.
He had two loan spells away from Griffin Park last season, scoring five goals in 12 games at Northampton Town and four goals in 19 appearances at Dagenham & Redbridge.
Egan, a Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, moves to Priestfield on a free transfer.
He enjoyed brief loan spells at Crystal Palace, Sheffield United and Bradford City earlier in his career and made 15 appearances for League Two side Southend towards the end of 2013-14.
