Turkington has a strong history with the team after winning the BTCC title in 2009 and 2014 with WSR, as well as making his debut with the team in 2002.
The Portadown driver split from his BMR team at the beginning of the year.
"It feels fantastic to re-join WSR for the 2017 season and I couldn't be more excited about my return," he said.
As well as two BTCC titles, the 34-year-old has 30 race victories with the team and has collected four Independant Title championships.
Turkington added: "From my debut in touring cars in 2002 right through to winning my second BTCC title, it's been like a second family for me and my greatest achievements in motor racing have all been shared with them.
"I'm confident our rear wheel expertise and shared work ethic will be a successful formula and allow us to fight for honours once more."
WSR boss Dick Bennetts said, "Colin, no doubt, is one of the fastest and most consistent drivers in the BTCC, we are looking forward to getting him back in the car and hitting the track."
Turkington finished fourth in the overall standings last year, taking an impressive five race wins.
WSR collected both the Manufacturers and Teams championship, meaning that Turkington and WSR will be looking to continue one of the BTCC's most successful partnerships.
