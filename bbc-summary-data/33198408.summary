[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Ross, 26, attacked Gavin Ross, 28, at his flat in Dunfermline between 28 and 30 April 2015, despite the pair having been described as best friends.
The pair had a row before Daniel Ross stabbed Gavin, who was recuperating after being treated for a blood clot.
Ross was jailed for life at the High Court in Glasgow after he pled guilty to murder.
Daniel Ross had been caring for his cousin who had been in hospital.
Advocate depute Alison Di Rollo, prosecuting, told the court that Mr Ross suffered 23 stab wounds, 11 of them to the chest.
Lord Turnbull said the jail-term would have been 18 years, but for the guilty plea.
The judge described the killing was a "vicious and prolonged attack".
Det Sgt Neil Seath, of Police Scotland, said: "Gavin had taken his cousin into his home as an act of kindness and was subsequently subjected to a significant level of violence, which led to his death.
"Our condolences continue to be with Gavin's family and hopefully today's verdict will offer them some form of closure and allow them to move forward."
