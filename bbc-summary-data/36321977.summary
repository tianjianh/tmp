An online teaser earlier this week confirmed filming on T2 had started, with a release due for January 2017.
The original cast has been brought together, along with award-winning director Danny Boyle.
Welsh was on set in Edinburgh - as was Robert Carlyle, sporting the white socks and loafers favoured by his bad boy Begbie character in the first film.
It has taken 20 years to reassemble the cast of Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewen Bremner and Carlyle.
