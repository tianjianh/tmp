Phil Armes, from Norfolk, was topping 120mph (193km/h) when he lost control and was thrown off his bike in 1995.
The 55-year-old, who is now paralysed from the chest down, said he hopes that 20 years on he can "prove his worth" and "get one over on the circuit".
He will carry out a demonstration lap before the main event later.
During the 1980s, Armes, from Hellesdon in Norwich, won titles including the 250cc newcomers prize at the 1984 Manx Grand Prix, and the 350 class at the 1986 Macau Grand Prix in modern day China.
In 1995 he was slightly on the wrong line and fell off his bike qualifying in Northern Ireland, crashing backwards into a curb.
He remembers the crash at the Dundrod circuit, including being rushed to casualty. As well as damaging his back, he also shattered his arm and wrist.
Two years ago he got back on his bike again, being one of 65 former Manx Grand Prix champions to ride a celebratory lap at the Isle of Man to mark the TT's 90th anniversary.
"I'm extremely excited and not just a little emotional about it," said Armes.
"Having that life-changing crash there 20 years ago, this'll be the first time I've been on that tarmac since, and I just have a feeling that it could be laying the ghost [to rest] - actually proving my worth and getting one over on the circuit."
