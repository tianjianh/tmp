[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The NHS trust running the world renowned Addenbrooke's and Rosie hospitals in Cambridge has been put into special measures after inspectors found it to be failing patients.

But is that the view of the people who use the hospitals' services? These people got in touch with the BBC to air their opinions.
Sue Munro said: "Addenbrooke's have cared for me all my life in a timely and efficient (and considerate) way. Without them I wouldn't be alive. They're great!"
David Harding said: "Are we really surprised, for years it's had problems and worked hard at covering them up, but patients and visitors saw the truth. Now it's in the open maybe something will be done to correct the problems."
Sonya Louise-Bubbles Pledger said: "I cannot say nothing but praise - the staff do a wonderful job considering their low wages cut backs and more population."

Paul Bernal said: "I was one of the victims - an appointment delayed three months because of computer problems."
Eric and Ern Col said: "My mother came out on Sunday. Hip replacement. Treatment and care was SECOND TO NONE! Brilliant staff!"
Sharon Goddard said: "Me too 'outstanding' care received so why in Special measures? Daft."

Phil said: "Addenbrooke's has become too big and too arrogant. The lower end staff do a great job but certain consultants walk around as though they are untouchable and unanswerable."
Carole said: "I am not surprised that Addenbrooke's hospital has gone into special measures. When my late husband, who had motor neurone disease, was in there for a week it was appalling. I worked in the NHS myself for 14 years and I am horrified by how low care has sunk."
Sue said: "Addenbrooke's may be a little slow with outpatients and yes it can be annoying, perhaps we should look at a bigger picture here, they do a BRILLIANT JOB and waiting a while tells me they have time to spend with each person, to me this feels good".
