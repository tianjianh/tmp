Wimbledon 2016: Andy Murray in form of his life before Milos Raonic final - Boris Becker

Andy Murray is in the "form of his life" as he targets a second Wimbledon title in Sunday's final, says three-time winner Boris Becker.

The world number two, 29, meets Canadian sixth seed Milos Raonic on Centre Court at 14:00 BST.
Murray is already a two-time Grand Slam champion, while Raonic, 25, plays in his first major final.
"Andy has been in finals here before and knows what it takes to win. He is the favourite," Becker told BBC Sport.
"He is in great form, not only in this tournament but the past few months."
Second seed Murray has breezed into his third Wimbledon final after dropping just two sets, both in his quarter-final against French 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
German great Becker thinks that could be an advantage to the Scot, who has spent two hours less on court than Raonic over the past fortnight.
Murray laboured through gruelling five-set matches in the opening two rounds at the French Open, eventually going on to lose in last month's final against Novak Djokovic - who, of course, is coached by Becker.
"Andy hasn't wasted any time or sets in the earlier rounds," said 48-year-old Becker, who watched defending champion Djokovic lose in the third round to Sam Querrey.
"If you look at the French Open he spent a lot more hours on the court than Novak and eventually it showed. He was physically drained and mentally exhausted.
"Eventually it is one match too many. But at Wimbledon he has done a professional job.
"He was pushed by Tsonga and that was the wobble. Naturally, you have to have one of these tricky matches before the final. In the other matches he has been flawless."
Murray, who won the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon titles, is playing in his 11th Grand Slam final, but the first without 17-time major champion Roger Federer or world number one Novak Djokovic in opposition.
"This is a great opportunity without Federer or Djokovic facing him," said Tim Henman, a four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist.
"Off court there has been a lot going on a lot for Murray - the Djokovic defeat particularly because everyone was saying 'this is your chance'.
"Even on Friday he would have been aware of what was going on in the match before him, where everyone was expecting Federer to come through into the final and then Raonic wins.
"He keeps overcoming these challenges and you expect him to do the same on Sunday.
"The consistency and intensity of his performances over the past three months has been amazing."

Raonic's biggest weapon is no secret - his thumping serve. But then it was also what Nick Kyrgios and Tsonga - who Murray dispatched earlier in the competition - were pinning their hopes on.
Raonic has blasted down more aces than any other man at this year's tournament (albeit having played twice as many matches as John Isner), while he also leads the top serve speed chart with a whopping 144mph delivery in his semi-final win against Roger Federer.
"He has the biggest serve in tennis right now," said Becker, who won Wimbledon in 1985, 1986 and 1989.
"The key will be how well Andy can return Milos' serves. The more returns he gets into play the more points he will get off the serve and the higher chance he will win."
Former British number one Henman added: "One of Andy's great skills is the return of serve and the key element is how he is able block the serve back. It will be absolutely vital.
"But when it is coming at 144mph straight at you, it is a very difficult serve to return.
"Raonic's serving has been amazing and will be the cornerstone of his game on any surface, certainly on a grass court."
Murray and Raonic meet in a grass-court final for the second time in a month, following the Scot's gutsy comeback win at Queen's Club.
Raonic led by a set and 3-0 before Murray dismantled his opponent's huge serve, breaking it twice in succession, to turn the three-set match around.
"At Queen's, Andy found a way to keep getting the ball back," said Henman.
"If they keep getting into baseline rallies where the serve is not part of the occasion then that's where I feel Murray, like he did against Berdych, can exploit Raonic's lack of movement."
Becker added: "It was an awfully close match and Raonic should have won. That will be in the mind of both players.
"Milos will have learned there aren't many better players than Murray on grass at the moment. Murray will know that is the toughest match he has had in the grass-court season."
Raonic is the first Canadian man to play in a Grand Slam final after beating Federer in an epic semi-final.
Even though he handled the occasion against the Swiss legend, preparing to walk out on to Centre Court for your first SW19 showpiece is a particularly nerve-wracking experience, says seven-time finalist Becker.
"The expectations are there, the whole world is watching and it is probably your childhood dream to be in a Wimbledon final and to win it," he added.
"Things change a little bit ahead of the final, in terms of all the build up and media commitments, but you want to keep your routine and keep your rhythm.
"If you get too caught in the moment you're going to get too nervous and you're not going to win.
"You have to keep calm when everyone around you is going crazy."
Lleyton Hewitt, the 2002 Wimbledon champion, believes Raonic has the cool composure to handle the occasion.
"He is a pretty level-headed guy. I think he will enjoy it and take it in his stride," said the Australian.
"When I played in my first Slam final - the 2001 US Open against Pete Sampras - I was thrilled to be there and just tried to enjoy it. I think Milos will do the same."
