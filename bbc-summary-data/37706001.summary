Coleman, 46, guided Wales to the semi-final of Euro 2016 - the side's first major tournament in 58 years.
He got the honour at a ceremony at the city's Guildhall on Thursday.
Coleman told BBC Wales it was "important" that he is still surrounded by the people he was brought up with in Swansea.
"The things that were instilled in me from a young age  - you hold onto the good things - and they have certainly stood me in good stead," he added.
"I'm so proud of the achievements of this Welsh team, so proud to be associated with it, and to be a Welshman."
Lord Mayor David Hopkins said: "Chris is a proud Swansea boy and a terrific ambassador for the city, so he's thoroughly deserving of being offered the highest honour we can confer."
Other people to be given the freedom of the city include Prince Charles and President Jimmy Carter, as well as footballers John Charles and Mel Nurse.
Following the ceremony, a celebration was held at Brangwyn Hall, which included a performance by James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers.
Mr Hopkins added: "Chris took over the Wales football manager's job in extremely difficult circumstances following the death of his close friend Gary Speed, but his achievements ever since mean the nation has truly taken him to their hearts.
"Nobody will ever forget what his Welsh team did at the Euro 2016 championships in France this summer. It was a magical time for Welsh football, with Chris leading his men to the semi-finals and setting the tournament alight with a series of inspired performances."
