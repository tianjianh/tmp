A Scottish Premiership football club fighting relegation has appealed to its fans to show their support at the team's latest crunch game.

Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC tweeted the plea ahead of Wednesday night's away match against Dundee.
The message included the line: "We have no right to ask, but be there if you can."
It was posted just hours after ICTFC's Highland rivals Ross County beat Hamilton 3-2 in Dingwall.
If Hamilton had won, the Inverness club would have been relegated to the Championship.
County made the game free of charge to watch to home and away fans.
