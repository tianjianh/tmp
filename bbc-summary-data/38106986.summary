William Thomas, 16, was found hanged at the family's farm in Llangyndeyrn on 22 August - two days before he was due to get his GCSE results.
The Llanelli inquest heard his parents have asked police to check his phone calls and text messages but they were unable to without his pin code.
The inquest has been adjourned until next year for the phone to be unlocked.
His father David Thomas told the hearing: "If it was the phone of a suspected terrorist I'm sure they would get into it.
"We are clutching at straws to find out what happened."
The schoolboy, a pupil at Ysgol Bro Myrddin in Carmarthen, was described as a brilliant rugby player and all-round sportsman who had been selected to train with the Llanelli Scarlets.
The inquest heard he passed his GCSEs with three A-grades, four Bs and one C and was due to return to school to study for his A-levels in September.
Parents David and Kelly Thomas said there was no reason why their son would want to end his own life but the phone could contain important information.
The inquest heard the phone was sent away to a specialist company but it could not unlock it. Apple were also approached but the phone remains locked and its contents are still a mystery.
Carmarthenshire coroner Mark Layton said: "I believe it's possible to get information off that phone and I will do everything in my power to get that information.
"It may answer some of your questions, it may not. But at least we can try."
Mr Layton said the police would send the phone away again to experts but he could force Apple to come to court to give evidence if necessary.
Adjourning the inquest, he added: "It seems to me that if the family want to know what's on the phone, then they should."
