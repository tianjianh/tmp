Rhys Healey: Newport striker taken 'out of the firing line' - Graham Westley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Graham Westley says striker Rhys Healey was left out of Newport County's starting line-up "to take him out of the firing line".

Healey, on loan from Cardiff City, revealed Plymouth Argyle had made an approach for him.
Cardiff boss Neil Warnock criticised Westley for allowing Healey to speak to the media about interest from Argyle.
"His form has definitely been affected the last couple of games," Westley said.
"He himself talks about his brain being fried by everything. He's a young player and he's not faced this kind of thing before.
"I just wanted to take him out of the firing line, rest him and have him available as a sub.
"He's sorted himself out I think. His mind will be back on doing a job for Newport County by the time we play again."
The 22-year-old's loan spell with Newport, for whom he has scored six goals in 18 appearances this season, expires in January.
Healey played in Tuesday's 2-0 home defeat by Stevenage but was left out of Newport's game against Morecambe, which was abandoned at half-time due to a waterlogged Rodney Parade pitch.
