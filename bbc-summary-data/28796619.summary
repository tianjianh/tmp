The England international, 24, has passed his medical and could face Arsenal in Saturday's opening Premier League game at the Emirates Stadium.
"I'd heard about a potential move at the start of the summer," he said. "Now is the time when I need to get back to playing every week."
Kelly made his Liverpool debut in 2008 and went on to make 62 appearances.
