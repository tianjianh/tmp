[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dominic Jackson, 35, was reported overdue after leaving from Portsoy in Aberdeenshire last month.
His kayak was found near Lybster in Caithness. His body was later found in the same area.
The funeral will be at Fettercairn Parish Church on Friday 17 March at 13:30. Donations can be made to a charity to promote sea safety.
The campaign set up by relatives - called PLanB - encourages the use of personal locator beacons (PLBs) and has already raised thousands of pounds.
His family have said they will be  "forever grateful" to the "brave and wonderful people" who helped in the search.
Mr Jackson was originally from Uckfield in East Sussex but later moved to Fettercairn.
