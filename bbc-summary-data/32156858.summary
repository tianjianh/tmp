[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton and Hove Albion giving young players sexual consent training

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Young footballers at the English Championship club Brighton and Hove Albion are being trained in the law and ethics surrounding sexual consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club is the first to provide the training and counselling to all its young male and female players.
In 2013 four current and former Brighton players were cleared of sexual assault charges at the Old Bailey.
The Protect, Inform and Prevent (PIP) programme aims to explain when, in law, consent can be said to have been given.
It involves players taking part in confidential question and answer sessions about their previous encounters and is led by a former police detective and a psychotherapist.
The Brighton players were all found not guilty in May 2013 of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman at a hotel in Brighton. They were also cleared of voyeurism.
