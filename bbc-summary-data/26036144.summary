"So, we were left with two to consider and we had a full consultation with the clubs involved, both venues: Celtic Park and Ibrox; and with Police Scotland and the broadcasters.
"The key determining factor was that, at Ibrox on the day before the final, Rangers are due to host Dunfermline.
"That's likely to be a live televised game and, in those circumstances, it just wouldn't have been possible for the broadcasters to de-rig on the Saturday and get rigged up in time for the Sunday.
"We've been left with Celtic Park and are delighted to be coming to Celtic Park, which has a huge tradition of hosting big European games.
"We're absolutely sure it'll provide a great venue for the first final for the Scottish Professional Football League."
Responding to concerns that the final would be well below capacity, Doncaster said: "It's always difficult to gauge at this point how many people will be there.

"Hopefully, there'll be many thousands of fans travelling from the north to enjoy it."
