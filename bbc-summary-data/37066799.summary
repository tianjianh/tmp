Commonwealth Games silver medallist Walker was 10-7 down to Simon Gauzy in the fifth game of the fifth match before he won five successive points.
Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford also won singles matches for Great Britain in a tie that lasted nearly four hours.
GB play defending Olympic champions China in the quarter-finals.
"We played in the team event this season in the World Championships where we won bronze so to come out and perform at the Olympics as well is an amazing feeling," said Walker.
"We knew it would be tough right from the beginning and there were times we thought we were down and out.
"It means so much to do it at the Olympics. To be part of one of the best games of the Olympics is a great feeling. I can't really describe it, but it's good to be in the next round."
The quarter-final match against China takes place at 14:00 BST on Sunday, 14 August.
