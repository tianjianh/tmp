[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Franklyn Mathurin, of no fixed address, posed as a mourner to gain access to the church last November.
The 47-year-old who admitted burglary, was described as a prolific thief who carried out a cruel and callous theft.
At Harrow Crown Court he was sentenced for two burglaries and breaching a suspended sentence.
The computer was taken from the Willesden church after the service when the congregation went to the cemetery.
It had been used to show photographs of Norris Tashan-Javan Martin, known as TJ, at Pentecostal City Mission Church in north-west London after he had died from a rare genetic condition.
After the theft on 2 November, TJ's family, said the computer contained "all their memories".
Nicola Calnan, from Crown Prosecution Service London, said: "This offence was particularly damaging as the victims were heartbroken parents who were mourning the loss of their young son and the laptop that was stolen contained some of their treasured memories.
"This was a cruel and callous theft and Mathurin has now been brought to justice for this despicable crime."
TJ had Candle Syndrome, a rare condition affecting the immune system. The funeral congregation of more than 300 people included members of staff from the Great Ormond Street and Northwick Park hospitals where he had been treated.
