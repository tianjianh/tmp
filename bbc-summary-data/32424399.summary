Fugitive ends 40 years on the run to get healthcare

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fugitive in Kentucky has turned himself in to authorities after decades on the run, so he can get medical care.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clarence Moore, 66, called police this week to surrender, after struggling to get medical care without a legitimate identity or social security number.
Moore was convicted of robbery in North Carolina in 1967 and made several escape attempts before disappearing in 1976 and starting life on the run.
He was in tears when he was finally arrested, police said.
"As soon as he saw us, he started crying," Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton said. "He said, 'I just want to get this behind me. I want to be done.'"
Moore has lived in Kentucky since at least 2009, and his poor health can be attributed to a stroke which has made it difficult for him to speak.
A woman who lived with Moore was unaware of his background.
"She was just blown away when all this happened," the sheriff said.
Moore was taken from his home in an ambulance on Monday. He was evaluated at a local hospital and then taken to prison.
When he arrived at the prison on Monday, Moore thanked the sheriff for his kindness.
