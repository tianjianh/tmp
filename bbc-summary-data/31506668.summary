[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures was seven-time World Superbike champion and reality TV star Carl Fogarty.

The Blackburn Rovers fan has tried his hand at predictions before, when he used his Twitter account to guess various football scores, initially with some success.
'Foggy' explained to BBC Sport: "I had this 'Mystic Fog' thing going on Twitter and got loads of results right - but that was two or three years ago. I keep getting them all wrong at the moment."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.
For the FA Cup fifth round, Lawro got three correct results from eight games, including two perfect scores.
His score of seven points was enough to beat both of his giant-killing opponents, Mickey Thomas and Nigel Jemson. Thomas picked four correct results with one perfect score to earn six points, while Jemson got two correct results and one perfect score for a tally of four points.
Lawro's FA Cup score does not count towards his Premier League average or total.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
