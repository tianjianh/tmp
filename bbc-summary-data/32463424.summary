More than 51,000 people will race the 26.2 mile course from Blackheath to The Mall past some of London's most iconic landmarks including the Cutty Sark.
Many runners will also be raising money for charity and hoping to beat 2014's record amount of Â£53.2m.
Paula Radcliffe, 41, a former winner and the current world record holder, will be running her final marathon.
In the elite men's race Wilson Kipsang is hoping to become the fourth man to win three titles while in the men's wheelchair race, home favourite David Weir is out to land a record seventh crown.
Many celebrities will also be running including Formula 1 star Jenson Button and Radio 1 DJ Greg James.
Athlete David Hemery, who won gold in the 1968 Olympic Games in the 400m hurdles, will be running his first marathon for 39 years at the age of 70.
But some runners have also given themselves additional challenges to just running the course.
For Rob Young it will be his 367th marathon in a year having decided to run at least one marathon a day after watching last year's event.
And Andy Wray will run having already cycled the 220 miles from Ripon to London in a rickshaw with two passengers in it.
This year the London Marathon celebrates its 35th anniversary.
In the inaugural event Dick Beardsley and Inge Simonsen battled stride for stride for 26.2 miles, crossed the line hand in hand and were declared joint winners.
