"Blodwen" was found on Llandudno's Little Orme in 1891 and ended up in Lancashire near the home of the quarry owner who found her.
A long campaign to see her returned has come to fruition with funds raised to open a dedicated exhibit space.
Llandudno Museum is hosting a special exhibition starting from Thursday.
Research of the bones suggest Blodwen, who died after falling down into a vertical fissure in the rocks, was aged between 54 and 63.
