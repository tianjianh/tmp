A Met Office yellow warning covers much of southern Scotland runs until 18:00 on Friday.
Scottish Borders Council said it had the potential to bring similar problems to those suffered in Jedburgh and Hawick last week.
It has warned residents to be prepared for potential problems.
Emergency planning officer Jim Fraser said: "The information we have from the Met Office is that a band of rain will reach the western Borders between 6am and 9am and will persist throughout the day, gradually moving eastward, but easing in the evening.
"Unfortunately, amongst that rain there is the potential for some extremely heavy showers, similar to those experienced last Wednesday.
"At this stage, predicting where these downpours will fall is impossible, but we will be monitoring the forecast very carefully over the next 24 hours and will liaise with the Met Office to get as much detail as we can.
"Thanks to the early warning for the potential heavy rainfall, we are putting plans in place to enable us to respond effectively to any impact this may bring."
