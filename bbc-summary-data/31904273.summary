[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tourist guide John Alasdair Macdonald captured his image on a compact camera near Dochfour at about 21:00 on Sunday.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency got calls from people in the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway and Cumbria concerned it was a distress flare.
Mr Macdonald described his images as a "fluke".
Mr Macdonald said: "I was taking some new pictures to put on my Facebook page using a Sony RX100 compact camera.
"It was a beautiful, clear night and I got some nice pictures but capturing the meteor was a fluke. I will never take a picture like that again."
Mr Macdonald, who runs the business The Hebridean Explorer, said he had seen messages on social media of a meteor being seen elsewhere, including Sleat on Skye.
Meteor sightings were also said to have been made from North Uist, Oban and Mull.
A "meteorite" mistaken for a distress flare also sparked a lifeboat search operation off the English coast on Sunday.
Maryport Coastguard Rescue Team said it received numerous reports of a moving red object over the sea between Workington, Cumbria, and the Isle of Whithorn in Dumfries and Galloway.
