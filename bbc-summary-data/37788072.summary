Suez Crisis: The MI6 secretary with a ringside seat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"I looked out of the window and there, each side of the runway, were the Egyptian tanks."

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jennifer Boyle is thought to be the last surviving person to have worked in the British embassy in Cairo during the Suez Crisis.
Aged 21, Jennifer left London the day the Suez canal was nationalised by Egypt's president, Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, arriving at the embassy on 7 August 1956.
Now 81, Jennifer remembers the "emergency telegrams flying backwards and forwards". Her short time at the embassy, was like "living the pages of history".
When she arrived as an MI6 secretary, the youngest by six years, "it was already at pretty good fever pitch".
Meeting the British ambassador, Humphrey Trevelyan, was "just like being presented to royalty", Jennifer wrote to her mother and father.
He was "rather small, with sticking out ears, but still he was very charming. He informed me that I had arrived in stirring times."
At first, the "general situation was quiet" and throughout "all Egyptians are charming," she wrote.
A few days into her work deciphering messages, Jennifer wrote again to her parents: "Nobody really knows what is going to happen. But underneath the surface, the atmosphere is pretty tense."
Everyone feels as if they are "doing things for the last time and therefore must get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of it".
Jennifer explained to her parents: "There is still no indication of which way the tide is going to turn out here. Although the tension and the work have certainly mounted and we have started burning some of the very old embassy records just in case. And what a frightful job it is, as every bit of ash has to be raked through afterwards."
But as the embassy staff shrunk and wives returned to the UK, Jennifer remembers "playing hard".
"There were nightclubs, belly dancers. We would get to bed at three o'clock in the morning and were back in the embassy at seven. I was having the time of my life."
"We got an allowance of 200 cigarettes and two bottles of spirits a month for Â£1. So it made entertaining quite easy."
"I was invited out to His Excellency's tent in the desert for a picnic supper," she wrote.
"Little did I dream that the first meal I would ever have with an ambassador would be sitting in the middle of the desert chewing chicken bones in one's fingers.
"Lady Trevelyan is now the only wife left down here. If only things would just quieten down a little, we would have the most glorious time as there are so many unattached males wandering around and just no girls!
"Only at the moment one might just as well have a bed in one's office. I only tell you all this just in case anyone ever feels like telling me I don't know the meaning of work!"
But if not working, Jennifer says they were usually "in the club" having dinner with friends.
"In my case", the 21-year-old wrote, "nearly all Charlie boys from the embassy registry and a sprinkling of Dutch and American."
The fun was "drowned only by Ms Dunk, a large spinster of uncertain age, who has just arrived from Damascus where, according to her, she was the ambassador's right-hand woman.  It is just like a gramophone record of 'I said to Sir John' or 'Sir John said to me'.
Recalling this 60 years on, Jennifer agreed "she was a dreadful old bag".
As the crisis intensified, the ambassador was left "out of the loop".
The first thing anyone knew in the embassy of the attack by Israel was "a telegram at quarter to one in the morning," Jennifer said.
The code over the telephone, summoning her back to the embassy in the middle of the night was: "Shall we have a cup of tea?"
"And then, 'Shall we have some friends with us?' That meant it was top secret."
Having helped the ambassador decode the telegram, he turned to her and said, "It looks as though things are moving. You better go home as it looks as though you might be leaving soon."
Jennifer was told to leave with just one suitcase weighing 1st 6lb (9kg).
"The Swiss had volunteered to look after British assets. They're very good, the Swiss. They know what they're doing."
They were put on the last flight out of Cairo. The aircraft had four seats too few for those wanting to fly and Jennifer said she moved to the back of the queue in the hope of staying.
However "that was foiled," she said.
As they took off - quickly and "straight up" - an elderly American gentleman turned to her and said "ooh gee, I hope he doesn't rush it".
"I looked out of the window and there, each side of the runway, were the Egyptian tanks."
"There's no use saying I was frightened because I wasn't. The atmosphere was typically British: determinedly cheerful."
