Aston Villa recall Aly Cissokho from Porto

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa have recalled left-back Aly Cissokho from his season-long loan spell at Porto, although he will not be eligible to play until January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Villa's first-choice Jordan Amavi has been ruled out for the season with a serious knee injury.
Cissokho, 28, who played under Villa boss Remi Garde at Lyon, made only three appearances for Porto.
He played 27 times for Villa last season but made his final appearance in former boss Tim Sherwood's first game.
Villa have won just one of their 16 Premier League games this season and are bottom with six points, eight adrift of safety.
