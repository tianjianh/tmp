The 27-year-old scrum-half, who has also played as a winger, joined Exeter from Bath earlier this month.
He has linked up with his new teammates for the first time this week following international duty with Fiji where he played against England and Japan.
"I'll play any position in the back line as long as I'm playing," he told BBC Radio Devon.
"There's lots of talent in here and I'm looking forward to playing with the boys for this season and hopefully we're going to be in a good spot for the end of the season."
Matawalu's appearance against England was his first since February after injuring his knee ligaments.
"He's looking pretty sharp, he hasn't played a lot of rugby in the last eight or nine months so we're actually pretty pleased with how he's turned up," Exeter head coach Rob Baxter said.
"We're going to have to monitor him for a little while, he's desperate to get onto the pitch for every minute that he can.
"We're having to drag him off and make sure he doesn't overdo it in his first couple of days, but he'll be up and running within a couple of weeks."
