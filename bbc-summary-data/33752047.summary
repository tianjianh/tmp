Erwyd le Fol (also known as Russell Erwood), 34, took part in a naming ceremony in the towns' square.
The occasion was marked with a birds of prey demonstration, medieval games and a parade.
Paid for by the town's chamber of trade, he will attend functions wearing a hat with donkey ears.
Speaking after the ceremony Mr le Fol said: "It's amazing. It's phenomenal. To be the first jester of a town in 700 years feels unreal."
