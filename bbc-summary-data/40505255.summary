The 27-year-old from Northampton, who came through six rounds of qualifying, lost 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-1 to fellow Brit Kyle Edmund in the first round proper at the All England Club.
He is set to rise around 300 places and has received Â£35,000 for his efforts.
"[The prize money] will mean a massive amount. I can invest it; get a coach to travel with me," he told BBC Look East.
"It's expensive, we're travelling a lot of the time, staying in hotels, flights and what have you. Last year I was off for six months so had nothing for that time, so this will help."
Ward made his Wimbledon debut last year after reaching a career-high ranking of 242, but since then has struggled with injury.
With his ranking now set to take him near the world's top 500, Ward, who has spent the majority of his career playing on the Futures Tour, effectively tennis' third tier, has many more tournaments planned for the rest of this year.
"I'm going to head home for a few days and rest a bit, I think I deserve it, then head out to Spain to train," continued Ward.
"I'm going to be playing another 15 tournaments this year, mainly on clay in tough conditions, but I am looking forward to it.
"I've definitely got the desire, I see it as a great opportunity and that I'm lucky, being a professional sportsman is a lucky lifestyle."
