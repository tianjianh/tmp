A former Caledonian MacBrayne ferry has capsized in Fiji.

MV Suilven was used on Calmac's Stornoway to Ullapool route until it was replaced by the MV Isle of Lewis in the 1990s.
All the ship's crew were believed to have been rescued following Tuesday's incident in Suva Harbour. The ferry was thought to have been carrying cargo.
Footage of the Suilven in heavy seas off New Zealand several years ago has been popular on YouTube.
