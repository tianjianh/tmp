Week ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Summer time, and the legislating is easy; two Commons days of Scottish detail, one Opposition Day and a general debate on international security.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
And a not dissimilar week in the Lords. It's the calm before George Osborne unleashes his Budget the following week.
There's a rare bit of high profile select committee action on Tuesday (4.10pm), when the House of Lords EU Committee asks the Europe Minister David Lidington who is overseeing the UK's EU renegotiation.
Will it be a transparent process? Will devolved governments have a say?
He will also be asked for updates on discussions on the Mediterranean migrant situation and the Greek crisis.
Elsewhere, the special committee yomping its way through the HS2 Bill (fresh from series of site visits in Mr Speaker's Buckingham constituency) hears evidence from the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson and his new West London neighbour Nick Hurd on the scheme's implications for their patch. That's on Wednesday from 9.30.
And a couple of other events to watch out for are the emergence of the remaining names of select committee members and, possibly, of the prime minister's nominations to the spooks' watchdog, the Intelligence and Security Committee.
Remember, this is not a select committee, but a committee of parliamentarians chosen by the PM. A number of senior figures are quietly angling for the chair of the ISC - previously held by Sir Malcolm Rifkind.
Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve is mentioned as the likely front-runner.
There were calls for the ISC to be reconstituted as a full-dress Commons Select Committee, with a chair elected by MPs. Either way, with some high powered law-making to do on interception powers for internet data, getting the committee up and running is probably creeping up the Downing Street to do list. As is the nomination of any special committee to scrutinise a draft bill on those powers - in the last Parliament the committee which eviscerated the Communications Data Bill, of blessed memory, was chaired by the former Home Office Minister Lord Blencathra (the artist formerly known as David Maclean). The choice for this exercise will be a particularly interesting one.....
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
Monday
The Commons day begins (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government Questions, and any urgent questions or ministerial statements would normally be taken from 3.30pm.
Then it's on to the second day of Committee Stage debate on the Scotland Bill - which is devoted to the section dealing with tax powers, with Treasury spokesman Stuart Hosie leading for the SNP - his party have a new clause on "Full Fiscal Autonomy!" down for debate, which calls for the UK government to enter into an "Economic Agreement" with the Scottish Government for the transfer of competence for taxation raised in Scotland as well as borrowing, and the level of public expenditure. Further SNP amendments assert Scottish control of Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax.
There are plenty more amendments including, interestingly, one from two Labour MPs Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray and Wayne David, requiring the Secretary of State for Scotland to establish an independent commission of external experts, appointed in consultation with the Treasury Select Committee and Scottish Affairs Select Committee, to publish a report by 31 March, 2016 setting out an analysis of the policy of Full Fiscal Autonomy on the Scottish economy, labour market and public finances. It has attracted the signature of UKIP's Douglas Carswell, who sees it as a step in the direction of a full UK constitutional convention.
Mr Murray has another new clause calling for the creation of a Scottish Office of Budget Responsibility - to exercise fiscal and budgetary oversight over the Scottish Government competencies. He quotes the Smith Commission recommendation that independent scrutiny of Scotland's public finances needed to be strengthened. And yet another amendment calls for a review of the implementation of the Scottish basic rate and any other income tax rates
The adjournment debate at the end of the day will be particularly interesting. The Conservative Andrew Bridgen will lead a debate on Postmasters and postmistresses and the Horizon system  - he will be calling for a full inquiry into the Post Office's handling of complaints about the computer system which, he believes, put sub-Postmasters into an impossible position in the handling of their accounts - and I'm told he expects to get a positive response from ministers.
In the Lords (from 2.30pm) the day's main event is the third Committee Stage day on the Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill - key issues are governance arrangements of local authorities in England, votes for over 16s in local government elections (there's a joint Lib-Lab amendment - see earlier blog)  the effect of devolution on health and social care functions, where former Health Minister Lord Warner has an amendment to give combined big city authorities the NHS responsibilities provided for in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 - the new Health and Wellbeing Boards which bring key figures together to look at public health measures. Another hot topic is further devolution in London. There will also be a short debate on plans to assist the recovery of Sierra Leone from the Ebola outbreak.
Tuesday
The Commons meets at 11.30am for Business, Innovation and Skills Questions. And then it's on to the third Committee Stage day on the Scotland Bill - which will mainly focus on amendments on social security and benefits.
In Westminster Hall (9.30 - 11am) the Conservative - Kevin Hollinrake leads a debate on Shale Gas - he's pro-fracking, arguing that Shale Gas exploration will lead to greater energy independence and security at a time of significant international uncertainty while calling for tough safety and environmental rules around it.
In the afternoon session (2.30 - 4pm) the subject is the Future of the Human Rights Act 1998 - led by the former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael. It is expected to be a broad debate, but one focus will be how the HRA is constitutionally hardwired into Scottish Parliament and also the peace process in Northern Ireland.
In the Lords (2.30pm) questions to ministers include an intriguing one on allowing passengers on the Eurostar to travel with pets - from the Conservative, Baroness Sharples.
Then the Committee Stage of the Psychoactive Substances Bill moves into its second day: the key issues include the ACMD, exemptions for prescriptions and medical research, alcohol, prohibition and premises notices. The dinner break business is a short debate on the recommendations of the Children and Young People's Mental Health Taskforce report 'Future in Mind'.
Wednesday
The Commons convenes at 11.30am for Cabinet Office Questions, followed, at Noon by Prime Minister's Question Time. The day's main debate is on an as yet unannounced Opposition Day motion.
Then Ed Miliband brings the day to an end with 30 minute adjournment debate on 'Hatfield Colliery and the low carbon transition'.
Over in Westminster Hall (9.30 - 11am)  watch out for Albert Owen's debate on English votes for English laws and North Wales - he will be stressing the need for Welsh MPs to be able to vote on English NHS decisions, arguing that his constituents and family in North Wales have always relied on specialist NHS services in Liverpool and Manchester.
"The logical argument is when there is a big decision about the policy and direction of those hospitals which serve my constituents, then I should be entitled to have a say and a vote on it because it affects the people I represent," he says.
In the Lords (3pm) questions to ministers include an interesting one from the Lib Dem Lord Sharkey, on holding a review to examine all options for the future of the state-owned super-bank RBS, including alternatives to simple reprivatisation - he hopes to provoke a look at alternatives like breaking RBS up into several regional banks, which seem to work better with small and medium sized enterprises. And ministers will face yet another question on that hardy perennial, the publication date for the long awaited Chilcot Report into the Iraq War - from the Labour veteran and former Attorney General, Lord Morris of Aberavon.
Then Peers move on to the first Committee Stage day on the Childcare Bill, where the  key issues include the definition of working parent, quality of childcare, and funding of childcare. The dinner break business is a short debate on the steps being taken to tackle litter in urban and rural areas.
Thursday
The Commons opens at 9.30am with questions to the Attorney General and the Minister for Women and Equalities - Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. That's followed by the Leader of the House and the weekly Commons Business Statement. And the main event is a general debate on Britain and International Security.
In the Lords (11am) questions to ministers range across the start date for building a new London airport runway and the prospects for establishing a Constitutional Convention.
The day's debates are on subjects chosen by the Lib Dem Peers - starting with Human rights and civil liberties in the UK and then moving on to the UK's role in a world threatened by terrorism, conflict, climate change and mass migration. There will also be a short debate on helping people with diabetes to educate themselves on disease management.
Neither House sits on Friday.
