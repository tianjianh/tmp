Magnus Okuonghae: Maidstone sign ex-Dagenham & Redbridge defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone have signed experienced defender Magnus Okuonghae on a deal until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The much-travelled 31-year-old Nigerian recently left Dagenham & Redbridge after the Daggers decided not to renew his short-term contract.
Okuonghae began his career with Aldershot and played for St Albans, Crawley and Weymouth - and had two stints with the Daggers.
He then joined Colchester in 2009, where he played more than 200 games.
