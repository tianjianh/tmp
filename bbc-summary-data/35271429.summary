Chris Gayle made 21 in his first innings since being fined for asking a reporter on a date in a live interview.

The ex-West Indies captain was fined A$10,000 (Â£4,900) by Melbourne Renegades for "inappropriate conduct" to TV journalist Mel McLaughlin.
Gayle hit two sixes before being caught in the deep as the Renegades managed 155-6 from their 20 overs.
Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen then plundered 67 not out from 43 balls to get the Stars home in 18 overs.
McLaughlin was in the Network Ten studio at Etihad Stadium as the Stars recorded their fourth win from six matches.
She was conducting a pitch-side interview with Gayle in the Renegades' previous match when he said: "To see your eyes for the first time is nice. Hopefully we can have a drink afterwards. Don't blush baby."
Melbourne Renegades said his comments were "completely inappropriate and disrespectful" and apologised to McLaughlin and to the public.
