The Division Two match between Durham and Worcestershire ended as a draw, with no play possible on the final two days because of bad weather.

Persistent rain prevented any action on day three at the Riverside.
And, with more rain on Thursday, the game was abandoned at 14:15 BST - 15 minutes after the scheduled start time.
Worcestershire, who had a first-innings lead of 170 before the weather intervened, took 12 points from the match, while Durham collected eight.
