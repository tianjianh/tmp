The Belgian, 26, began his career with the Shrimpers, making 90 league appearances and scoring seven goals.
"Franck's on a non-contract basis; it's almost a pay-as-you-play," Brown told BBC Radio Essex.
"At this moment in time he's not ready to play. He's played behind closed doors for us, but Wednesday and Saturday are games too early for him."
Southend are currently 13th in League One following Friday's heavy defeat against Rochdale, but still have an outside chance of reaching the play-offs.
"With eight games to go if Franck plays some part in the run-in, all well and good for him and all well and good for us," Brown continued.
"There might be a contract for him here at the end of the season.
"It was a win-win, a no-brainer, it's not going to cost the club anything. We're getting him fit for a contract to us or somebody else."
