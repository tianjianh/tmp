Pete Broomfield attended the 2010 fire in Shirley Towers, Southampton, which resulted in the death of colleagues James Shears and Alan Bannon.
An inquest found they were entangled in fallen ceiling cables.
Mr Broomfield's device forms a bridge to stop cables getting tangled around cylinders on firefighters' backs.
It was incorporated into all of Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service's breathing apparatus (BA) sets in 2012.
Mr Broomfield said he based the design for the strap on a hair clip worn by his wife.
He said: "It is extremely gratifying to think that something I created off the cuff will be making lives safer in other services.
"It is fantastic news that this is being rolled out to the military."
A wiring safety change requiring electrical cables to be mounted in metal trunking instead of plastic was also brought in following the fire.
