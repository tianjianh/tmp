Morecambe 0-3 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle maintained their unbeaten start to the League Two season with an impressive victory over Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from skipper Danny Grainger and two from veteran Jason Kennedy earned Keith Curle's side all three points at the Globe Arena.
Grainger gave the Cumbrians the lead on 15 minutes after a mistake by home keeper Barry Roche.
Luke Joyce crossed from the right and Roche could only flick the ball straight into the path of the left-back who drilled the loose ball home.
The scoreline did flatter Carlisle as Morecambe were in the game for long periods, with Mark Gillespie forced into making three fine saves from Cole Stockton and Tom Barkhuizen also clipped an effort inches over the bar.
The visitors, though, doubled their lead on 73 minutes when the ball fell behind Kennedy in the area and the midfielder twisted and turned sharply to fire past Roche from eight yards.
The home side then crumbled and Carlisle added a third just four minutes later. Kennedy was in the thick of the action again from a Nicky Adams corner and appeared to head home, although his lack of celebration meant the final touch may have flicked off a Morecambe defender.
