Crawley Town owner Ziya Eren has told fans that success will take time after a poor run of form in League Two.

A 3-0 home defeat by Crewe on Tuesday means the Reds have won only two of their last 12 matches.
"I would like our fans to be patient with the family. We are fighting relentlessly to be better," Eren said in a statement on the club website.
"Our football has improved this season. The infrastructure and recruitment has given the club a solid platform."
Eren completed his takeover of Crawley 12 months ago, with plans to take the club into the Championship within 10 years.
The Turkish businessman appointed former Chelsea academy coach Dermot Drummy as manager in the summer and Crawley were in the top six in mid-October.
However, they have since slipped to 16th - the position they were in when Eren bought the club.
He said: "While we have played some exciting football in a few games we have also had disappointing results.
"This is normal for a squad with 22 new faces. It is still a period of growing stability and togetherness.
"The performance against Crewe was not positive. I'm certain the players will answer and display their true ability in the remaining matches.
"I believe we will finish the season positively and set up a foundation for an exciting season ahead."
Meanwhile, Crawley midfielder Aryan Tajbakhsh has extended his loan with National League South side Wealdstone for a further month.
