Kane Kennedy, 20, of Heysham was found guilty of killing Oskar Jobey-Kennedy at a flat in Morecambe.
Oskar's mother Tia Jobey, 19, was sentenced on 5 December to 30 months after admitting causing or allowing the baby's death.
At Preston Crown Court, Kennedy was told he must serve a minimum term of 18 years.
There was a catalogue of other non-accidental injuries to Oskar's body, including to his genitals and marks inside his mouth consistent with fingers being pushed forcibly inside, the court heard.
Kennedy, of Harewood Avenue, Heysham, had initially claimed he fell asleep on the sofa with his son and had woken to find him unresponsive.
But in November he changed his story and claimed he had slept in a separate room to Oskar and Jobey.
Home Office pathologist Alison Armour concluded Oskar's injuries "negated the possibility" his death was caused by an adult laying on top of him.
Kennedy had later tried to blame Oskar's mother, the jury was told.
Det Ch Insp Jon Holmes from Lancashire Police said: "Kane Kennedy has repeatedly changed his account of what happened on that fateful night and has tried to blame other family members to try to save himself.
"The person who should never be forgotten in this is baby Oskar. He should have been able to look to Kane Kennedy for the protection and love of a parent. Instead this defenceless child found himself subjected to horrendous abuse and the injuries which sadly caused his death."
An NSPCC spokesperson said it was a timely reminder to be vigilant for the signs of abuse and neglect.
"Kennedy unleashed unimaginable abuse and murdered this defenceless, young child when he should have done everything to protect him."
