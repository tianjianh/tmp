A new design of wakeboard was secretly tried out on Scottish lochs ahead of the product going on general sale next year, it has emerged.

The board made by a US manufacturer was among those used by a team of professional wakeboarders who visited Scotland in the summer.
They included Adam Errington, the Inverness-born, Ullapool-raised cast member of MTV show WakeBrothers.
Loch Ness and Loch Lomond were among those visited by the team.
They also took their wakeboards on to the sea near Eilean Donan Castle near Kyle of Lochalsh.
Loch Ness was one of the test areas for the new shape of board by O'Brien. The design was not officially made public until this month's international Surf Expo in Orlando, Florida.
Roddy Holihan, who rode the board, said: "While I was in Scotland I was riding one of the new shapes for 2016 called the Revo.
"The core of the board is a hybrid combination of wood and polyurethane foam.
"This mixture of the two allows for a more explosive upward kick coming off the top of the wake."
The other wakeboarders in the team included Josh Twelker and Massi Piffaretti.
