Rooney, 29, scored in the Euro 2016 qualifying win over Switzerland to overtake Charlton's record of 49.
Directly addressing Rooney, Charlton said: "It is a record that I am sure you will hold for a long time.
"And it is clear to see that you will go on scoring for your club and country for a long time to come.
Rooney was given his debut by Sven-Goran Eriksson in February 2003, coming on as a half-time substitute against Australia. Just six months later, he became England's youngest scorer, netting in a Euro 2004 qualifier against Macedonia.
His 50 goals have come in 107 caps - one game more than Charlton.
"I obviously cannot deny that I am disappointed that I now don't hold this record, however, I am absolutely delighted that it is Wayne, as captain of my beloved club and country, who now holds this record," Charlton added.
"On behalf of myself and everyone at Manchester United I would like to say 'Congratulations Wayne, this is a very proud moment for you and your family'."
Charlton will present Rooney with a special golden boot before the match against Estonia at Wembley in October.
Rooney "thoroughly deserves" his status as England's record goalscorer, says former striker Alan Shearer.
The former Newcastle Untied and Blackburn Rovers forward played 63 times for England, scoring 30 goals, before retiring from international football in 2000 aged 29.
"When you look at how long the record has stood then he should be a very proud person," Shearer told BBC Sport.
"It's a fantastic achievement to have stayed at the top for so many years.

"He's been around for so many years and no-one has come in and taken the shirt off him and I can't see anyone doing that for the next few years."
Rooney has only scored six goals in major tournaments - four times at Euro 2004, once at Euro 2012 and once at the 2014 World Cup. However, only 12 of his goals have come in friendly matches, so is he worthy of the record?
"The accusation that will always be thrown at him is that he hasn't produced at a major tournament," added Shearer.
"I can understand that and also people will say there are easier games nowadays, but his record goals per games is excellent.
"It's not his fault extra teams or so-called weaker teams were put in competitions. He did his job, he scored goals and he broke the record."
Former England captain John Terry played in the same team as Rooney at the World Cup in 2006 and 2010.
The Chelsea defender said on Instagram: "Congratulations waynerooney on becoming England's top goalscorer.
"I've had the pleasure to play alongside Wayne and for me he's England's best EVER.
"I've seen 1st hand him do things with the ball that I've never seen before. A winner and a leader and so proud to see him wearing the armband captaining our country. Legend."
