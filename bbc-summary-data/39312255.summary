[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 0-0 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton missed a penalty and both goalkeepers were in fine form as they played out a goalless stalemate with Oxford at Sixfields.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northampton had the better of a scrappy first half in which both defences were on top and chances were few and far between.
Aaron Phillips tested Simon Eastwood with a long-range shot and Marc Richards headed onto the roof of the net for the Cobblers.
Matt Taylor also had a free-kick deflected over, and from his ensuing corner, the unmarked Zander Diamond headed off target.
Michael Smith headed wide for the hosts before Oxford began to offer more of a threat in the final third, with Conor McAleny curling an effort wide and Antonio Martinez firing a shot over the bar.
After the restart Liam Sercombe fired wide for Oxford before Northampton missed a glorious opportunity to break the deadlock when they were awarded a penalty, only for Taylor's spot-kick to be superbly saved by Eastwood.
Northampton still sensed the breakthrough, but Richards fired into the side-netting and Paul Anderson failed to convert from Phillips' excellent cross.
Oxford had a couple of good chances late on as Curtis Johnson had a shot tipped onto the bar by Smith, who then foiled a Kane Hemmings effort.
