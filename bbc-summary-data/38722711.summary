Second consultation expected on ship-to-ship transfers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Communities along two Scottish firths have the chance of a second public consultation on planned ship-to-ship transfers of oil, says MSP Kate Forbes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cromarty Firth Port Authority wants permission to transfer millions of tonnes of crude oil at sea in the Moray Firth.
Campaigners around the Moray Firth and nearby Cromarty Firth oppose the plan.
CFPA has been asked to withdraw an application it made in 2015 for the work but is expected to make a new one.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has asked CFPA to withdraw the application for a licence for the ship-to-ship transfers, according to Ms Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.
The port authority said earlier this month that it was modifying its application "in response to the concerns raised over the past 12 months".
It insists the transfers can be carried out safely and protecting the environment was of paramount importance.
Campaigners dressed in dolphin and shark costumes held a demonstration outside the Scottish Parliament earlier this month.
