[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers 3-2 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn's Danny Graham and Brentford's Scott Hogan both scored twice as struggling Rovers came from a goal down to win a pulsating encounter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hogan put Brentford ahead in the first minute with a right-foot shot but Graham soon equalised from close range.
Graham scored his second from the penalty spot after a foul on Corry Evans but Hogan hit back for Brentford from six yards on the half-hour mark.
Harlee Dean's own goal restored Rovers' lead, which proved decisive.
Blackburn went into the match without a win for more than a month and it looked like that wait would continue when Hogan hit the back of their net after just 33 seconds.
But Graham grabbed his two goals in the space of five minutes to turn the game on its head, only for Hogan to hit back with a second of his own.
Brentford captain Dean then scored what was to be the winning goal past his own goalkeeper before half-time to condemn the Bees to their fourth defeat in their last six games.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle:  "I'm so pleased for the players, the fans, because it would have been easy losing a goal after 30 seconds to feel sorry for ourselves, but nothing could be further from the truth.
"We kept persevering with our quality of play and got ourselves in front at 2-1 and we tried to add to it. When you don't get that goal, at the level we operate, you can get punished.
"Having got in front and looking good to add to it, we find ourselves at 2-2 and have to pick ourselves up again, which we do.
"There was a lot to be pleased about. I'm just delighted how we went about it. It's an important three points."
Brentford manager Dean Smith:  "I just felt that we gave them a helping hand with the goals. We didn't defend the second phase of a corner well enough. They overloaded the back post. Daniel's (Bentley) made a great save but they reacted quicker.
"The second goal, we get done with a one-two and go to ground in the box. And the third goal, Egs (John Egan) gets caught out, and then we don't delay the lad crossing it and Harlee doesn't sort his feet out quick enough, so we certainly gave them a helping hand.
"It's a concern that we've conceded three goals because that's very unlike us. We've kept seven clean sheets this season.
We went with a more attacking formation today because we haven't been converting our chances over the last few games. But I can't fault them second half and if they keep giving that, they'll get back to winning ways."
