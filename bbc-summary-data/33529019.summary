Devolution for Cornwall: Meeting 'moves plans closer'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Devolution powers for Cornwall are said to be a step closer after councillors approved plans in a private meeting.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cornwall Council members gave the council leader John Pollard a mandate to sign off an agreement with the government.
Cornwall would be the first county to get devolved powers as announced by the chancellor in the Budget.
The details of the deal have not been made public under instructions from ministers, said Mr Pollard.
The main demands listed by Cornwall Council include:
Councillors had a confidential briefing session where they were given details of which areas the government is offering to hand over some powers.
Councillors had a private briefing on Tuesday at which they were given some information about what extra powers ministers are offering the authority.
The Labour and UKIP groups didn't back the offer, but leader John Pollard received enough support for a mandate to sign an agreement.
The council says the government has insisted the process remain confidential. Alongside EU funding and bus services, the BBC also understands further education, business support, energy, and health and social care services will form part of any package.
An official announcement is expected possibly by the end of the week.
"Seeking more powers for Cornwall is not new - we have been striving for more autonomy for years," said Mr Pollard, independent leader of the Liberal Democrat-independent controlled authority.
"If agreed these proposals will allow the people of Cornwall to benefit from an integrated health and social care system, significant economic growth, more affordable homes, greater access to employment and training opportunities, together with a much improved public transport network."
Both UKIP and Labour members voted against the deal.
Tim Dwelly, leader of the Labour group, said: "We think this deal should not have been done in secret and should have been put to the people of Cornwall."
