The incident happened within the grounds of the city's bus station in Smithfield Street just before 10:30 GMT on Monday.
The woman was in her 30s but her name has not yet been released.
The depot is now closed. Translink confirmed that an incident had taken place and that an investigation was under way.
An eyewitness at the bus station, Jo-anna McLucas, described what she saw in the immediate aftermath of the collision.
"I was on the phone and I heard a bang, I looked up to see what had happened," Ms McLucas said.
"The bus had hit the wall and I walked outside and there was a small gap between the wall and the bus and I could see there was someone on the ground."
Ciaran Rogan from Translink told the BBC: "Our thoughts and our sympathies are with the family and relations and friends of the young lady involved.
"It really is a tragedy."
Mr Rogan said the bus driver was "distressed" and would be given support by the transport company.
"We would have assistance available within Translink [for those] who are involved in accidents because it can affect people very badly at times.
"We'll give the driver every assistance as we will any member of staff who was badly affected."
Mr Rogan said other Translink workers at the station would be affected by the fatality but added that "our main job at the moment is to find out what happened".
