Former Somerset and England wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter says the mental and physical scars of his eye injury forced him to retire.

Kieswetter broke his nose and damaged his eye socket and cheekbone while batting against Northants last July and announced his retirement on Friday.
"I came back and played a few games and got through on adrenaline and support," the 27-year-old told BBC Points West.
"I played a T20 comp and realised that physically my eye wasn't quite right."
He added: "When you have a physical thing it affects you mentally and you start to question yourself and your ability.
"There is a muscular injury but going through that trauma has pushed me back mentally. As a person if I can't give 100% then I'd rather not let myself or the team down. It's disappointing and tough but necessary for me."
Kieswetter says he is unsure what his next career move will be but admitted he was now looking forward to watching his former team-mates from the stands.
"You'll probably see me on the sidelines with a cider in my hand," he added. "There are a few options. I'll take some time off and work out what I want to do and where I want to be."
