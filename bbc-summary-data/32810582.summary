Andy Coulson perjury trial told he knew of phone hacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Andy Coulson perjury trial has been told that the former News of the World editor was aware that phone hacking was taking place while he was in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former newspaper's Royal editor Clive Goodman said Mr Coulson did not know at first that phones were being hacked to generate stories.
But he told the High Court in Edinburgh Mr Coulson was later made aware of it.
Mr Coulson, 47, denies lying when he appeared as a witness at the Tommy Sheridan perjury trial in 2010.
Giving evidence, Mr Goodman told the jury that he took a proposal to his editor, Mr Coulson, that the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire should be paid to intercept voicemails.
He said Mr Coulson agreed to the plan on a trial basis.
Mr Goodman told the court that Mr Mulcaire was eventually "paid purely by results".
He also told the court that he felt under a great deal of pressure at the News of the World to find "new ways of doing things".
He said that he gave names of those close to Princes William and Harry to Glenn Mulcaire, who then found PIN numbers to their voicemails.
Mr Goodman said that listening to those messages had yielded "results".
He said one such example was when he discovered that Prince Harry asked for help with his homework from an aide while he was training at Sandhurst military academy.
He said he had shown Mr Coulson a transcript of the voicemail conversation.
Mr Goodman was asked whether at any point Mr Coulson was worried about privacy issues.
He said "It didn't occur, it didn't come up".
The charge against Mr Coulson alleges that he lied in court and that he did in fact know about phone hacking, did know or know of Mr Mulcaire and did know about payments by the newspaper to corrupt police officers.
The trial before Lord Burns continues.
