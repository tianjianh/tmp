Exit poll: Polls close at 21:00 GMT and the BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll is published. In 2010, the exit poll was pretty much spot on in its prediction of how many seats the parties eventually got.
Seat projections: There are 650 seats up for grabs. To form a majority government, a party needs 326, although 323 should be enough because Sinn Fein's MPs (five in 2010) don't take up their seats. If no party gets this, it becomes a question of who gets the most MPs - and how many seats their potential coalition partners get.
Declaration times: The Huffington Post have a list of all 650 constituencies and the times they are expected to announce their results.
Sunderland City Council in the north-east of England prides itself on its speedy counting and aims to declare the first seat within an hour.
