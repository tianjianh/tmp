Sir Alan Duncan: Boris Johnson didn't want Brexit win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boris Johnson only campaigned to leave the EU to set himself up as the next Conservative leader, Sir Alan Duncan said the day before June's referendum.

Sir Alan said he believed the now foreign secretary, who is his current boss, wanted to lose narrowly and be the "heir apparent" to David Cameron.
The foreign minister's comments were made in a BBC Two documentary being broadcast at 21:00 BST on Thursday.
Mr Johnson has said the UK will be better off outside the European Union.
In his first interview after becoming foreign secretary he said: "There is a huge opportunity and... I have been very struck by how excited and how positive people here are about the opportunities for Britain."
The UK voted by 52% to 48% to end its membership of the bloc in a referendum on 23 June.
In a behind-the-scenes documentary, Brexit: A Very British Coup?, Sir Alan - then a backbench MP but now a minister in Mr Johnson's Foreign Office - predicted the result would be 52% for Remain and 48% for Leave.
And he questioned the motives of Mr Johnson in backing the campaign to exit the EU.
"I think there are a lot of Leave people who don't believe it, and I've always thought that Boris's wish was to lose by one so that he could be the heir apparent without having to have all the... you know... of clearing up all the mess, that's always been my view of Boris."
He added: "By championing leave, he can be the great heir apparent of the future, darling of the activists, but actually it would be quite good if he didn't actually win the referendum because there would be total chaos."
Speaking after the result was known, Sir Alan warned that the UK was entering "a period of deep instability and uncertainty" and "potentially ultra-dysfunctional government"
"And you know, the first thing we hear is Michael Gove says he is going to negotiate with David Cameron about being in charge of the negotiations. Well these people have got to remember they might have won a referendum, but they don't run the country."
Mr Johnson, popular among Tory activists as one of the leading Vote Leave figures, argued that leaving the EU would be Britain's "independence day".
He said the UK could "take back control" - of its money, its immigration system and its democracy and accused Remain campaigners of talking the country down.
After the referendum and David Cameron's ensuing resignation Mr Johnson unexpectedly withdrew from the race to be the next Tory leader and PM, positions he is long thought to have harboured desires for.
He said he did not believe he could provide the leadership or unity needed, after then Justice Secretary and fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove made his own bid for the job.
But in a shock move just over a week later - with Mr Johnson's fortunes seen to be at their lowest ebb -  Mr Cameron's successor, Theresa May, appointed him as foreign secretary in her new cabinet.
In that role, he has stressed that Brexit does not mean Britain will be leaving Europe, just "leaving the EU", and said he wanted the UK to be a "great global player".
The documentary, Brexit: A Very British Coup?, will be broadcast on Thursday 22 September at 21:00 BST.
