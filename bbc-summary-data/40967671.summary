AC Milan put six past Shkendija in Europa League

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AC Milan thrashed Macedonia's Shkendija to take a huge step towards reaching the Europa League group stage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Italian side led 3-0 at the break - with summer signing Andre Silva scoring his first two goals for the club since joining from Porto in July.
Fabio Borini - on loan from Sunderland - also scored his first goal for Milan.
Luca Antonelli and Riccardo Montolivo also struck for the Rossoneri, who are back in European competition for the first time since the 2013-14 season.
It was Milan's second biggest win at home in European competition, after their 8-0 victory over Union Luxembourg in 1962-63.
Their 3-0 lead at the break was also the first time they led by that margin at half-time in a European competition since the 2005 Champions League final, which they went on to lose on penalties to Liverpool.
