[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey student nurses return to wards

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Student nurses are to return to the wards in Guernsey after placements were suspended by the University of East Anglia (UEA) in October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suspension followed concerns raised with the Nursing and Midwifery Council during an extraordinary review of midwifery supervision.
Third year students, which make up 13 of the 44 nurses, are due to return to their placements from 5 January.
Year two and one students should return in May and November respectively.
The move follows confirmation the required number of mentors have completed the training needed.
Student nurses spend about half of their three-year programmes, run by the UEA and the Institute of Health and Social Care Studies, in hospital with the remainder in the classroom.
Sally Walker, head of partnerships at the UEA, said: "We are very pleased that HSSD [Guernsey's Health and Social Services Department] and the institute have been able to move quickly and effectively to begin resolving the issues relating to the practice experience element of the degree programme.
"We will continue to work collaboratively to ensure that students receive a quality learning experience."
Dr Carol Tozer, chief officer of HSSD, said: "Those year one and two students who will not be returning in January to the on-ward training are all being found suitable posts in health and social care."
Minister Paul Luxon said: "It is vital that we grow our own nurse workforce, and the nursing degree programme run from the institute is a vital part of our workforce planning to meet our island's future needs."
