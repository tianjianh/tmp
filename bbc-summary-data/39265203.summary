[SN]TITLE[SN]
Father killed baby son 'in moment of anger'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father killed his three-month-old son by throwing him "vigorously" against a hard surface in "a few moments of anger and violence", a court was told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Julian Hinz was taken to hospital from his home in Bournemouth, Dorset, on 8 April last year with serious injuries.
He died the following day when doctors decided to turn off his life support systems.
Robert Hinz, 34, is charged with his murder and three counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, told the jury the child's mother, Monica, had left him healthy in the care of his father.
Mr Hinz, who had been made unemployed a month earlier, became angry and agitated after the death and police believed he had been drinking, he added.
"In a few moments of anger and violence, his father killed him," Mr Lickley said.
"An adult caused the injuries to that little boy, they cannot be explained by an accident or illness."
Winchester Crown Court heard pathologist Dr Russell Delaney found Julian suffered skull fractures and brain trauma.
"I favour the baby was thrown vigorously on to a blunt object or surface," Dr Delaney reported.
The baby also had fractured ribs, which Mr Lickley said would have been inflicted by "squeezing" on occasions prior to the fatal injuries.
He said Julian suffered a collapse "when the defendant was alone with him in a bedroom at their home in Bournemouth".
During the 999 call, the defendant could be heard "shouting and swearing and hitting walls and damaging property", he added.
"He continued to behave in that agitated state even after paramedics arrived - he had to be told to calm down," Mr Lickley continued.
Mr Hinz, of Carysfort Road, denies the charges. The trial continues.
