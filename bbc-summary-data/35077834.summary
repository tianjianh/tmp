[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 0-3 Middlesbrough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough confirmed they will be top of the Championship at Christmas by winning at Brighton and ending the Seagulls' unbeaten start to the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Hughton's side had avoided defeat in their opening 21 league games.
Kike's first goal since 18 August, a near-post header from Albert Adomah's fourth-minute cross, put Boro in front.
Adomah diverted in Daniel Ayala's header to make it 2-0 at half-time and Cristhian Stuani nodded in from close range after the break to seal victory.
Leaders Middlesbrough are three points clear of Brighton, who surrendered second place in the table as Derby won at Ipswich.
The home side's failure to deal with crosses proved to be their undoing, with all three of Middlesbrough's goals coming from centres into the box.
Brighton struggled to break through a resolute Boro defence, which kept their 12th clean sheet in 22 league outings this term and has not conceded a goal in any of their last six Championship matches.
Brighton 0-3 Middlesbrough as it happened
Former West Bromwich Albion striker Jason Roberts on BBC Radio 5 live: "Brighton could have been a bit more decisive. Make no mistake, they've come up against a really strong, well-oiled unit.
"(Middlesbrough head coach) Aitor Karanka hasn't shouted and screamed, he's been calm throughout and you can be when you've got a team that's only conceded 12 goals in the league.
"When you're coming up a side like that and you concede goals the way they have, it's very disappointing.
"Chris Hughton will be disappointed with the way they've gone about this game, but they need to maintain their focus because this is a team that could come very close to promotion."
News of Guus Hiddink's appointment as Chelsea manager broke during Middlesbrough's victory at Brighton, which was watched by his predecessor at Stamford Bridge - Jose Mourinho.
An agency representing the 52-year-old released a statement earlier on Saturday, which read: "He (Jose) will not be attending any high-profile games because he wants to discourage any speculation about his future."
But Mourinho did take in some Championship action later in the day and he watched Karanka - who was on Mourinho's coaching staff at Real Madrid - lead his side to an emphatic success.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:

"Middlesbrough got an early goal and an early lift. We've now conceded four goals from corners in our last three games and that is something that needs to be eradicated.
"But we were up against a very good side and it's very difficult to be too harsh on the players.
"The reaction from our supporters at the end was excellent, and I hope the impact is positive and this defeat is a little bit of a reality check that allows us to get back to winning ways."
Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka:
"Jose brought us luck. We worked together at Real Madrid and it was an amazing experience.
"He is a friend of mine. I didn't tell the players that he would be watching but it wasn't a secret.
"Afterwards, he came into the dressing room to offer congratulations. He felt he had watched a really good team and he was impressed with us. He was the best and he will be the best."
