As darkness fell on the battlefield at Waterloo on 18 June 1815, 47,000 men lay dead and wounded in the blood and mud.

Amid the carnage of the battle is an incredible story of bravery and survival that has become legendary amongst the stories of Wellington's defeat of Napoleon.
The role played by Irish soldiers in the battle 200 years ago is being commemorated in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.
The Inniskilling Dragoons and Fusiliers both fought in the battle and helped to turn the tide of European history.
Pte Peter McMullen, a weaver from Downpatrick, was serving with the 27th Inniskilling Regiment when he was seriously wounded.
Incredibly, his heavily pregnant wife Elizabeth was watching the battle nearby and fearing her husband was dead, she rushed into the midst of bodies.
As the battle continued around her, with cannon shots, sniper fire and cavalry charges, Elizabeth was shot in the leg with a musket ball.
Despite her injury and the chaos, she discovered her husband still barely alive and dragged him away from the battlefield.
They were taken to a hospital in Antwerp where Peter lost both arms through his injuries and Elizabeth was able to rest, allowing here shattered leg to heal.
The couple were then transferred to a hospital in Chelsea and it was there that Elizabeth gave birth to a baby girl.
The Duke of York, the commander in chief of the army, was told of their bravery and visited them in hospital.
He agreed to be godfather to the infant, who was christened Frederica McMullen of Waterloo.
Pte McMullen's Waterloo medal has been acquired by the Inniskillings Regimental Museum and is part of a display at Enniskillen Castle to mark the bicentenary of the battle.
Neil Armstrong, the curator of the museum, believes it is probably "the perfect love story", and having his medal in the collection brings the experience of a County Down man into a battle of international importance.
The key role played by soldiers from Ireland is being commemorated in Enniskillen ahead of events throughout Europe to mark the bicentenary of the battle.
They suffered heavy losses.
Of the 747 men and officers of the 27th Inniskilling Regiment of Foot who marched into cannon and sniper fire, 493 were either killed or wounded.
The defeated Napoleon commented on their bravery.
"That regiment with castles on their caps is composed of the most obstinate mules I ever saw; they don't know when they are beaten," he said.
The Duke of Wellington praised them with the words: "They saved the centre of my line at Waterloo."
