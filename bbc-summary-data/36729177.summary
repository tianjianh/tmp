[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff driver accused of father and son crash 'knew dad'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff driver accused of causing the deaths of a father and his baby son has told a jury they knew each other.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Lewis, 33, died when Kyle Kennedy, 29, hit his car head-on in a crash in the Tremorfa area of the city.
His son was delivered three days after the crash but later died.
Mr Kennedy, from Rumney, has denied two counts of causing death by dangerous driving at Cardiff Crown Court, but he has admitted causing death by careless driving.
On Wednesday, Mr Kennedy told the court Mr Lewis was godfather to his cousin's child.
Christopher Rees, defending, asked him whether he accepted he caused the death of Mr Lewis and his son, which Mr Kennedy said he did.
Mr Kennedy said: "This is going to be part of my life and the family and loved ones of the Lewis' for the rest of my life."
He said he took responsibility for his actions and offered his "deepest sympathy" to the family.
But he told the court the crash would not have happened if a van had not braked in front of him - although he admitted being too close to the vehicle.
Matthew Cobbe, prosecuting, asked Mr Kennedy whether he thought the van driver was as responsible as he was for the crash.
"I believe if he had not braked as aggressively as he did this accident would not have happened," Mr Kennedy said.
"The manner of his braking left me with no choice but to go into the back of him or try and avoid a collision."
But he added that he took "full responsibility".
The court previously heard he was driving at "motorway speeds" of up to 70mph when the crash on Lamby Way happened. Yet Mr Kennedy told the jury he had not been driving that fast - "up to 40, 45mph tops".
Judge Paul Thomas QC told the jury they must approach the evidence "dispassionately".
"It is important to try this case using your heads, not your hearts," he said.
The trial continues.
