[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The rise of Islamic State (IS), the jihadist militant group that has seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, has sent shockwaves around the world.

Its brutal tactics, including mass killings and abductions, as well as the beheadings of soldiers and journalists, have caused fear and outrage and led to US military intervention.
IS is also known as Isis and some companies have changed their names to stop themselves being associated with the group in any way.
The latest people to announce a rebrand are the team behind Archer but there are many more organisations who are associated with the name Isis.
The spy comedy has been focused on the work of the International Secret Intelligence Service.
At Comic Con over the weekend, the creators confirmed that the fictional organisation would be phased out in the upcoming sixth series and instead the team would be working for the CIA.
They also revealed vast quantities of merchandise with the Archer Isis logo would have to be scrapped.
The high street adult shop launched a range of lingerie recently which was branded with the word Isis.
The range of black and white underwear is still available on their website, although some of it is in the sale.
The Crawley family dog, who features in the opening credits of the ITV show, is called Isis, in reference to the Egyptian God.
There have been no suggestions that the production team will be changing the pet's name.
With sites in London, Brighton, Oxford, Toronto and Canada, Isis Schools have been teaching English for more than 20 years.
There is no indication on their website or on social media that they are planning to alter their name and a request by Newsbeat for a comment was not returned.
Now known as Thairish Cafe, owners Bernadette Lyons and Sa-Nguan Lyons changed the name of their Levenshulme restaurant after the death of Alan Hennings.
Bernadette says they received warnings from the police that the name might attract trouble to the cafe.
The new name reflects the owners' Thai and Irish backgrounds.
Another company which has decided to change its name is Isis Equity Partners, a firm which supplied investment to UK businesses.
They've yet to reveal the new name they are going with and are still listed online under the name Isis.
This isn't the first time in history that international politics and conflict have conspired to create brand identity problems for a company.
Back in the 1930s SS Cars became a successful sports vehicle brand.
With the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany, the name SS became increasingly associated with the SchutzStaffel, the primary organisation responsible for the Holocaust.
In 1945 SS Cars was launched under the title Jaguar.
