[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 1-1 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teenager Ryan Sessegnon snatched an injury-time equaliser to rescue a point for Fulham and deny Burton their first away win in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 16-year-old struck from close range after Burton goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin could only fumble Sone Aluko's effort.
The visitors had taken the lead early in the second half when Jackson Irvine swept home his fourth goal of the season from just inside the area.
The result keeps Fulham in the play-off places and leaves Burton in mid-table.
Fulham dominated proceedings against the Championship new boys but had nothing to show for their efforts in the first half.
And they paid the price when Irvine put the visitors ahead in the 51st minute after good work by Stuart Beavon.
Fulham piled on the pressure but Chris Martin and Matt Smith missed chances and Aluko was denied by McLaughlin.
Sessegnon finally beat the Albion goalkeeper in the third minute of stoppage time, leaving Burton to settle for their third draw of the season.
Burton manager Nigel Clough: "Fulham deserved a point at least and dominated for long spells in the game. It's hard to hold out for that long. I wasn't surprised six minutes was added on.
"We are disappointed now but without a doubt when we go on the bus it will become a brilliant point. We had a makeshift team out so to get a draw is a superb result for us.
"We've been to Molineux on the weekend and here to Fulham and got two draws against two big teams."
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic: "It was important not to lose two home games in a row.
"We have to be the more clinical and score the goals - they scored with their first shot.
"I have to be satisfied when you score the goal in extra-time. It was some kind of salvation but you generally believe, especially in our stadium, that we can win our home games."
