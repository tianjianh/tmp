Fans were queuing from the early hours on Friday to get a seat for the match against Gillingham.
The match this Friday will be the first game in the city since the owners of the Sky Blues moved home fixtures to Northampton in a dispute over rent.
The League One club has said more tickets may be made available if police and safety approval is given.
