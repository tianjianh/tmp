What is BBC News School Report?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC News School Report gives 11-16 year-old students in the UK the chance to make their own news reports for a real audience.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Using lesson plans and materials from this website, and with support from BBC staff and partners, teachers help students develop their journalistic skills to become School Reporters.
In March, schools take part in an annual News Day, simultaneously creating video, audio and text-based news reports, and publishing them on a school website, to which the BBC aims to link.
Last year more than 1,000 schools across the UK took part on School Report,  on the biggest ever School Report News Day. Take a look at what students produced on the day!
School report's 10th News Day will be held on 10 March 2016.
There are five steps for teachers to take, and the sooner you complete them, the sooner we can work with you:
BBC News presenter and former teacher Huw Edwards is working on School Report.
He said: "Over the years I've run many journalism workshops in schools. So I've seen how much fun it can be and how much can be learnt when there are real deadlines, real audiences and real standards to meet.
"I'm involved because I want to give young people the chance to make the news themselves, and I want to share the principles of good journalism. So have a go, let me know what you think, and good luck!"
As well as the main News Day in March, there are also opportunities to join in a Practice News Day - a chance to rehearse what you will do on the big day itself.
You can hold your own Practice News Day on a date of your choosing, but one advantage of taking part on a central date is that your school will be featured on the School Report website.
The safety and well-being of young people taking part in the project is very important to everyone involved in School Report. All mentors and other people working with School Report sign a personal disclosure form and undertake training in accordance with the BBC's guidelines on child protection.
We also have protection measures in place to prevent identification of children, including not using surnames and requiring parental consent for all children taking part.
The project aims to give young people from across the UK the chance to make their own news to real deadlines and broadcast it to real audiences. School Report helps to fulfil one of the BBC Charter's pledges to "sustain citizenship and civil society":
