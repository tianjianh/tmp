The final Parkrun has been cancelled at the site near Bristol where a council became the first to request a contribution towards the park's upkeep.

Organisers of the Little Stoke Parkrun said they were given until 28 May to reach an agreement with Stoke Gifford Parish Council or "leave the park".
They have decided to cancel Saturday's free-for-all run "on safety grounds".
Last month councillors voted to charge Parkrun saying it was "unfair" to expect residents to pay for the event.
The decision was met with widespread criticism with Parkrun saying it would search for a new venue as its ethos remained to offer weekly 5k (3.1m) runs at no financial cost to each entrant.
However, on Wednesday Parkrun said it had yet to determine the long term future of the Little Stoke gathering but had to cancel the final scheduled run on the 28th.
"We appreciate that this will be frustrating to our runners and volunteers, but the last thing we want is the strength of feeling to boil over from either parkrunners or local residents," a statement online said.
"We hope to provide you with a further update next week," said the organisation.
The council said its original statement still stood which was that the three-year-old event had led to "increased wear on the park" and Parkrun had refused a request to contribute "a small monetary amount towards the upkeep".
