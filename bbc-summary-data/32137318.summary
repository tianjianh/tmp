[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP's national organiser in Wales has stepped down two days into the general election campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Atkinson, who holds other positions in the party, told BBC Wales he needed to reduce his workload.
Earlier this month, UKIP Wales' attempt to suspend one of its candidates was overruled by the party centrally.
In February, UKIP Wales also suspended its Brecon and Radnorshire branch committee after a row over election candidate selection.
Mr Atkinson is staying on as the party's general election candidate for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire.
"As the party's success and profile has increased in Wales so has the workload," he said.
"I don't feel I have the time to continue in the role as well as working for Nathan Gill (UKIP MEP for Wales) and standing for the party at the general election".
The other candidates declared as standing in Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire are Delyth Evans (Labour), Simon Hart (Conservative), Selwyn Runnett (Liberal Democrat), Gary Tapley (Green Party) and Elwyn Williams (Plaid Cymru).
