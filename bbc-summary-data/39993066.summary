Steven Daniel, known as Bonzo, was slashed in the face after two cars forced his Skoda Octavia to stop on Craighall Road at 00:10 on Thursday.
Detectives believe the attack may have been witnessed by two people standing at traffic lights nearby.
The victim, 37, is a nephew of gangland figure Jamie Daniel who died last year.
In the past 18 months, there has been a spate of attacks in the city, which detectives believe may, in some cases, be connected to the rivalry between the two notorious Daniel and Lyons crime families.
Det Insp Jim Bradley said: "We potentially have two eye witnesses who will have seen this horrific incident take place and it is absolutely vital that they come forward and speak to the police.
"In order for us to find these despicable individuals, we need a complete picture of what exactly happened, therefore if you were waiting to cross at Craighall Road, where it meets the slip road onto the M8 just after midnight on Thursday, please get in touch and tell us what you saw.
"We understand that it would have been a very frightening scene to witness, but your information could be absolutely crucial to our investigation and to helping us find these dangerous criminals."
Det Insp Bradley added: "The victim was clearly targeted and I have no doubt that there are people who know who is responsible. I would appeal to these people to do the right thing and pass on their information to the police because these violent and reckless individuals have no place on our streets."
After the attack, Mr Daniel was taken by ambulance to hospital, where his condition was described as stable.
Forensic experts are examining two cars which were found shortly after the incident. Both had been set on fire.
A black Audi vehicle was found in Forge Street, Germiston, and a silver Volkswagen vehicle was recovered in Balmuildy Road, Bishopbriggs.
