Cezary Sobiewski, 40, murdered Barbara Baraniecka weeks after she confided concerns about his drinking to friends.
A judge said Sobiewski went to buy cider after the "sustained and brutal attack" at the couple's home in Tipton, West Midlands.
Sobiewski admitted Ms Baraniecka's murder on Monday.
He entered the plea on what would have been the start of his trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Ms Baraniecka had told Sobiewski she wanted to end their relationship last October, a month before her death.
She had already confided in friends she had concerns about his increased alcohol consumption.
Police said Sobiewski, who had moved to the UK from the US in 2010 to live with Ms Baraniecka, was arrested at the scene.
Her 25-year-old daughter found her covered in blood on her bed as Sobiewski sat in the kitchen.
Paramedics confirmed she had been dead for several hours.
Sentencing him, Judge John Wait said: "Having killed Barbara Baraniecka in the course of a sustained and brutal attack, you went out to the supermarket, bought cider and sat at home drinking it, leaving Barbara's daughter to find her mother's body and call the emergency services.
"You took the life of someone who had many friends and who was the mother of two daughters."
Speaking after Sobiewski's guilty plea on Monday, Det Insp Jim Munro said: "I very much hope that now this case is over, it will in some small way allow Barbara's daughters to start rebuilding their lives after the terrible events of November last year."
"Cezary Sobiewski could not control his drinking or his jealousy and his actions have resulted in the death of a completely innocent woman."
