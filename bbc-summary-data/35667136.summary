A man has admitted killing his wife who was found beheaded at a house in Cambridgeshire.

Bio-scientist Samantha Ho, 39, was found dead at the property in Curlew Place, St Neots, on 29 August.
Her head and torso were discovered separately, and a post-mortem examination found she died from cuts to her neck.
Her husband, Timothy Allen, 40, of Curlew Place, admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility.
He appeared via video link at the Old Bailey earlier, where his plea was accepted.

Allen had denied her murder at an earlier hearing in December. He will be sentenced on 17 March.
Police were initially called to the house by the ambulance service after a report of concern for a man at the property.
Armed officers forced entry to the house, where Ms Ho's body was found.
Allen was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to hospital with what police described as a serious but not life-threatening injury.
He was later charged with murdering his wife.
It was "a tragic case where a woman lost her life and families have been torn apart", said Det Ch Insp Richard Wall, of Cambridgeshire Police.
In a statement, Ms Ho's family described her as "well-loved... with a bright future ahead of her with lots of aspirations".
The former Nottingham Trent University student had worked at bio-science firm Asterand, in Royston, Hertfordshire, for more than 10 years. Before that she was employed at Pharmagene, which is part of Asterand, and Cambridge firm Cytocell.
"She wanted to be a great scientist, have time to travel the world, realise her dreams and spend more time with family," Ms Ho's family said.
"However, on that fateful day... Samantha was tragically taken away from us. That day was a day where a part of us died."
