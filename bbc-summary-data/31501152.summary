[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Denbighshire primary school is facing closure for a second time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Denbighshire council decided on a new consultation process to shut Ysgol Llanbedr DC, Ruthin.
The first consultation was declared flawed by Education Minister Huw Lewis in January so plans to close the school were rejected.
But despite the reprieve, a second consultation will now be launched with a view to closing the school in 2016.
The Church in Wales school has been marked for closure because of low pupil numbers and surplus places.
The council voted to close it last summer despite opposition from parents and the church.
One parent, Andrea Fragata Ladiera, said it was "galling" to be in the position of fighting the closure again.
Another parent and governor at the school Sian Jones said pupil numbers were steadily increasing in spite of the school being under threat.
The council said it would begin pre-consultation talks with the Diocese of St Asaph over the next 28 days.
