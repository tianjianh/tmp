Ding Junhui: UK Championship anger prompts disciplinary action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World number nine Ding Junhui is facing disciplinary action for his angry outburst following his shock first-round exit from the UK Championship.

The two-time winner was beaten 6-2 by amateur Adam Duffy on Tuesday.
The Chinese player swore throughout his 30-second post-match news conference and used a derogatory word to describe the set-up at the York Barbican.
His comments have been referred to the disciplinary arm of snooker's governing body, the WPBSA.

The UK Championship is widely regarded as snooker's second biggest event behind the World Championship.
But in 2013 the format changed to a flat draw with 128 players starting in the same round, meaning the early stages involved more tables and more cramped conditions, with four in the main hall and four in the sports hall.
Asked where he thought his match went wrong, Ding said: "It was crap. Fucking four tables and everything is going wrong.
"I don't want to say any more about this. It's just crap. It's for amateurs."
Ding is expected to be fined for his outburst, but further sanctions are unlikely.
