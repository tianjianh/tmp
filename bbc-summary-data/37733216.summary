Pat McCann put Sligo ahead on the stroke of half time before second-half goals from Aaron McEneff and Barry McNamee clinched a merited home win.
It was the third game in a row that Derry came from behind to win.
The Candystripes received another boost on Friday with boss Kenny Shiels signing a one-year contract extension to keep him at the club until 2018.
Derry started slowly and carved out just one decent chance in the first half, with Ronan Curtis' smart shot forcing Ciaran Nugent to make a good save with his legs.
Sligo were in the ascendancy before the break and deservedly took the lead in the first minute of stoppage time.
A corner was played short and McCann sent the ball sailing across a crowded square into the top corner of the net.
However it was all Derry in a much-improved second second half.
Rory Patterson was denied several times by the in-form Nugent but the brilliant goalkeeper's defences were finally breached after 64 minutes.
Good work by Josh Daniels down the left was finished off by McAneff, who drilled a low shot from the edge of the box past Martin for his seventh goal of the season.
McNamee clinched the winner when he stroked the ball into the far corner of the net after Sligo failed to clear their lines.
Derry are now assured of third place in the Premier Division. They complete the season away to St Patrick's Athletic next Friday night.
