Winklevoss twins' latest Facebook case rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The latest attempt by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to re-open their case against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They had asked the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to reconsider its April ruling upholding the $65m (Â£40m) settlement from 2008.
The twins say that Facebook concealed information and they should have received more Facebook shares.
Mr Zuckerberg denies their claims that he stole the idea of Facebook.
In April, a three-judge panel decided not to scrap the original settlement and not to allow a fresh case to begin.
In their latest move, the Winklevoss twins had asked for a full panel of 11 judges to review that decision.
No fresh reasons were given for declining the appeal.
Their lawyer Jerome Falk said in a statement that they would appeal to the Supreme Court.
The 2008 settlement gave them $20m in cash and $45m of stock valued at $36 a share.
But the shares are not yet traded anywhere, and the brothers say that they were duped because internally the shares were only valued at $9.
Their claim that Mr Zuckerberg stole their website idea while they were all students at Harvard was made famous by the film The Social Network.
