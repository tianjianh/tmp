Alex Hales added just five runs to his overnight score of 136 before he was bowled by Andre Adams (3-93).
The away side benefitted from a last wicket partnership of 47 between Jake Ball and Sam Wood to end on 371.
Hampshire reached 167-4 in response with with Jimmy Adams (61) the top scorer before bad light forced the sides from the pitch early.
The day began well for the home side, with the in-form Hales, Vernon Philander and Will Gidman (34) all falling in quick succession.
However, Ball and Wood's tenth-wicket partnership gave the visitor's some momentum which Philander continued to bowl Liam Dawson in the third over of the reply.
Luke Wood (2-44) then accounted for Michael Carberry (30) and Adams before James Vince was run out trying to push for two.
Will Smith (25 not out) was joined by Adam Wheater before the light closed in and play was brought to a close.
Hampshire all-rounder Andre Adams:
"I think before Vince got out we were nice and poised. We are one partnership away from parity.
"After yesterday's toil it was nice to get a bit of reward from a bowling point of view. I think we bowled very nicely and if we continue, it will stand us in good stead.
"For us we were thinking about how to stop Hales from scoring and dominate today's play, so to get him out early was a bonus."
Nottinghamshire bowler Luke Wood:
"It was a good day for us. We feel like we are on top and can maybe force a win in the next couple of days.
"We bowled well as a collective on a decent wicket but we still have some work to do in the morning.
"It was tough losing Jake Ball early but I think we worked hard and covered for him. It is never easy when you are a bowler light but we dealt with it well."
