The 42-year-old stepped down after a draw with Braintree but stayed on as caretaker manager while a replacement was found.
The National League side have now re-appointed Gary Mills as manager.
Mills, 54, previously managed York from October 2010 to March 2013, leading them to promotion to League Two, and was sacked by Wrexham on Thursday.
McNamara offered to resign as boss if York did not get a "positive result" at Braintree earlier this month.
Mills rejoins York with the club 19th in the National League.
His first game in charge will be Monday's FA Cup fourth qualifying round replay at Curzon Ashton.
A statement on the club website said that following an interview process Mills was "the person most qualified to take the team forward".
It added: "Gary brings with him a depth of knowledge and experience at this level, together with a track record of getting the most out of players and is well known for his exciting, attacking and, when necessary, pragmatic brand of football to achieve positive results."
McNamara took over as York boss in November last year but was unable to prevent them being relegated from League Two last season and won just three of 15 league games this term.
Mills was sacked by Wrexham on Thursday after 18 months in charge at the Racecourse Ground.
