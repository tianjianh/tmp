Rangers will 'get it right' for cup final, says Mark Warburton

Manager Mark Warburton believes Rangers will return to top form in time for the Scottish Cup final despite going three games without a victory.

Livingston delivered the latest blow with a 1-0 win thanks to former Rangers defender Craig Halkett's headed goal against the Championship champions.
"We all have to look at ourselves, because that was not Rangers," said Warburton.
"We have 24 days to get it right, which we will do."
Since their Scottish Cup semi-final win over Glasgow neighbours Celtic, Rangers have lost to Hibernian, who they will face in the final on 21 May, drawn at home to relegated Alloa Athletic and now suffered a defeat by second-bottom Livi.
Warburton's side conclude their league campaign with a trip to Paisley to face St Mirren on Sunday and the manager dismissed the suggestion that it would be difficult to regain momentum ahead of their trip to Hampden Park.
"After the Celtic game against Hibernian, you can say it was the draining nature of the game at Hampden, but that was not really us," he said.

"But, no excuses. We started brightly, but for the vast majority of the game we were way below.
"I am not going to sit here and defend that. We didn't deserve to get anything out of the game."
Warburton, on the shortlist for PFA Scotland's manager of the year, did not think Rangers were feeling the pressure of completing a trophy treble - having also won the Petrofac Training Cup.
"Pressure is fighting relegation, fighting for your contract, you might get a pay-cut as a player, pressure is going out of business," he said.
"That is not pressure. Everyone is tired, we all have had long seasons, do you feel more tired when winning the league or more tired when fighting relegation?"
