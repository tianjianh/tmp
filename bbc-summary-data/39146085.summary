Scunthorpe winger Hakeeb Adelakun has been told to 'grow up and be a man' by manager Graham Alexander.

The 20-year-old has made 18 appearances this season, but has not been involved in their last five matches.
"I need players who compete and train well everyday. Hakeeb isn't doing that," he told BBC Radio Humberside.
"He's the same age as Dele Alli and that's where we are. Hakeeb is not a boy. He needs to realise his abilities and direct them the right way."
Alexander continued: "Now is the time for him to grow up and be a man. He's 20, which is young, but he's been around the first team for four years."
Scunthorpe have not won in their last six games but remain second in League One.
Former Burnley and Preston defender Alexander made over 1,000 appearances in a professional career spanning 22 years, and believes Adelakun needs to take responsibility for himself.
"The one constant thing in your career is yourself so you have to manage yourself. The earlier you learn that the better career you'll have," the 45-year-old said.
"I will constantly give Hakeeb the support he needs but I can't hold his hand.
"There's no reason he won't play again this season. I pick the team based on performances and he has certainly got the ability to be in this team."
