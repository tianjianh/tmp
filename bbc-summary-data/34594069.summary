Neil Lennon: Bolton Wanderers squad lacks quality

Bolton Wanderers' lack of quality is the reason they sit bottom of the Championship, says boss Neil Lennon.

The Trotters lost their unbeaten home record on Tuesday as Birmingham City won 1-0 at the Macron Stadium.
It means Bolton, the division's lowest scorers with nine goals, have lost three straight matches and won just once in all competitions this season.
"I think it is apparent that there is a lack of quality at times," Lennon, 44, told BBC Radio Manchester.
"We're relying on players to improve and make the most of the opportunities that come their way and they are not doing that at the minute."
Lennon took over at Wanderers in October last year when they were bottom of the league and guided the club to safety.
Asked if there would be money available in January for transfers, the former Celtic boss added: "I don't know how much we've got, whether it be from the owner or the chairman.
"We have talked about players, we are still endeavouring to bring a player in and it's been like that for the past couple of weeks."
