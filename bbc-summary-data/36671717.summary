Helen Jenkins: Rio Olympics course suits British competitors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh triathlon star Helen Jenkins believes she can win a medal at the Rio Olympics, but is putting herself under no pressure to do so.

The 32-year old finished fifth at London 2012 and qualified for Rio in April with victory in Australia.
Jenkins joins compatriot Non Stanford and Vicky Holland in the GB squad as the trio compete in Stockholm in the penultimate world event before Rio.
"Running in Rio is a bonus; I didn't really expect to be going," she said.
"So I don't want to put that pressure on myself at the moment.
"Winning a medal is something I won't allow myself to think about."
Jenkins says she has learned lessons for her experiences four years ago.
"In London it was all about gold or getting a medal and this time around really all I am focusing on is lining up fit and healthy," she explained.

"With 10 weeks to go heading into London, I got a really bad injury and I couldn't walk. I went in as one of the favourites and no-one had any idea how bad the injury was.
"I dealt with the pressure really well and did well to come fifth. But it was not was I was aiming for. I was disappointed at the time, but I am proud now.
"It was the most adverse conditions I had ever faced and I now view it as an overwhelmingly positive experience.
"But in Rio if I can do that and produce the best performance that I can, I will come back happy. That's what I want to do really."
Jenkins believes all three British women are major medal contenders, especially the Welsh participants.
"It would mean a lot to win a medal if it happened, but I don't want to think about that, I want to just focus on fitness," she told BBC Wales Sport.

"It is going to be a lot tougher in Rio than it was in London, the course is harder, we have a sea swim, which tends to break things up a bit more and we have a bike course with a very steep hill in it, so it is a very technical ascent.
"But I do think the course suits, especially myself and Non Stanford, who both ride really well, it is a great course for us."
Jenkins had considered skipping Stockholm, the penultimate World Series event, with the season concluding in Hamburg on 15/16 June.
"Choosing to go to Stockholm, it is an important decision, I haven't raced too much this year and just for race practice and race feel, it should help, I would like to do the two remaining World Series events," she said.
"But the ultimate aim is to get to the start line in Rio fit and healthy.
"We will play things by ear. We need to have a plan but a very flexible one."
