[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rossnowlagh and Murvagh beaches had been given red flags when concerns were raised.
Swimming had been banned at the beaches while the problem was resolved.
Donegal County Council said in a statement that this was a "natural phenomenon."
The algae is not toxic to humans but may result in dead marine life washing up on shore.
A local website has reported that some people have been lifting dead fish from the beaches.
The council has said it will be monitoring the beach closely and will keep the public updated on changes.
