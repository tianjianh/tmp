[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ali Raza Shah, 36, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Christopher John Leslie, 32, pleaded guilty to the same charge and was jailed for six years in January.
Police said the Birmingham men had arranged to take delivery of the carpets - flown from Pakistan - in Telford, Shropshire.
The packaged carpets arrived at Heathrow Airport on 2 August, 2013.
UK Border Force officers discovered heroin in hollow straws had been woven into some of the rolls.
They were found to contain 7.3kg of heroin at a purity of 45-50%, giving a potential street value of about £730,000.
The consignment was originally destined for an address in Leegomery, but the address was changed to a storage facility in Birmingham.
Shah, from Malmesbury Road, Small Heath, was convicted on Monday and sentenced at Hereford Crown Court on Thursday.
Leslie, from Kitchener Road, Selly Park, also pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply 9kg of cannabis, at Worcester Crown Court on 4 November 2014 and was jailed for one year on 21 January - to be served consecutively to the heroin supply sentence.
