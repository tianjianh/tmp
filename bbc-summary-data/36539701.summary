Pay and display parking 'here to stay' in Flintshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flintshire council has agreed to push ahead with permanent charging for car parks in its town centres.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been operating a pay and display system since last year, and on Wednesday, members of a scrutiny committee voted to continue charging but with a number of amendments.
Flintshire council said the parking fees would help protect services threatened by budget cuts.
Its cabinet will now be asked to endorse the decision on 21 June.
"Pay and display is here to stay in Flintshire," said cabinet member Bernie Attridge, adding that it was important to collect and listen to feedback so they could improve the experience of car park users.
He said the tariffs people paid were not only used to maintain and improve car parking facilities, but helped "protect other vital services, such as social services and education, which are under threat from continued budget reductions."
