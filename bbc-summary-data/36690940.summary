The 20-year-old had already knocked out second seed Dae-Hoon Lee of South Korea and defending champion Joel Bonilla Gonzalez on his way to the final.
And the 10th seed overcame Russia's Alexey Denisenko 10-6 to take gold.
Abughaush delighted the crowd with several jumping head shots and also ran away from his opponent in a bid to protect his lead in the final seconds.
Lee and Gonzalez went on to claim the two bronze medals on offer.
Jordan's royal family watched Abughaush make history, and he received a telephone call from the king's brother, Prince Feisel al Hussein, president of the country's Olympic committee, after claiming the gold.
"He told me that the people of Jordan are very happy and crying tears of joy for me,'' said Abughaush.
