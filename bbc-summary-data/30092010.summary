Dale Gordon, known as "Deezy", was attacked on Netherbury Close, Gorton on Saturday night and died in hospital on Sunday.
Police said his death was being treated as murder and a post-mortem examination was due to take place.
The rapper appeared on Greater Manchester Police's wanted website in June over an alleged assault.
Kira Martin, a friend of the musician, said: "He was amazing. His music touched everyone; he was just raw talent."
Another friend Jerrell Barnwell said: "Everyone has their own faults and mistakes but Dale never let that drag him down.
"He was always a good guy, always on the up and up and every time I'd see him he was positive."
Mr Gordon's attackers, who struck at about 22:15 GMT on Saturday, have been described as tall, in their mid-20s and wearing dark clothing. Police said one was dark-skinned and the other was black.
Det Ch Insp Howard Millington said there had been "some kind of fight between the victim and the men who were seen to flee from the scene in a silver car".
"We are appealing for the public's help [as] the incident happened outside on a residential street.
"Did you see a silver car leaving the scene at speed or other cars parked up on the street? You may think that what you saw is only trivial, but it could be vital."
