Downie, 17, was completing a somersault on the floor when she landed awkwardly.
She was assessed by medical staff and returned to compete on the vault.
Britain finished fourth in qualifying with a total of 174.064, behind Russia, China and defending champions USA, with the top eight teams progressing to Tuesday's team final.
Downie, meanwhile, finished 24th in the all-around qualification meaning she is into the final.
"I crunched my neck," Downie said. "It sounds pretty gross but I just felt dizzy before my last tumble.
"They put me in a wheelchair and I was like, 'I don't need a wheelchair.'
"I was better than I thought so I came back out and vaulted."
