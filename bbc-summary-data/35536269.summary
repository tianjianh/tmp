[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dolphin forced into Jersey harbour by Storm Imogen is feeding well, according to experts.

The young dolphin, believed to have been separated from its mother by strong winds, was originally seen swimming in La Collette basin and has now settled in the old harbour.
Marine life specialists from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue organisation are trying to help it.
They have asked people who spot marine animals in distress to report it.
Winds of up to 70mph and waves reaching 10m hit the island on Monday as Storm Imogen struck.
Amy Daniels, a marine mammal medic, urged boat owners to leave the dolphin alone and not feed it.
She said: "It seems calm at the moment, it seems to be eating and there doesn't seem to be anything physically wrong with it.
"It looks like a recently weaned juvenile separated from its mum and the rest of the pod."
