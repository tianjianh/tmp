The two singers performed on stage together before Lopez presented Anthony with the award for person of the year.
The former couple, who divorced in 2012, were married for seven years and have two children together.
Lopez said in Spanish: "Marc, you are a living legend who has laid bare your heart and soul on your musical journey.
"We've learned so much and we've grown so much, and you've always been so many things in my life: My mentor, a twin soul, a father who's not only the person of the year, he's the person of all time."
Anthony dedicated his award to his five children, who he said have "sacrificed more than anyone" for his career.
The entertainer has been married to Venezuelan model Shannon De Lima since 2014 but has remained on good terms with Lopez since their divorce.
They recently appeared together at a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and last month it was announced Anthony will serve as an executive producer on Lopez's next album.
Lopez and Anthony performed Olvidame y Pega la Vuelta together at the Las Vegas ceremony on Thursday. Anthony also sang his hit I Need to Know.
Winners on the night included Juan Gabriel, who posthumously won album of the year for Los Duo 2. The singer died in August aged 66.
Enrique Iglesias featuring Wisin's Duele El Corazon won record of the year while Shakira's duet with Carlos Vives, La Bicicleta, was named song of the year.
