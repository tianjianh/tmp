Historic England is looking for photos of the country's first mosque set up in Liverpool in 1887 by English Muslim convert Abdullah Quilliam.
The Gloucestershire site of the first smallpox vaccination by Edward Jenner is also on a list of 21 places that require updated details.

Details and photos are also being requested on:
