League Two outfit Clyde have appointed Peter MacDonald and JP McGovern as their interim management team.

The duo have come in for Barry Ferguson, who resigned as manager last month with the Bully Wee sitting eighth in the table.
"We're both confident in our abilities and we played at a decent level," MacDonald told Clyde's website.
"I think we've got the respect of the boys and we're coming from a player background," McGovern said.
The Cumbernauld side, who are 14 points behind fourth-placed Annan Athletic, have not won a league match since November and have lost nine of their last 11 games in the division.
Defeat by Montrose in midweek saw the Bully Wee slip to ninth in the table.
"The main thing we're going to ask for is hard work, because we will structure the players in the way we think is needed," added MacDonald.
"We're asking for a willingness to change, even just for themselves, to get three points on the board."
Clyde host Forfar Athletic on league duty at Broadwood on Saturday.
