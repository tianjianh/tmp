Hundreds of people have signed a petition calling for rainbow-coloured zebra crossings in Manchester's Gay Village amid concerns about traffic.

The idea has been pitched by Adam Edwards, who says traffic around Canal Street is a "recipe for disaster", the Manchester Evening News reports.
The petition has already been signed by more than 540 people.
Several cities around the world, including Sydney, have rainbow-coloured crossings to celebrate diversity.
Mr Edwards said concerns about traffic had been raised after roadworks prompted diversions along Minshull Street, Chorlton Street and Sackville Street.
It means more and more motorists are commuting through the Gay Village.
Councillor and city centre spokesman Pat Karney said "a number of people" had recently claimed to have had accidents in their cars in the area.
"There's a nasty cocktail of a large amount of traffic and lots of residents, and because of the nightlife, there are often people who've had a few drinks," he said.
"It's a problem for sure, and I will be sitting down with people to look at safety solutions."
