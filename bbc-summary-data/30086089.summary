An Australian teenager died on her 18th birthday after drinking a 95% alcohol strength spirit.

Nicole Bicknell collapsed after having several shots of the Polish spirit Spirytus Rektyfikowany.
According to Nicole's family, the teen wasn't a big drinker and had only had a few mixers when a friend offered her the spirit neat.
They're now calling for a complete ban on the sale of super-strength booze across Australia.
"I cannot see why alcohol so strong is sold in liquor stores," Nicole's grandfather Kevin McLean told the Western Australian newspaper The Sunday Times.
"No one needs to buy alcohol that strong. It should be taken off the shelves so this doesn't happen to any other family.
"We want it banned Australia-wide and we would like to see it an offence to sell it."
The Australian Medical Association actually called for the spirit to be banned two years ago.
Nicole's mother Belinda Bicknell said she's furious that the drink hadn't already been taken off shelves.
"It's like anything, more deaths have to happen before things get done," she said.
"I just feel very angry right now."
Although the drink has been removed from major off-licences in Australia, it's still available at independent stores.
Spirytus Rektyfikowany comes from Poland, where it's mainly used as an ingredient in home-made liqueurs.
One 500ml bottle contains the equivalent of 38 standard drinks.
The Whisky Exchange website describes the spirit as "often used as a base for liqueurs and other infusions", but adds "we highly recommend that you don't drink it neat."
According to her family, Nicole wanted to be a forensics police officer.
"If there was one word to sum up Nicole, it's perfect," her mum said.
"She was too good to be true. She was very thoughtful and was always thinking about others.''
