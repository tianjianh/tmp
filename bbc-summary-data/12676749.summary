The Labour-led city council's executive is to consider plans for re-siting the cenotaph in St Peter's Square away from its site next to the tram station.
Council leader Sir Richard Leese said the proposal arose from the competition to re-design the square and the proposed Metrolink extension.
The final cenotaph site will only be decided after public consultation.
The competition brief for re-designing the square had envisioned the cenotaph staying in the same place but during consultations it became clear that it needed a better place.
Sir Richard said: "I would stress that the proposal for a sensitive relocation of the cenotaph within St Peter's Square is something which has only been brought forward after careful consultation with veteran's groups, church authorities and other interested parties."
He added: "There was a strong consensus that the current site is not ideal and that there is scope to make the cenotaph more of a focal point, in a location better suited to quiet contemplation and with fewer space constraints for remembrance events."
The report to be considered by the executive recommends further consultation on the cenotaph proposal and the Metrolink second city crossing route in partnership with the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE).
