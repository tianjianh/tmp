Rosa Dominguez won $655,555 (Â£508,000) from a pair of $5 scratch cards bought from two different gas stations over the course of a few days.
"I was so nervous I just wanted to cry," Ms Dominguez told the California Lottery.
The California Lottery said she told the organisation she plans to use the money to go shopping and buy a new car.
Ms Dominguez was driving back from Arizona when she bought a Power 5 ticket at a gas station in San Luis Obispo County and won the top prize of $555,555.
A few days later, Ms Dominguez tried her luck again on a $5 scratch-off ticket at a gas station in Monterey County and scooped $100,000.
The Lottery did not say when the tickets were purchased.
