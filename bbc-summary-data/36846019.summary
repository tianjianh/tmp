Welsh budget: Opinions sought on £16bn priorities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People are being asked how the Welsh Government should spend its £16bn budget next year.

AMs want to know the public's priorities before ministers publish their plans in October.
Key questions include the importance of tackling poverty, an aging population, and preventative measures in health.
Finance committee chairman Simon Thomas said the impact of Brexit and tax powers required a Welsh Government with "a clear purpose and direction".
"The next few years will be among the most critical in Wales's development," said the Plaid Cymru AM, launching the consultation on Wednesday.
"We will be looking at the draft budget to judge whether or not it can deliver the best possible value to Wales.
"Before we reach that stage, it is important that we assess how the Welsh Government is performing against its own objectives, and we need people to tell us how they think it's doing.
"That is why we are gathering opinions and ideas now, through expert advice, relevant authorities and an online survey for people to contribute to our inquiry and help form our recommendations."
The survey form can be found on the Welsh Assembly website and people are also invited to share their views via email.
Earlier in July, First Minister Carwyn Jones said he had hoped to publish a detailed programme for the Welsh Labour government's five-year term before the summer recess, but he said he was putting it off until September amid uncertainty over the impact of Brexit on funding.
