The 46-year-old, Scotland's most successful female tour professional, is to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at next year's Scottish Golf Awards.
Previous recipients include Paul Lawrie, Colin Montgomerie, Sam Torrance, Sandy Lyle and, most recently, Bernard Gallacher.
Matthew, who continues to play on the LPGA Tour, said: "I am simply thrilled to accept this award."
The Scot, currently 61st in the world rankings, has expressed her desire to captain Europe's Solheim Cup team at Gleneagles in 2019 and is hopeful of representing Team GB at golf's return to the Olympic Games in Brazil next summer.
"I've been fortunate to have enjoyed a successful career over 21 years as a professional and I believe there is still more I can achieve in the coming years," she added.
