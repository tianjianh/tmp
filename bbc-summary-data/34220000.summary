Jesse Hawthorne, 23, from Caerphilly, posted it on Facebook six weeks after the early morning row.
The details emerged during his trial at Caerphilly Magistrates' Court for four counts of criminal damage which he was cleared of.
Hawthorne is due to be sentenced for the picture post on 7 October.
On Friday, the court heard Hawthorne was born as Jessica and had been in a lesbian relationship with the woman for two-and-a-half years before deciding to undergo a sex change.
Three months after their break up, he turned up at her house party to get his Pug back.
During the exchange on 2 May, her car damaged but magistrates ruled Hawthorne was not responsible.
The court heard he has already pleaded guilty to one count of disclosing a private sexual photograph or film with the intention of causing distress and could face jail.
