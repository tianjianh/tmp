The first minister will use the visit to promote economic, education and cultural opportunities for Northern Ireland.
She will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yangdong in Shanghai and has other engagements in that city as well as in Shenyang and Beijing.
Mrs Foster said the links between Northern Ireland and China were "strong and growing".
"This week's visit underlines the continued commitment of the Northern Ireland Executive to engage with China, the world's second largest economy," she said.
"We may be a small country, but we have a compelling proposition in terms of commerce, tourism, education and cultural opportunities.
"Over the course of the next four days I have a packed programme including engagements in Shanghai, Shenyang and Beijing.
"The discussions I have this week will build on the work the Executive Bureau in Beijing has been leading on and take this mutually beneficial relationship to the next level."
