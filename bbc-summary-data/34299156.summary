Clarke sidefooted home to give the Shakers a 19th-minute lead before doubling it with a 51st-minute penalty.
Sky Blues defender Reda Johnson pulled one back 11 minutes later when he headed home Tom Armstrong's corner.
However, Bury held on for their fourth straight win to go level on points with the Sky Blues.

"I'm sick of hearing people tell me that 'we're getting outplayed but we keep losing'.
"We're doing something at this football club that's creating a new future.
"Winning football matches is something that takes a hell of a lot of work."
Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"It would be churlish of me to comment on a referee after a defeat.  It would have been nice if we'd have won and I could talk about the referee, but we didn't so I don't think it's the right time for me to comment on the referee's performance.
"The penalty? It was a really poor decision, and they change games. And I was unhappy with the first goal. The naivety was ridiculous.
"I'm not sure I could have asked more of us in the second half in terms of chances created, but we probably lacked the quality to finish them off."
