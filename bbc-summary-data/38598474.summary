FA Cup: Plymouth Argyle's Derek Adams against splitting prize money

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Football Association should not change how it distributes FA Cup money to clubs, says Plymouth's Derek Adams.

The FA plans to increase prize money, but could introduce a "unity" payment to split funds more equally.
Clubs receive an extra payment each time a tie they are involved in is televised live, meaning some earn much more money than others.
"I think it should be the same as it is now," said boss Adams, whose side have earned £1m from this season's FA Cup.
Argyle will have at least three games televised this season. Their second-round replay at Newport County netted them £36,000, the third-round 0-0 draw at Liverpool earned them £144,000 and they will get £72,000 for their replay at Home Park on 18 January.
Coupled with prize money and gate receipts from five games, including their share of the 52,692 crowd at Liverpool, Argyle's earnings from the run represent around 20% of the club's annual turnover.
"A lucrative tie can help clubs massively, we've seen that in the past in being able to help clubs improve their infrastructure," added Adams.
"The way it is just now makes it even better. Everyone sitting around their television on a Monday night waiting for the draw is what it's all about. Everyone wants to get that big Premier League team."
