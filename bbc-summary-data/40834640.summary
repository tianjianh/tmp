The Uruguayan opened the scoring at the KCOM Stadium after four minutes, before Jackson Irvine equalised for Albion.
But he saw red for a second yellow card and two goals in three second-half minutes from Kamil Grosicki and Hernandez put Hull back in front.
Hernandez completed his hat-trick on 68 minutes, as the hosts won for the first time since Premier League relegation.
Substitutes Sebastian Larsson and Adama Diomande both wasted good chances late on as the Tigers continued their unbeaten start under former Russia boss Slutsky.
Hull are now unbeaten in their last 15 home league games in the second tier, winning 10 and drawing five.
Burton, also beaten in their Championship opener against Cardiff last weekend, lost captain Stephen Warnock early on, after the former England international went to ground without contact.
Both bookings for Brewers goalscorer Irvine came within 10 minutes of one another, and both were given for fouls on Hull's Jarrod Bowen.
Hull City manager Leonid Slutsky:
"Our supporters helped our team change the match because we had a very difficult 20 minutes in the first half.
"We started very well, we scored a goal and we had chances.
"But from 20 to 35 minutes we did not play good, we lost control of the match."
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough:
"It was very encouraging how we played in the first half up to the sending-off.
"The second one was not a booking, I thought it was harsh.
"The first booking was petulant and I have told him."
Match ends, Hull City 4, Burton Albion 1.
