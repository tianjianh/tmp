[SN]TITLE[SN]
Election 2015: Isle of Wight candidate Andrew Turner replaces electoral agent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The election agent for the Isle of Wight's Conservative candidate has been replaced, just over a week before polling day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The agent for Andrew Turner, David Walter, asked to leave his position, claiming it had become "untenable".
In a letter seen by the BBC, Mr Walter raised concerns he had about campaign funds and management.
Mr Turner said Mr Walter's opinions were "not shared by other members" of the campaign team.
Election agents are legally responsible for their candidate's campaign. Under Electoral Commission rules they cannot resign, instead the appointment has to be revoked by the candidate.
In the letter to Mr Turner, Mr Walter said: "I have for some time been unhappy to continue as your nominated election agent."
He said he was concerned about "significant anomalies and ambiguities" relating to financial aspects of the campaign.
In a statement, Mr Turner said: "David of course is entitled to his opinions, but they are not shared by other members of the team, the Conservative Association's officers or the majority of voters I have been speaking to every day.
"Naturally, this is disappointing, but with only 10 days to go to the election I will be concentrating on the issues that islanders are concerned about and working with my tremendously supportive campaign team towards a victory."
Mr Turner, who was first elected as the island's MP in 2001, survived a vote of no confidence earlier this year from within his own party.
The other candidates for the constituency are:
Stewart Blackmore (Labour)
David Goodall (Liberal Democrats)
Vix Lowthion (Green)
Iain McKie (UKIP)
Ian Stephens (Independent)
