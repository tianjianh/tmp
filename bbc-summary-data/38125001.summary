[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman was walking along a path in Merksworth Way at about 02:20 on Sunday when a man pushed her to the ground before raping her.
After the attack, she managed to get help from the residents of a nearby house.
Her attacker was described as male, white, 5ft 7in tall, well-built, with dark spiky hair. He is believed to have had an Eastern European accent.
He was wearing jeans and a dark hooded top, with the hood up.
He ran off in the direction of the airport after the attack.
The woman was taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley for treatment. She has since been released.
Police have appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact them.
Det Insp Louise Harvie, from Police Scotland, said: "Merksworth Way is one of three streets with a grassy area joining them all.
"The lady was cutting across the path in that grassy area when she was attacked by the man.
"She hadn't seen anybody about and just remembers him approaching her and then attacking her.
"Thankfully the woman got help from someone in one of the houses nearby and police were called."
She added: "The area is residential so it's possible that someone may have heard either a disturbance or shouting that was out of the ordinary.
"Either that or they may have seen the man hanging about the area.
"This was a terrifying attack for the lady to go through.
"It is vital we catch this man, so if you have any information that you may think will help police with their inquiries, then please contact Paisley Police Office via 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where details can be given in confidence."
