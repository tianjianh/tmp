Watson's serve was broken four times as the world number 56 lost the first set in 30 minutes to the 2009 champion.
Watson, 24, who has not made the third round in Paris in six attempts, tested the Russian in a closer second set.
"She was just better than me today," Watson said. "I tried to stick with her but a few points made the difference."
British number one Johanna Konta, Laura Robson and Naomi Broady all lost in the first round at Roland Garros.
Andy Murray, Kyle Edmund and Aljaz Bedene are all in the second round of the men's singles, with Murray and Edmund in action later on Wednesday and Bedene playing on Thursday.
Elsewhere in the women's singles, Romania's 2014 French Open finalist Simona Halep fought back from 4-1 down in the first set to beat Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan 7-6 (7-5) 6-2.
