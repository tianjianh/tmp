[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 0-1 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers' League Two play-off hopes suffered a blow as Shola Ameobi grabbed the only goal in Notts County's win at Adams Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ameobi scored via the post after 27 minutes to ensure Wycombe fall to 11th, four points behind seventh-placed Exeter.
But County took a giant step towards Football League safety, moving 13 points clear of the drop zone.
Both sides traded chances in a frenetic opening with Jon Stead forcing a brilliant save from Jamal Blackman, before Luke O'Nien blazed an effort over from seven yards.
The midfielder was then denied a goal by a terrific block by Richard Duffy and it proved a crucial intervention as County scored from their next attack when Ameobi rattled a shot in via the post, following some brilliant work by Stead.
Wycombe tried to claw their way back into the game and should have levelled when Adebayo Akinfenwa volleyed wide of the post.
The hosts then appealed for a penalty when Myles Weston went down in the box but referee Ross Joyce waved play on as the Magpies survived.
