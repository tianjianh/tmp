Spectre stars Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux, along with producer Barbara Broccoli, were presented with an official certificate on Monday.
The official title holder is Oscar-winner Chris Corbould, who created the explosive scene for the film.
The 7.5 second scene was shot in Morocco. Watch the explosion here.
The blast used 68.47 tonnes (68470 kg) of TNT equivalent and was the result of detonating 8,418 litres of kerosene with 33 kg of powder explosives.
Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said: "It is absolutely tremendous that the Guinness World Records have recognised Chris Corbould's incredible work in Spectre.
Guinness World Records editor-in-chief Craig Glenday added: "The James Bond movies are synonymous with pushing cinematic boundaries. The scene featuring the world's largest film stunt explosion is spectacular and will live long in the memory as one of the outstanding moments in the Bond franchise."
Corbould won an Oscar for Inception in 2010.
Spectre, the 24th film in the spy franchise, is currently at the top of the North America and UK box offices, with earnings of $73m (Â£48.5m)
But the film failed to beat the performance of the last Bond movie Skyfall in the US and Canada, which took $88.4m (Â£58.5m) in 2012.
Its UK launch set a new record for movies released on a Monday - as opposed to a Friday - taking more than Â£41m in its first week.
Records were also set in Norway, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark.
