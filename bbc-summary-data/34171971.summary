Salisbury's Magna Carta Baron's Trail sculptures removed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salisbury's firefighters are helping remove the city's 25 baron sculptures, created to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Baron's Charter trail marked the creation of the Magna Carta by medieval English barons, seen by many as the foundation of democracy.
Forklift trucks will be used to move the half-ton, 5ft 3in barons on Monday, after 12 weeks on display.
They will go on show near the cathedral before being auctioned for charity.
Fire fighters and humanitarian response organisation Serve On are removing the painted sculptures decorated by artists from sites across the city, to take them for repairs before they are displayed outside the cathedral.
The whole lot will be auctioned to raise money for poverty charity The Trussell Trust, which runs the UK's largest foodbank network.
Jenny Marshall, from the charity, told BBC Wiltshire the trail had been much more successful than anticipated.
Having originally printed 30,000 trail maps for the whole event, they ran out in two-and-a-half weeks and eventually got through more than 80,000.
Only four original 1215 copies of the Magna Carta - Latin for Great Charter - remain, one of the best preserved of which is at Salisbury Cathedral.
