Johanna Konta will not complain about Australian Open schedule

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Johanna Konta says she would be a "real princess" to complain about playing two matches in two days after reaching the Australian Open semi-finals.

The British number one beat China's Zhang Shuai to set up a last four meeting with seventh seed Angelique Kerber (04:30 GMT, Thursday).

"I'm fine," said Konta, 24. "Whatever comes, I'm enjoying it."
Konta, who is guaranteed prize money of Â£370,000, is the first British woman to reach a major semi-final since 1983.
Jo Durie was the last person to achieve that feat, at the US Open in 1983.
Konta also joins Virginia Wade, the Australian Open champion in 1972, and Sue Barker, a semi-finalist in 1975 and 1977, as the only British women to reach the last four at the Australian Open since the open era began in 1968.
Konta was ranked 47 in the world before this tournament and her exploits mean she is likely to break into the world's top 30 on the back of her success in Melbourne.

She says, however, that she does not let her results - good or bad - consume her.
"If you live and die with your wins and losses it is an incredibly tough lifestyle to live," she said. "Separating myself from that gave me a lot of enjoyment and perspective.
"It gave me some peace to realise that I am also working on myself for post-tennis. There is a whole rest of my life for when I retire from tennis whenever that may be - hopefully not for a number of years if I stay nice and healthy."
"Both of them are false," said Konta. "I had a lot of ear infections when I was younger so I didn't learn to swim until I was about 14 so that is definitely false. I was a decent 800m runner, not 400m.
"I'm actually really proud of this... I won at school, I beat the girls and boys so it was a big deal at the time when I was about 11.
"Then I won the district race and I made the state but I just never went because I was training in tennis. It was a big part of my life at that point.
"For me, it has always been tennis. I haven't really explored any other avenues."
Konta was born in Sydney to Hungarian parents and settled in the UK when aged 14 before becoming a British citizen in May 2012.
"Actually I am a tri-citizen," she said. "I've got a Hungarian passport as well. Just add that into the mix - I'm pretty much the female version of Jason Bourne."
When it was suggested other countries may try to claim her allegiance, she added: "That's a real lost cause. I definitely belong to Great Britain."
