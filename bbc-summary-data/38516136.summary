Catherine O'Brien, 37, from Salford, Greater Manchester said she is having surgery to remove one of her kidneys and become a living donor next month.
She said her husband Shaun found a cancerous lump on his neck in 2015. He was given the all-clear following surgery and treatment in March.
"I'm sharing a spare rather than losing one," said truck driver Catherine.
She said she heard of another woman becoming a living donor and turned to her husband and said: "I could do that."
Catherine contacted Salford Royal Hospital and "it went from there".
Although she has never had surgery before, she said: "I'm sort of excited as I know the impact it will have on someone and their family."
She said her husband was "100% behind me".
"I suppose he's worried... it is a major operation but it is a very safe and highly successful."
Catherine said she was not concerned about problems which may occur as a result of having only one remaining kidney in future.
"I could get hit by a bus tomorrow. I'm just providing the organ; the NHS are doing the hard work."

NHS Blood and Transplant said more than 500 people have helped save the life of stranger by becoming a living kidney donor since changes to the law made it possible a decade ago.
Lead nurse for Living Donation at NHS Blood and Transplant Lisa Burnapp said: "Nearly 300 people died waiting for a kidney transplant last year.
"Hundreds of people have had their lives saved and transformed in reaching this milestone over the past decade, thanks to the incredible generosity of these donors."
