[SN]TITLE[SN]
Threat of jail lifted for households who do not pay bills

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in the Republic of Ireland who do not pay government bills, including water charges, will no longer face the risk of going to jail under new plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Irish government is said to be in favour of taking the money straight from wages and social welfare payments as a last resort.
The proposals on debt, which have been formulated by the departments of justice and the environment, will be discussed by the cabinet on Wednesday.
Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin said it was a "general provision" which would apply to all small debts, including water bills.
He said the idea behind the proposal was that "people wouldn't go to jail for not paying a TV licence and that a plumber or electrician who can't collect a debt owed to them would be able to do so".
"We've been looking for some time at ways to ensure those who won't pay as opposed to those who can't pay, will pay their bills," he said.
The joint proposals between the two government departments propose that those who can not play will be invited to enter into "payment plans" and will be given the option to pay their bills on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.
However, those who will not pay face having the bills deducted from their incomes.
The proposals on debt collection and enforcement were based on a report by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) in 2010.
It recommended that those who did not pay their general debts should not be jailed.
Instead the LRC advocated a graduated process of enforcement, which would see attachment orders apply to earnings, but not if they deprived debtors of a minimum standard of living.
Although households in the Republic of Ireland started receiving their bills for water last month, penalties will not apply until after 15 months of non-payment.
Many householders have objected to paying for their water supply, and have staged large-scale protests against the government scheme.
As part of the Republic of Ireland's international bailout deal in 2010, the government made commitments to restructure its economy, and the introduction of universal domestic water charges was just one of the unpopular changes it agreed to introduce.
Amid widespread protests, it revised its plans last November to introduce a number of caps on charges, including water conservation grants of 100 euros (??74) a year.
