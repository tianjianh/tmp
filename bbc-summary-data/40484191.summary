Champions League qualifier, second leg: La Fiorita 0-0 Linfield (0-1 on agg)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Linfield secured a money-spinning Champions League tie against Celtic as a goalless draw in San Marino earned a 1-0 aggregate win over La Fiorita.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cameron Stewart missed a great first-half chance for Linfield but they had to battle hard to repel pressure from the home side in the second period.
Aaron Burns also wasted a second-half chance but the visitors had some nervous moments before progressing.
Linfield will host Celtic in their first leg on Friday 14 July.
It is estimated that the second qualifying round tie against the Scottish champions could earn the Irish Premiership winners up to £1million in Uefa prize money, gate receipts, television revenue, advertising and merchandising.
Security concerns around the tie led to agreement that any potential first leg between the clubs at Windsor Park would be moved from the normal midweek slot to the Friday because of the clash with the 12th of July marches in Northern Ireland.
Celtic also announced they would not take supporters to Belfast because of safety worries.
Linfield had the better of the possession in the first half with Andrew Waterworth having an early chance stopped by La Fiorita keeper Gianluca Vivan before Stewart headed his great opportunity over the crossbar on 37 minutes after a superb Jamie Mulgrew cross.
However, the home produced intense pressure immediately after the restart and, for the most part, Linfield retreated into their own half during the remainder of the contest as they held on to the first-leg lead secured by Jordan Stewart's late goal.
A dreadful clearance by keeper Vivan gifted a lobbed chance to substitute Burns in the 70th minute but he pulled his shot badly wide.
La Fiorita, aiming for a first win in a European tie at the sixth attempt, produced intense late pressure but their only clear opening came two minutes from time when substitute Adrian Ricchiuti had an effort blocked.
The San Marino champions continued to press during the four minutes of injury-time, although Mulgrew did produce a late break into the La Fiorita penalty area before being handed a yellow card after being adjudged to have dived in the box.
Linfield manager David Healy told the club's website: "I'm delighted. Our main objective was to get through into the second round. We've done that and we've earned the right to play a fantastic club in Celtic.
"The players worked their socks off. Was it pretty? No it wasn't, but it was effective. The players were organised and they gave everything in their bodies tonight."
