A cannon was fired at Edinburgh Castle to signal the start of the two-minute silence to mark Armistice Day.
Services of remembrance were held at churches and war memorials around the country.
It is 98 years since the guns fell silent in World War One at the 11th hour, on the 11th day of the 11th month.
In Glasgow, Poppyscotland volunteers broke from a day of fundraising activities to pay their respects at the city's cenotaph in George Square.
The Lord Provost, Sadie Docherty, joined them and read Laurence Binyon's For The Fallen.
The city centre square is currently home to the Every Man Remembered statue, which depicts an unknown soldier in glass case, surrounded by hundreds of poppies.
Commemorations also took place in the capital, with events organised at the Princes Street garden of remembrance, Edinburgh Waverley station and Edinburgh Castle.
Nicola Sturgeon did not attend a public event, but a spokeswoman for the first minister said she observed the two-minute silence and would be at a Remembrance service on Sunday.
In Paisley, pupils from two primary schools joined military, civic and church representatives for the annual Renfrewshire children's armistice service.
After the event in Paisley Abbey, they headed to the town's cenotaph for a two-minute silence.
More than 700,000 men were killed in World War One - 1.7% of the population of the United Kingdom.
Scotland was particularly badly affected and new figures reveal the impact of the bloody conflict on towns across the country.
In a list of the 10 UK towns worst-affected by the Great War, six are Scottish.
Durham tops the list compiled by Ancestry, but Dumfries is third, having lost 4.79% of its population of just over 30,000 in the war.
The survey found:
It also revealed that 13,740 people from Glasgow died in the war - only London suffered more losses during the 1914-18 conflict.
Ancestry senior content manager Miriam Silverman said: "The First World War was devastating for communities across the UK.
"Sadly many brave soldiers did not return to their cities, towns and villages, leaving friends and families bereft.
"It may be a century ago, but their communities and country as a whole honour their bravery today."
In Bishopton, Renfrewshire, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay joined veterans from the Erskine care home to lay wreaths and remember their fallen colleagues.
Meanwhile, 20 of Scotland's most famous landmarks will glow red at the weekend in support of the Scottish Poppy Appeal.
Edinburgh Castle, The Kelpies and St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney are among the structures taking part in the "Light Up Red" campaign.
The heavy horse statue next to the M8 motorway near Ballieston will also wear a specially-designed poppy to celebrate the appeal.
Poppyscotland's head of fundraising, Gordon Michie, said: "It's fantastic to see Scotland lighting up poppy red for the Scottish Poppy Appeal, and we've been blown away by the country's support.
"We hope that when people see all these wonderful iconic structures glowing red over the weekend they will think about the many ways they too can go the extra mile in their support for this year's Poppy Appeal.
"Whether it's putting a little bit more in the poppy tin, or doing something completely different to raise money, every penny helps us to offer life-changing support so we can be there when they call for backup."
