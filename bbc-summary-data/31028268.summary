A man has died after he reportedly shot himself in the head while he was being followed by the police in the Republic of Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony John Ward was being pursued by officers over the suspected abduction of a woman, but he crashed the car he was driving near the M50, south Dublin.
It is believed the 31-year-old got out of the car and shot himself in front of officers just after midnight on Monday.
The Irish police watchdog is carrying out an investigation into the death.
The Garda (Police) Ombudsman is obliged to carry out an independent investigation when a person either dies or comes to serious harm after having been in contact with police.
Mr Ward, who was from the Crumlin area of Dublin, was taken to hospital in a critical condition after the shooting and died on Tuesday.
It has been reported that the woman alerted a police patrol about the alleged abduction, when Mr Ward stopped at a filling station off the M50 and ordered her to buy cigarettes.
He attempted to flee alone, but crashed his vehicle a short distance away near the Spawell roundabout, Templeogue.
In a statement, the ombudsman's office said: "A previous incident involving the man had been reported to gardaÃ­, and as a result they had been observing the vehicle when the man lost control of it."
