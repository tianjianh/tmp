Grant, 25, who spent a month on loan at Highbury Stadium in 2014, returns after being released by Blackpool, having spent most of last term at Shrewsbury.
"We want to add goals to the team and Bobby will provide that," boss Graham Alexander told the club website.
Della-Verde, 20, was released by Fulham last month, and has been with the Cod Army for pre-season.
He was a youth player with Tottenham and Southend and was loaned to Bristol Rovers last season where he made seven appearances.
"He can operate in various positions, he is mainly left-footed but he is comfortable on his right," Alexander said.
