The 21-year-old has come through the academy system at Wire but is yet to feature for their first team.
He is available for selection immediately and could feature in Salford's next game against Castleford.
"Sean is a player we've had our eye on for a while and it's great that he's signed for the Red Devils," head coach Ian Watson told the club website.
"He has shown great potential and shown that he is ready to step up to a Super League level. He is hugely ambitious and will fit in well with the squad we already have here at the club."
