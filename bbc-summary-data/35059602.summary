The 40-year-old lifted the county from sixth to a third-placed finish in Championship Division Two after standing in temporarily following Paul Grayson's departure in September.
Silverwood had been Grayson's assistant since January 2014 and was "unanimously" chosen by a panel.
"I passionately want to see Essex be successful," he said.
Former England captains Keith Fletcher and Graham Gooch, cricket committee chairman Ronnie Irani and recruitment specialist Wasim Haq were part of the selection panel, which interviewed a five-man shortlist.
"There were some big names on the panel, and to know I've got the support of those guys is immense," added Silverwood.
"There was so much knowledge sat around that table, and to have them pick me out is fantastic."
Silverwood appeared for Yorkshire, Middlesex and Essex during his playing career, taking 577 first-class wickets at an average of average of 27.41 in 184 matches.
He made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 1996 and later made five further appearances, the last in the 2002-03 Ashes series in Australia, and also played seven one-day internationals.
"Chris Silverwood is a tremendous young coach with the vision, passion and dedication that this club deserves," said Essex chief executive Derek Bowden, who was also on the selection panel.
"His work with the England Lions this month, alongside his time spent with other England and Wales Cricket Board development squads over the past few years, demonstrates how highly regarded he is in the game of cricket."
