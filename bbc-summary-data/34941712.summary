A woman and her children have fled from their home after an arson attack in Antrim.

A car belonging to the family, originally from India, was destroyed.
Subi Philip and her two children, aged ten and eight, were inside the house at Meadow Drive when the attack happened at about 06:20 GMT.
Her husband was not at home as he had returned to India for his father's funeral. Police are treating the attack as a hate crime.
"We believe that the attack was motivated by racial hatred," said Ch Insp John Allen.
"Any attack on property is unacceptable, however I totally condemn the racial hate crime element of this attack, which makes it particularly repugnant "
Mrs Philip, a cardiac nurse, said the attack had left her family "distraught".
She told the BBC that they had been alerted early on Friday by a noise outside.
"I just heard a big bang and got out of my bed and saw a big fire. When I came downstairs and saw it, I started screaming.
"My girls didn't know why I was screaming and they were screaming too. I was really panicking."
When neighbours knocked at Mrs Philip's door, urging her to get out of the house, she initially feared that they were the arsonists and refused to leave.
"I was scared. I wasn't sure if they were there to attack me and my girls or not," she said.
When she realised that they were trying to help, she opened the door and fled with her children.
"I got out and I ran," she said.  "It was so scary."
She said she has no idea why anyone would attack her home.
Members of the local Indian community gathered at the house to offer their support to the family.
Mrs Philip's friend, Siba Thomas, said he was shocked when he arrived at the scene of the attack.
"We have around 60 Indian families here, most of us work in the Antrim Area Hospital as either nurses or doctors.
"We work along with the community. Most of our children were born here and go to the local school.
"The community here is very welcoming, the people are so nice.
"So it's very unfortunate to see things happening like this, that someone would have that mindset."
UUP MLA for South Antrim, Adrian Cochrane-Watson, said Mrs Philip got her children out of bed and "escaped up the street to safety".
He said: "This is a young mother who has been living in this country for a number of years, set up home.
"This is a lady, a professional who is saving lives every day of the week and rehabilitating people who are suffering from heart disease or heart attacks."
The Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze was being treated as deliberate.
Police have appealed for information.
