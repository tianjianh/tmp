Ryan Clarke joins AFC Wimbledon after leaving Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon have signed Ryan Clarke after the goalkeeper was released by Northampton Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clarke, 34, was signed on a two-year deal last summer, but his contract has been terminated by mutual consent.
The form of Adam Smith meant Clarke made only four first-team appearances for the Cobblers last season and did not feature at all in the league.
Wimbledon, also promoted to League One via the play-offs, have not disclosed the length of Clarke's contract.
"It's a fantastic opportunity for me," he told Wimbledon's website.
"To join a club of this stature, with its history is an honour and a privilege. It's going to be an exciting season ahead in League One."
Clarke, who started his career at Bristol Rovers, joined Northampton after leaving Oxford United.
