A photographer has captured a stunning image of a halo that could be seen around the moon on Thursday night.
Called a 22-degree halo, the large rings of light can be seen in certain conditions around the moon, and also the sun.
Calum MacLean took his image in a field near Inverness.
Haloes are caused by "poorly orientated" hexagonal ice crystals.
Dr Edward Graham, a meteorologist at the University of the Highlands and Islands' Lews Castle College in Stornoway, Lewis, said: "Crystals actually often orientate themselves when falling.
"For example, try throwing a flat piece of paper downwards and it always moves into a laminar, flat orientation - just like a crystal.
"But in this case, turbulence might keep the crystals randomly orientated."
He added: "I think last night's display was widespread across the whole of Scotland, it was good here in Stornoway too."
