The major security operation began at about 14:30 GMT on Monday at flats at John Street, close to Craigavon Bridge, and ended just after 20:00 GMT.
Police said they had concerns for the welfare of a man who was in a distressed state in one of the flats but have confirmed that no weapons were found at the scene.
Residents had to be moved from their homes for several hours.
Specialist police units and other emergency services were involved in the operation.
The closure of two of the city's main streets during rush hour also caused major traffic disruption.
Ch Insp Tony Callaghan said: "This was a fluid and very delicate situation and we had real concerns for the man involved as well as the residents.
"We deployed negotiators to the scene, they talked to the man throughout this operation because our priority was to make sure no harm came to anyone. The man gave himself up to police and was arrested, we searched the property and made sure everything was safe.
"The investigation is ongoing, it is live, but we can say that the initial information which led to our response came from the individual involved."
Sinn FÃ©in Councillor Patricia Logue, who was at the scene on Monday, said she was relieved that nobody was hurt.
"I spoke to some of those people who had to be moved from their homes and it was good to see that the council acted quickly to make sure there was temporary accommodation made available for any residents who needed it.
"Thankfully it didn't go on too late into the night and I hope this man gets the care that he needs."
