[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alastair Cook scored an unbeaten 67 as Essex thrashed Middlesex to make it five wins from six in the One-Day Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Put into bat, Middlesex were bowled out for 148, with no batsman making more than opener Dawid Malan (23).
Jamie Porter (4-40) and Paul Walter (4-37) did the damage before a last-wicket stand of 31 between Steven Finn (13) and Ravi Patel (18) boosted the total.
Cook then struck 10 fours alongside Ravi Bopara (33 not out) to ease Essex to victory with 122 balls remaining.
Essex and Cook have been in fantastic form in the 50-over format this season and the comfortable win sets up a top-of-the-table clash with first-placed Somerset on Sunday.
Middlesex, on the other hand, have won just two of their seven matches in the One-Day Cup and are in seventh place, two points adrift of the qualifying places having played a game more.
