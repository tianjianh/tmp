[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is visiting two Tata steel plants in Scotland which have been earmarked for closure, with the loss of 270 jobs.

Ms Sturgeon is meeting workers, unions and management at the Dalzell plate rolling works in Motherwell and the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang.
Tata this week confirmed plans to mothball both facilities.
The Scottish government has said it will "leave no stone unturned" in its efforts to keep the plants open.
Ms Sturgeon has set up a Scottish steel task force, which will "seek a viable alternative to the potential mothballing of Tata Steel operations in Scotland".
It will also look to support the 270 staff affected by the move.
The task force, which is due to hold its first meeting next week, will be chaired by Scottish business minister Fergus Ewing and include representatives from Tata Steel, trade unions, local councils, Scottish government agencies and local politicians.
Tata has blamed the planned closures on a flood of cheap imports from China, a strong pound and high electricity costs.
It said it had looked at "all other options" before taking the decision.
Tata Steel human resources director Tor Farquhar later said he was "pessimistic" about the Scottish plants re-opening.
The trade union Community, which represents many of the steel workers affected, welcomed the setting up of a task force.
However, it added that it needed to come up with "real, practical solutions that protect the workforce, the skills and the assets until we can find an alternative and sustainable future".
Meanwhile, Scottish Labour called on the government to make a statement to the Scottish parliament next week on the steel industry.
Labour MSP James Kelly said Scottish ministers must report on the outcome of the task force's first meeting and set out the specific actions that will be taken to protect jobs and secure a future for the steel industry.
Mr Kelly, who is a member of the task force, added: "The steel industry is an iconic part of the culture, community and economy of Lanarkshire. Generations of families have worked at the plants in Clydebridge and Dalzell.
"We must move heaven and earth to save jobs and secure a future for the steel industry in Scotland."
The decision to close the two Tata plants in Scotland in effect ends production at the country's last two major steelworks.
The Dalzell Steel and Iron Works opened in 1872, and Clydebridge in 1887.
The plants became two of the giants of Scottish industry, with Clydebridge providing steel plates for many of the most famous ships built on the River Clyde.
