Wilson hit 72 before he was out lbw to seamer Nathan Buck - who ended with 3-54 - seven balls before the close.
All of the hosts' dismissed batsmen made double figures but Ben Sanderson took two wickets and Rory Kleinveldt one.
Alex Hughes and Jeevan Mendis were not out at stumps with 71 overs bowled.
Ireland international Wilson joined Derbyshire from Surrey in September and hit 10 fours in his 104 ball innings.
