The 72-year-old opera singer, who used to live in Chelsea, has made 200 appearances at the Royal Opera House during a career that began in 1959.
"I am blessed to have amassed and nurtured an enduring relationship with London," he said after being nominated.
The Freedom of the City dates back to 1237 and is given for outstanding contributions to London life.
On his London connection, the Madrid-born tenor said: "I am proud of having once called Chelsea a home, and having embedded so much of my history here. I am now filled with emotion and gratitude."
He was given the honour in a ceremony at the Mansion House in the City of London, the Lord Mayor's official residence.
Alderman Roger Gifford, the Lord Mayor, said: "His exceptional legacy to classical music will endure for decades to come."
The singer has received numerous international accolades, including the Spanish Prince of Asturias Award for Arts, Commander of the French Legion d'Honneur, the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
