The Leicester rockers are opening the Baftas at the Royal Opera House next month instead of playing at the Brits at London's O2.
The 34-year-old guitarist said: "It's a conspiracy. They're trying to shut rock'n'roll out.
"What sort of message does that send to working class rock'n'roll bands which the industry is in dire need of?"
The band, who won the award for best British group in 2010, didn't get any Brit nominations when they were announced earlier this month.
That's despite them being nominated in eight categories for the NME Awards after the release of their fifth studio album 48:13, which topped the Official Albums Chart, and a headline slot at Glastonbury.
Pizzorno called the Brits "awful from start to finish" in 2013 while Kasabian singer Tom Meighan described that year's ceremony as "terrible".
Talking to the Independent, the guitarist said they had their best year ever in 2014.
"Kasabian couldn't have done any more last year.
"It's way more exciting to be playing the Baftas than the Brits.
"It's a huge honour to open the Baftas because we're all such great film fans.
"It'll be a strange old show playing in front of a load of penguins, but it's going to be great.
"We're going to start the night off with a huge explosion. We're going to play everything twice as loud.
"Half the people there won't have a clue what is going on."
Alt-J, Clean Bandit, Coldplay, One Direction and Royal Blood are up for best group at this year's Brits while the album of the year prize will be fought out between Alt-J, Ed Sheeran, George Ezra, Royal Blood and Sam Smith.
The live act category was dropped after 2013's ceremony.
We've asked the organisers of the Brits for a response to Sergio Pizzorno's comments.
