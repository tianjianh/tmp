Nick Blackwell: Retired boxer criticises 'inhuman' reaction of Chris Eubank camp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Retired boxer Nick Blackwell says Chris Eubank Jr and his father were "inhuman" in how they reacted to his life-threatening injuries post-fight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blackwell, 25, suffered a bleed on the brain in a loss to Eubank Jr in March and was put in an induced coma.
The Eubanks held a news conference after the British middleweight clash, while Blackwell was in hospital.
"My family and friends were begging them not to talk, but they ignored it," Blackwell told the Sun.
"I was still in a coma but they went ahead and did it. I've only just been shown the press conference and I know exactly what happened - it isn't human what they've done."

Blackwell woke from his coma a week later without requiring an operation.
Eubank Jr stopped him in the 10th round after Eubank Sr had advised his son to avoid aiming for the head and instead concentrate his efforts on the body at Wembley Arena.
"If Chris Jr was in a coma and I wanted to do a press conference on the Tuesday and their family was begging me not to do it, I would not do it," added Blackwell. "It's inhuman, it's disgusting.
"That's the Eubanks, isn't it? They just want attention, no matter if it's a bad or a good thing."
Speaking to the Sun, Eubank Jr defended their actions in the aftermath of the fight.
"People and media demanded that we speak to them - if we had just said 'no comment' it would have come off as cold," he said.
"If Nick is part of the small percentage that took offence, that's unfortunate - it's sad for me to hear something like that.
"All I have ever wanted for Nick has been the best."
