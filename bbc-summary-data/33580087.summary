Dorothy Jones, 75, was fatally injured when she was struck by a silver Ford Transit truck in Nantlle Road, Talysarn, on Friday afternoon.
She was airlifted to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, but later died.
Her family said she was "the kindest, most generous person with a heart of gold".
Ms Jones, known as Dot, was born in Stockport and worked at Stepping Hill Hospital from the age of 16, before later moving to Cilgwyn to run a small holding, and then Talysarn, near Nantlle.
Her daughters Tracey and Caroline described her as a "wonderful mum and nana" to her grandchildren Ryan and Holly.
"We are in total disbelief at the moment," a tribute from them read.
"If anyone asked us for two words to sum mum up it would be 'free spirit'. She was the kindest, most generous person with a heart of gold.
"It will be very hard for us as family and friends now, as she was killed so close to her home."
Police want to speak to anyone who may have seen Ms Jones walking her lurcher dog along the road before she was hit.
