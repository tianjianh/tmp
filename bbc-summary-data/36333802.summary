The incident occurred in the 84th minute of Wednesday's Confederation Cup match between Sudan's Al Merreikh and Kawkab Marrakech of Morocco.
Caf is reviewing the incident and awaiting the match officials' report.
Kawkab won the match 2-0 - with two penalties - for a 2-1 aggregate win.
Caf director of communications Junior Binyam told BBC Sport: "Investigations are being carried out and the the case will be submitted to the disciplinary jury."
Kawkab were 1-0 up in Wednesday's second leg of the play-offs tie - with the score 1-1 on aggregate - when a number of Merreikh club officials entered the field.
In the ensuing melee, Al Merreikh's director football Hatim lashed out with his left arm and seemed to strike Otogo-Castane on the right side of his head.
After play resumed, Kawkab went on to win an 89th-minute penalty which they converted to earn their place in the group stage of Africa's second tier club competition.
