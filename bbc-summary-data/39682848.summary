[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton saw off already-relegated Swindon with a comfortable win at The Valley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The last game of the season saw the visitors start the stronger with Anton Rodgers hitting the bar from a free-kick.
But it was Charlton who took the lead on 15 minutes when Chelsea loanee Jay Dasilva's cross was headed home by striker Josh Magennis.
In a game which saw flares and balloons launched in more protests against Charlton's owner Roland Duchatelet, Nathan Byrne and Magennis came close to doubling the hosts' lead.
The Addicks were dominating and got their second on 43 minutes when Jake Forster-Caskey turned in a Byrne cross from close range.
Johnnie Jackson was then prevented from scoring by Will Henry when the keeper saved well from the Addicks' captain.
An offside flag then saw a Islam Feruz goal for Swindon chalked off.
Charlton's third came on 66 minutes when Ricky Holmes slid a shot past Henry from a Byrne pass to wrap up the points.
