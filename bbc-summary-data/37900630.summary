Sherri Papini, 34, was last seen on Wednesday jogging in her neighbourhood. Her husband said he suspected his wife had been abducted after she failed to pick up their children from childcare.
Local police who have interviewed some 290 people, say her disappearance is "suspicious".
Her family is offering $50,000 for information regarding her whereabouts.
In an interview with ABC News, Keith Papini said: "Everybody who knows my wife knows that there's no reason for her to leave ... She was definitely taken against her will."
Mr Papini told police that he had discovered his wife's phone on the side of the road on Wednesday.
She had sent a text message to his phone earlier in the day asking him if he would be coming home for lunch.
"She could drop her phone but she would never in a million years not pick up our children on a time that she normally would have," Mr Papini told ABC News.
Shasta county police officers have urged the public to come forward with any information about Ms Papini's disappearance and said they were piecing together information from various sources.
