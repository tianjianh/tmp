Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward wants to remain at promoted Huddersfield after helping them rise into the Premier League.

Ward was on loan with the Terriers from Liverpool in the Championship and does not want to leave after his penalty shoot-out heroics helped take them up.
The 23-year-old's saves helped them beat Sheffield in the semi-final and Reading in the play-off final.
"On a selfish point, yes, I would like to stay at Huddersfield," said Ward.
"I am only young for a goalkeeper and to have a chance of playing week-in week-out in the Premier League would be good experience for someone of my age."
Ward accepts Liverpool will decide his future as they contemplate a season in which they return to the Champions League, but he would prefer regular games with Huddersfield to the likelihood of sitting on the Reds' bench.
"It's in the hands of Liverpool because ultimately I'm their player," said Ward.
"They've got to decide what's best.
"Liverpool have my contract and their needs come first, especially with the Champions League."
Ward and his Wales team-mates are preparing for Sunday's 2018 World Cup Pool D qualifier against Serbia, but he is expected to be on the bench with Crystal Palace's Wayne Hennessey preferred.
He will go into the game having been congratulated for his efforts with Huddersfield by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp.
"After the final he said, 'Congratulations and keep it up'," said Ward said.
"His relationship with the Huddersfield manager David Wagner has been well documented and that's been good for me.
"I know they were in constant contact and hopefully he (Klopp) has heard only good things."
