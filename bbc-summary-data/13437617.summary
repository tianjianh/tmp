Seventeen firefighters, including rope rescue specialists, were called to the scene at about 2025 BST on Tuesday.
An ambulance service spokesman said he had fallen about 50ft (15m), but tumbled in three stages.
The 48-year-old man, from Herefordshire, was then taken to hospital with suspected spinal injuries and severe concussion.
Firefighters from the Gloucestershire and Hereford and Worcester services, ambulance crews from West Midlands and Great Western ambulance services, police and mountain rescuers attended.
A spokesman from the West Midlands Ambulance Service said the rescue had involved getting the man from the bottom of the 50ft drop to the top. He was taken to Hereford County Hospital.
"Considering he'd fallen 50ft but he had fallen and tumbled in three stages he came off pretty OK," the spokesman said.
"Considering the distance he'd fallen, he was very lucky indeed."
