A member of the public dialled 999 at about 14:50 on Monday after the small terrier named Pepsi disappeared at cliffs at Findon.
Coastguard teams from Aberdeen, Stonehaven and Cruden Bay took part in a search along the coastline between Portlethen and Cove.
They were assisted by Aberdeen RNLI lifeboats.
Potential sightings were later reported in the Portlethen area.
Pepsi's owner Claire Muir, of Aberdeen, posted a message on Facebook appealing for help from anyone who may have spotted the dog in the area.
She wrote: "Saddest day for a long, long time in the Muir household today as our utterly, completely, immeasurably adored canine bestie disappeared whilst on her doggy daycare escapades.
"Despite incredible and quite unbelievable efforts from the Aberdeen, Stonehaven and Cruden Bay coastguard teams, our curly haired rascal hasn't shown up.
"They've sent us home but they're still there in the hope she's snuck off somewhere and may show up. We are holding out our very biggest and best hopes that this is the case - miracles do happen.
"If anyone sees our Pepsi in that area, or any other Aberdeen or Aberdeenshire area, please, please, please let us know."
