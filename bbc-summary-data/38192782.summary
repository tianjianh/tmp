[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 0-2 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Collins fired in twice as Crawley claimed only their second win in nine League Two games with victory at Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Red Devils were the better of two sides desperately out of form and in Collins had their match-winner.
Crewe, under the spotlight for off-the-pitch headlines, are fighting to keep skipper Ryan Lowe from taking up the offer of a coaching post at Bury. The veteran striker was included in the starting XI, but it was Crawley who posed most of the threat.
Josh Payne fizzed a low 20-yard drive past the post before some poor control by Perry Ng allowed a routine cross to drop into the path of Collins, who lashed home the 21st-minute opener.
Enzio Boldewjin spurned a great chance to extend Crawley's lead six minutes before the break when he shot straight at Ben Garratt.
Crewe improved marginally after the restart with Danny Hollands firing over and Chris Dagnall going close. But they lacked a frontman of the calibre of Collins whose intelligent cut-back set up winger Jordan Roberts for a first-time shot which was drilled inches past the far corner.
And the former Shrewsbury and Swindon striker collected his second in the 76th minute after Garratt's loose pass out from the six-yard box was seized on by Billy Clifford who cut the ball back for Collins to sweep home.
