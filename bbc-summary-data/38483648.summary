Despite sleet and snow, the pair were believed to have gone to the summit to see in 2017, but became lost on the descent of the Pyg Track.
A man developed medical problems and was unable to walk by the time Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team (LMRT) rescue team arrived.
A coastguard helicopter from Caernarfon airlifted him off the peak.
Two other mountain rescue teams were put on standby.
Hours earlier, two climbers stuck on a ledge on another Snowdonia peak were brought to safety after an operation lasting more than seven hours.
They had completed a climb on the Idwal Slabs above the Ogwen Valley but were unable to locate a descent route.
A coastguard helicopter could not winch them off because of wind.
Ten members of Ogwen mountain rescue team used ropes to bring them to safety just after midnight on New Year's Day.
In 2016, Llanberis MRT recorded its busiest year with 202 callouts. It has previously said a drive to attract tourism to the region led to an increase in ill-equipped walkers becoming stranded.
