[SN]TITLE[SN]
Italy senate votes to diminish its own power

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In what is deemed a victory for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Italy's senate has voted to cede most of its power.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Senators backed plans to reduce their number by two-thirds, remove the chamber's power to bring down a government, and limit its ability to block legislation.
The moves aim to end decades of political instability in the country.
Senators voted 179 in favour and 16 against the reforms, which will go to a national referendum next year.
Mr Renzi has overcome much opposition to push through the reforms.
However, because it involves a change to the constitution, the bill introducing the changes will have to return to the senate again next year, and pass twice through the lower house.
This will give opponents considerable opportunity to oppose the reforms.
The bill will then have to be ratified through a referendum, adding another hurdle to the process.
