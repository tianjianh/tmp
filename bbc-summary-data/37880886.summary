[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gillingham 2-1 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jay Emmanuel-Thomas grabbed an injury-time winner as Gillingham recorded their first League One victory in eight games by beating Northampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker curled a left-footed shot past Adam Smith in the 92nd minute to give his side their first victory since late September.
John-Joe O'Toole had given Northampton a first-half lead from close range, but Max Ehmer equalised after the break.
The home team started well, but it was the visitors who scored first in the 36th minute as O'Toole squeezed a header through two defenders after being left unmarked in the six-yard box.
The Gills then hit back early in the second half as Ehmer slid in at the back post to convert a flick from Emmanuel-Thomas.
Both sides had chances to take the lead but the game appeared to be petering out into a draw.
However, Emmanuel-Thomas - Gillingham's top scorer this term - pounced late on to give the hosts a win that moves them away from the relegation zone.
