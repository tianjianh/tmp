A 17-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon and cannabis possession.

Local residents turned to social media to express anger at being kept awake through the night.
Among those tweeting, Paul Tanner posted: "What is that music noise coming from Sulham Woods ALL night and still going on? Why hasn't it been stopped?"
