Police said the death was currently being treated as unexplained.
The body is believed to have been discovered in toilets at the Strathallan Castle site in Auchterarder.
A T in the Park spokesman said: "We are extremely saddened by this news, and our thoughts are with the family at this time." He said the organisers were helping police with their inquiries.
Officers are also making inquires into a video which appears to show an assault taking place at the campsite and have appealed for anyone with information to come forward "urgently".
As of mid afternoon on Saturday, Police Scotland said it had made 25 arrests, a similar amount to last year.
About 60,000 revellers are camping at the site, with more than 80,000 music fans expected to attend the festival over the weekend.
