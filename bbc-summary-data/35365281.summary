[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four Seasons Health Care announced it would have to close its home in Garvagh.
In December, it emerged that a prospective buyer was interested in buying the home, however, the sale did not progress.
The sale of three other homes -  in Antrim, Ballynahinch and Armagh -  is going ahead.
The group had been in discussions with two care home operators about selling Hamilton Court in Armagh, as well as Garvagh Care Home.
In a statement, Four Seasons Health Care said there were "no viable options remaining" and so it had "reluctantly re-started the process to close the home".
It said: "As promised, we will ensure that people who chose to remain in the home [in the intervening period] don't lose out in terms of notice.
"We will work with the Health and Social Care Trust and do everything we can to support residents and their families to transfer to suitable alternative placements. The home is expected to close during May 2016.
"We are in discussion with families and with the unions about the closure process.
"We would like to retain as many employees as we can within the Four Seasons Group.  Sales of three other homes are progressing - Antrim Care Home, Oakridge Care Home in Ballynahinch and Hamilton Court in Armagh."
The prospective purchaser of Hamilton Court was the operator of Sanville Nursing Home in County Tyrone.
The firm interested in buying Garvagh Care Home was also an existing care home operator.
