Scottish construction skills gap 'near crisis point'

An ongoing skills shortage in Scottish construction is reaching "crisis point", a report has warned.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said about 30% of respondents to its monthly construction market survey reported an increase in workloads.
But almost two-thirds said difficulty in sourcing labour was an obstacle to growth.
A similar percentage reported problems in finding enough bricklayers.
Just under two-thirds of chartered surveyors predicted a growth in construction workloads during the next 12 months.
But Rics said growth in Scottish construction would only be sustainable if the continuing skills gap was addressed.
Rics Scotland director Sarah Speirs said: "The availability of both blue collar and white collar construction workers is reaching crisis point.
"Without the relevant skills, we will not be able to grow many of the Scottish government's priority construction sectors such as infrastructure.
"Currently, while we know that there is a serious shortage of skills, we don't yet know why we have seen such a dramatic drop in the labour market over the past five years.
"Part of the problem is the legacy of the collapse in the sector following the onset of the global financial crisis.
"Many professionals and other skilled workers chose to leave the industry and quite simply have not returned or been replaced.
"A real focus on attracting more young people into the industry is critical alongside an expansion of apprenticeship opportunities."
Earlier this month, a report prepared on behalf of the Scottish Building Federation suggested confidence among employers in the construction sector had fallen back to levels of the first half of 2014.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said Skills Development Scotland has launched a plan for the sector to ensure it was recruiting and retaining talented workers.
"We will continue to work with bodies including the Federation of Master Builders to increase opportunities for employment in construction, improve how the public and private sector invest in young talent and ensure that Scotland has a skilled workforce across all industries," she said.
"Over the last four years we have delivered more than 100,000 new modern apprenticeships and this will increase to 30,000 each year by 2020."
Scottish Labour's skills and lifelong learning spokesman Iain Gray said: "While the SNP government boast about their apprenticeship programme, it is clear that there are just not enough apprenticeships in key sectors like construction.
"We also know that Scotland needs almost 150,000 engineers by 2022 and if we want our economy to continue to grow we need to fill that gap.
"Yet this year saw a fall in pupils coming out of school with Higher passes in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects.
"We will pay a price in lost opportunity for the Scottish government's complacency."
