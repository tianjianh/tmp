It sets out the infrastructure needed to "best connect to HS2" and also includes a faster bus network, more cycle routes and new rail stations.
The West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority (ITA) adopted the Movement for Growth strategy on Thursday.
After a three-month consultation it said it had a "clear path" to follow.

Extra cycle routes are set to be developed throughout the region.
New tram and train links between Walsall and Stourbridge and new suburban rail lines and stations for Castle Vale, Castle Bromwich and Moseley and Kings Heath also form part of the strategy.
Councillor Roger Lawrence, chairman of the ITA, said the region would "be speaking with one voice" in support of the plans.
"We have a clear path to follow, so now is the time to move forward and deliver these schemes."
The Treasury has pledged Â£1bn of government money to create the new authority, expected to be made up of councils in Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton.
It has also confirmed a 10-year, devolved Â£8bn transport budget, the ITA said.
The high-speed rail network, initially between London and Birmingham, was given the go-ahead by the government in 2012, despite strong opposition.
