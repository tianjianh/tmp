A technical fault left Norwich Half Marathon runners without an official race time, organisers have confirmed.

The fault involved runners' "chip time", usually triggered by microchips worn by entrants as they pass sensors at the start and finish lines.
Organisers said a "malfunction" on Sunday meant not all 3,150 chips were read at the start line at Royal Norfolk Showground.
Organiser Hugh Magill said he was "not interested" in talking about the fault.
He added he was happy to talk about "all the good things" about the half marathon.
Separately, the organisers have apologised on their website and Facebook page and offered to add runners' personally-recorded race times to its official results, which will not be confirmed until Friday.
It said the equipment was tested before the half marathon "but sadly technical faults can hit anyone".
"Regrettably, an equipment malfunction immediately before the race start caused the loss of several hundred start times, and if this affects you then we apologise unreservedly," it said.
It also suggested those with no race time should email with their details and "a brief description of what you were wearing and we will do our best to track you down on the finish line video".
The majority of comments on the half marathon's Facebook page praise the "well organised, friendly" event.
But John Moore went on to say the fault was a "complete fiasco".
Others suggested a refund of the Â£23 fee, or free entry for the 2016 event "as we didn't get what we paid for".
Dave Reading added: "Great event. But paid for a service that I have not received what are you planning to do about this?"
