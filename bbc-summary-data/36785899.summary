[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The United Airlines flight UA2081 took off from Edinburgh Airport at 14:22 but declared a second emergency a short time later.
It comes a day after the same aircraft diverted to Edinburgh from London Heathrow with a fuel leak problem.
There were no passengers on the plane. Edinburgh Airport officials said there had been no impact on operations.
The plane landed back at Edinburgh at 15:30, after circling the airport for 10 minutes.
An United Airlines spokesman said: "United Airlines flight UA2081 from Edinburgh to Chicago today (July 13, 2016), which was being repositioned and was not carrying any customers, returned to Edinburgh Airport after take-off because of a mechanical issue."
