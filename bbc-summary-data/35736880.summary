Pochettino was aggrieved with the 2-2 draw as Spurs lost the lead against 10 men after Francis Coquelin's red card.
"You feel frustrated and disappointed because at 11 against 10 you need to keep that result," said Pochettino.
Wenger felt Arsenal were in control leading 1-0 before the dismissal, adding: "We have big regrets."

Alexis Sanchez's 76th-minute equaliser gave Arsenal a point after two quick goals from Toby Alderweireld and Harry Kane had put Spurs in front following Aaron Ramsey's opener and Coquelin's dismissal.
Pochettino added: "It is true we missed a big opportunity. It was a game that means a lot to us and the feeling is we missed a big opportunity to move forward but we are young and I was proud of my team."
Look back on a thrilling north London derby
Wenger was left equally frustrated - not by the result, but by Coquelin's 55th-minute sending off for a second yellow card, awarded after he dived in late on Kane.
"I couldn't see how, with 11 against 11, we could drop points," added Wenger, 66. "We made a big mistake when it was 1-0. Francis knows he made a big mistake and we can't complain about the decision."
Arsenal are now without a win in five games and have just three wins in their last 12 outings.
Wenger added: "I'm very happy with the attitude and character we showed. We refused to lose the game"
Wenger had no complaints about Coquelin's red card, but was understandably aggrieved Spurs' Eric Dier escaped similar punishment later for a blatant shirt pull on Olivier Giroud when he was also on a yellow card.
He said: "I can certainly complain that Dier wasn't sent off. The referee was ruthless with us but not with Tottenham."
Pochettino said: "You could say Hector Bellerin deserved a second yellow card but this was the decision of the referee. They are the bosses on the field."

Spurs were left two points behind leaders Leicester before their kick-off against Watford, with Arsenal five points off the pace.
The Gunners face away trips to West Ham, Sunderland, Everton and Manchester City in their run-in.
Wenger admitted: "I don't know what to say any more about that. Let's see what happens over the weekend. I think we have to take encouragement from this performance and reproduce it until the end of the season and then we might have a chance."
Pochettino urged his side to now be "focused" on Thursday's Europa League trip to Borussia Dortmund ahead of a league run-in which includes trips to Liverpool and Chelsea.
