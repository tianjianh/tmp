A man has been arrested after the top floor of Dunlop House, on Woodstock Link, east Belfast, was destroyed by flames during the early hours.
The fire was spotted by Imelda Fairfield who was working a night-shift in Amber Taxis, opposite the flats.
Along with a co-worker, she entered the building, shouting to raise the alarm.
Ms Fairfield noticed the flames while looking out of the window of the taxi office at about 03:00 BST, and after calling the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS), she ran towards the flats.
"I could see flickering light, realised that it was a fire starting, phoned the fire brigade and radioed over to our driver, saying 'there's a fire across the road'.
"I ran over, started ringing buzzers, got the main door open - me and another guy," Ms Fairfield said.
"We ran in, started shouting and calling, just trying to make as much noise as possible to get people out."
The fire spread from flat to flat causing extensive damage to the roof, but all the residents got out of the building safely.
About 30 firefighters were involved in the operation to extinguish the fire.
"When we arrived it was pandemonium, because people were already evacuating the building," Michael Roberts of NIFRS said.
"There was a large plume of smoke issuing from the roof of the building.
"Our job was to ascertain what the extent of the fire was, extinguish it and at the same time make sure everyone in the building was evacuated."
The detained man, who is 32, was arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life.
The Woodstock Link was closed to traffic for a period while the fire was brought under control.
Dunlop House is run by Helm Housing, one of the largest housing associations in Northern Ireland.
In a statement, it said it had "worked to provide alternative accommodation for all tenants who have been affected".
"We commend emergency services and Helm Housing colleagues for their quick response and urge anyone with information to contact the PSNI immediately," a spokesperson said.
Police have also appealed for information.
