England all-rounder Bopara, 31, led the club to the quarter-finals of the T20 Blast and the One-Day Cup this year.
"Ravi did an excellent job," Ten Doeschate told the club website.
"He has decided he would prefer to concentrate on his individual game next year and make valuable contributions throughout the season."
Bopara took up the one-day captaincy at the start of 2016, with Ten Doeschate stepping up to become skipper in the County Championship.
"We respect Ravi's decision," 36-year-old Dutchman Ten Doeschate added.
"I was more than happy to take up the captaincy in all formats as I have thoroughly enjoyed my role in the Championship."
A club statement said Bopara, who has played 13 Tests, 120 one-day internationals and 38 T20s for England, would "enhance various aspects of his batting and bowling" ahead of next season.
