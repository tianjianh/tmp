Liam Fee murder trial: Mother admits neglect but not murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of Liam Fee neglected him but there was no evidence she assaulted or killed him, a jury has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In his closing speech, Rachel Fee's lawyer Brian McConnachie said there was evidence another boy killed Liam.
He said the jury must put aside any preconceptions and prejudices they might have and look dispassionately at the evidence in this harrowing case.
Rachel and Nyomi Fee deny murdering Liam near Glenrothes in March 2014 and blaming his death on another child.
The women, who are both originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny all the charges against them.
Mr McConnachie QC said: "As far as Rachel Fee is concerned, there is no direct evidence against her that she assaulted Liam."
Mr McConnachie said that she had "no motive" for attacking her son and was guilty only of the "unforgivable crime" of failing to seek medical aid for Liam for a suspected broken leg in the days before his death.
He said: "By failing to get medical help, his mother Rachel Fee committed an unforgivable crime and in due course she will be rightly and justly punished for that.
"That does not make her a murderer.
"Tragedy is an overused word in this court but the death of Liam Fee is a real, genuine tragedy."
He told the jury: "Do not compound that tragedy by convicting Rachel Fee of the murder of her son when there's not a shred of evidence to support that contention.
"The crown case is one of illusion, of smoke and mirrors."
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
