The 26-year-old joined the Rhinos from Brisbane Storm in June and helped the team complete the treble last season.
He is the third Rhinos player to extend their deal this week after Stevie Ward and Jimmy Keinhorst.
"I am really excited about how things are going for the future. This is the most I have enjoyed my footy," he said.
