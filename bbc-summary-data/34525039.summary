Imran and Farzana Ameen and their five children, aged five to 15, were reported missing on Tuesday, West Yorkshire Police said.
Police said the family travelled from their home to Manchester Airport a week earlier, on 6 October.
A relative described the disappearance as "totally out of the blue".
Officers said the family, who live on Birch Lane in the West Bowling area, are believed to have flown to Antalya - though their "current whereabouts are unknown".
Police confirmed Rehan Ameen, 30, brother of Imran Ameen, is also missing. He was last seen on 29 June and also flew to Turkey.
West Yorkshire's assistant chief constable, Russ Foster, said: "We have established they travelled to Turkey on a one-way ticket.
"Although this is being treated as a missing from home inquiry, we are keeping an open mind.
"We haven't ruled out the possibility that the family may intend on travelling to Syria or Iraq."
Arshid Siddique, first cousin of both Imran and Farzana Ameen, who lives on their street, said: "The strange thing is they never saw anyone before they went, never said goodbye.
"I knew there was something not right here, then your worst fears are confirmed.
"My worst fears are they are going to a war zone, not for them, they are adults, it's for the kids."
They were last seen on 5 October.
Turkey is a known staging post for people heading for the Syrian war-zone.
Earlier this year, sisters Khadija Dawood, 30, Sugra Dawood, 34, and Zohra Dawood, 33, also from Bradford, went missing after going on an Islamic pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia with their nine children.
A smuggler told the BBC he had taken them over the border into Syria to an area held by the so-called Islamic State group.
Ishtiaq Ahmed, from the Bradford Council for Mosques, said local people were "shocked and concerned" for the family's welfare.
Speaking to BBC Radio Leeds, Mr Ahmed was asked if his organisation had done enough to dissuade people from travelling to Syria following the disappearance of the Dawoods.
He said: "I think over the years and months we have worked with our membership through mosques, faith schools and other community relations to emphasise to individuals and families that Syria is not a safe place.
"We need to know more information regarding this family - about their whereabouts and motivation. The safety and wellbeing of the children is paramount."
Police said officers were working with family relatives in the UK as well as the Turkish authorities.
