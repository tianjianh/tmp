Carlisle United 1-2 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Stead and Matt Tootle struck inside the final five minutes as Notts County snatched a 2-1 win over League Two play-off hopefuls Carlisle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cumbrians remain in the final play-off spot, after Blackpool's defeat at home by Grimsby, but looked on course for victory when Jabo Ibehre struck just before the hour mark only for the Magpies to hit back in the closing stages.
The visitors had the first opportunity after some scrappy early exchanges when Shola Ameobi's header from Tootle's floated cross was cleared off the line by Carlisle defender Shaun Brisley.
It proved the only meaningful chance of the half and Carlisle manager Keith Curle did not wait long after the break to make changes.
One made an instant impact, with Ibehre latching onto Mark Proctor's ball over the top to smash a thunderous shot from the right side of the area in the 58th minute that left Adam Collin helpless as it hit the roof of the net.
Stead might have drawn County level soon after but dragged his effort wide of the left hand post.
But it was Stead who finally got his side on level terms in the 85th minute, scrambling the ball over the line after Brisley's attempted clearance from Jorge Grant's header left his own goalkeeper Mark Gillespie stranded.
Then just before the end of normal time Tootle fired in a low shot from the right which deceived the diving Gillespie as it bobbled over the goalkeeper to clinch County's fourth straight win.
