Three women were seriously assaulted in Spondon - the first in September 2014 - and another raped in Darley Abbey.
Detectives believe the attacker is connected to the local area and they are "working extremely hard" to catch him, Derbyshire Police said.
Supt Tracy Harrison said the four attacks have had a "life-changing impact" on the victims.

The woman who was attacked in December 2015 described how she fought off the sex attacker.
Sarah, whose identity is being protected, said: "He kept punching me in the head and telling me to shut up.
"Then he was trying to undo my trousers and he was holding my throat. I felt like I couldn't get out the way. It was horrible.
"My friend could hear me screaming, so she rang the police."
Supt Harrison said the force had received "new lines of inquiry" after a dedicated phone number was set up to try to find the person responsible for the attacks.
"I want to thank everyone who has been in touch with us so far," she said.
"The calls and emails that have come in today have provided us with new lines of inquiry and we will be looking into them all."
Extra officers have been drafted in to patrol the areas where the attacks took place.
