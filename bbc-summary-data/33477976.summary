Several thousand people are in the village for the demonstration.
Fifty lodges from counties Donegal, Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan have been joined by lodges from Northern Ireland as well as England and Scotland.
A small number of Orangemen from Canada and America also travelled to the event.
The Orangemen, accompanied by 30 bands, paraded along the one-mile route into the seaside village before a religious service.
Harold Henning, Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, said it was an "excellent venue".
"This is a unique experience. It brings brethren, family, friends from all over our jurisdiction to come there to Rossnowlagh on this special day."
David Mahon, County Grand Master of County Donegal Grand Orange Lodge, said it the event was main highlight of the year for Protestants in the Republic of Ireland.
"This is their annual Twelfth parade and it's been going on since the early 1900s," he said.
"It seems to be getting bigger all the time. It is a very important day for Orangemen."
The march comes before the annual 12 July celebrations in Northern Ireland, marking the 1690 Battle of the Boyne.
The Orange Order invited the Irish President, Michael D Higgins, to the Donegal parade but said it appreciated that he has a busy schedule.
It said it hopes he will be able to attend in the future.
