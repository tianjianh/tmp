Police were called to an address on Preston Avenue at about 02:50 on Sunday where they found a man with serious injuries.
He was taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh but later released.
The woman, who has also been charged with robbery, is expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Tuesday.
Det Insp Paul Batten, of Police Scotland, said: "Our investigation is at an early stage and is very much ongoing.
"We're trying to gather as much information as we can from the local community, which has involved handing out leaflets to members of the public as well as door-to-door visits.
"There will also be an enhanced police presence in the area for the foreseeable future as we work towards establishing what happened within this address."
He added: "I urge anyone who remembers seeing suspicious activity in the area of Preston Avenue during the early hours of Sunday to contact police immediately."
