Elgin City 1-2 Inverness CT

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inverness Caley Thistle came from behind to avoid a shock at Elgin City and reach the fifth round of the Scottish Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Nicolson fired the League Two part-timers in front with a fabulous first-half free-kick.
However, Larnell Cole replied soon after with a low strike.
Lonsana Doumbouya went close with two headers, one brilliantly saved, the other hitting the crossbar, before he touched the winner past Marc Waters.
Elgin threatened an upset when Chris McLeish was brought down on the edge of the area, the free kick was very well worked with Nicholson curling low around the wall into the corner.
Goalkeeper Owain Fon Williams got a hand on it, but was perhaps unsighted by the low winter sun, and couldn't keep it out.
Inverness responded immediately with Gary Warren powering a header home from a corner only for that to be ruled out for a foul.

The equaliser arrived shortly after though when Cole found space on the left side of the area and calmly slotted home.
Doumbouya crashed a header off the bar before muscling his way into the box to touching home a cross which appeared to come off a defender on route for what proved to be the winner.
Iain Vigurs also hit the woodwork with a lovely curling free-kick as the visitors sought  to make things more comfortable.
Richie Foran's men deserve credit for not panicking and getting through the tie, as do Elgin City, who produced a strong performance and gave their opponents a scare early on.
Inverness CT's Richie Foran: "Character, credit to them. It's been a tricky season so far, a weaker team would have folded going one down. They would have panicked. We never did.
"We controlled most of the game, particularly the second half which was excellent. We hit the crossbar twice and scored a good goal which was disallowed, I don't know why.
"Cup football there's always upsets, there wasn't one here today so I'm delighted. It's great for confidence, hopefully we can kick on."
Elgin City's Jim Weir: "I absolutely thrilled with the effort. Getting the first goal was maybe key for us but we lost the goal too early after going in front.
"Second half, Caley controlled the game. If we'd got to half-time with that one goal lead obviously a bit of fear goes into their game as well.
"They were worthy winners and what a fantastic crowd, it just shows the potential of this club."
