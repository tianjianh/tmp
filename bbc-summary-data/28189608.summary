Australia asylum: Why is it controversial?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia's policy on asylum seekers has come under intense scrutiny. The BBC explains why.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Australia's humanitarian intake has remained relatively steady over the last 20 years, with around 12,000 to 13,000 people typically accepted every year.
In 2015-16, Australia accepted 13,750 people through its humanitarian programme and has committed to accepting an additional 12,000 refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq.
Asylum seekers have attempted to reach Australia on boats from Indonesia, often paying large sums of money to people smugglers. Hundreds have died making the dangerous journey.
At its peak, 18,000 people arrived in Australia illegally by sea. However the numbers plummeted after the government introduced tough new policies to "stop the boats".
Australia's two leading political parties, the ruling Liberal-National coalition and the Labor opposition, both support tough asylum policies.
They say the journey the asylum seekers make is dangerous and controlled by criminal gangs, and they have a duty to stop it.
The coalition government made Australia's asylum policy even tougher when it took power in 2013, introducing Operation Sovereign Borders, which put the military in control of asylum operations.
Under this policy military vessels patrol Australian waters and intercept migrant boats, towing them back to Indonesia or sending asylum seekers back in inflatable dinghies or lifeboats.
The government says its policies have restored the integrity of its borders, and helped prevent deaths at sea.
However, critics say opposition to asylum is often racially motivated and is damaging Australia's reputation.
When asylum seekers reach Australia by boat, they are not held in Australia while their claims are processed.
Instead, they are sent to an offshore processing centre. Currently Australia has one such centre on the Pacific island nation of Nauru and another on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.
Even if these asylum seekers are found to be refugees, they are not allowed to be settled in Australia. They may be settled in Nauru or Papua New Guinea, and four were settled in Cambodia at a reported cost of A$55m (Â£28m, $42m).
Rights group say conditions in the PNG and Nauru camps are totally inadequate, citing poor hygiene, cramped conditions, unrelenting heat and a lack of facilities.
Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court ruled in April that restricting the movement of asylum seekers who have committed no crime was unconstitutional.
The country's prime minister has since demanded that Australia shut down the centre.
But Australia is not prepared to accept the 850 men held in the centre and it is not clear where they will be taken
What next for Manus Island asylum seekers?
The likely closure of Manus Island means that asylum seekers could be relocated to Nauru, which says it has additional room.
Or they could be taken to the Australian territory of Christmas Island, where there is an existing detention centre.
However, Australia's hard line on immigration is unlikely to change.
