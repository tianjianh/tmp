Spitfires, Hurricanes, Chinook helicopters and Strikemasters were among the aircraft taking part at City Airport, Eccles.
The event was last held in 1994, when the site was called Barton Aerodrome.
Nick Duriez, of City Airport, said people had "fond memories" of the airshow and it was time for a return.
He said: "Last year we put on a few flying displays and it went really well, it was really popular - so many people were asking, 'bring back the airshow'.
"We then had a think about it and had a look to see if it was possible."
Despite early sunshine, the event concluded earlier than planned due to heavy rain showers.
