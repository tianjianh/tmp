Hundreds of trees have been planted in the Lake District to help restore woodlands and reduce flooding.

More than 90 National Trust staff and volunteers planted 1,400 native woodland trees including oak, birch, hazel, rowan and crab apple at five sites in the national park.
It is hoped the trees will reduce the risk of flooding like that caused by Storm Desmond in 2015.
The National Trust faced a Â£1m clean-up bill after the storm.
About 34cm (13in) of rain fell in just more than 24 hours at Honister Pass during the storm.
The National Trust said the trees will hopefully slow rainwater run-off and reduce the risk of landslides.
More than 500 trees were planted in the Coledale valley about two miles upstream of the village of Braithwaite, which was hit with boulders, silt and debris from landslides during Storm Desmond.
Villager Emily Brooks said: "It feels like important work now to better protect our homes from future flooding."
About 600 trees were planted at Close Head Coppice, Hoathwaite, Coniston, to help restore 10 acres of ancient woodland.
Smaller numbers of trees have also been planted at Scafell Pike, Fell Foot and Glencoyne Park.
Mike Innerdale, assistant director of operations for the National Trust, said the floods showed how "fragile a landscape" the Lake District is.
He said: "The 2015 floods caused millions of pounds worth of damage, leaving scars on the landscape that are yet to heal.
"With major storms occurring more frequently, we're working with farmers and local residents to look at ways of making the Lakes more resilient."
