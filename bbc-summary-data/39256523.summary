Her sister Val said: "Susan was well liked and well known locally, we're thankful for everyone's kind words and thoughts.
"Whoever is responsible, if you know something about what happened or who might have been involved, please tell police.
"We need the missing piece of the puzzle so we can lay Susan to rest and find some answers.
"If you know or saw anything, no matter how small - it could be vital. Please call police, or if you're the driver, hand yourself in."
Insp Mark Hughes said the force was grateful to Mrs Gravel's family for their support.
He added: "Our investigation continues in earnest and the recovery of the BMW is a positive step but we still need help from the public to identify those responsible for this crime."
