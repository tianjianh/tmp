Carlos the Jackal faces new France trial

Notorious convicted killer Carlos the Jackal, who carried out a string of attacks in the 1970s and 80s, is to go on trial again in France for the murder of two people in 1974.

A self-styled professional revolutionary from Venezuela, he is accused of throwing a grenade in Paris that also left 34 people wounded.
Carlos the Jackal's real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez.
After years on the run, he was caught in 1994 and jailed for life.
An investigating judge specialising in anti-terror cases had ordered the latest prosecution, French newspaper Le Figaro reported on Tuesday.
Ramirez, 64, had admitted carrying out the 15 September 1974 attack on the Drugstore Saint-Germain in an Algerian newspaper five years later, French media said.
He has already been given a life sentence for killing 11 people and wounding another 150 in four attacks dating back to the early 1980s:
Ramirez has also been linked to several other attacks outside France.
Francoise Rudetzki, head of France's national victims of crime federation, told France Info radio that the latest move was "a victory for justice, the victims and of being able to get a message to the terrorists".
Whatever the period of time, there would be no escape and they would have to answer for their actions, she said.
