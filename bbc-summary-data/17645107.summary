After a seven-year delay, planning permission to redevelop Buxton Crescent, built between 1780 and 1789, was granted in September 2010
The first phase of construction work should begin with repairs to the Pump Room.
Plans include a 79-bedroom hotel and natural mineral water spa.
A development agreement was signed between landowners High Peak Borough Council and Derbyshire County Council and the Buxton Crescent Hotel and Thermal Spa Company at the beginning of April.
The Pump Room will serve as an information centre for the duration of the project after which it will be converted into a cafe where visitors will be able to "take the waters" for the first time since the mid-1970s.
Caitlin Bisknell, leader of High Peak Borough Council, said: "Tourism is vitally important to the High Peak and this development will create jobs and attract countless new visitors while protecting Buxton's precious architectural heritage."
Funding for the project includes a £12.5m Heritage Lottery Fund grant.
