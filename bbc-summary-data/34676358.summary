Loading of straw shipments for Westray begins at Montrose

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emergency shipments of straw for farmers on the Orkney island of Westray have been delayed, but loading has begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Poor weather conditions have left many producers without enough fodder for their cattle.
Bad weather hampered the progress of a specially-chartered cargo vessel to Montrose.
However loading began on Friday morning, ahead of several trips needed to top-up supplies for the winter.
Westray relies on a high level of agricultural activity.
