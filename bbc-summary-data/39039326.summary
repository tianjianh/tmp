The pianos - together worth more than £50,000 - are a gift from Millers Music in Cambridge to mark the shop's 160th anniversary.
They are being offered to schools and colleges across the region that apply for one before 12 March.
King's College Chapel will host the instruments in its 50-minute 21 Piano Nocturne concert on Tuesday.
Richard Causton, King's College fellow in music at the University of Cambridge, described it as a "unique event".
"The sound and sight of 21 pianos in this wonderful space promises to be really memorable," he said.
Young pianists from the Peterborough and Saffron Walden Centres for Young Musicians will take part in the concert.
Simon Pollard, managing director of Millers Music, said: "We're thrilled to be collaborating with a prestigious university that celebrates music education.
"We are dedicated to encouraging more young people in the region to embrace music, and gifting these pianos to local institutions does just that."
