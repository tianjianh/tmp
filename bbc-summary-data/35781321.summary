Paul Scholes: Man Utd 'shambolic' against Liverpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United were "shambolic" and had no plan during their 2-0 Europa League defeat at Liverpool, says former United midfielder Paul Scholes.

Daniel Sturridge and Roberto Firmino scored, with only keeper David de Gea preventing a heavier first-leg loss.
Scholes, who made 718 appearances for United, told BT Sport that the Old Trafford club "have certain standards and they have fallen well short".
He added: "Liverpool had a way of playing. United didn't have a clue."
The second leg of the last-16 tie takes place at Old Trafford next Thursday (20:05 GMT).
Louis van Gaal's side are sixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four as they chase Champions League qualification for next season, and face fifth-placed West Ham in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday.
They dropped into the Europa League after finishing third in a Champions League group that also included Wolfsburg, PSV Eindhoven and CSKA Moscow.
"Manchester United should be competing to win the Premier League and Champions League every season," said Scholes.

"They have spent Â£300m and they are sixth in the league. They have ended up in the Europa League after failing in a poor Champions League group. They should be competing with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.
"I hope none of the players comes out saying sorry on Twitter. Stop talking on social media and start playing.
"The last thing I want for Manchester United is to be happy with finishing fourth and winning the FA Cup. That's what Arsenal do."
United had won their four previous games against Liverpool under Van Gaal but rarely looked like beating them on Thursday.
The Dutchman felt the goals his side conceded were "cheap" but accepted they could not handle Liverpool's pressing game.
"It was a surprise that we did not cope with it," he said.
"In the second half, we tried to press like Liverpool. They had difficulties, but we did not create too many chances."

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp praised the "electric" Anfield atmosphere after his side beat United for the first time in two years.
"The atmosphere was unbelievable, really great. I want to say thank you to everyone that was involved," said the German.
"That was Liverpool how I knew it before I came here.
"No matter how you play against Manchester United, it is always difficult to make chances. We could have scored more goals in the first half, but that's life.
"Scoring the second goal was very important. We know it is only the first leg but we needed to win it and we did. We are in a good position now."
