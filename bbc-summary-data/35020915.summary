Cameron to insist he is delivering on election pledges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives are delivering on manifesto pledges on childcare, home ownership and skills training, David Cameron will argue as he sets out the "progress" made since the election.

The prime minister will use a speech to re-assert his key domestic priorities after 10 days in which the political agenda has been dominated by Syria.
He will say he is "marking commitments off" not heading in a "new direction".
And he is set to announce an expansion of the shared home ownership scheme.
Mr Cameron will mark seven months since his party won a majority by insisting there will be no let-up in its drive to achieve the goals it set out in May, including the expansion of free childcare, rising home ownership and creating millions of new apprenticeships.
After two weeks in which attention has been focused on the government's U-turn over tax credit cuts and the decision to bomb so-called Islamic State fighters in Syria, the prime minister will insist he will not be blown off course by events and is determined to press ahead with changes to boost opportunity and increase security at "every stage" of people's lives.
Among new initiatives he will announce include:
The government says 230,000 people have been "helped into home ownership" since 2010 through schemes such as shared ownership, in which people can buy a share in a property, ranging from 25% to 75%, using a deposit and a mortgage.
Mr Cameron will say current restrictions stopping people from using shared ownership on multiple occasions will be lifted to allow people to move to bigger properties when they start a family or their circumstances change.
Combined with eligibility changes announced in last month's Autumn Statement - which will enable anyone in the UK to apply for shared ownership irrespective of where they live or what job they do as long as they earn less than £80,000 or £90,000 in London - Mr Cameron will claim this is proof that the government is committed to "building a nation of homeowners".
"So many people are attracted to the idea, especially those who thought they never had a chance of owning a home," he will say.
"But because it has been too heavily restricted, many people have missed out. We have had local councils dictating who is eligible, based on everything from salary to profession to where the buyer comes from.
"From April next year, that will make 175,000 more people eligible for home ownership. It means some people will be able to buy a house, for example, in Yorkshire, with a deposit of just £1,400."
Mr Cameron has pledged to double the number of first-time buyers, build 200,000 new starter homes and 275,000 new affordable homes by 2020, but critics say this is nowhere near ambitious enough to meet the demand for new housing.
Labour has accused the Tories of presiding over a fall in home ownership to the lowest level in a generation, a record low peacetime level of house building and a sharp drop in the number of affordable homes to buy.
Shadow housing minister John Healey said: "The spending review revealed that the government is set to halve funding for affordable homes compared to the plans inherited from Labour.
"At the same time they are driving a Housing Bill through parliament which will choke off low-cost homes, including for shared ownership."
As he marks his 10th year as Conservative leader, Mr Cameron - who has said he will stand down before the 2020 election - will say he will be "accountable" for the government's success or failure in achieving his party's manifesto commitments.
"A manifesto should not be a wish-list, it should be a checklist," he will say. "I want to go back to that opening page and show that this is a government that delivers."
The government's plan to introduce a payroll levy to fund three million new apprenticeship places remains unpopular with business while the House of Lords has called for plans to double free childcare for parents of three and four year-olds to be put on hold amid concerns about its funding.
Chancellor George Osborne announced £300m in new funding for nurseries last month but also said the extended childcare subsidy would be limited to parents working 16 hours a week and earning less than £100,000.
Mr Cameron's speech comes amid reports that the government could make a decision on airport expansion in the south-east of England this week, one of the most controversial issues in his in-tray.
The prime minister has said it will decide whether to go ahead with a new runway at Heathrow - as recommended by the Davies Commission - by the end of the year. Several senior Conservatives, including Boris Johnson, are opposed.
