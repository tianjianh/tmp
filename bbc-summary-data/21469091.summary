Sam Woodhead had failed to return to a cattle station in central Queensland on Tuesday afternoon.
Queensland Police said Mr Woodhead was a little sunburned when he was found but was hydrated and otherwise well.
Mr Woodhead, 18, reportedly from Richmond in south-west London, was reported missing by the owner of Upshot Station, where he was working.
The former Brighton College student is being returned to the cattle station for a medical assessment, before being transferred to a hospital in the nearby town, Longreach.
His sister Emma Lupton said the family had been "very distressed" during his disappearance.
"We heard this morning [that he had been found] from a family friend of ours who lives in Brisbane," she said.
"We didn't know a lot about his condition... but we know that he's been found and is safe and alive.
"You have to stay positive in these situations and you have to keep faith that he would be found."
Mr Woodhead had been in Australia for eight days when he disappeared.
Local authorities launched a search amid fears he may have become lost in the hot, isolated region. Temperatures have been around 37C (100F) in the area this week.
Rescuers searched by land and air. His mother is said to have urged police to widen their search as her son, who is a long-distance runner, could have travelled away from his base.
