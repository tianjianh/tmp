The teenager, believed to be named Jack Susianta, fled after smashing a window at his home in Clapton, east London, after officers were called there.
He was missing for about 40 minutes before being seen, running away again and entering the canal, the Met said.
A police officer followed the teenager into the water and tried to rescue him but was unable to. The death has been referred to the police watchdog.
Police said they were called to the boy's home on Wednesday afternoon because family members were concerned for his welfare and officers arrived at 15:12 BST.
At 15:38, Hackney Police tweeted: "Jack Susianta, 17yrs missing from E5. Last seen wearing a T-shirt, shorts and socks."
The boy was seen on Hackney Marshes at about 15:50 and when he ran away again he ended up in the canal at Lea Bridge Road in Hackney.
His body was recovered from the water at about 17:20 BST. The cause of death is not yet known and a post-mortem examination and formal identification are still to be carried out.
Dog units, a police helicopter, Marine Police and London Fire Brigade were all deployed in the search.
The Hackney Police account had also tweeted appeals over the disappearance of Jack in the early hours of Tuesday, followed about an hour later by a message saying he had been found.
The incidents leading to the teenager's death have been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
A spokesman said: "We deployed investigators to the scene and we are currently assessing it to determine the level, if any, of our involvement.
"We haven't yet determined whether it will be necessary for an independent investigation."
