Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a relationship, used their positions within Greater Manchester Police to access restricted material.
A court heard they targeted Hussell's ex-boyfriend, who lost his job after he was wrongfully arrested.
Fendall was jailed for 19 months and Hussell was sentenced to 16 months.
The pair provided false information to the charity Crimestoppers, naming Hussell's former boyfriend as being responsible for a fail-to-stop collision in which another PCSO was injured.
Brett Gerrity, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: "Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a personal relationship, abused their positions within the police to access restricted material on the police computer system for their own use and to settle a personal grievance.
"Fendall used the police computer system to research background information on people he and Hussell knew, and shared information and documents with others.
"They provided Crimestoppers with bogus information leading to an innocent man being investigated by the police for attempted murder."
He continued: "They also supplied the DVLA with fictitious intelligence, which led to the same man having his driving licence revoked.
"He had to prove he was medically fit to drive before his licence could be reinstated two months later."
Sergeant Lee Westhead, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "The actions of Fendall and Hussell undermine everything that is at the heart of policing in this country."
Hussell, 19, from Glossop, and Fendall, 26, from Denton, each pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office.
They also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in relation to providing false information to Crimestoppers.
Fendall had pleaded guilty to another count of misconduct in a public office and four counts of computer misuse relating to the GMP intelligence system.
The pair were arrested in August 2015 after an investigation by GMP's Serious Collision investigation Unit. They were suspended from GMP upon arrest.
