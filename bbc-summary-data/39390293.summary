Dagenham & Redbridge 4-0 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Corey Whitely's hat-trick helped Dagenham consolidate their National League play-off place with a handsome win over Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The forward lobbed Graham Stackto set Dagenham on course for victory, and two minutes later Whitely forced the Eastleigh goalkeeper to spill a shot into the path of Paul Benson who slotted home.
Whitely then beat Stack at his near post to make it three goals in five minutes, and completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot on the hour mark after Luke Guttridge was fouled by Gavin Hoyte.
Dagenham now hold a four-point cushion over the nearest threat to their top-five place with six games of their season remaining.
