Senate Republicans unveil healthcare bill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senate Republicans have unveiled a plan to overhaul the US healthcare system, including drastic cuts to a government health programme for the poor.

The 142-page "discussion draft" repeals most of President Barack Obama's signature health law.
The Senate plan drops a requirement for individuals to have health insurance and eliminates taxes on the wealthy.
Republicans, who released the bill after weeks of behind-closed-door talks, need 50 votes to pass it.
That means they can only afford to have two Republican rebels voting against it when it comes to the floor next week. No Democrats are expected to back it.
Repealing Mr Obama's law, called the Affordable Care Act but also known as Obamacare, was a central promise of Republicans throughout his presidency.
Senators wrote their own version after their colleagues in the House of Representatives passed Obamacare repeal legislation six weeks ago.
The legislation affects tens of millions of Americans and a fifth of the US economy.
Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, who crafted most of the plan, presented the Better Care Reconciliation Act Of 2017 to the upper chamber on Thursday.
"Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act - and we are," Mr McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor.
The bill mostly aligns with a measure passed by the House last month, but ties federal subsidies for individuals based on their income rather than age - as the Affordable Care Act currently does.
It would make it more difficult for recipients to qualify for those subsidies, however, by implementing more restrictions on income requirements.
Critics of the House bill, which tied the subsidies to age, say it unfairly penalised older Americans.
The Senate plan phases out the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the low-income Americans, more gradually than the House bill.
But it would impose deeper long-term cuts to the programme.
The bill also gives states more latitude in requiring insurers to provide essential health benefits guaranteed under Obamacare, including emergency and maternity care and mental health services.
Details of the draft also include:

The curtain has finally come up on the Senate healthcare bill, and the product of weeks of back-room negotiations looks a lot like the oft-derided House version.
Sure, there are a few key differences. In some places, it's more moderate - keeping in place income-adjusted subsidies to help less affluent Americans purchase insurance, for instance.
In other areas the cuts are actually much more aggressive.
It appears Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hopes to mollify moderates and hard-liners by pushing the painful changes to low-income insurance programmes farther down the road.
Whether that's enough to cobble together the bare-minimum 50 votes necessary from the 52 Republicans in the Senate will be the big question next week.
Moderates and at-risk senators up for re-election last year are the ones to watch - folks like Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
The others may groan, and try to wrangle a few last-minute deals to sweeten the pot, but they face the same reality as their House brethren.
They've spent the last seven years saying they'd tear Obamacare up "root and branch", in Mr McConnell's words, and they can't risk walking away empty handed.
Senator McConnell expects the bill to come to the Senate floor as early as next week, when the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office releases the plan's estimated cost and impact on Americans.
But many have expressed concern over both the House and Senate bills to overhaul the system.
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has already been critical of the plan.
"I think the death spiral of Obamacare continues," he said. "The Republican plan doesn't fix that; the Republican plan just subsidises it."
Asked whether he has seen the bill, Arizona Republican John McCain said on Tuesday: "No, nor have I met any American that has.
"I'm sure the Russians have been able to hack in and gotten most of it."
Democrats stand firmly against it and are expected to ask for more time to review the measure.
