The 07:30 BST journey from Douglas to Liverpool and the 11:15 return have been cancelled along with the 08:45 to Heysham and its 14:15 return crossing.
The Steam Packet Company said its evening and overnight crossings are also "subject to disruption."
All passengers are advised to contact the ferry operators.
A Met Office spokesman said winds could reach severe gale force nine, around 60 mph (97 km/h), this afternoon.
He added that there will be a gradual improvement overnight and into Wednesday.
