[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Charley Hull is in contention to win her first major after a third-round 69 left her within two shots of the lead at the ANA Inspiration.

The 20-year-old revived a frustrating round by posting birdies at the final four holes to move to eight-under in California.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew is also in the mix, two shots further back, after posting four birdies in a round of 70.
American Lexi Thompson leads after carding an eagle on the last for a 69.
The joint overnight leader finished strongly, too, also picking up four shots in the final four holes.
World number one Lydia Ko lurks ominously one shot behind Thompson on nine-under, alongside In Gee Chun (69) and Ariya Jutanugarn (67).
Hull's best major result was a tie for seventh at this event in 2014 and she performed strongly at the Mission Hills Country Club as a 16-year-old amateur in 2012.
"I'm buzzing for it. I love this golf course," she said. "I'm going to hit a couple of balls, work on my driver in a minute, and have an early night."
