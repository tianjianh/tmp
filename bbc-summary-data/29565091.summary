Simon Cowell: I took a chance putting Olly Murs through

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He's arguably one of the most famous people in the world.

If you haven't heard of Simon Cowell, chances are you have heard of one of his many artists.
But love him or hate him, how much do any of us really know about the boss of The X Factor?
Well, fret no more because he has opened up to Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw about "crazy" Miley Cyrus, his doubts about Olly Murs and who he thinks is the ultimate pop star.
As a kid Simon hated school and used to pretend to his parents that he was sick so he didn't have to go in.
The worst thing you could call a teenage Simon Cowell was a "show-off". However, he now hopes that is how he will be remembered.
At one point the 55-year-old worked at an estate agent, which he hated. We reckon he constantly looked like this.

The estate agent was based in swanky Mayfair in London - there's the Simon we know.
Simon's first job in the industry was working as a runner on a film set where he was paid £20 a week.
He's never looked back…
10 years since the X Factor began, Simon has said he is glad the show exists because it gives normal people the chance to become a star.
People like Olly Murs.
Simon has admitted that Olly almost did not make it to the live finals, but he decided to "take a chance on him".
"I don't think Olly would have got a contract outside the show, because the show defined his personality," Simon said. "I'm not interested in an object who just sings."
For Simon, others just had star quality …
"I used to call Cher Lloyd a brat, and she was, but I loved her," he explained.
"I didn't need to say, 'What kind of record do you want to make?' She knew exactly what record she wanted to make, even at 16. Those type of artists are rare."
And the world's number one performer?
Simon has admitted he does not know Beyonce well, but has called the singer "a killer in the nicest sense of the word".
"She wants to win. She always wants to be the biggest artist in the world and never, ever stops rehearsing or trying to get better," he said. "It's a dream to have an artist like that."
Simon also has a lot of time for Adele.
"I like Adele. She knows when to take time off and do things under her own way of doing things," he said. "She wants to take two years off, she takes two years off."
Speaking of some of the world's top female artists, Simon has revealed that Miley Cyrus went "too crazy too quickly".
"I think what Miley misunderstands is that coming from Hannah Montana, you are going to take a lot of that young audience with you," he explained.
"She can't suddenly appeal to 25-year-olds straight away. But I've met her and I liked her."
"That's the nature of the beast. People need to take their opportunity and run with it. I don't feel sorry for those who don't make it."
It's similar tough words for his ultimate rivals…
"Strictly Come Dancing are so competitive with us, it is beyond belief. I'm competitive with them, but I admit it. They say, 'We are the BBC, we don't care about ratings', but they do."
Simon has also claimed X Factor has more to it: "With that show you win a tin cup, on our show you've got a chance of winning a recording career. There's more at stake."
So, has there ever been a moment where Simon has literally pinched himself?
"Watching One Direction at Wembley Stadium, that moment will stay with me for the rest of my life," he said.
"Those boys grabbed their opportunity and just ran with it. They didn't want to be some horrible boy band, doing awful chorography, wearing stupid outfits and they really haven't changed since I have met them. I think they are my boss now."
But no matter what Simon has achieved in his career or will go on to achieve, he still has two dogs called Squiddly and Diddly...
Oh, Simon.
