Culture and Digital Economy Minister Ed Vaizey said free devices could be given to those at higher risk of "financial damage and personal distress".
It comes after a law change making it easier to impose fines on cold calling companies came into force in April.
It also follows tens of thousands of complaints about cold calling to the Information Commissioner's Office.
Complaints reached 18,594 for live calls and 22,072 for automated messages between April and June this year.
Companies face fines of up to Â£500,000 if they continue to contact people who have registered to not receive marketing calls with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS).
"While call blockers are available on the open market for consumers to purchase, the government is exploring options to provide free devices to people identified as being at higher risk of financial damage and personal distress as a result of nuisance calls," said Mr Vaizey.
"Individuals can register their telephone number with the TPS and there is no charge for doing so."
Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer body Which?, said he supported the government's plan to offer free call-blocking technology to those at risk.
"It's good news that the government wants to do more to protect vulnerable people from the everyday menace of nuisance calls," he said.
"It shouldn't only fall to consumers to block these calls though.
"Regulators need to come down hard on firms that break the rules and senior executives should be held to account if their company makes unlawful marketing calls."
In March, an investigation was launched after the details of 3,000 vulnerable people were sold to undercover Daily Mail reporters by medical firms.
It was alleged that similar information was sold to cold-calling firms.
