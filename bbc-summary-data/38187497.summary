Three men entered Granton Post Office on Granton Mains Avenue at about 09:00 and threatened staff with a bladed weapon before stealing a sum of money.
They fled the scene in a black Mini Cooper with the registration number SM15 UXB.
Detectives urged anyone with information to contact them.
One of the suspects was described as white, in his early 20s and wore a grey tracksuit, black puffa jacket with a tracksuit top underneath, black trainers with white soles and black gloves.
Det Sgt Robbie Wallace said: "Crimes of this nature are rare for Edinburgh and an extensive investigation is now underway to trace those responsible.
"No-one was injured in this incident however staff members within the shop were left badly shaken.
"At this time we're pursuing all lines of inquiry and I urge anyone with relevant information to come forward."
