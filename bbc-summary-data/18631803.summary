Detectives investigating the murder of a woman in Kent in 1987 have received a number of calls following a fresh appeal for information.

Wendy Knell's beaten body was found at her home in Tunbridge Wells on 23 June.
To mark the 25th anniversary, her parents appealed for information to catch the murderer, who is also thought to have killed another woman.
"We don't want to die not knowing who did it, we want to die knowing what happened to her," said her mother, Pam.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said a number of calls had been received in response to the appeal on Friday.
She said detectives were actively following up the information they had received.
Cold case detectives believe the same person is responsible for the murders of both Miss Knell, 25, and Caroline Pierce, 20, also from Tunbridge Wells, who was found dead on Romney Marsh after disappearing in November 1987.
She was last seen in Grosvenor Park. Her body was discovered 40 miles away by a farm worker in a field on St Mary in the Marsh on 15 December.
Both victims worked in Camden Road in Tunbridge Wells and had been sexually assaulted, battered and strangled.
Miss Knell's body was found in her bed in her flat in Guildford Road after she failed to turn up for work.
Mrs Knell and her husband, Bill, who are both in their 70s and live in Tonbridge, said they wanted to discover the truth about what happened before their daughter before it was too late.
"Give us some closure in our lives, so things can be a little bit better for us," said Mr Knell.
