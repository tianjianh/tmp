Jordy Hiwula almost put the Saddlers ahead but was thwarted by goalkeeper Joel Coleman, before Curtis Main shot wide from Tareiq Holmes-Dennis's cross.
Oldham striker Main then fired in the winner with 25 minutes to go, netting his third goal of the season from 12 yards into the bottom corner.
Hiwula had a chance to equalise for Walsall but his shot cleared the bar.
Walsall's second successive defeat means back-to-back losses for the first time in the league since February 2015.
They drop a place to sixth in the table, six points clear of seventh-placed Barnsley, although with two games in hand on a lot of the teams above them, having not played over Easter due to international calls.
John Sheridan's Oldham are now up to 18th, undefeated in four games and two points clear of the relegation zone.
Oldham manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"Obviously it's a relief to get out of the bottom four.
"It's my best result so far since I've come back. I don't think we've played well, but it just shows what character the players have got.
"It's about getting results at this moment in time.
"I thought we were really flat first half, too many players not on the game, so I had a little dig at half-time, and the most pleasing thing is, they responded."
Walsall interim head coach Jon Whitney told BBC WM 95.6:

"I wasn't as disappointed as last week. The performance was OK. It's the result I'm obviously disappointed with.
"In the first half, we did really well. We tried to play it the right way on the pitch.  In the second half, they pressed us.
"They got the one chance, that one chance went in and then they've got something to hold on to."
