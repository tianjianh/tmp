Charter NI: PSNI chief constable stands by paramilitary activity claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chief Constable George Hamilton has stood by a PSNI claim that people linked to Charter NI have been involved in recent paramilitary activity.

Mr Hamilton met with First Minister Arlene Foster at Stormont on Monday.
Charter NI, an east Belfast community organisation, received Â£1.7m from Stormont's Social Investment Fund.
Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin last week said some individuals in Charter NI had "connections" to the UDA.
He said he believed these individuals had taken part in paramilitary activity "in the past year".
Mr Hamilton said ACC Martin's comments were "an accurate assessment of the PSNI's position".
"At an operational and community level Charter NI do some very meaningful and positive work.
"However, it remains our view that an individual or individuals connected to that organisation continue to be associated with paramilitarism."
The meeting at Stormont was also attended by Health Minister Michelle O'Neill and Justice Minister Claire Sugden.
In a statement, the executive said that it had been assured by the PSNI there are "no concerns" over the work of Charter NI and that it would continue to work with the community organisation.
The executive statement added that "where there is any evidence of criminal activity police should investigate thoroughly and bring those responsible before the courts".
"We have also emphasised that any individuals associated with Charter NI or any community enterprise must make a clear choice between paramilitarism and legitimate community work."
The board of Charter NI said ACC Martin's comments had "come as a surprise" and they added "we do not condone illegal or criminal activity of any kind".
The community organisation has been under scrutiny since October, when its chief executive Dee Stitt gave a controversial interview to the Guardian newspaper.
Mr Stitt, a leading member of the UDA, referred to his loyalist band the North Down Defenders as "our homeland security" who were "here to defend North Down from anybody".
He also launched a foul-mouthed verbal attack on the government, saying politicians did not care about Northern Ireland.
Mr Stitt later apologised for his comments, but resisted calls for his resignation.
He took a three-week break from his role while Charter NI completed an "internal review process", but he resumed his job in November.
First Minister Arlene Foster was photographed with Mr Stitt when the Â£1.7m award was made, but later said he had become a "distraction" to the work being carried out by Charter NI.
