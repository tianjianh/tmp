A driver whose car got stuck in mud has been reunited with the hen party that helped him out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Journalist Richard Chambers was making his way to Letterkenny in County Donegal when his car became stuck in mud and gravel.
A mini-bus carrying a hen party then came along to help him. Mr Chambers said the group women were "heroic".
Catherine Callaghan was the bride-to-be who arrived with her crew - pink feather boas and all.
Mr Chambers' car skidded to the side of the road outside Ballybofey when he drove over a large amount of water.
He tried to reverse it but it got stuck. He called the AA but they said they would be an hour and a half.
"We were on our way home and we noticed the car off the road," said Catherine Callaghan.
"One of the girls was a nurse. We thought something was wrong so we got out. It turned out he was just stuck in the mud.
"It was my hen party. I get married on February 26. It will be a good story for the speeches.
"We didn't even think about the high heels or nothing. We just ploughed on to rescue him."
Richard Chambers told BBC Radio Foyle: "I really appreciated their help.
"I had a load of interviews lined up across Donegal and if it wasn't for them it would have been a whole day of news coverage lost.
"I will send a token of appreciation to them in Donegal."
