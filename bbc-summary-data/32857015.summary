The third place play-off match became a straight fight for the fourth Rio qualifying berth, behind Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
Earlier, Simon Middleton's side reached the knockout stages and beat New Zealand 17-14 in the quarter-finals.
The sport will feature at a summer games for the first time.
During the group stages, England comfortably beat China and Russia, but lost the final pool match 24-7 to Australia.
Finishing in the top four places in the series standings was the easiest route to Rio.
Had they not achieved qualification at what was the final event of the series, England, Scotland or Wales would have had to try and achieve Great Britain's Olympic place by winning a regional qualifying event between June and September.
