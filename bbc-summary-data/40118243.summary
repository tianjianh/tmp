Mrs Roussos was understood to be in a critical condition initially and on a life support machine.
In a post on Facebook group Leyland Memories, Mr Swanny said Mrs Roussos was now awake and out of surgery and added she was "fully aware of the situation".
Mr Swanny praised Saffie's mother and father Andrew Roussos for their "strength" and "bravery".
"They are all now together... Ashlee the eldest daughter is also out of danger and is talking to her mother," he wrote.
"Now they can start to deal and rebuild their lives."
Mr Swanny added: "I hope this news will make everyone smile as this is the best news we've had through this tragedy."
Saffie was described as "simply a beautiful little girl" by her head teacher at Tarleton Primary School.
Chris Upton said she was "loved by everyone".
