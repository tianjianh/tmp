Tynemouth Pool, filled daily with seawater with the passing of the tides, was once a popular visitor attraction but has lain derelict since the 1990s.
The art exhibition has opened at the Old Low Lights Heritage Centre in North Shields to raise money for the pool.
The specially commissioned artworks will be auctioned on 26 November.
See more on this story and other news from the North East here.
Works at the exhibition include the first print of a previously unseen work by internationally renowned photographer and founder member of the Amber Film and Photography Collective, Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen,
The Friends of Tynemouth Outdoor Pool, which was formed in 2012, has submitted detailed refurbishment proposals to North Tyneside Council.
Exhibition organisers said: "While the artwork on display will cover a variety of mediums and artistic approaches, all exhibiting artists share a common aim of helping return the outdoor pool site to its former glory."
Also at the exhibition will be an "incredible illuminated model" of the restoration, which has been created in Lego by architectural photographer Steve Mayes.
Afterwards it will go on display at various locations around North Tyneside.
