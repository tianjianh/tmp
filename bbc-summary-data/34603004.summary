The new Â£5m facility in Coatbridge is expected to open in December and be fully operational by March next year.
It will be capable of washing, drying and ironing more than four tonnes of laundry every hour for hotels and restaurants in the Glasgow area.
Fishers said the laundry would allow it to optimise production across its other sites.
The business currently operates from seven bases in Scotland and the north of England.
Fishers said "a full review" of those sites would be undertaken in the coming months.
Managing director Michael Jones said: "This will be the largest single laundry investment ever to be made in Scotland and is testament to Fishers' confidence in the strength of the country's growing hospitality industry and our continuing commitment to the sector."
Cupar-headquartered Fishers was established in 1900 and now washes, irons and delivers more than two million items a week.
The company also offers linen rental, work wear hire and clean-room garment services to the hospitality, healthcare, manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors.
