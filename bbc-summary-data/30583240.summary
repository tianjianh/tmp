The council vehicle then crashed into the Millennium Hotel, near Queen Street station in George Square, at 14:30 GMT.
One eyewitness told Newsbeat the scene "was like something out of a movie".
Steven McNeil, who among thousands in the city doing Christmas shopping, said: "I witnessed something that was horrific."
After coming out of one of the shops he heard screams.
He said: "If you imagine people on top of a roller coaster about to go over the edge.
"We actually thought there was something happening in George Square because just now there's an ice rink, there's the Ferris wheel."
Police Scotland declared a major incident but said there appeared to be nothing "sinister" about the crash.
The force has launched a dedicated number - 01786 289070 - for anyone who has concerns about relatives or friends.
It has also urged people who we're shopping today in the city centre to let relatives know they are safe and well.
McNeil continued: "As we turned around to the left we've seen this massive green city council lorry coming towards bystanders.
"We didn't see it hitting them face on but we've seen the aftermath of it.
"What we witnessed today was like something out of a movie.
"If you can think of it like a game of bowling. You throw the bowling ball down and it hits all the pins and the pins scatter, that's what it was like.
"My heart goes out to their families, I hope I never see anything like this again in my life."
George Square, which is a hotspot for tourists, was the site for a dance event on the first night of Radio 1's Big Weekend in June.
Steven said the city centre was "chaos" because of all the Christmas shoppers and that the car park he intended to use was full.
He said that if there were spaces, he would have parked there and would have been walking up the same side of the road that the bin lorry crashed into.
"It was just so sick, especially this time of year.
"It's really, really sad and I hope the families are pulling through."
