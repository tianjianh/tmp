Sir Bruce still 'struggles to move' after op, wife says

Sir Bruce Forsyth still has "a bit of a problem moving" his wife says, following major surgery a year ago.

Sir Bruce, 88, underwent keyhole surgery after doctors discovered he had two aneurysms following a fall at his Surrey home last year.
Lady Forsyth, 59, said the star was in "incredible shape mentally" but that the "operation took his energy".
"He's the man I fell in love with because his brain is there," she told the Daily Mail's You magazine.
She said: "The operation took his energy because of his age, there's no question about it.
"Some days are better than others. On the not-so-good days, he tries to rest."
An aneurysm is a potentially serious blood vessel swelling. If left untreated, larger abdominal aortic aneurysms - the type which Sir Bruce has had - can be fatal.
Lady Forsyth said she hoped Sir Bruce would be able to perform again, but added: "He doesn't want to do anything publicly until he's 100% well. I respect that."
She said she found it hard to contemplate a future without her husband, who she has been married to for 33 years.
"I don't think about it too much. I hope I'll be prepared somehow, but it doesn't feel real.
"He has a bit of a problem moving, but we still laugh and talk. I pray, I believe. The main thing is that he's doing well. The pain is more emotional; sometimes we cry, but mostly we laugh."
Lady Forsyth said Sir Bruce was still enjoying puzzles and the internet and programmes including the Olympics, The Apprentice and Question Time, as well as spending time with his grandchildren.
Sir Bruce has not been seen in public recently, having been too frail to attend the funerals of close friends Ronnie Corbett or Sir Terry Wogan.
He left Strictly in 2014 after nearly 10 years fronting the BBC One show with Tess Daly.
