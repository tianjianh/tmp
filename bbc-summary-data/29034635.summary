[SN]TITLE[SN]
Delroy Facey in court over match fixing allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Premier League footballer has appeared in court charged with involvement in a match-fixing conspiracy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Delroy Facey, 34, of Huddersfield, is accused of conspiring with four other men to commit fraud by way of bribery in November last year.
Mr Facey did not enter a plea during the two-minute hearing at Cannock Magistrates' Court.
He was bailed to appear at Birmingham Crown Court on September 19.
The ex-Bolton Wanderers, Hull City and West Bromwich Albion striker will appear alongside his co-accused, former non-league player Moses Swaibu, 25.
It is alleged Mr Facey plotted with Swaibu, of Bermondsey, to induce or reward others to "improperly perform their function" as professional footballers.
Mr Facey, who also played for Notts County, Tranmere Rovers and Lincoln City, was arrested in November as part of a National Crime Agency investigation into match fixing.
