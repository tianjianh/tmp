Darrell Richards, 47, used a metal bar to batter Thomas Downey, 51, who was known locally as "Manchester Tommy" because of where he came from.
His body was found on Christmas Eve under a railway arch in Lower Bristol Road, where it had lain undiscovered for a week, Bristol Crown Court heard.
Richards, who was also homeless, was sentenced to 10 years and nine months after admitting manslaughter.
Speaking after sentencing, Det Ch Insp Julie Mackay said: "Thomas Downey died as the result of a callous and brutal assault.
"He'd been bludgeoned to death, the blows causing multiple fractures to his skull."
She said: "The attack by Darrell Richards, a fellow member of the homeless community, was vicious and appears to have resulted from what was effectively a very minor disagreement."
The detective said police accepted the manslaughter plea because they believe "it reflects what took place in that archway on that evening".
Det Ch Insp Mackay added: "We hope today's sentencing will bring some closure for Tommy's family."
