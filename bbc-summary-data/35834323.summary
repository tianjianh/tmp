Wakefield Trinity Wildcats coach Chris Chester has said he did not think he would get back into the game so soon.

The 37-year-old took over at Belle Vue on Wednesday, just three weeks after being sacked by Hull KR.
"It was surprising. I was disappointed by how things ended at Hull KR, although I understood the reasons for it," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I'd got bored of being at home so when the opportunity came up here I jumped at the chance."
He added: "It's a very proud day for me, especially being a lad from Wakefield who supported the team as a boy. I'm very honoured to be here."
Chester has replaced Brian Smith after the Australian resigned last week.
The Wildcats, who finished bottom of Super League last season, are currently 11th with one win from their opening six games.
Despite their poor start Chester is hopeful they can still finish in the top eight before the league splits after 23 rounds.
"Everyone thinks Wakefield are a bottom-four team and it is my job to make sure that we are not that," he said.
"We have aspirations to finish in the top eight and everyone is beating everyone else this year. We need a little bit of confidence and to get people playing with smiles on their faces."
