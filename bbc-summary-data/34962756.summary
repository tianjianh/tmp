[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Accountant Patrick Hurling, 45, was found beaten and strangled at his house in Bengeo Street, Hertford on 1 December 1990.
His daughter Lorna Ringer, 44, said a "black cloud" hung over the family as they searched for answers.
Three people were arrested in connection with the case at the time but no-one has ever been charged.
Mr Hurling's family said it was fully supporting the new police investigation and remained "desperate for answers".
"It won't take our pain away but it will help us grieve dad for who he was and not have that black cloud over him and us," she said.
Det Sgt Dave Taylor, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: "I am convinced someone, somewhere will have some information they may not have shared with police previously which could be vital to solving the case."
Mr Hurling was found dead in the early hours of 1 December 1990.
The night before he had been drinking at The Angel Public House in Waltham Abbey, across the road from his office.
He left the pub and drove home in his BMW 7 Series car arriving there at about 23:00 GMT.
The case was reopened following advances in forensic technology. Police said officers wanted to re-interview a number of witnesses identified in earlier inquiries.
600
statements were taken
1,700 people interviewed
1,800 lines of inquiry pursued
Crimestoppers is offering a reward of up to Â£5,000 for any new information on the murder.
