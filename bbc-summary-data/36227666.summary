Ex-Sunderland player Cabral acquitted of rapes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Premier League footballer has been found not guilty of raping a woman he met in a Newcastle nightclub.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Sunderland player Cabral, 27, whose real name is Adilson Tavares Varela, was accused of carrying out the attack in January last year.
Giving evidence at Hull Crown Court, he said the woman was lying and that sex at his flat in Gateshead was consensual.
The midfielder who had denied two charges of rape, was cleared by a jury.
The court heard that sex took place after Cabral went back to his flat in with friends, including retired France international Anthony Reveillere.
The woman, who cannot be named, had claimed Cabral -  who was born in Cape Verde and now plays for FC Zurich - pinned her down on his bed and attacked her.
