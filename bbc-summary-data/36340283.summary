[SN]TITLE[SN]
Alleged misconduct by Sandwell Councillor Mahboob Hussain pursued

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Misconduct alleged against a former deputy council leader will be pursued, the authority says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sandwell Councillor Mahboob Hussain is accused of six alleged council code of conduct breaches, according to solicitors Gowling WLG.
The law firm was brought in 15 months ago to investigate alleged irregularities in the sale of the authority's former properties.
Mr Hussain, now suspended by Labour, denies any wrongdoing.
Gowling investigated alleged irregularities in sales from 2011-2013, including three old public toilet blocks and a former coroner's office in Smethwick.
A parallel police investigation ended in March with no further action.
Publication of Gowling's report had been delayed after legal action by "one of the parties named", the council said, but was published on Friday "in the public interest".
Documents leaked to the BBC earlier had shed light on its findings.
The authority's chief executive Jan Britton said the "next step" was to refer allegations to its internal disciplinary watchdog-  the standards committee - to consider.
Mr Britton said a review would take place to "tighten up council procedures on land sales" and it would "consider if any disciplinary action against employees was required."
The allegations set out in the report include:
Former economy chief councillor Mr Jones and Mr Hussain stood down from the ruling cabinet after investigations began, but both had their suspensions from the Labour party lifted before elections on 5 May.
Mr Hussain has now been suspended afresh, the party confirmed.
Tipton Green ward councillor Mr Jones, whom the report said faced no misconduct issue, said he was "pleased" to see the report published and with those conclusions.
He added: "Throughout this matter I have always protested my innocence of any wrongdoing and I have always fully co-operated with all investigations."
Oldbury ward councillor Mr Hussain gave evidence to the report that he did not know who was buying the toilet blocks because the purchase was through a company name, not the name of his friend.
He said he had not been consulted and had not been aware of the price.
Mr Hafeez, who was arrested last year, provided no evidence despite requests, the report said. He has not yet responded to further questions from the BBC.
Police told him in November 2015 he would face no action.
He said in November his arrest "did not relate to the sale or purchase of any former Sandwell Council properties" and he was "considering taking legal action against a number of individuals and organisations".
Analysis
Behind this saga is no little irony.
The council introduced its so-called asset management strategy, under which it planned to streamline its operations into fewer buildings, to reduce its overheads and bring in some money by selling off property it no longer needed, it said to mitigate government cuts.
In the months since these investigations began, the council has spent thousands of pounds on solicitors to investigate these serious allegations â€Žand commissioning James Goudie QC to advise the council on whether it could publish the solicitors' work, putting a big dent in any money it might have made on these sales.
