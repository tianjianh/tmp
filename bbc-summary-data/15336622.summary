A Shropshire charity has designated October 'Black Cat Awareness Month' in a bid to rehome unwanted felines.

Staff at RSPCA Gonsal Farm animal centre, in Dorrington, said they wondered if superstition caused people to be "spooked out" by black cats.
The animal centre is currently "inundated" with black cats and kittens, having 37 out of 62 cats.
In an attempt to entice the public they are highlighting the black cats in their care in need of homes.
A spokeswoman for the charity said the idea was also in keeping with the celebrations and superstitions of Halloween.
She said staff were determined to quash some of the negative myths surrounding black cats and promote them as potential pets.
Two of the cats in need of a home are Potter and Sally who have been in RSPCA care since November 2010.
Kirsty Martuccio, cattery supervisor at Gonsal Farm, said: "Potter and Sally are just two of the many black cats we currently have looking for a second chance in life.
"We find it really sad that people often choose to rehome a cat simply on its colour as the colour of a cat makes no difference to their personality and the love they have to offer."
She urged people living locally to visit the cattery and see some of the cats in their care.
