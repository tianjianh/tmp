People of African origin are at "significantly" higher risk of developing glaucoma, an avoidable condition that can cause sight loss, said the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) Scotland.
The event is being held during Black History month.
Free NHS eye tests are available to UK residents in Scotland.
The event, was arranged by Glasgow Caledonian University, in association with RNIB Scotland, to urge black Africans in Greater Glasgow and Clyde to attend eye examinations.
RNIB Scotland said people of African origin were more likely to suffer from glaucoma, which can lead to sight loss if not detected and treated early on, than those of white origin.
As well as discussing sight loss in people of black origin, the event is celebrating the work of leading US ophthalmologist Patricia Era Bath, one of the first African-Americans to gain prominence in her field.
RNIB Scotland equality officer Gozie Joe Adigwe, a Scot of African origin, said the charity was working with organisations that encounter people from Black African groups to support them with their eye health.
She said: "People [of black origin] are often unaware of the risks their ethnicity holds in sight loss."
In April, the "You Care, Eye Care" project, RNIB Scotland's project supporting Black Africans with visual impairment in Glasgow, secured funding until 2019.
Black History month is a celebration of African and Caribbean heritage observed annually in the UK since the late 1980s.
Free NHS eye tests have been available to UK residents in Scotland since 2006.
