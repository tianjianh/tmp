Road closure warning after floods

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Several roads are still closed across central Scotland because of flooding, Stirling Council has warned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A81 is closed at Gartmore, near Aberfoyle, after the River Forth broke its banks.
And the Crow Road over the Campsie Fells, from Fintry to Lennoxtown, has been closed by a landslip caused by the heavy rain.
The Met Office has issued more rain warnings for Monday into Tuesday in Tayside and other areas of Scotland.
Further road closures in Stirling include the B829 at Aberfoyle Primary School, cutting off the community of Kinlochard, but Stirling Council said the school remained open.
The B823 Cornton Road is closed at the level crossing, with access available from Causeway head only. And the B822 between Thornhill and Kipped station is also closed by flooding.
Communities badly hit by flooding over the weekend include Bridge of Allan and Aberfoyle.
There are renewed rain warnings in place for parts of Scotland already affected by flooding due to Storm Desmond.
The latest yellow "be aware" rain warnings are not expected to be as heavy or as prolonged as recent downpours.
However, due to the saturated nature of the ground and high river levels, the Met Office said further localised flooding and disruption to transport was possible.
The first warning runs from 17:00 on Monday to 05:00 on Tuesday with the second valid from 06:00 on Wednesday to 18:00 on Thursday.
The alerts cover Tayside, Fife, Strathclyde, the Borders and south west Scotland.
