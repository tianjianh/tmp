Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan believes the national side must take three points in their World Cup qualifier against Slovenia on 26 March.

Scotland are on four points after four matches and sit second bottom of qualifying Group F, four points adrift of second-placed Slovenia.
Regan reckons the Scots can qualify for next year's finals in Russia, but only if they beat Slovenia at Hampden.
"That's really a must-win game for Scotland," Regan told BBC Scotland.
National coach Gordon Strachan has been boosted by the news that Celtic captain Scott Brown will be available against Slovenia.

And Regan added: "We know how important it is to get our campaign back on track. Gordon knows it. The team knows it.
"We came out of the England game [November's 3-0 loss] very disappointed. Gordon was keen to have a friendly match to prepare for the next qualifier and we've set that up with a match at Easter Road on 22 March against Canada.
"Whilst ever there is an opportunity to qualify for the World Cup, that remains our focus.
"We still have a number of matches at home this year - we've got four home games - and we'll be trying to get as many points as we can possibly get, starting with Slovenia here at Hampden."
Scotland kicked off their qualifying campaign with a 5-1 win in Malta and a 1-1 home draw with Lithuania, before back-to-back 3-0 defeats away to Slovakia and England.
