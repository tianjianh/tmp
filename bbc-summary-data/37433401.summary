Euro 2020: England fans may struggle to afford travel - FA's Greg Clarke

England fans may struggle to afford travel costs during Euro 2020, new Football Association chairman Greg Clarke has said.

The competition will be split across 13 European venues, with the semi-finals and final held at Wembley.
Clarke, who took over from Greg Dyke in August, was not sure how European governing body Uefa could help fans.
"It's like trying to book a low-cost airline in the summer when the school holidays are on," he told BBC Sport.
"The free market will set the prices between those cities. Demands and prices are high and I'm not sure what Uefa can do about it."
Speaking at the logo launch of Euro 2020 in London, Clarke said the FA would look at future tournament bids on a "case by case basis".
In 2010, England lost out to Russia in bidding for the 2018 World Cup.
"Last time we spent Â£18m and had no chance of winning - if we decide we have a chance the board will look at it and we will have a go," he said.
"I think it would be a big ask to get Euro 2024 when we've had the final here [in 2020] but we're reaching out to our friends in Uefa and building relationships and building an ability to bid."
New Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin confirmed the 2020 format is a one-off to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.
Clarke also confirmed England had scrapped their target of winning the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, stating the board "doesn't set targets like that".
That goal was set by Clarke's predecessor Greg Dyke in 2013.
"We look at every tournament where an England senior or junior team play and what we want to do is well in every tournament," he said.
"I don't want to wait until 2022 - there's a lot we can do before then."

Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo has only just taken his hands off the trophy but Uefa is already looking toward Euro 2020.
The idea to play the tournament across 13 host cities was Michel Platini's brainchild. He may have left the scene but his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, must now make the idea work.

The theme over the next few years will be about how the Euros can bring Europe closer together, but fans may well be wondering how they'll afford to follow their team.
Group games will be regionalised to minimise travel - but this could be an expensive experience for many.
It's a one-off but the challenge for Uefa now is to convince fans Euro 2020 is a good idea and one which won't leave many of them excluded.
