Accrington Stanley's Josh Windass and Matt Crooks have both signed pre-contract agreements with Scottish Championship leaders Rangers.

The midfielders will move to Ibrox on four-year contracts at the end of the season, when their current deals end.
Stanley, who are seventh in League Two in England, will be due compensation for the duo, who are both 21.
Windass has been with Accrington since 2013 while Crooks, who can also play in defence and attack, joined last year.
Son of former Aberdeen and Hull City striker Dean, Windass joined Accrington from Northern Premier League outfit Harrogate Railway Athletic.
He was recently reported to be a target for Arsenal and has rejected the offer of a new contract from his present club.
Like Windass, who has netted 11 goals this season, Crooks came through the youth ranks at Huddersfield Town and made the switch to Accrington permanent in February after a loan spell.
Crooks had previous loan spells with Halifax Town, Radcliffe Borough and Hartlepool United.
Accrington majority shareholder Andy Holt confirmed on Monday that Rangers were in talks with Crooks and Windass.
Meanwhile, Arsenal midfielder Gedion Zelalem has extended his loan spell with Rangers until the end of the season.
