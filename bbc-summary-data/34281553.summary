Premature baby moves home after 105 days in hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A baby born 12 weeks early has finally gone home to his parents and five sisters in Swansea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reuben Lawrence weighed just 3lbs (1.3kg) and spent 105 days in special care at Singleton Hospital after his mother Claire went into labour at seven months.
She had to have an emergency Caesarean section, followed by a hysterectomy. She also received 29 pints of blood.
But Reuben now weighs 9lb 3oz (4kg) and his family has thanked hospital staff.
Mrs Lawrence and her husband, Andrew, have written to Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board to thank staff.
Mrs Lawrence said: "The care I had was exemplary.
"[They] kept my family updated and explained carefully what needed to be done in to order to save my life.
"We just want all them all to have a pat on the back, they deserve it."
He is still being tube-fed and receiving oxygen to help his breathing.
