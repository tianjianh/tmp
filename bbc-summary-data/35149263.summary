[SN]TITLE[SN]
China's grim history of industrial accidents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
China has a long history of industrial accidents, from factory explosions and mine collapses to mudslides. Here are just a few of those to have hit the country.

The gypsum mine in Linyi city collapsed on 25 December, trapping 17 miners. The chairman of the company that owned the mine killed himself two days later.
Many of the miners are believed to have died. Four were found alive. Four more were detected with infrared cameras and were rescued 36 days later.
Ninety-one people were missing after a landslide hit 33 buildings in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Sunday.
Authorities said a huge man-made mound of earth and construction debris, piled up against a nearby hill over years, lost stability and collapsed, blanketing a vast area of 380,000 sq m (455,000 sq yards).
Two massive explosions in the port of Tianjin, northern China, killed 173 people, left hundreds more injured and devastated large areas of the city.
The blasts took place at a warehouse housing large quantities of hazardous and flammable chemicals, which officials concluded had been improperly stored. Housing was also built closer to those facilities warehouses than the law should have allowed.
A metal dust explosion at a car parts factory in eastern China killed at least 75 people and injured more than 180, leaving many of them with severe burns.
Dust explosions occur when metallic particles contained in an enclosed space are ignited by a spark. It was a possibility the company had already been warned about, according to Chinese media reports.
Sixty-two people were reported killed when an oil pipeline leaked and then caught fire and exploded.
The accident happened near a residential area, adding to the number of injured - at least 136 people.
A fire at a poultry processing plant in China killed at least 119 people after explosions caused fires and a fatal crush, as workers tried to escape through the few exits that were not locked.
The blasts were blamed on an ammonia leak, which also forced the evacuation of local residents.
An industrial landslide engulfed a small mining community in central China, killing at least 254 people. It happened when a dam holding back sludge at an unlicensed iron ore mine burst after torrential rain.
China has an abysmal record on mine safety. That 2008 disaster was followed by a mine blast in February 2009 in the same province, in which 73 people died. And in August 2007, mine shafts at Xintai mine in Shandong Province flooded after a nearby river burst its banks, killing at least 172 miners.
The situation has at least improved somewhat from the grim records it set in decades past: 684 people died in a methane explosion in Laobaidong colliery in 1960, and 1,549 people died in a massive blast in Benxihu coal mine in eastern Liaoning province in 1942.
Thirty-two people died when a huge ladle transporting molten steel around the Qinghe Special Steel factory crashed to the ground.
Poor quality equipment and similarly substandard safety practices were blamed by the subsequent investigation.
Eighty-seven people died and many others suffered horrific injuries when a fire broke out in a toy factory not far from Hong Kong. The disaster was made much worse by the fact that many exits were locked - a practice that has often exacerbated China's worst industrial disasters.
Until the Dehui poultry factory fire in June 2013, it was the worst factory blaze in China in living memory, and led to a public outcry.
Said to be the world's worst-ever industrial disaster. Estimates vary but it has been said that around 100,000 died when the dam, overwhelmed by typhoon rains, burst.
Around the same number again are estimated to have been killed by subsequent famines and disease.
