The Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) tanks - or CVR(T)s - are being delivered to Castlemartin this week ahead of a training exercise.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) tweeted to say: "Take care on local roads - tank transporters are big!"
CVR(T)s are used to carry small specialised armed forces teams.
The delivery is ahead of training planned for the Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeth's Own) next week.
The MoD's Castlemartin range covers 2,400 hectares (6,000 acres) and is located within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.
In total, there are 20 CVRTs and they can be seen "firing" from the public viewing area at Warren Tower on Monday.
