Gareth O'Brien and Junior Sa'u sent Salford ahead before Batley's Wayne Reittie ran in his 100th career try.
Weller Hauraki, Greg Johnson and Josh Griffin all scored for Salford before Reittie went over again for the hosts.
The Red Devils scored twice more before full-time through Robert Lui and O'Brien while Chris Ulugia also ran in.
The victory means Salford finish in fifth place in the Qualifiers and face a trip to fourth-placed Rovers in the Million Pound Game on Saturday, 1 October.
The winner of that game will retain their Super League status and seal their place in English rugby league's top flight for 2017, while the loser will drop to the Championship.
Salford head coach Ian Watson: "The way we played it, I thought was perfect. It was just a really good professional performance.
"It took us 10 or 15 minutes to get going but, once we did, I thought we were really good."
Batley head coach John Kear: "I'm really chuffed. One of the things we wanted to do at half-time was win the second half and we did that.
"I'm just really pleased with what my players have done all season. With Featherstone losing, that means we're the best part-time team in the country over a full season and I take great pride in that."
