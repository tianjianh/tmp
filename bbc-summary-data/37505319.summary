Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe says he will not be distracted by talk linking him with the England manager's role.

As he was in the summer, the 38-year-old has again been linked with the vacant national job following the departure of Sam Allardyce on Tuesday.
Howe guided Bournemouth to Premier League safety last season after winning the Championship title in 2015.
"My mindset and my full attention is here with AFC Bournemouth," Howe told BBC Radio Solent.
"The last thing you need is to be distracted. I certainly won't be, but I know other people will talk about it."
Howe was recently asked in an interview with the BBC's The Premier League Show if the role as national coach would ever appeal to him in the future.
"The England job, I think, is the ultimate," he told presenter Gary Lineker during filming before Allardyce's departure. "I would never say no, but it's not something I want to consider."

Howe has now moved to reassure Bournemouth supporters his view has not changed despite subsequent events.
"I have pledged my allegiance to AFC Bournemouth time and time again," he said.
"When these situations and these stories occur, it's more the press than absolutely anything else. I'm absolutely committed to AFC Bournemouth."
