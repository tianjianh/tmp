Ambulance crews and police were called to Kendor Gardens at 08:07 GMT and found the man with stab wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The Metropolitan Police say that a man is in custody on suspicion of murder.
Police believe the victim was attacked when people would have been making their way to the station and have appealed for witnesses to contact them.
His next of kin have yet to be informed.
Det Ch Insp Dave Reid said he was "appealing for anyone who may have seen the stabbing or the events leading up to the incident to get in contact with us".
A post-mortem examination and formal identification will take place "in due course", the Met said.
