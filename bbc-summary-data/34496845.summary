Thailand's Aphibarnrat, twice a winner this year, moved a shot ahead after a 40-foot breaking birdie putt at 14.
But Fitzpatrick, 21, who has led since day one as he seeks a first European title, picked up his fourth birdie at 15 to join the Thai at 12 under.
England's Luke Donald, now 66th in the world rankings, carded six birdies in nine holes in a 65 and is four adrift.
Another former world number one, Lee Westwood, is two shots further back after a 67, with 16 players within five strokes of the lead.
Donald, 37, who has not won since November 2013, said: "I've put myself in a good position. I'd love to shoot another round like this and if I did I think that might be good enough."
Welshman Bradley Dredge, seeking his first European Tour title since 2006, withdrew shortly before the start of the round because of a viral infection.
The 42-year-old, who lost his tour card in 2012 but regained it after finishing 81st on the Race to Dubai last year, had been only two shots off the lead.
