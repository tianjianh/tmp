The world number eight, 26, won 6-3 7-5 after converting her fourth match point against the 21-year-old.
Konta lost her serve midway through the second set before fighting back to claim four of the final five games.
"It was difficult, she started very strongly. I had to raise my game and only had one little dip," she said.
Konta, whose three career titles have all come on hard courts, is two more wins away from earning her first WTA title on home soil at her opening grass-court tournament of the season.
She will face Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova, who is ranked outside the world's top 100, in Saturday's semi-final.
"I am enjoying playing each match, I am getting much surer of my footing on the grass," said Konta.
"I am enjoying working hard and executing my game plan with each match that I play.
"That is something that happens with every player. It takes time to get used to a surface."

Meanwhile, British number three Naomi Broady has reached the semi-finals of the Aegon Trophy in Manchester after beating top seed Chang Kai-Chen.
The 27-year-old from Stockport, who is ranked 115th in the world, won 6-3 6-4 against the Taiwanese world number 109.
British men's number four Aljaz Bedene's run at the Ricoh Open ended with a quarter-final defeat by Luxembourg's fourth seed Gilles Muller.
Bedene, 27, was a break up in the deciding set but lost five of the final six games in a 6-3 3-6 6-4 defeat.
Reaching the last eight is still an encouraging start to the grass court season for the Slovenia-born player before Wimbledon next month.
