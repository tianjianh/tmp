Jared Payne will have further tests on the migraines that ended his British and Irish Lions' tour of New Zealand.

The Irish back was withdrawn from last week's match against Hurricanes after complaining of headaches.
He has stayed in Wellington for further tests while the Lions squad has moved to Queenstown before Saturday's third and final Test against the All Blacks.
Fellow Lion Robbie Henshaw faces a 16-week lay-off with a shoulder injury and could miss Ireland's autumn series.
Lions medical chief Dr Eanna Falvey said there is no clear return date for Payne, despite the 31-year-old progressing through a raft of tests.
"He's actually suffering from migraine," Dr Falvey said.
"He had a bang in the Chiefs game (on 20 June), but he was fully cleared from concussion.
"But he's been struggling with migraines and that's an independent process since then."
Payne missed the Lions' 31-31 draw against Hurricanes draw, and was then not involved in Saturday's 24-21 victory in the second Test.
It was the tourists' first win over the All Blacks since 1993 and set up Saturday's decider at Auckland's Eden Park.
"Jared's slightly more difficult," Dr Falvey said of the Ulster player's recovery situation.
"Thankfully all his tests have been good. He's suffering from migraine symptoms at the moment.
"The specialist is quite happy with him. He'll have a couple more minor tests, and that will give us more idea. But while he still has a headache, he won't be training."
Ireland and Leinster centre Robbie Henshaw could face a four-month lay-off after tearing his pectoral muscle off the bone.
"The muscle needs to be reattached, and that's usually about a 16-week recovery," Dr Falvey said.
"He may do slightly better, but that's probably what we're looking at."
