The video, published by The Sun, shows Johnson, 29, apparently talking to other inmates at HMP Moorland about his child sex abuse case and victim.
The former Sunderland and England midfielder was jailed for six years in March 2016 for grooming and sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.
A spokeswoman said: "An investigation is under way."
The Prison Service spokeswoman also said measures to "find and block illegal mobile phones" were being "stepped up".
She added: "Those who break the rules will be punished and can face extra time behind bars."
In the video, Johnson said he felt he had received a tougher sentence because of his celebrity status.
He also said he hoped to resume his football career abroad after leaving prison.
Rape Crisis in the North East said it was concerned about the effect the publication of the video could have on Johnson's victim.
A spokeswoman said his comments showed "arrogance and a lack of remorse".
Johnson, who lived in Castle Eden near Peterlee, County Durham, played for Middlesbrough, Manchester City and Sunderland, and represented England 12 times.
