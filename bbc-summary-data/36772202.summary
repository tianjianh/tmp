The 34-year-old won the last of his Wales caps in 2009 and had been playing in France in the Top 14 for Oyonnax after signing from Bristol.
The 13-times capped former Cardiff RFC player made his Wales debut in a 2003 World Cup warm-up game against Ireland.
He joined Wasps from Gloucester in 2011, having joined them from Cardiff Blues in 2009.
Robinson's elder brother Jamie joined Toulon in 2007 and went on to finish his career at Agen, after signing for them in 2010.
"We're really disappointed that we left Oyonnax early," said Nicky Robinson.
"It was a three-year contract which gave us great security as a family to move over there and to leave the life we had in Cheltenham.
"We didn't want to come back after a year. That was never the intention, but with the way it worked out in France, the coach got sacked and we got relegated and staying there for another year would have been really difficult."
