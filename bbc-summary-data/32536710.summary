The pictures show the era of the great ocean liners when the port was the hub for transatlantic passenger travel in the early 20th Century.
Cunard's three current liners, Queen Victoria, Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, were all named in the city.
The free exhibition runs at Southampton City Art Gallery throughout May.
Cunard was founded in 1840, with Sir Samuel Cunard's mail steamship RMS Britannia beginning its transatlantic service to Halifax and Boston from Liverpool.
By the early part of the 20th Century, the company's "Big Three" liners - Mauretania, Berengaria and Aquitania  - were the primary means of passenger transport the Atlantic.
Black and white shots of the great liners arriving in  and departing from Southampton make up the exhibition along with advertising illustrations and memorabilia from the time.
They include pictures of the Mauretania in port. It was the fastest ship in the world when it inaugurated Cunard's new express service from Southampton to New York in 1919.
The ships were a byword for luxury, with royalty, Hollywood film stars and the leading politicians of the day all travelling through Southampton on their way to or from the US.
The Caronia was known as the "green Goddess". It was renowned for its luxurious service, having 600 staff for the 600 passengers on board.
Cunard moved its headquarters from Liverpool to Southampton in 1965. More than 400 staff worked at the offices in the former South Western Hotel.
In 2011 Cunard announced it would stop sailing under the British flag and the port of Hamilton in Bermuda replaced the name of Southampton on the stern of Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth.
Mike Harris, head of culture and planning at Southampton City Council, said: "It is important for us to recognise the contribution of the cruise industry to Southampton.
"It gives us a perfect opportunity to celebrate not only the 175th anniversary of Cunard but also our city's key role in its prestigious history."
A series of lectures and an educational programme accompanies the month-long exhibition.
The current "three queens" will mark the 175th anniversary on Sunday when they all arrive in Southampton.
They are also due to attend celebrations in Liverpool at the start of July when Queen Mary 2 will replicate the line's first transatlantic voyage.
