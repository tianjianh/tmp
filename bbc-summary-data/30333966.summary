[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton's much-changed side fell to a Europa League defeat as Krasnodar's Ricardo Laborde took advantage of a Joel Robles error to score the winner.

England Under-18 captain Ryan Ledson was one of four debutants as Roberto Martinez - whose side had already won Group H - gave his youngsters a chance.
Laborde ran on to a through ball and checked to score at the near post, with keeper Joel badly positioned.
Striker Arouna Kone played 90 minutes as he ended a 14-month injury absence.
Kone's inclusion in the Everton line-up was one of 10 changes Martinez made to the side beaten 1-0 at Manchester City in the Premier League last Saturday, with only Gareth Barry retaining his place, as 17-year-old midfielder Ledson made a solid impression.
Forward Kieran Dowell - capped by England at Under-18 level along with Ledson - also made his first senior appearance as an early substitute for hamstring injury victim Christian Atsu, while striker Chris Long and midfielder Gethin Jones came on late in the game.
But the most impressive of the young players given a chance by Martinez was left-back Luke Garbutt, making only his third Everton start as Leighton Baines was rested.
Garbutt, 21, made a number of surging forward runs, the best of which came after a quarter-of-an-hour, when Conor McAleny just failed to connect with his low cross before the ball ran loose for Steven Pienaar's 25-yard shot to be pushed aside by keeper Andrei Sinitsin.
The former Leeds United youngster also tested Sinitsin with a second-half drive from out on the left.
Joel, making his first Everton appearance since March, suffered a bloody nose in keeping out Wanderson's drive towards the near post shortly after Pienaar's effort at the other end.
But the Spanish keeper was at fault as Krasnodar - who were already eliminated - took the lead in the 30th minute. Laborde escaped Pienaar's attentions to run clear, and although he was forced to check as Joel narrowed the angle, the keeper left his near post open for the Colombian forward to fire in from a tight angle.
Kone, harshly booked for an accidental first-half elbow on Vitali Kaleshin, completed his first senior match since suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury in October 2013.
He had a smart shot on the turn beaten out by Sinitsin after Tyias Browning's cross was deflected into his path, but Everton could not find an equaliser despite a brighter second half.
Everton manager Roberto Martinez: "I thought we saw young players with a lot of talent, but they were very nervous in the first half. I don't think we saw their real quality in the first half, but in the second half they got rid of that fear and expressed themselves a lot better.
"The experience will be really helpful. They are different players after the game than they were before, and that is part of the development of a youngster.
"I know the talent the young players have and I think they have learned a massive lesson about how to enjoy yourself on a football pitch. I think these young players will be much more ready to compete on a football pitch after this."
