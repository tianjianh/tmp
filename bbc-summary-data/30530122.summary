[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The drugs, said to have a street value of £500,000. were believed to have been destined for Jersey, which lies 14 miles (22km) from France.
A 57-year-old Irish national was arrested in Granville at the weekend and has appeared in court in France.
Following the arrest, Jersey authorities carried out "a number of searches" in the island.
Officers say the investigation is continuing.
Mark Cockerham, director of enforcement at Jersey Customs and Immigration, described the seizure as "significant".
"Had it been imported and distributed in Jersey this would have led to a large supply being available at user level," he said.
"Whilst we have seen a marked increase in the seizures of new psychoactive substances this year, this demonstrates that there is still a demand for class A drugs in Jersey."
During 2013, Jersey customs seized drugs worth £2.4m.
