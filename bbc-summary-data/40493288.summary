A group representing the survivors of Grenfell Tower has said it does not matter who is the new leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council.

Elizabeth Campbell was chosen as the new leader by Kensington and Chelsea Conservative group on Monday.
Nicholas Paget-Brown resigned on 30 June following continued criticism of the council's handling of the Grenfell Tower tragedy.
The Justice 4 Grenfell group said it had "no confidence in the leadership".
Sue Caro, a co-ordinator for the Justice 4 Grenfell group, compared the new appointment to "rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic".
"They have shown they are not fit to run a council or deliver the services that are needed and I don't really think it matters who is the leader," she said.
Nicholas Paget-Brown remains leader of the council for the time being but Ms Campbell becomes de facto leader.
It is expected that she will be confirmed as leader at its next full meeting on 19 July.
In her first statement since her selection, Ms Campbell said: "The first thing I want to do is I want to apologise.
"This is our community and we have failed it when people needed us the most. So, no buts, no ifs, no excuses.
"I am truly sorry."
