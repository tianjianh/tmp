[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lian Doyle was given a 10-month term after admitted perverting the course of justice over the murder of Pennie Davis by Justin Robertson, last September.
Robertson, of no fixed address, was jailed for life on Tuesday.
Because of credit from time spent on remand, Doyle, of Beech Crescent, Hythe, was freed by the court.
The defendant had pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice before the six-week trial of Robertson and Carr at Winchester Crown Court.
Mrs Davis, 47, was found dead by her new husband in a field at Leygreen Farm near Beaulieu in the New Forest, where she had been tending to her horses.
Robinson was paid Â£1,500 by Benjamin Carr, 22, to "silence" his Mrs Davis, his former stepmother, after a long-running feud between the pair.
Carr, from Southampton, was convicted of conspiracy to murder and will serve a minimum of 30 years.
She had been stabbed 14 times in an attack described by trial judge Justice Andrew Popplewell QC as "particularly brutal".
