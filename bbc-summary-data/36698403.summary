Southwell Minster's window commemorates sacrifice of WW1

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A window commemorating the sacrifice of people from Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire in the First World War has been installed at Southwell Minster.

The heart of the design shows a group of soldiers lifting a comrade, with his outstretched arms hinting at the crucifixion.
The artist, Nicholas Mynheer, said this represents "an act of compassion and service to others".
The window will be dedicated at a service on 10 July.
Mr Mynheer said it was a privilege to produce a window for "such a splendid building as Southwell Minster" and to spend time in his life entirely dedicated to considering the Great War.
"It was to be a truly humbling experience as I started to get an inkling of the stupendous sacrifice by all involved," he said.
"Initially, I felt overwhelmed by the accounts of sheer horror - mind numbing cruelty - and yet ever so gradually, amidst the darkness, little glimmers of hope appeared; of one man helping another, love overcoming hatred, and it was this that I realised I had to depict in the design."
Southwell Minster is in Nottinghamshire, but it was the mother church of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire at the time of the war.
Mr Mynheer said the sacrifice was not just made in the trenches and at the war front, so those at home are also reflected in the window.
Beneath the central group of soldiers a woman hangs up washing, blown by the gathering storm.
This represents the women and others who remained at home, but also Mary at the foot of the cross.
