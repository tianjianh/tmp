Lawro's Premier League predictions v comedian Tim Vine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of guests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this week's fixtures is comedian Tim Vine.
Vine, who has just released his latest live DVD - 'Tim Timinee Tim Timinee Tim Tim To You' - is a Sutton United fan who is looking forward to their FA Cup second-round tie at home to Cheltenham Town on Saturday (15:00 GMT).
"The great attraction of a small football club is the feel of it," he told BBC Sport. "We all hear the complaints about big clubs being very corporate but you go to Sutton United, there is not a prawn in sight - it is Marmite sandwiches and sausages, and about seven or eight people.
"The FA Cup is special too. It still contains that romance that no other football trophy has, because it reaches to all the small clubs like Sutton who suddenly have a glimpse of glory."
Football Focus comes live from Sutton's Ganders Green Lane home at 12:00 GMT, and Vine will deliver a team-talk to his team during the  show.
Host Dan Walker will be joined by Tony Rains and Matthew Hanlan, Sutton's two goalscorers in their famous giant-killing win over Coventry in the FA Cup third round in 1989.
