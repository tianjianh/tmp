Millions of people enjoyed an incredible total solar eclipse.
A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon moves in between the Earth and the Sun, blocking out the Sun's light and plunging areas of the Earth into darkness.
It was called the Great American Eclipse, as the shadow cast on the Earth by the Moon fell directly onto America - so this was the best place to watch the eclipse.
Follow all the action as it happened below.
Well that's it for the evening! We will leave you with this incredible photo of the Moon moving across the Sun during this eclipse, as there's something rather special about it.
It might look like the Nasa photographer forgot to clean his camera, but actually those little dots on the pictures are in fact the space station moving across the Sun.
This picture is seven pictures stitched together, so you can see how the space station was moving. Pretty amazing, huh?!

The Great American Eclipse is now well and truly under way, with some amazing pictures coming from the US.
Pictures from Nasa show that once the Moon has completely covered the Sun and starts to move across it onto the other side, the light from the Sun starts to peek through again.
This creates a beautiful effect which is known as the diamond ring.
You can see from the pictures below why it is called that.
Here is one of the very first images from one of Nasa's special aircrafts showing a breathtaking total solar eclipse.

Well, sort of. A partial eclipse is now visible right on the west coast of the US, which is the first place where people will get to see this incredible solar spectacle.
This means that the Moon has started to move in between the Earth and the Sun, and people watching from this area are now able to see the Sun slowly being covered up.
It is about half an hour before people in Oregon will get to see a total solar eclipse. Watch this space, Newsrounders!
