The body of Adrian Greenwood, 42, was discovered by his cleaner in the hallway of his four-storey house in Iffley Road on Thursday.
He had been stabbed several times in the chest and neck.
Thames Valley Police said a 26-year-old man being held on suspicion of murder was released without charge on Saturday afternoon.
A post-mortem examination confirmed Mr Greenwood died "following a vicious and sustained attack".
The murder weapon has not yet been found.
The last sighting of Mr Greenwood was at Sainsbury's supermarket in Oxford Road, Kidlington, at about 18:00 BST on Tuesday.
Police are appealing for people who knew him to come forward to enable detectives to build up a picture of his life and associates.
Det Supt Chris Ward said: "We know Mr Greenwood had a number of businesses so anyone that had dealt with him from a business point of view or anybody that had a personal relationship with him - we will treat all of that information sensitively.
"I think the answers lay in his personal life and his business connections and that's why I'm appealing for people to come forward that knew him".
Mr Greenwood was an Oxford graduate who had written two historical biographies and traded rare and antiquarian books as well as art.
In 2011, he spoke to the BBC ahead of an auction of Banksy artworks in Oxford, where he sold a locked 1970s safe stencilled by the artist.
Mr Greenwood was also in the news in 2010 when his limited first edition of a Harry Potter book was stolen from an art gallery in Woodstock.
It was later found in a carrier bag outside a shop in Abingdon.
