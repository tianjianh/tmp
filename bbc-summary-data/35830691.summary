New bridge on A96 near Pitcaple to open to traffic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new bridge on the A96 is to open to traffic on Friday following a Â£10.2m construction project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The improvements at Inveramsay Bridge, near Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire, mean traffic will no longer bottleneck at a set of lights at a railway bridge.
The new bridge takes the A96 over the Aberdeen to Inverness railway line.
Transport Minister Derek MacKay said the upgraded section of road would bring an end to years of delays and frustration for motorists.
The A96 links Aberdeen with Inverness.
