Wales may play a friendly against high-profile opponents at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff in March 2017.

With the home of Welsh rugby hosting the Champions League final in June, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) wants to stage a notable football game there as part of its preparations.
It is unclear who Wales would face, but Argentina and Spain are understood to be under consideration.
Wales have not played football at the 72,500-capacity ground since 2011.
They lost 2-0 to England on that occasion, ending an 11-year association with the arena formerly known as the Millennium Stadium.
Wales have since moved to the 33,000-seat Cardiff City Stadium, and Chris Coleman and his players have stressed that they want to stay at the ground where they have been successful recently.
If they do return to the Principality Stadium for a friendly, Coleman hopes it will be against challenging opposition.
"I like a friendly if it's against opposition where we're going to be right up against it, not one where we should win," he said.
"If we're playing Argentina or Spain or teams where we're right up against it, yeah, I'm all for that."
Wales face Ireland in a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Dublin on 24 March, and the friendly would likely take place the week after that fixture.
There would be an option to play a friendly before then in November as well, but Wales are unlikely to do so.
"I prefer that because it gives me a better chance to mould them [Wales' players] into what we're going to be doing for a game," Coleman added.
"To be fair to our FA, a lot of other countries when they've had a friendly and then a competitive game, I've said I don't want a friendly. Give me that time to work with the team and get them ready for the game.
"That costs us money sometimes because we can earn money off good friendlies.
"But the time I get to spend with players is invaluable because we don't get it [time]."
