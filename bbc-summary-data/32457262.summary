Election 2015: Cameron 'pledges Lowestoft third crossing by 2020'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to build a third water crossing in Lowestoft by 2020, the local Conservative candidate has said.

Mr Cameron visited the town, where Peter Aldous is defending a Conservative majority of 769.
Mr Aldous called it "the most significant commitment" so far to the debate about a third bridge.
Opposition candidates in the Waveney constituency called it "electioneering".
The Suffolk coastal town is divided by Lake Lothing, with one road crossing at the Oulton Broad end and the Bascule Bridge at the town centre/harbour end.
A recent study for Suffolk County Council estimated a new bridge crossing near the harbour would cost Â£95m.
Mr Cameron said the New Anglia New Enterprise Partnership would be asked to submit a final design for consideration in the 2016 Budget, when a funding decision would be made.
"The promises we've made in the East of England, we've delivered on - I said we'd sort out the A11, we did sort out the A11," he told the BBC.
"The job performance [in East Anglia] has been magnificent with 207,000 more people in work since I became prime minister.
"Back that with the infrastructure and that performance could be stellar."
Doug Farmer, Liberal Democrat candidate, said: "We will be delighted if he has promised a third crossing, providing it is a dual carriageway and in a central location.
"If all he's promised is to 'look at it', that's no change from what the Conservative and Labour administrations have been saying for 50 years, so I'm sceptical."
Graham Elliot, Green candidate, said: "It's basically electioneering - who knows what he's promising?
"We still favour reliable road crossings and investment in public transport, walking and cycling."
Mr Aldous said: "The PM pledged a Conservative government would build a third crossing by 2020 and this is the most significant commitment that any party leader has provided.
"There is still a lot of work to be done, but there is a very clear timetable."
Five candidates are standing in the Waveney constituency on 7 May.
Bob Blizzard, the Labour candidate who lost his seat in 2010, could not be contacted for comment, but previously said he favoured a central Â£65m barrage and lock road crossing and that Labour leader Ed Miliband had said he would "support a bid to make funding available".
Simon Tobin, UKIP, candidate was also not available but had previously said he would "fight to bring the project up the political agenda".
