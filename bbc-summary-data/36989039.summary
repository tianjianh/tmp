Belfast man Patrick Huston was 38th in the men's individual archery qualifying as he had the honour of being the first Briton in action at the Rio Olympics.

Friday's qualifying determined Monday's first-round pairings and Huston will face Dutchman Rick Van Der Ven.
The Dutchman was 27th in qualifying at the Sambadrome but he is currently seventh in the world rankings.
World number one Kim Woo-jin of South Korea set a new world record of 700 in Friday's qualifying.
The current world champion's total eclipsed the previous record of 699 set by his compatriot Im Dong-hyun at the London Olympics.
Huston, whose performance matched his current world ranking of 38th, produced a qualifying total of 656.
Minus his trademark flat cap after it fell foul of the British Olympic Association's dress code, Huston sought inspiration during Friday's competition by reading a series of motivational notes.
One of his notes started, and appeared to finish, with the line:"I am the 2016 Olympic champion" and Huston said afterwards that the idea was inspired by the ormer Olympic shooter and now sports psychologist Lanny Bassham.
Bassham created his "Mental Management System" after falling short in the 1972 Games in Munich and went on the gold medal in Montreal four years later as well as 22 world titles.
Huston said: "I would not have got my Olympic place if I had not followed Lanny Bassham's system.
"One of its tenets is the more you think and write about something the more likely it is to happen, so one of the things to do is write directive affirmations.
"I have notes pasted up on my wall in the Olympic Village and it is just something to inspire me and keep me focused."
Huston said his performance on Friday "wasn't the target I had set myself" but insisted that he remained optimistic for the knockout stages.
"When I get to the proper stadium with the crowds cheering all around me, the pressure of that will make me perform," said the Belfast archer.
