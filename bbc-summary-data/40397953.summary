James Brindley was talking to his girlfriend on his phone when he was attacked in Aldridge town centre shortly before midnight on Friday.
Det Insp Jim Munro said four boys aged 16, leaving their school prom, helped Mr Brindley and called his parents.
West Midlands Police has released CCTV of four vehicles seen near the scene.
Mr Munro appealed for people in the cars, which were travelling along Little Aston Road towards the town centre at the time of the incident, to come forward.
"We are very keen to speak to the occupants of those cars, two light in colour and the other two darker, as they may have seen what happened and could lead us to the killer," he said.
Describing the attack as "callous", Mr Munro said "the motive is unclear".
"This is an awful incident which has taken place in Aldridge town centre. He had been on a night out and had been enjoying time with his friends and has ended up dying in his parents' arms," he said.
Mr Munro said the attack "lasted just seconds" and the four teenagers, who were first to help Mr Brindley, gave him first aid and called the emergency services.
A post-mortem examination found the 26-year-old died from a single stab wound to his heart.
Officers are conducting "extensive searches" for the murder weapon, which could be a knife or other sharp object.
Mr Munro said: "James' family and friends are devastated by his loss and we need to bring his killer to justice.
"Someone will have knowledge of this attack and I would ask them to search their conscience and do the right thing. If you can't speak to police then please call Crimestoppers anonymously."
