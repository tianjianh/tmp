[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mrs Danczuk, who found fame posting "selfies" on Twitter, is hoping to be chosen to stand for Labour in the marginal Bury North constituency.
The 33-year-old served as a Labour councillor from 2012 to 2015 in her home town of Rochdale.
The seat is held by Conservative David Nuttall who had a majority of 378 at the last general election.
She waived her right to anonymity last year after her brother was jailed for raping her as a child.
She then became patron of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood and stated previously she wants to become an MP to help victims of sexual abuse.
"Politics is changing, you only have to look across Europe and the rest of the world," she said.
"Parliament needs more common sense and someone who can connect with voters. I really believe I'm a voice of the people."
Mrs Danczuk is the ex-wife of Simon Danczuk, the sitting MP in Rochdale.
He was suspended by Labour in 2015, pending an investigation, following revelations he exchanged explicit messages with a 17-year-old girl.
Mr Danczuk, 50, who currently serves as an independent MP, recently said he "expects" to fight the general election for Labour in Rochdale on 8 June.
The snap election has resulted in the suspension of the usual Labour Party selection procedures of a panel interview and a vote by local members.
Instead, candidates in seats where there is no Labour MP, such as Bury North, will be selected by a panel of the party's ruling National Executive Committee.
A spokeswoman for the party said candidates selected to stand for Labour in the general election will be made public on 2 May.
