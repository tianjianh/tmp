Age Cymru has been given the money by Arts Council of Wales and The Baring Foundation.
Artists will go into care homes to teach people new skills as part of cARTrefu, which launched in April 2015.
Nick Capaldi of Arts Council of Wales said: "Taking part in the arts adds to the everyday quality of life and the wellbeing of our nation."
The money, which covers 2017 to 2019, was announced on the eve of BBC Wales' Get Creative weekend, a partnership with Arts Council of Wales.
It begins with people forming an outline map of Wales on the side of Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons on Friday.
Get Creative will give people the chance to try their hand at a range of cultural activities with a number of taster events.
cARTrefu, meaning to reside in Welsh, is a programme aimed at introducing older people to the arts. In its two years, it has held more than 1,000 workshops at 120 care homes.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: "Art can play an integral part in tackling social isolation for older people and improving the wellbeing of communities across Wales."
A Baring Foundation report in 2011 stated the arts in care homes were "integral to the definition of excellence in social care".
It also found art programmes could also help boost people's confidence and self-esteem.
