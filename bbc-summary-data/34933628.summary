£6.6m flood wall at Hull's Albert Dock completed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £6.6m project to protect homes and businesses in Hull from flooding has been completed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The project involved the construction of a new metre-high flood wall between Albert Dock and the Trans Pennine Trail.
The scheme was approved by the government after 300 homes and businesses were flooded by a tidal surge in December 2013.
The Environment Agency began construction work in November 2014.
The agency said the scheme had "greatly reduced" the risk of flooding for homes and businesses close to Albert Dock.
Funding for the defences came from the Environment Agency, Associated British Ports and the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership with support from Hull City Council.
