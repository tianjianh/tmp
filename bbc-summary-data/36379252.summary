Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey says he will use the European Championships to prove he can play at the highest level.

The 25-year-old helped Arsenal finish in second place in the Premier League and played in eight of Wales' 10 games as they qualified for Euro 2016.
"I've played in some big games and everybody's eyes will be on this tournament," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"I've never been in a tournament before. I want to come here and show what I'm capable of doing."
This summer's competition will be Wales' first appearance at the finals of a major championship since the 1958 World Cup.
And Ramsey believes Chris Coleman's side can perform well when it matters.
"It was one of my biggest targets to help Wales qualify for a major tournament. It was a big achievement not just for me personally but for this team and our country," he added.
"Now we're here, we don't want to be rolled over every game that we play, we want to make a statement and show we're capable of doing it."
Ramsey believes Wales can draw upon the experience of their squad and do not have to rely on Gareth Bale this summer.
"We're delighted to have him in our team but it's not just him, it's the whole team, we've had to work hard," Ramsey continued.
"Defensively we've been solid, we haven't conceded many goals in the [qualifying] campaign and we have players who can counter-attack and create things and put the ball in the back of the net. I think we have a good balance."
