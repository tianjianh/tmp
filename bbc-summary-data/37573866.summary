The 35-year-old joined the League Two side on Monday and opened the scoring in their 4-1 EFL Trophy victory.
Taylor-Fletcher scored twice in 21 appearances at Tranmere last season.
"I was told Accrington liked to play football but I didn't understand how much - in the first half it was like watching Barcelona," he said.
He told BBC Radio Lancashire: "I'm a bit lost for words but it was enjoyable.
"If you made a mistake no one was bothered, it was just 'get the ball back and keep playing'. You can take risks and that's what I like."
