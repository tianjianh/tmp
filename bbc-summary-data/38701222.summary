The hosts went ahead when Izale McLeod was fouled and Anthony Barry tucked away the penalty that followed.
At the other end, Boreham Wood won a penalty of their own when Mark Carrington brought town Morgan Ferrier, who made no mistake from the spot.
There was late drama however, as John Rooney scored another Wrexham penalty to seal the win in the 93rd minute.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales:
"I thought in the first half we controlled the game. We should have killed the game off and when we went in at half-time, it wasn't good enough even though we were in control.
"The positive is we got a penalty in the last minute and John scored.
"To give full credit to Boreham Wood they changed their formation. They played the way we expected the first half but didn't in the last 25 minutes."
