[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
East Cheshire NHS Trust has been told by England's chief inspector of hospitals it "requires improvement".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A team of specialists visited Macclesfield District General and Congleton War Memorial hospitals and the trust's community services during December 2014.
The trust's services were rated as "good" for being caring.
However, the trust was rated as "requires improvement" for being safe, effective, responsive and well led.
East Cheshire NHS Trust said it had already made changes since the inspection and it would implement an improvement programme.
The inspection was carried out over three days in December, but the team from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) also made separate unannounced visits.
Inspectors found that services were provided by "dedicated, caring staff" and that patients were "treated with dignity and respect".
Patients had spoken positively about the treatment they had received.
However, the CQC report said the trust needed to ensure:
The Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, said: "We found that - across the board - staff were working hard delivering compassionate care to people using trust services.
"We also found, however, that improvements were required in some areas particularly in relation to safety of the trust's community services and services for children and young people.
"We saw that work was needed to improve the leadership and governance at the trust."
East Cheshire NHS Trust said it welcomed the report and noted inspectors had found good practice around hand hygiene and emergency and critical care.
The trust's chief executive John Wilbraham said: "We are pleased that the inspectors have seen good care provided across all areas of our hospital and community services.
"The report offers opportunities for the trust to improve further and we are confident staff will respond positively to these and indeed we have already made changes since the inspection last December."
