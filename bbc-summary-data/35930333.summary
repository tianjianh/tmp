A McDonald's security guard who punched the manager of comedian Alan Carr has been given a suspended jail sentence.

Carr and Elliott Andrews were at the Lord Street branch in Liverpool on 20 September when several people started taking pictures.
Liverpool Crown Court heard Jaleel Burman, 21, "lost his temper" after he and another guard removed Mr Andrews for a reason "which isn't... clear".
Burman, from Langdale Road, received a suspended jail sentence of 12 months.
Carr had performed as part of his "Yap Yap Yap" tour at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall before he and his manager went to order food at about 04:30 BST.
Other people at the McDonalds branch started trying to take pictures of themselves with the comedian.
Simon Duncan, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Burman and another security guard spoke to Mr Andrews briefly after they were asked to remove him, "before grabbing him by the arms and marching him out of the premises".
"Once outside, Burman appears to have lost his temper and punched Mr Andrews once to the face, which knocked him to the ground, breaking his ankle."
The assault also caused a cut to his face that required two stitches, he added.
"Initially when interviewed by the police, Burman claimed he was acting in self-defence.
"When shown video footage he later admitted the assault and expressed some remorse for his actions."
