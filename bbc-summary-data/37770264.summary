The former nursing home worker accused of killing eight elderly residents came across as a doting daughter, an animal lover and a Harry Potter fan, according to her social media profile.

But Elizabeth Tracey Mae Wettlaufer's Facebook page also hinted at personal struggles.
The 49-year-old faces eight charges of first-degree murder over the deaths in southern Ontario between the years of 2007-14.
The victims were all residents in two long-term care facilities where Ms Wettlaufer worked and were between 75 and 96 years-old.
Earlier today, a spokesperson for Caressant Care, the facility in Ms Wettlaufer's hometown of Woodstock where seven of the residents died, said the accused had not been their employee for about two and a half years.
Neighbours in the apartment building where Ms Wettlaufer resided described her as a pleasant person who lived alone with her dog.
"We would chat and have laughs. She seemed like an everyday, normal kind of person," Derek Gilbert told CBC.
On the Ontario College of Nurse's website, her profile states that she became a registered nurse in June 1995 but that she resigned on 30 September 2016.
The profile also lists her former surname as Parker, and notes that she is facing murder charges and in currently being held in custody.
Ms Wettlaufer listed on Facebook that she studied religious education in the province of Ontario.
She said she was at London Baptist Bible College before going to nursing school at Conestoga College in Kitchener.
Ms Wettlaufer listed Lifeguard Homecare as her current employer. A representative from Lifeguard Homecare did not return the BBC's request for comment.
In the past, she was also an employee at Christian Horizons, the long-term care facility confirmed.
A spokesperson for the organisation, which was not named in the police investigation, said she left in 2007.
"Christian Horizons fully intends to cooperate with the authorities in their investigation in this matter," said chief executive Janet Noel-Annable in a statement.
On Facebook Ms Wettlaufer frequently posted pictures of herself with her elderly parents, a dog and cats.
"Father's day is a great reminder of how blessed I am to still have my Dad alive and able to spend time with me," she wrote beneath a picture of her father.
In another post, dated 28 September 2015, Ms Wettlaufer spoke about her difficulties with alcoholism.
"My own voice called to me in the darkness. Others hands lifted me when I chose the light. One year ago today I woke up not dead. 365 days clean and sober," she wrote.
