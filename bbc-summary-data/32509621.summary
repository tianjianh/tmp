A national park has said it has been "overwhelmed" by public generosity after appealing for help to gather aid to take out to earthquake-hit Nepal.

The Brecon Beacons is home to the Ghurkha Wing (Mandalay) company at Brecon's Infantry Battle School.
The park said it was unable to take any more donations as the convoy trucks were now full.
Ghurkhas have been barracked in the town since 1974.
A park spokeswoman said: "We have been overwhelmed by the generosity from the people of Britain - so much so that I'm afraid we cannot accept any more items to go in this convoy.
"There will be some HGVs leaving Brecon for Aldershot to deliver all the supplies generously donated. Thank you again for all your superb efforts."
