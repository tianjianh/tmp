Van Vuuren, 24, signed a short-term deal with the Tigers this season and has since made three appearances.
The former Stade Francais front-rower also has Super Rugby experience with the Cheetahs and Kings.
"This is a great opportunity for me to compete for a place in a team that is really going places," Van Vuuren said.
"I've had a taste of English rugby recently and I'm looking forward to playing in one of the toughest leagues in rugby."
Bath head coach Mike Ford added: "He is a robust, talented player, with a lot of potential to continue improving as a player, and we're looking forward to helping him do that."
