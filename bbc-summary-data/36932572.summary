RAF Valley closed for August as £20m project to refurbish airfield continues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RAF Valley airbase on Anglesey is closed to all aircraft for August as a £20 million project to refurbish the airfield continues.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) say the project will extend the life of the airfield by 25 years.
In preparation, 11 RAF Hawk T2 jets have been relocated from RAF Valley to MoD St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan.
The airbase's Number 4 flying training school (4FTS) will continue to operate.
Citywing passengers flying between Cardiff Airport and Anglesey will land at RAF Mona on the island.
Passengers are being advised to check in at least 45 minutes before departure, due to the temporary changes.
RAF Valley is also being given upgraded taxiways, improved aeronautical lighting and a new perimeter road.
The existing taxiways are thought to be insufficient to handle larger visiting aircraft such as the RAF Typhoon, Hercules or Atlas.
In total, the MoD has pledged over one billion pounds for future training, with the majority of the investment going to Valley.
In future, the Anglesey airbase will also be the home of basic flying training.
The runway will reopen in September and the refurbishment project is due to be completed in February 2017.
