Terry Perkins, 68, allegedly broke into Chatila jewellers in Old Bond Street during the August bank holiday in 2010. He denies the charges.
Only five stills of the raid remain available, Southwark Crown Court heard.
Perkins, of Enfield, was sentenced to seven years in jail for his role in the Hatton Garden raid in 2016.
The prosecution said the Mayfair burglary bore "striking" similarities with the Hatton Garden Raid in 2015
Matthew Hollands, a detective in the Metropolitan Police's armed robbery unit, told the court the footage had been destroyed due to rules on how long police property can be stored for.
He said the move was "regrettable", but due to the "passage of time" it was decided that "these exhibits would be destroyed".
The key footage from came from nearby shops and Westminster Council, the court heard.
It showed four men in high visibility jackets getting out of a white van on the morning of 29 August and later leaving the premises with white containers and bags.
But none of the remaining stills include the men.
The group tried to drill into a safe containing about Â£40m worth of jewellery, but was unsuccessful.
They did, however, manage to get into the showroom where they allegedly stole Â£1m in precious stones and jewellery, the jury was told.
Fellow Hatton Garden raider Daniel Jones, 60, pleaded guilty to his role at an earlier hearing ahead of the trial.
Defending Perkins, Peter Rowlands pointed out that no descriptions of the men's height, build or age had been recorded when the viewing logs of the footage were produced.
The trial continues.
