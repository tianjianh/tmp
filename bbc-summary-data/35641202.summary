The left-hander has scored three centuries in 17 Test appearances and averages 41.39 in first-class cricket.
The 23-year-old has also played 38 one-day internationals and 12 Twenty20 internationals for the Black Caps, but did not make their World T20 squad.
"Playing county cricket has always been a goal of mine," Latham told the club website.
"I've heard great things about the playing group and coaching staff, so I can't wait to get started."
Latham, who made his Test debut against India in February 2014, is due to join the Kent squad before they start the County Championship Division Two campaign at Worcestershire on Sunday, 10 April.
South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has agreed to join Kent for a stint in June and July.
