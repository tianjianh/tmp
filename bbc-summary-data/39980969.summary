Mellis, a former Chelsea youth team player, has also played for Southampton, Barnsley, Blackpool and Oldham, before joining Bury in 2015.
The Stags have not disclosed the length of the 26-year-old's contract.
"I watched the kid in spells last season at Bury, where he was simply stunning," Mansfield boss Steve Evans told his club's official website.
Mellis was signed by Chelsea for Â£1m in 2007 from Sheffield United and reached the FA Youth Cup final under current Swansea boss Paul Clement the following year.
The former England Under-16s captain made his first-team debut in a Champions League win against MSK Zilina in November 2010.
He left Stamford Bridge after he admitted setting off a smoke grenade at the club's Cobham training ground.
