Liam Fee murder trial: Mother cried during murder charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury has been shown a film of a woman crying as she was charged with murdering her son.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rachel Fee wept as a police officer read the allegation in relation to the death of two-year-old Liam Fee.
The jury was shown a film of Rachel Fee in a police interview in August 2014.
Nyomi Fee and her partner Rachel Fee deny murdering Liam on 22 March 2014 and blame his death on another child. Liam was found dead in a house near Glenrothes, Fife.
The pair are also charged with a catalogue of allegations that they neglected Liam and abused two other children, one of whom they blame for killing Liam, while in their care over a two-year period.
The women, who are both originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny all the charges against them.
The jury was also shown a film of Rachel Fee's co-accused and partner Nyomi Fee during a police interview in which she was questioned about various injuries on Liam's body.
In a later police film when she was charged with murder, she appeared tearful and put her hands over her face.
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
