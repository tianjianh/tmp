Ed Clancy, Jon Dibben, Owain Doull and Andy Tennant beat Germany's men by almost a second in the team pursuit.
In the women's team pursuit final, Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Joanna Rowsell and Laura Trott defeated the Russian team by nearly seven seconds.
Clancy took bronze in the men's scratch race behind Otto Vergaerde of Belgium and Spain's Eloy Teruelrovira.
The championships, taking place on the Caribbean island because Guadeloupe is a French colony, are the first chance to score Olympic qualification points for Rio 2016.
