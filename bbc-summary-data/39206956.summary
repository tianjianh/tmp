Bissouma penned a professional deal with the northern club only in July 2016, four months after joining the reserves from AS Real Bamako.
The 20-year-old, whose previous deal ran until June 2019, says he is very happy at Stade Pierre-Mauroy.
"In football, when you put in the work you always get rewarded," Bissouma told the club's website.
"I still have a lot of progress to make. I want to give myself every chance of doing that and fulfilling my objectives.
"The first is to keep the club in Ligue 1, and then I would also like to win a trophy with Lille."
Bissouma has scored once in 17 appearances for the club since making his debut against Toulouse in September 2016.
