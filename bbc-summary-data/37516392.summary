Head coach Paul Trollope says he will use past experiences to turn around the fortunes of Cardiff City.

Second-from-bottom Bluebirds travel to Burton in the Championship on Saturday having won just twice in the league.
Trollope accepts responsibility, but vowed: "It's easy for things to fall apart, that's not going to happen."
Striker Rickie Lambert is in contention for selection despite suffering an injury early in the 2-0 home defeat by Derby County.
Trollope could also give a debut to former Aston Villa defender Joe Bennett.
Cardiff came from behind to clinch a 2-1 win at Rotherham on Saturday, but Tuesday's set-back against Derby saw them drop back into the Championship relegation zone.
But former Wales assistant coach Trollope believes the spirit in his squad is still good and his own experience will help them.
He said tough spells as Bristol Rovers manager and as an assistant to Chris Hughton at Norwich and Birmingham have prepared him to deal with adversity.
"You are made up of all your experiences, what you have seen and what you have done and certainly I have been in similar situations through my career," he said.
"You learn and you evolve and learn how to act and how to turn things around in this situation, because it's easy to go the other way."
The Cardiff City boss admitted the international break, which follows the game at Burton, adds to the pressure, but said he remains confident.
"It is disappointing and there are some feelings you don't want to be feeling. But we are where we are, I take responsibility for that, I'm the head coach," he said.
"It's my programme I have set, I have that responsibility and I also have a belief that although things have not gone our way things will turn."
Lambert limped off with a hamstring injury in the first half against Derby, but could feature at Burton.
Defender Joe Bennett, signed from Aston Villa during the summer transfer window, is travelling, while Lee Peltier and Freddie Gounongbe could return from injury.
But there are injury doubts over Wales defender Jazz Richards and Iceland midfielder Arron Gunnarsson, while  Anthony Pilkington will be assessed on Friday.
