"Cranial features can distinguish ethnic groups but it's very difficult to be certain," says Matthew Morris, who is supervising the project to find out more about the remains.
"We can only be sure through DNA analysis which the team may explore in the future."
He says osteologists, who study bones and skeletons, would find it even harder to pinpoint a region of Africa.
Septimius Severus was the first African-born Roman emperor. He was born in Libya in AD145 and reigned between AD193 and AD211, when he died in York during a military expedition.
Severus was the first emperor to admit openly that the army shored up his imperial power, and he rewarded the soldiers accordingly .
Ever the realist, on his death bed in York in AD211, Severus told his sons to look after the soldiers and to ignore everyone else.
"Part of why this is not talked about is because it doesn't fit into the narrative of race and Britain," says Dr Kehinde Andrews, course leader of the Black Studies degree at Birmingham City University.
"The myth we are sold is that Britain is a special island nation, with an indigenous white population who exported civilisation around the world.
"The idea that there were Africans and others here contributing in Roman times - and all the way up to the present - shatters that illusion."
Mr Morris says one of the skeletons had "severe rickets".
His theory is this may have been a result of environmental change rather than dietary, as people with African ancestry have darker skin and need more sunlight to get enough vitamin D.
It suggests these people had moved from a sunnier climate to gloomy old England, he adds.
It's at the former Equity Shoes factory on Western Road.
