England and Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson is due to face trial on child sex charges next February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old, who has played 12 times for England, appeared at Durham Crown Court for a pre-trial hearing.
The winger previously pleaded not guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child under 16 and another of grooming.
Mr Johnson, from Castle Eden, County Durham, is on conditional bail and will be tried at Bradford Combined Court.
His trial was due to start later this month but Judge Christopher Prince ruled it should be put back until 10 February 2016.
The footballer walked into the court for the hearing, which dealt with legal rulings, with a group of men, including his legal team and his father.
The three charges of sexual activity relate to a single night in January at two locations in County Durham, while the grooming offence was said to have happened between December and February.
Mr Johnson was arrested in March.
Born in Sunderland, he began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then Sunderland for Â£10m in 2012.
