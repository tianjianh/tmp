There are hopes of creating 500 new jobs over the next five years.
The Wales Co-operative Centre will operate the Social Business Wales project, backed by £6m in EU funding and £5m from the Welsh government.
It says social businesses "often fill the gaps the private sector won't consider and the public sector can't support".
Social enterprises include ventures set up with a community focus and have a strong presence in deprived areas.
Nearly a third operate in the health and social care sector, and similarly in culture and leisure.
The project aims to help 500 businesses, including co-operatives, worker-owned companies and social enterprises.
It will also help charities take forward commercial ideas.
The investment comes at a time when more than two thirds of Welsh social businesses expect to increase their turnover in the next two to three years.
Finance Minister Jane Hutt said: "The social business sector plays an important role in supporting local economies, particularly in disadvantaged areas."
Chief executive of the Wales Co-operative Centre Derek Walker added: "We believe that social businesses have great potential for further growth in Wales."
CASE STUDY: 'WE KNEW WE WERE DOING SOME GOOD'
The project announcement is being made at the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) - a social business in Neath.
It works with firms and organisations to make sure websites, apps and other digital media are accessible to people with visual and mobility impairments, dyslexia and learning disabilities.
The business provides work for people with disabilities and has a client list which includes Fujitsu, Santander and Channel 4.
How long has DAC has been going and how many people work there? Gavin Evans, director of operations: We have been operating for nearly four and a half years and have 21 employed staff and four volunteers at present.
Explain what a social business is - how does it differ in how you are set up and operate? My understanding of a social business is that the organisation requires investment in order to have some form of social gain. We have commercial and social missions and goals, the social impact being the big focus. We reinvest 100% our profits back into the business, as we operate on a not-for-profit basis. We initially placed all the investment in ourselves, and had some small amounts of funding for computer equipment from Welsh funding organisations.
We operate on a commercial basis, we sell our services. However, with investment and a good business plan, we can do a whole lot of more social good.
Any advice for someone thinking of setting up a social enterprise?  I think the key advice to offer is to have belief and confidence in what you are doing. When Cam (other co-founder and director) and myself set up the company, the first few months were extremely difficult. But we knew we had a good model and, after all, we knew we were doing some good. I think that is key really, to know that there is a socially-beneficial goal at the end of it, and believe in what you are doing will benefit the wider community. DAC does this by ensuring other organisations' digital products are accessible to everyone. However, we also provide sustainable employment for individuals with disabilities. So there are two key drivers for us really.
