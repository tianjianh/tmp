Floating wind turbines planned off Kincardine coast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been put forward for a floating offshore wind project off the Aberdeenshire coast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kincardine Offshore Windfarm Ltd - a joint project between Pilot Offshore Renewables and Atkins - wants to put up eight turbines about 10 miles off the coast, south of Aberdeen.
It is claimed that placing turbines on semi-submersible platforms would cut construction and installation costs.
The developers will now enter into a period of consultation.
Kincardine wants to start construction in the second quarter of 2016 and have the wind farm operating by the end of 2017.
It could be the world's first array of floating wind turbines.
Allan MacAskill, director of Pilot Offshore Renewables, said: "This is an exciting project that will demonstrate the potential of floating technology in the global offshore wind industry."
Dr Richard Wakefield, senior marine scientist at Atkins, said: "We have carried out the initial environmental assessments for the Kincardine Offshore Wind project and are really excited by the site, the technology and its potential to open the industry up to deeper waters and more productive turbines."
