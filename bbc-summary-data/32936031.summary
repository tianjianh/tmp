The eggs from breeding pair Glesni and Monty were first spotted at Cors Dyfi Reserve on 25 April.
The pair have previously produced four eggs together in the past three years.
Monty and Glesni, which featured on BBC's Springwatch programme in 2012, returned to the site in April after wintering in Africa.
Monty has returned annually to breed at the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust site since 2011.
The birds of prey are kept under constant watch and a webcam will capture the moment the eggs hatch.
