Sea eagle released after operation to remove fish hooks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A white tailed sea eagle chick that had to be rescued after swallowing two fish hooks has been released close to his nest site in the Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The male bird was found at Loch Arkaig in Lochaber in June tangled in fishing line and in distress. It was rescued by conservation officer Lewis Pate.
The Scottish SPCA first took the chick to Inverness and then to its national rescue centre in Alloa for treatment.
An operation was done on the eagle to remove the fish hooks.
Animal welfare staff have called him Brahma.
Colin Seddon, of the SSPCA, said: "Brahma is now around 12-weeks-old and fully fledged.
"The release site was prepared by Lewis Pate and staff from the Achnacarry Esate in Lochaber, who have generously provided a boat and engine for logistical support and feeding if he needs it.
"There were several people involved in Brahma's rescue and recovery and without them he would not have survived."
