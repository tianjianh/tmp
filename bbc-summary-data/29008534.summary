Switzerland 0-2 England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England made the perfect start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign as two second-half strikes from Arsenal's £16m new boy Danny Welbeck gave them victory in Switzerland.

Manager Roy Hodgson needed his side to produce an encouraging performance and positive result after the misery of going out of the World Cup in Brazil at the group stage in the summer - and this did the job on both counts.

England were indebted to two vital saves by goalkeeper Joe Hart from Haris Seferovic and a vital goal-line clearance from Gary Cahill, but this victory was fully deserved and showed promising signs for the future.
Switzerland - ninth in Fifa's world rankings in August after reaching the last 16 of the World Cup, with England 20th - posed a threat but ended up being well beaten.
The merits of Hodgson using the diamond formation, which suits Raheem Sterling perfectly, was shown as Liverpool's youngster set up former Manchester United star Welbeck's first goal just before the hour and was also involved as Anfield team-mate Rickie Lambert laid on the striker's second in stoppage time.
England's defence - Phil Jones in particular - still had moments of vulnerability but this meeting with Switzerland was regarded as the toughest assignment in the group with San Marino, Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia to come. From that point of view, this was mission accomplished.
With the post-World Cup apathy reflected in an attendance of just over 40,000 for England's friendly against Norway at Wembley last week, Hodgson could ill-afford a poor start to this Euro 2016 qualifying group.

He had shown signs of strain after the Norway win but cut a more relaxed figure here - and England delivered a result and performance that lifted his mood even more.
And as a signpost for the future, Hodgson has surely found a formation - with Arsenal's Jack Wilshere at the base of the diamond and Sterling at its tip - that he should settle on as England negotiate a group which should be nothing more than a foundation for success in France.
Sterling provided pace and strength, having a hand in both Welbeck goals, with England's pace on the counter-attack too much for Switzerland to handle.
Wayne Rooney also thrived surrounded by speed and willing runners and England's new captain showed his usual willingness to take responsibility and do his share of the donkey work.
Hodgson will also lean on those he has trusted in the past - and in Hart he found someone who excelled when called upon in Basel.
England gave a first start to Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph and he emerged with much credit, although he must also reflect on a lack of discipline that earned him an early yellow card and running the risk of even further punishment.
Jones, who has usurped Everton captain Phil Jagielka following the World Cup, was uncertain throughout and he was grateful to Hart for keeping England on level terms when he lost possession to Xherdan Shaqiri and, when he played in Seferovic, Manchester City's keeper was off his line to block.
England's speed on the counter was eye-catching and could have brought rewards on the break had Welbeck shot rather than attempt an ill-judged cross that missed both Sterling and Rooney.
Welbeck was on the mark after Hart had once again stopped Seferovic, getting on the end of Sterling's perfect cross after Rooney had broken swiftly on the Swiss defence.
Cahill was England's hero as Switzerland pressed, with a superb goalline clearance from Josip Drmic - and the final word was left to Welbeck as he took Lambert's pass in his stride in the dying seconds to beat Yann Sommer.
Hodgson punched the air in delight, and perhaps a measure of relief, as England made a start on their road to redemption after Brazil.
