Women's Super League One: Birmingham City Ladies 0-4 Chelsea Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea Ladies kept alive their Women's Super League title hopes with a devastating display that put an end to Birmingham City's 12-game unbeaten run.

Eni Aluko's shot and Karen Carney's header made it 2-0 by the sixth minute, with strikes from Gemma Davison and Ji So-Yun earning a 4-0 half-time lead.
Carney hit the bar after the break but Chelsea could not add to their tally.
The win took the Londoners back to within 10 points of leaders Manchester City, with two games in hand.
Unbeaten City beat Reading Women 2-0 earlier on Sunday to briefly stretch their WSL lead to 13 points.
City have three league matches left, including one against Chelsea. Even if they lose that match, City need only two wins to be certain of clinching the league title.
Birmingham captain Emily Westwood:
"Those first 30 minutes were the worst we've played all season and I'd like to apologise to our fans.
"We gave the ball away inside our own half for every one of their four goals.
"We were really poor, but credit to Chelsea they were really on it today.
"In the first half they were turning us, getting in behind us, exposing our weaknesses, and we were never in it."
Chelsea forward Karen Carney:
"That was the first time we've really clicked as a team this season and it was a fantastic performance.
"All the forwards scored and I was pleased to get a goal, but I refused to celebrate out of respect for Birmingham.
"Everybody's saying the title's theirs (Manchester City) because they're 10 points clear, but we've got two games in hand and we've still got to go to their place.
"So there's no way we're giving up - we're the reigning champions and we're not going to give that up without a fight."
