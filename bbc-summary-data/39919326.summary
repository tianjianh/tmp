Property listings may contain data about the air quality in an area in the future, according to estate agents.

The National Association of Estate Agent (NAEA) said it believes the data will soon be a compulsory part of property adverts.
The move may have a significant impact on property values in city centres.
Air pollution has been linked to 40,000 early deaths in the UK, according to the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Paediatrics and Child Health.
Mark Hayward, chief executive of the NAEA, told BBC Radio London: "I think anything that would affect someone's decision whether to buy or not should be there to be seen by the public."
"What we are saying is it will now factor into somebody's wish list in terms of what and where they want to buy," he added.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has previously described declining air quality in the capital as an emergency.
In London alone 9,000 deaths each year have been linked to air pollution, according to the mayor's office.
Earlier this year, Mr Khan announced primary schools located in London's most polluted areas would receive "toxic air audits".
In January, a "very high" air pollution warning was issued in the capital for the first time under a new alert system.
The mayor has also called for the government to adopt a diesel scrappage fund to tackle air pollution in the city.
