Sealed Knot honours founder Brig Peter Young in Oxford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Historical re-enactment enthusiasts are gathering in Oxford to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of their founder, Brigadier Peter Young.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brig Young founded The Sealed Knot Society which held its first meeting at The Mitre pub on High Street in the city in 1968.
The society is recreating Civil War scenes at Trinity College on Broad Street on Saturday and Sunday.
Mike Molcher said the society had "gone from strength to strength".
Brig Young was decorated in World War Two and went on to become an expert on the English Civil War.
He formed the Sealed Knot with a group of friends following a garden party in cavalier costume to publicise the launch of a book he had written on the Battle of Edgehill.
Mr Molcher said: "The public are so fascinated by what we do - the enthusiasm and passion for this period really come through."
The society now has thousands of members worldwide who stage massed battles in period costumes and provide personnel for television and film productions.
The event in Trinity College, Oxford, recreates the period when the city was King Charles I's base during the First English Civil War.
