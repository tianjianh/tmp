Health officials are being asked to approve plans first mooted in 2013 for additional facilities at Rhyl's Royal Alexandra Hospital so they can get the final sign off by the Welsh Government.
The aim is to offer a full range of care "closer to home" and 28 beds, according to a report.
The local AM said he was pleased progress was "finally" being made.
The plan is to refurbish the existing hospital and build a community hospital on the site.
The report to Betsi Cadwaladr health board said the additional services at Rhyl could reduce impact on nearby Glan Clwyd Hospital and alleviate strain on inpatient beds at community hospitals.
"Providing medical, nursing and therapist assessments and treatments, the unit will be designed to offer patients a faster and more convenient alternative to admission to inpatient beds," said the report.
The current Grade II-listed building was originally built as a children's hospital and convalescent home in the 1890s.
The plan is to refurbish the existing facility and build a community hospital on the site with costings revised from the £22m figure estimated in 2013.
The health board has been looking to improve patient care in north Denbighshire since the closure of care beds at Prestatyn Community Hospital in 2013.
Clwyd West AM Darren Millar said: "I am extremely pleased that progress is finally being made on this development - it's been a long time coming."
Vale of Clwyd MP Dr James Davies said: "When beds were lost at the hospital back in 2009 it only added to the pressure on services at Glan Clwyd as we pointed out to the Welsh Government repeatedly. I urge Cardiff to back this project so we can finally move forward."
The health board, which meets on Thursday, is being asked to rubber stamp the outline business case so it can be passed to the Welsh Government for final approval.
Work could begin in 2018 should the plans get planning consent and final approval.
