[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sian Harkin, 54, used cheques from Llwyncelyn Infant School claiming it was for a shelter for pupils' parents.
Merthyr Crown Court was told in April she gave them to convicted fraudster Lee Slocombe who had manipulated her.
Harkin, of Pontypridd, admitted fraud, theft and forgery charges and was given a 12-month prison sentence.
A disciplinary hearing was told mother-of-two Harkin was in charge of the staff account at the school, and was arrested after an internal audit.
It ruled she had brought her "profession into disrepute".
Harkin did not attend the hearing in Cardiff.
Slocombe was jailed for three years and seven months at Newport Crown Court in February after he defrauded three families out of more than £40,000.
