The Tees Valley Airshow will take place on 29 August at Durham Tees Valley Airport for the first time since 1989.
Organisers said the it had been "prepared in full compliance" with Civil Aviation Authority requirements.
At least 11 people are thought to have died after a Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 during an aerial display at Shoreham on Saturday.
A statement from Tees Valley Airport said: "Everyone connected with the airport and the air show is obviously deeply saddened by the weekend's tragic events at Shoreham and expresses their condolences to the victims' families and friends.
"Incidents of this kind are thankfully very rare and safety is, of course, always our primary objective.
"All our procedures have been developed with and approved by the Civil Aviation Authority.
"In addition, all plans for the air show have been prepared in consultation and agreement with the local authorities."
All aircraft operators taking part in live displays have been required to produce confirmation relating to pilot qualifications, aircraft airworthiness and insurance as required by the CAA, organisers added.
