Humberside Police said the tyres of 99 vehicles were deliberately punctured between 2 and 4 September in Pocklington.
The force has appealed for help to locate a suspect they believe may be responsible. The vandalism was described as "mindless".
The man is described as white, of slim to medium build, with short, dark hair which is balding on top.
Insp Jo York said: "I believe the man is local and knows the area well.
"There is already much talk about this around Pocklington and someone in the town must know who this is, or know something about it.
"I would urge anyone who has information to come forward and share it with us so we can identify and locate the person causing this mindless vandalism that has affected so many residents in the town."
