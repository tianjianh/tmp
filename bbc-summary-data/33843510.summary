The Bundesliga club say the bus was fired at by a motorcyclist in Bielefeld in north-west Germany but added that no-one was injured.
Hertha are staying near Bielefeld before their first-round tie with German second division side Arminia Bielefeld on Monday night.
Only the driver was on board at the time of the shooting and police are now investigating.
The vehicle was travelling from the team hotel to pick the players up from Bielefeld Central Station.
Hertha say the motorcyclist had overtaken the bus and threatened the driver "with his fist", before turning and pointing a gun at the bus and the driver.
Pictures from the club show the windscreen of the bus with a bullet hole.
Hertha chief executive Michael Preetz said: "We are deeply shocked and hope that the perpetrators will be caught. Luckily our bus driver got off with a fright."
Arminia Bielefeld tweeted: "We are shocked by the attack on the team bus from HerthaBSC."
