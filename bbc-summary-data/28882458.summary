Phone hacking: Neil Wallis and Jules Stenson appear in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two more senior figures from the now closed News of the World have appeared in court accused of phone hacking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-deputy editor Neil Wallis and former features editor Jules Stenson face charges in Operation Pinetree, a police inquiry into the NoW features desk.
District Judge John Zani granted Mr Wallis and Mr Stenson unconditional bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Mr Wallis and Mr Stenson are due to appear at the Old Bailey in London for a preliminary hearing on 8 September.
They are accused of conspiring to illegally listen to voicemails with Andy Coulson, Greg Miskiw, James Weatherup, Neville Thurlbeck, Dan Evans, Ian Edmondson, Glenn Mulcaire and others unknown between January 2003 and January 2007.
The other individuals named were charged under the Metropolitan Police's main phone hacking investigation, Operation Weeting.
Mr Wallis was previously arrested in Operation Weeting in July 2011 and was told in February last year he would face no further action due to lack of evidence.
Mr Wallis, known from his Fleet Street days as the "Wolfman", was deputy to Coulson at the News of the World. He went on to become a media consultant whose clients included a Metropolitan Police commissioner and an assistant commissioner.
