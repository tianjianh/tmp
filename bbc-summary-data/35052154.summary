The 27-year-old will now remain at Hove until the end of the 2018 season.
"It's obviously great for me to have the security to go and play how I want to play," said Brown.
"It's an honour to be named vice-captain, and there is a responsibility for me to become a senior player in the group."
Brown came through Sussex's youth set-up and made his first-class debut in 2007.
The Crawley-born right-hander had a fine season with the bat in 2015, scoring 1,031 Championship runs at an average of 44.82 and hitting four centuries.
Mark Davis, who was appointed as Sussex head coach last month, described Brown as a "natural leader".
"Ben had a great season in 2015 and we're looking forward to him continuing his career with Sussex," added Davis.
"He will be of great support to Luke and a positive influence in the dressing room."
