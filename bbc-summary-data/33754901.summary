Pre-tax profit was $13.6bn (Â£8.7bn) in the first six months, compared with $12.3bn a year ago - higher than forecasts which were for $12.5bn.
The lender also announced the sale of its Brazil unit to banking giant Banco Brandesco for $5.2bn.
The move comes as it tries to reduce costs with plans to cut 50,000 jobs.
"We are executing the actions that we announced at our investor update in June and our focus is on making significant progress during the remainder of the year," the London-based bank said in a statement on Monday.
The sale of its Brazilian operations marks the bank's retreat from the second-largest emerging market, where it has about 21,000 employees.
The bank has been looking to withdraw from underperforming markets and also wants to sell its business in Turkey. It operates in 70 countries worldwide.
HSBC has also been considering moving its global headquarters from London, and confirmed a decision by its board would be made by the end of this year.
Its revenues rose by 4% to $30.8bn in the same period, with its Asian operations helping to drive earnings.
Asia accounted for nearly 70% of the bank's pre-tax profit as the firm considers moving its headquarters to Hong Kong.
HSBC's Hong Kong listed shares were up 1.4% after the results, outperforming the benchmark Hang Seng index, which is down almost 1%.
