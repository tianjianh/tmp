Wilson, 54 in the world, and in his first ranking final, extended a 6-3 interval lead to 8-4 and then 9-7.
However, Trump took it to a decider but Wilson, 23, from Kettering, held his nerve with a 75 break to prevail.
The Englishman is the lowest-ranked player to win a ranking event since 2005, and will rise to 22 in the world.
Wilson, who beat Joe Perry, Michael Holt, Ding Junhui and Mark Allen to reach the final, knocked in breaks of 71, 58 and 62 to move 6-3 ahead.
He stayed in control by winning the first frame of the second session but world number seven Trump, who beat world champion Stuart Bingham in the semi-finals, recovered with a 115 break and runs of 76, 50, 89 and 60 drew him level at 9-9.
But Wilson split the reds perfectly off the black in the decider and punched the cushion in delight as he potted the frame-clinching ball, bringing him a winners' cheque for Â£85,000.
"It's every player's dream to win his first ranking title. It will always stay in my memory," Wilson told World Snooker.
"This is my breakthrough, just like Judd had his when he won the China Open [in 2011].
"I felt like crying at the end because it means so much to me. It felt as if it was slipping away from me, so to pull through in the end was just a relief."
