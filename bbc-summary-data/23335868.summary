Plans for a Â£6m artificial surfing lake near Bristol have gone on display to the public.

The Wave wants to build the facility on land at Over Court Farm in Almondsbury and Washingpool Farm in Easter Compton.
A public consultation on the plans, which would create a freshwater lagoon on the 40 acre site, will run until 1 September.
The finalised plans will then be submitted to South Gloucestershire Council.
A spokeswoman for The Wave said if the plans were approved this year, the lake could be completed next year.
A company based in San Sebastian in Spain would create the technology needed to generate waves of up to 1.5m (5ft) high.
The Wave said it would be "joining forces" with an outdoor activity centre which already has an established business at the site.
