Plymouth Albion have appointed its first female chairman in the club's 140-year history after Ali Hannaford took on the role.

The 55-year-old businesswoman runs a food manufacturing company in nearby Newton Abbot.
"It's a real honour to be asked to become chairman of Plymouth Albion," said Hannaford.
"I'm very excited to be joining the board who have a great vision for the future development of the club."
Albion were taken over by former players Bruce Priday and Dave Venables in April and appointed Dan Parkes as their new head coach earlier this month, having sacked long-serving boss Graham Dawe.
"Ali is a very experienced business woman who has had a lot of success with a number of enterprises," said Priday.
"Ali has huge experience chairing of a number of organisations and her input into Plymouth Albion will be invaluable.
"Ali is a massive rugby fan but she will be concentrating on the governance and commercial aspects of the club.
"She is the best person I know to lead those of us involved in creating a big future for our great club."
Meanwhile Albion have agreed a new contract with lock Dan Collier and signed former London Scottish prop Sam Nixon.
Thirty-one year-old Collier played 26 times for Albion last season, scoring three tries, having returned to the club last summer after being released in 2012 following a series of injuries.
Nixon, 19, came up through London Scottish's academy and trained with the club's first team last season, but did not feature in any matches for the Championship club.
