Biowatch contains a tiny camera that takes a photo of your wrist and stores a snapshot of your blood vessels.
The watch then checks that your veins match the photo every time you put the watch on.
That could stop imposters from accessing private information on a smartwatch if they put it on.
The Swiss company developing the device said it worked correctly 999 times out of 1,000.
Biowatch is now working with smartwatch manufacturers to include its technology in future watches.
