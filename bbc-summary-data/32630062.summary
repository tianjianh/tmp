A youth zone and a new public space are planned for the building, with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) running the contest.
A panel featuring leading architects and council representatives will shortlist the five best designs.
Lancashire County Council (LCC) said the Â£13m redesign was "to make it more appealing to passengers".
The LCC and Preston Youth Zone plans include a sports hall, arts facilities and 36 bus bays.
Preston Bus Station was considered the largest bus station in Europe when it opened in 1969.
The site, which was under-threat from demolition, was given Grade II listed status in 2013.
