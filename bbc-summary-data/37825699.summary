Ex-London Rowing Club captain 'slapped woman on backside'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former captain of one of England's oldest rowing clubs poured beer over a woman before pulling up her skirt and repeatedly slapping her bottom, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alastair Main, 35 a City lawyer and ex-London Rowing Club captain, is accused of assaulting the woman at a club Christmas dinner on 16 December.
He denies racially aggravated common assault and sexual assault.
The woman, 27, said he had called her an offensive name before the assault.
Speaking behind a screen at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court, the woman said she had turned down Mr Main's request for a hug.
She told the court Mr Main followed her into a separate room, where she was crouched down rearranging her bag.
It was there, she said, he poured a beer over her,  leaving her "drenched", before calling her a "slut".
She said Mr Main then followed her to the toilets of the club, where she had gone to clean herself up, and assaulted her.
"I was in shock. He was just pulling my hair and slapping my head and pushing me around," she said.
"He pulled my skirt up, still calling me a slut, and asked me if I was wearing any knickers."
Describing the alleged assault in the toilet, prosecuting lawyer Paul Douglass said Mr Main had lifted her skirt and "smacked her approximately five times on the backside".
The woman said Mr Main then followed her out of the club, where he pushed her up against a truck.
His friend intervened and she left, the court heard.
Defence lawyer Eloise Marshall argued Mr Main had not slapped the woman after lifting the skirt and suggested she may have "exaggerated" the incident.
The woman strongly denied the allegation.
Jacqueline Grosch, a London Rowing Club member who was at the event, told the court Mr Main was "pacing around" and said the victim appeared "intimidated".
She said his demeanour on the night had been "particularly scary".
The trial was adjourned until 3 January.
Mr Main, from Kingston-Upon-Thames, was the club captain between 2013 and 2014.
