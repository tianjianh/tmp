A mound of waste, reaching 42ft high (13m) at its peak, has dominated the skyline around Moor Street, Brierley Hill for several years.
Robert McNaughton, director of Refuse Derived Fuel, was jailed for six months in December 2013 for failing to clear the site.
On Monday Dudley Council approved outline planning permission for up to 94 flats to be built on the site.
Developers are expected to meet the costs of removing the waste from the 0.83-hectare site, if detailed plans are approved at a later date.
"The clients will be dealing with taking the rubbish off the site and working with the Environment Agency to make sure everything is box-ticked," Ashley Clarke from MRC Architects, which is responsible for the new plans, said.
Local resident Geoff Clarke described it as a very "positive" step and said people in the area had suffered the sight and smell of the tip for many years.
"The waste site has been in its current state for about four years," he said.
"It's been there that long that it's started to sprout trees."
The legal action against RDF was brought by the Environment Agency.
