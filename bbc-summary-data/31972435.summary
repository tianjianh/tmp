A statement said: "Zayn has been signed off with stress and is flying back to the UK to recuperate.
"The band wish him well and will continue with their performances in Manila and Jakarta."
On Wednesday the singer declared his love for his fiancee, Little Mix star Perrie Edwards, after photos emerged of him with his arm around another woman.
The picture, which has been widely shared and published online, shows Malik with his arm around the bare stomach of a woman in a cropped top.
A second photo, taken from behind, shows Malik standing close to the woman. Their hands and arms look like they're linked.
Malik told his Twitter followers on Wednesday: "I'm 22 years old ... I love a girl named Perrie Edwards. And there's a lot of jealous [people] in this world I'm sorry for what it looks like x."
Zayn Malik along with Louis Tomlinson had faced losing more than Â£3,000 each if they were caught using, or promoting, illegal drugs in Manila.
The pair were asked to post bonds of 200,000 pesos each for a special work permit, ahead of two concerts in the Philippine capital this weekend.
It's after a video appeared last year of them both smoking what they called "a joint" in Peru.
Possession of a small amount of cannabis is not illegal there.
