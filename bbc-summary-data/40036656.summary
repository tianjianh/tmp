Smith, 30, has made 176 appearances for the Hatters, including 35 last season.
Fellow midfielder Jake Gray, 21, and striker Josh McQuoid, 27, have also been made available.
Manager Nathan Jones said he had to make tough decisions to try to improve on a season which saw them lose in the play-off semi-finals.
Jones told the club website: "I have to ask of each player; will they impact the team enough next season? Can I see them helping to take the club forward to where we want to be? We also have to be fair to the players themselves. Will they get enough football?
"My view is that they won't, so it is best that we make them available."
The Hatters had already released five players on Sunday.
