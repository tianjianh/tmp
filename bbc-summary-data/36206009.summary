A drunk man who kept lookout for a looter and then stole items himself during the Cumbria floods has appeared in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police called to Carlisle's Warwick Road area on 9 January saw Alistair Bradshaw with items taken from a shed.
The 46-year-old, of Charles Street, Carlisle, admitted burglary and was given a 12-month community order.
He had been acting as an accomplice to Martin Howlett, who was jailed in March for five years.
Bradshaw must also complete 120 hours of unpaid work.
At the city's crown court, Recorder Kevin Grice heard Bradshaw had played a "limited" role in the crime in the wake of Storm Desmond and was "very sorry".
