The wreckage was found on Friday morning, and investigators are working to determine the cause of the crash.
The six US marines and two Nepali soldiers were delivering aid near the Chinese border after Tuesday's quake.
It came as Nepal was reeling from a 7.8-magnitude earthquake on 25 April, which killed more than 8,000 people.
The helicopter had dropped off supplies in one location and was travelling to a second area shortly after the second earthquake when contact with it was lost.
Although the cause of the crash is not yet known, a nearby Indian helicopter heard radio chatter about a possible fuel problem, Pentagon spokesman Steve Warren said.
Nepal Times editor Kunda Dixit said that the helicopter wreckage was found 56km (35 miles) from Kathmandu, in an area of dense forest and rugged terrain at an altitude of 3,400m (11,200ft).
About 300 US military personnel have been participating in the Nepal relief effort, using a variety of aircraft.
Tuesday's 7.3-magnitude quake killed at least 110 people.
