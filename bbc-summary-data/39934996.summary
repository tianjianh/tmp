Danny Hollands: Eastleigh sign Crewe Alexandra midfielder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eastleigh have signed Crewe Alexandra midfielder Danny Hollands after he turned down the offer of a new contract with the League Two club.

The ex-Bournemouth, Charlton Athletic and Portsmouth man, 31, joined Crewe on a free transfer in August.
He scored once in 29 games for the Alex, taking his tally of appearances to 442 in a career which includes loans at Torquay, Swindon and Gillingham.
Hollands becomes Eastleigh's second signing of the summer.
After originally joining Crewe on a short-term deal until January, that was then extended until the end of the season.
Having missed the last two months of the campaign through injury, he was still one of seven out-of contract players offered a new deal after keeping Crewe in League Two.
But he still lives down in Hampshire and Eastleigh's offer was too good to turn down.
"He's moving back close to his Portsmouth home," Crewe boss David Artell told BBC Radio Stoke. "But that's football. It means I've got to look for another midfielder now."
Eastleigh, now under the new management pairing of former boss Richard Hill and ex-Gillingham boss Andy Hessenthaler, finished 15th in the National League last season.
