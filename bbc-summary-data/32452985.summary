The mother of the cancer fundraiser Stephen Sutton has run her first London Marathon to keep a promise she made to her son before he died.

Stephen, 19, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, died last May after launching an appeal that raised more than £5m for the Teenage Cancer Trust.
Jane Sutton said her son was a "keen runner" but his illness prevented him from completing a marathon himself.
She finished the 26-mile course in a time of six hours and three minutes.
She aims to raise £10,000 for the trust during the event.
"I am fulfilling my wish to Stephen, he has been my driving force and when I have been going out running he has been the person I am thinking about and hopefully I've got the same determination as him so I will cross that finish line," she said.
In September the trust announced £2.9m of the money raised would be invested in specialist cancer units for young people, and a further £1.2m used to train future cancer nurses and support staff.
