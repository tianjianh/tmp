Worcestershire batsman Tom Fell has signed a two-year extension to his contract.

Fell, 23, hit more than 1,000 County Championship runs in 2015 before two bouts of cancer, only getting the all-clear halfway through last season.
He has scored 2,867 first-class runs in his career, at an average of 33.72, but is averaging around half that in 2017.
"Hopefully I'm just one score away and it should all fall into place again," Fell told Worcestershire's website.
"It is a good time to be at the club. I think the future definitely looks good and it's nice to know I'm going to be a part of that future and hopefully keep taking the club forward."
Last summer, Fell won the MCC Spirit of Cricket award after signalling his foot had touched the rope when trying to stop a boundary in the County Championship match with Sussex at Hove.
His new deal comes just two days after 19-year-old paceman Josh Tongue agreed a four-year contract with the club.
