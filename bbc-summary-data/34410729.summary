Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari: 'End unruliness'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has called on Nigerians to stop their "unruly behaviour" to achieve progress.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"To bring about change, we must change ourselves by being law-abiding citizens," he said in an address to mark 55 years of independence.
Mr Buhari was a military ruler in 1984 and 1985, and ordered civil servants who were late for work to do frog jumps as he tried to impose discipline.
He returned to office in May after winning democratic elections.
Nigeria is Africa's most populous state, and the continent's main oil producer.
However, most of its citizens live in poverty, and the country often faces fuel and electricity shortages.
"Change does not just happen," Mr Buhari said in his first address to the nation since becoming president.
"We must change our unruly behaviour in schools, hospitals, market places, motor parks, on the roads, in homes and offices," he added.
He did not give any details of policies he would introduce to encourage the change of behaviour.
In the 1980s, as well as the public humiliation of civil servants, he also deployed soldiers to force Nigerians to form orderly queues while waiting for public transport.
Mr Buhari strongly defended his failure to appoint a cabinet some four months after taking office, saying he did not want to act in a "haphazard" way.
"Anyway, the wait is over. The first set of names for ministerial nominees for confirmation has been sent to the senate," he said.
The list has not yet been made public.

Buhari's to-do list
Is Buhari a changed man?
Mr Buhari said the nation would have to "face squarely" the economic crisis caused by the sharp fall in oil prices.
It would require "prudent house-keeping", and tackling corruption in the oil sector, Mr Buhari added.
He has said that he will personally keep control of the oil ministry.
Mr Buhari is the first Nigerian to become president after defeating the incumbent in elections.
He beat Goodluck Jonathan by a comfortable margin in the March polls.
