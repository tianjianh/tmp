[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derbyshire v Leicestershire: Ned Eckersley makes 158 in visitors' 619 all out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ned Eckersley's first-class best of 158 helped Leicestershire post a huge first-innings score of 619 as the batsmen dominated at Derbyshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eckersley extended his fourth-wicket stand with captain Mark Cosgrove to 239 before Cosgrove was caught in the deep off Jeevan Mendis (6-204) for 188.
Leicestershire looked set for an even bigger score at 581-4, but once Eckersley fell, the tail folded.
Derbyshire closed day two on 154-1, still trailing by 465 runs.
Leicestershire's total was their best ever against Derbyshire, surpassing the 552-6 they made at Grace Road in 2005.
The hosts will now surely have to reach the follow-on target of 470, or bat out the final two days to avoid a fourth successive County Championship defeat this season.
