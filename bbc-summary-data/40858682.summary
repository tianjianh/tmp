Reid's signing on a two-month deal was announced less than two hours before the match and he came off the bench to claim the winner.
Goalkeeper Chris Dunn was another Wrexham hero, pulling off a fine save from Robbie Tinkler in stoppage time.
The result lifts Wrexham to 10th, one place behind Gateshead on goal difference after four games.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales: "I know what Alex is all about, I spent six months with him. He's a great lad, great attitude and great desire and wants to achieve something.
"He was somebody I was interested in last season, and I had no qualms in bringing him here."
