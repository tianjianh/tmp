[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Rotherham mayor Barry Dodson was 'dirty pervert'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who claims she was attacked by a former Rotherham mayor when she was a teenager has told a court he was a "dirty pervert who liked children".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry Dodson, 67, is alleged to have assaulted the girl, then aged 13, at Boston Castle in 1987.
Sheffield Crown Court heard she came forward after Mr Dodson became the town's mayor in June 2014.
Mr Dodson, of Cranworth Road, Rotherham, denies one charge of indecent assault.
In police interviews played to the jury, the woman said she wanted people to know "what sort of man he was."
The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told officers her "life had been ruined" and she "couldn't live with it any longer".
Mr Dobson stood down from the role following the allegations and also resigned from the Labour Party, which he has represented in Rotherham East since 2000.
The trial continues.
