Strictly Come Dancing picked up best TV entertainment programme from consumer group, which champions public service broadcasting.
Other winners included Martha Kearney and Professor Brian Cox, named best radio and TV presenter respectively.

The award recognised her contribution to public service broadcasting throughout her career.
Now in its 23rd year, the awards ceremony was hosted in London by Radio 4 Today programme presenter James Naughtie.
Hit period drama Downton Abbey, which returns for its sixth and final series later this year, was the only ITV programme to win an award.
TV awards were also handed to BBC One's Countryfile, CBBC's Newsround, Springwatch and the BBC News Channel.
The News Quiz on Radio 4 won best radio drama and comedy programme, while Germany: Memories Of A Nation won best radio factual programme.
BBC World Service was also honoured, as was Radio 3's Composer Of The Week.
Neil MacGregor, who recently announced he was stepping down as director of the British Museum and has presented several TV and radio programmes on the arts, was honoured with a special award, as was TV doctor Michael Mosley.
"The wide range of nominations proposed by our members illustrate the tremendous quality and diversity to be found in UK broadcasting," said VLV chairman Colin Browne.
"Winners tell us they particularly value these awards as they are chosen by the people who really matter - engaged listeners and viewers."
