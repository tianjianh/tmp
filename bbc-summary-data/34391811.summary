Link road plans for Leeds Bradford Airport

Plans for a new link road connecting Leeds with the city's airport have been revealed.

Leeds City Council has drawn up three options for improving access to Leeds Bradford Airport.
Two proposals include building a new link road from the A65 between Rawdon and Horsforth while the third involves upgrading the existing route.
The West Yorkshire Combined Authority has earmarked Â£38m for the scheme but the costs are yet to be finalised.
A public consultation is expected to be launched in November with a view to construction starting in 2019.
Councillor Richard Lewis said a new link road would help tackle congestion, delays and the use of rat-runs on the current road network.
"We have a need for better road and rail links and a link road is clearly one we can do most easily and see the benefits," he said.
"Anyone who uses the A65 knows how congested it is. These proposals can make a considerable difference."
The first option includes building a more direct route from the A65, which runs along the east of the airport and joins the A658 Harrogate Road from the north.
The second runs to the east of Rawdon and only provides direct access to the airport where it joins Harrogate Road from the south.
The final scheme would see the existing A65 and A658 around Rawdon and Yeadon upgraded with new junctions and wider roads.
Work is expected to finish by 2022 and full details of the plan can be found on the council website.
