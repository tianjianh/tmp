[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Leyton Orient have signed Crystal Palace goalkeeper David Gregory on a 28-day loan deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old came through the Premier League club's youth academy but is yet to make his first-team debut for the Eagles.
Gregory spent time on loan at National League South side Eastbourne Borough earlier this season.
The O's moved to bring in another keeper after Charlie Grainger broke a bone in his left hand during training.
The 19-year-old will require an operation after fracturing his scaphoid and Orient say the England youth international will be out for "an indefinite period".
Grainger has made four appearances for the O's this season but has been the regular back-up to number one Alex Cisak.
