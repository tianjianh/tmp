Will Grigg swept Chris McCann's cross past Tyrell Belford to put Wigan ahead.
And the Latics romped clear after the break, with Max Power's fine 25-yard curler, Grigg's deflected strike and Sam Morsy's low drive making it 4-0.
Nicky Ajose slotted a consolation for Swindon, who had Nathan Thompson sent off for a reckless challenge late on.
Wigan remain second in League One, three points behind leaders Burton but having played a game more than their promotion rivals, while Swindon are 14th.
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell told BBC Radio Manchester:

"It's never perfect - it was very close. I thought first half we played very well and we contained them.
"These are a difficult side to prepare to play against. If you don't work hard against them, then they'll punish you.
"Second half we were devastating for 15 minutes."
