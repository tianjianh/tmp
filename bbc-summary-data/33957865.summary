United Utilities issued a warning on 6 August after traces of cryptosporidium were found at the Franklaw water treatment works near Preston.
The boiling water notice will not be lifted until the supply is clear.
The company said it is starting to use ultra violet light to get rid of the remaining contamination.
Gary Dixon, United Utilities customer services director, said it had isolated the source of the outbreak but declined to give further details.
The Drinking Water Inspectorate, which was alerted to the problem on 5 August,  said a criminal investigation into the contamination is taking place.
The areas affected include Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble, Wyre and the Mellor area of Blackburn.
Mr Dixon said: "There are still traces of cryptosporidium in the water, but they are very, very low.
"We are bringing in rigs which put ultra violet light on the water, which kills the parasite.
"We are going to do that in a targeted way along the Fylde Coast."
The company is testing the water every day after 2,500 miles of pipeline was affected.
On Wednesday it confirmed customers would receive compensation but it did not specify the amount.
