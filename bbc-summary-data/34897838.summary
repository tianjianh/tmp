A man is attempting to put together two football teams in a bid to break the world record for the longest match.

Mike Standing, of West Sussex, wants to raise money in memory of his friend Matt Chaplain, who died from a cardiac arrest in 2013 at the age of 38.
The world record for the longest 11-a-side match was set at 105 hours, in Edinburgh in July.
Mr Standing, from Worthing, hopes the game will be played in May.
So far, he has recruited about 10 players to his Heartbeat FC teams but would like at least 36.
"Many of those are playing throughout the season so if anything happens to one of them and they pick up an injury during that time it means we have got someone to take their place," he said.
Mr Chaplain left a wife and two young children - one of whom is hoping to take part in the charity game in aid of the British Heart Foundation.
The final score for the game in Edinburgh, played in memory of the late Falkirk defender Craig Gowans, was 774-707. It raised more than Â£120,000.
"It would be fantastic if we could equal that," said Mr Standing.
"I had the idea for this game several years ago but Matt's passing gave us a determined focus for it.
"Back when I had the idea initially the record was around 48 hours so it would have been an easier task to achieve."
Mr Standing hopes the game will be played at Lancing College over the spring bank holiday weekend.
