West Ham United 1-0 Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Noble's first-half strike earned West Ham their first Premier League win in seven games as they beat Burnley at London Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It looked like the Hammers would go into the break without anything to show for their dominance, but in stoppage time they won a spot-kick when Ben Mee brought down Winston Reid.
He is a miracle. What he gives to the team is massive
Up stepped Noble. His initial kick was saved low by Tom Heaton but he kept his composure to tuck in the rebound.
Noble and Pedro Obiang both struck the woodwork with brilliant shots and Burnley's Matt Lowton produced a goal-saving block to deny Aaron Cresswell.
The Clarets improved markedly after the break. Keeper Darren Randolph made a great one-handed save to keep out Scott Arfield's free-kick and Sam Vokes headed over with the goal gaping.
Victory lifted the Hammers four points clear of the relegation zone and up to 15th in the table.

Reaction to Wednesday's other Premier League games
Throw the ball into the box and Andy Carroll will get his head to it.
It is a simple tactic that has worked in the past and will continue to pay dividends for West Ham if they can keep their 6ft 4in bulldozer fit.
The 27-year-old Geordie striker made his first start since August after recovering from a knee injury, and bullied the Clarets defence during the 83 minutes he played.
He only managed one header on target, and should have done better with another after just two minutes. However, his big strength is the ability to pull two defenders away, allowing his team-mates more space.
The Hammers have missed their target man immensely - can they keep him fit for the rest of the season?
Had the Clarets played the first half with the same conviction they showed in the second then there might have been a different outcome.
Manager Sean Dyche's side were a different proposition after the break. Cresswell cleared from the goal-line with Vokes ready to stab in, before the striker inexplicably headed over from six yards with an open goal in front of him.
And 17 minutes before full-time, Randolph pulled off a great save to prevent Arfield's low free-kick from creeping in.
It was an improvement, but again not good enough.
Burnley are five points clear of the relegation zone, but that is now only one point from a possible 20 away from home this season. They need to start picking up on their travels or they will face another scrap for survival.

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "It was a very important game for us. It was a very long game - the longest game we've been involved in.
"Well done to the players, we showed the character. I think we deserved it. We dominated the first half and we had shots that hit the post. We should have been ahead by more than one goal looking at the quantities of chances."
Bilic on striker Carroll: "It's no secret I'm a big fan of him. I'm not a big fan because he's a cousin or relative. It's what I see on the training pitch. He is a miracle. What he gives to the team is massive."

Burnley manager Sean Dyche on the penalty: "I'm frustrated we can't get the decision. It's a clear foul on our keeper Tom Heaton [in the build up].
"Every other keeper in the league would have gone down and flailed around on the ground.
"Ours does it the proper way and that used to be applauded. Now we are called naive. But we'll stick to what we believe in."
He added: "The reality of the Premier League is that it's tough. We took the game on in the second half.
"We have to bring the mentality of our home displays to away games. In the first half we didn't take responsibility of a game that could have gone our way. There was a strange feeling here today and we didn't capitalise on that until the second half."
Burnley have another away trip to London - this time at Tottenham on Sunday (16:00 GMT) and West Ham are at home to Hull on Saturday (15:00)
