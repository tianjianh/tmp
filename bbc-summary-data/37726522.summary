The girl band notched up 95,000 combined sales to score the fourth UK number one of their careers, following Cannonball, Wings and Black Magic.
The four-piece, who are the only group to have ever won The X Factor, knocked James Arthur's Say You Won't Let Go down to number two.
Arthur also won the ITV singing competition in 2012 - the year after Little Mix.
The girl group told the Official Charts Company: "Everyone can relate to this song. Everyone's had an ex or a bad relationship and this is a big positive break up anthem."
Closer, by the Chainsmokers featuring Halsey, and Starboy by The Weeknd featuring Daft Punk, both dropped a place to numbers three and four respectively.
Actress Hailee Steinfeld's debut single Starving - a collaboration with Grey and Zedd - climbed 12 places to break into the top five for the first time.
On the albums chart, the top five was made up entirely of new entries - although fourth placed Oasis's Be Here Now was originally released in 1997 before being reissued last week.
Kings of Leon scored their fifth consecutive number one with WALLS - which stands for We Are Like Love Songs.
Phil Collins' collection The Singles debuted at number two, while former Keane singer Tom Chaplin landed at number three with his debut solo album The Wave.
Two Door Cinema Club's Gameshow rounded off the top five, while last week's number one album by Green Day dropped to number six.
Further down the album chart, Rebecca Ferguson scored her fourth top 10 album with Superwoman, which landed at number seven.
US country-rock group Blackberry Smoke entered at number eight, while Katie Melua scored her seventh top 10 studio album with In Winter, which debuted at number nine.
