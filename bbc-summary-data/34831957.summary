Ospreys gave Exeter 'kick in the pants' in Champions Cup

Exeter head coach Rob Baxter says his side must improve after their 25-13 European Champions Cup loss at Ospreys.

The Chiefs led 10-6 at half time, but 14 points from Dan Biggar and a try from former Exeter player Josh Matavesi saw the Welsh side get the win.
"Sometimes what a team needs when it's on a winning run is a loss to give it a kick in the pants, and we've royally received a kick in the pants," he said.
"I've no doubt that we'll bounce back from this, we're a good side."
The defeat ended an excellent run for the Chiefs, which has seen them move up to second in the Premiership after bonus-point wins over London Irish and Newcastle, as well as victory over fellow high-flyers Leicester.
"That wasn't an Exeter Chiefs performance," Baxter added on BBC Radio Devon.
"We didn't look full of verve, full of fight and full of steely discipline, we got a little bit ragged a little too often and ultimately we paid the price.
"For a large part of the game it should have been the Ospreys under pressure with the scoreboard like that, but we never played like they were the team under pressure, we looked like the team under pressure for the whole game."
