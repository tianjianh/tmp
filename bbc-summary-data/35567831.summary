The victory also enabled them to set a new club record of 21 games unbeaten.
Danny Wright hit the winner, his eighth goal in six games, after just three minutes, when he smashed home Asa Hall's cross.
Tranmere were the last team to beat Cheltenham in the league in September, but they could not repeat that as their own five-match unbeaten run ended.
Cheltenham remain four points clear of Forest Green, with Tranmere in fourth place.

"It was a great win but a historic win as well, so I'm pleased for this group of lads that we've all got our names in the record books.
"You can't just pick up these points, you've got to go and earn them and we had to earn it today.
"I thought we were magnificent in the first half and maybe should've had one or two more.
"Our defending's been very strong and one-nil is a one-nil - I'd have liked it to be two-nil, but it's great for our supporters to see another win from their team and no goals against."
