The Ghana captain, 25, joined the Swans in June having spent his career so far at French club Marseille.
He made an early impact with a goal in a 2-2 draw at the champions on the Premier League's opening weekend.
"The Swansea players have really helped me out. They're really helping me to prove what I can do and they're pushing me," said Ayew.

"I feel at home already. I know with a few games to come I will get better and better as I get to know the league and the players.
"Marseille was a whole different thing for me. I grew up there, went to the academy, so it was home.
"Here is a different league, a different challenge."
A former BBC African Footballer of the Year with 62 caps for Ghana, Ayew was the Swansea's highest-profile signing of the summer.
His composed finish against Chelsea helped Swansea earn a creditable draw at Stamford Bridge.
"We had a good result. We knew what we were coming for and we managed to get what we wanted," he added.
"We showed a lot of quality and spirit. We worked as a team.
"What's important is that Swansea move forward. We will work hard because we know the season is long."
