[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Spanish football federation has suspended Mourinho for an incident that occurred towards the end of the Supercopa match between the sides.
Barcelona assistant Tito Vilanova was banned for one match for slapping Mourinho during a brawl.
Three players were sent off in the tie, won 3-2 by Barcelona, on 17 August.
Madrid duo Marcelo and Mezut Ozil and Barca's David Villa were dismissed as the Catalan side won 3-2 to take the trophy 5-4 on aggregate.
As players scrapped on the field, television pictures showed former Chelsea manager Mourinho walking over to Vilanova, manager Pep Guardiola's assistant, and poking him in the eye.
Mourinho later issued a letter apologising for his behaviour, but only to Madrid supporters.
Barcelona said immediately after the game that they would not report Mourinho, but the Spanish federation intervened.
