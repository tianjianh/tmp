Sweden won 1-0 against South Africa in the opener, before host nation Brazil beat China 3-0.
Plenty of empty seats could be seen in the 60,000 venue at kick-off, although more fans arrived before Brazil's game.
The football tournament has started two days before Friday's opening ceremony because of a packed schedule.
More than 11,000 athletes will compete in the first edition of the Olympic Games to be held in South America.
There are 42 Olympic sport disciplines, with 306 events over the course of 19 days of competition.
Football is the only sport that will be staged at venues across the country.
Sweden, who are ranked sixth in the world, secured the first win of the tournament when Nilla Fischer bundled in a second-half goal after a goalkeeping mistake.

Brazil, who lost at the quarter-final stage of the London 2012 Games, were comfortable winners with goals from Monica, Andressa Alves and Cristiane.
Striker Marta - who did not add to her 102 goals in 104 caps - said: "Scoring three times against a team like China, with all the pressure we had, I think it's super-perfect."
