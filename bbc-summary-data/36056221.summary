Employees at Cooplands, in the Carlton Centre, Lincoln, closed the store in protest over the issue on Thursday.
Store manager Katie Shipman said she was owed Â£1,400 and had not been paid for five weeks.
A spokesman for Cooplands, which employs more than 175 people, admitted it was in arrears but said it hoped to resolve the matter within two months.
Ms Shipman said: "Me and my staff were just fed up of being behind in our wages.
"We started off getting 50% of our wages every week and then it was down to 25% and now we're only getting about 20% of our wages each week.
"It's a nightmare because you can't plan anything."
Cooplands went into administration in February last year with the loss of 303 jobs and the closure of 39 retail stores, together with the bakery and head office in Doncaster.
However, 41 retail stores stayed open following a buyout by restructuring firm ReSolve.
A spokesman for Cooplands said it "massively regrets" the situation and apologised for any hardship caused to any of its staff
He said: "We are in arrears with paying wages. However everybody gets paid something every week and there is no suggestion that wages won't get paid.
"The situation is improving as business performance improves and within two months we expect all wages to be paid up to date."
