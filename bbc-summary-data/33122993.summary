Republic of Ireland: Martin O'Neill not giving up on Euro 2016 place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Martin O'Neill says he has not given up on qualifying for Euro 2016 despite seeing his Republic of Ireland side held to a 1-1 draw by Scotland.

The result means Ireland have not won any of their last four Group D fixtures and they stay in fourth place, two points behind their Dublin opponents.
"We wanted to get ahead of Scotland and they will be delighted to go away with something on the board," said O'Neill.
"But there is still a distance to go and we have not given up on this."
O'Neill felt the Republic had dominated the first half and had been unlucky to see Shaun Maloney's shot deflecting in off skipper John O'Shea for the equaliser early in the second.
"We had been dominant and did not want half-time to come," added the Republic manager.
"Their goal was poor for us. The shot looked like it was going miles wide before hitting John O'Shea and going in.
"That put us on the back foot for about 10 minutes and Scotland had their best spell of the game.
"But we fought back well and piled on a little pressure and I felt we were going to win it in the end."
