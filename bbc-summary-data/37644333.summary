[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colwyn Bay crematorium to provide online funerals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Conwy county crematorium has started offering mourners the chance to watch funerals online if they cannot make a service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colwyn Bay crematorium will run a webcast for absent family and friends so they can still pay their respects.
Conwy council said the move will make services more accessible and "give people the opportunity to pay their respects, wherever they may be".
CD and DVD recordings of services are also going to be available to buy.
