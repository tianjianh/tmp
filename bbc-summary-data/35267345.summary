The 26-year-old has previously worked with Terrors boss Mixu Paatelainen at club and international level.
"I've known the head coach for many years and have worked with him for a long time," Riski told the United website.
"I look forward to working with him and I see this as a great challenge."
Riski says he is not alarmed by Dundee United's precarious Scottish Premiership position, 11 points adrift at the foot of the table.
"I follow the Premiership and the situation the club finds itself in doesn't scare me," he said. "I know what we have to do as a team and I will give my all every week.
"The football culture in Scotland is so strong and I am excited about testing myself in this environment. I relish the opportunity to perform for Dundee United and help the club go forward."
Riski should be included in Paatelainen's squad for Saturday's Scottish Cup tie against Airdrieonians.
