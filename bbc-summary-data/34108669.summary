Djilobodji, 26, has agreed a four-year contract at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho turned his attention to the 6ft 4in centre-back after failing to sign England's John Stones from Everton.
Centre-back Hector, 23, has agreed a five-year deal but will spend the rest of the season at the Championship club.
Djilobodji was in the last year of his contract and had made 183 appearances for Nantes after joining them in 2010.
"I'm very happy to sign for a big club like Chelsea and I want to do my best to help the team win titles. I want to thank the club for giving me this opportunity," he said.
Mourinho has moved to address the Premier League champions' defensive concerns after they conceded nine goals in their first four league games.
That has left them eight points behind leaders Manchester City before they return to action at Everton on 12 September.
Jamaica international Hector, a boyhood Chelsea supporter, began his career in the youth team at Millwall and moved to Reading's academy in 2009.
Earlier in the day, Chelsea agreed a new four-year deal with winger Victor Moses, 24, and sent him on loan to West Ham for the season.
