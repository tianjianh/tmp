NI eel fishery hopes to repeat open day success

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Until recently, very few people knew what went on inside the largest eel fishery in Europe.

But this time last year, an unexpected 3,000 people turned up to attend the first ever open day of the fishery in Toomebridge, County Antrim.
More are expected later this month, when the fishery again plays host to the River to Lough Festival.
"Not many people in Northern Ireland know about the fishery and many of those who do, don't actually know what goes on inside," said Eimear Kearney, marketing manager with the Lough Neagh Partnership.
"In 2014, we held an open day in case anyone was curious. We didn't expect many to turn up, but more than 3,000 people came along.
"They were able to tour the factory, learn about the lough, the history of the industry and the fishermen.
"For 2015, there will also be cookery demonstrations, an eel exhibition, storytelling, traditional boat displays and much more."
In a first for any Northern Ireland food product, Lough Neagh eels were awarded EU protected name-status (PGI - Protected Geographical Indication) in September 2011.
The prestigious recognition has previously been awarded to products such as Scotch whisky, Parma ham, Roquefort cheese and champagne.
The eels have since been joined by Northern Ireland's Comber potato and Armagh bramley apple as products that have been successful in securing PGI status.
More than 500 tonnes of Lough Neagh eel and eel products are exported to London's Billingsgate Market, Holland, Germany and the Far East from the factory every year.
Although eel fishing on Lough Neagh began thousands of years ago, in the early 1960s the rights to the industry were controlled by a consortium of Dutch and English merchants.
Local fishermen had to sell eels to the consortium at whatever price it determined and families who had fished for generations watched their livelihoods evaporate.
In 1963, Fr Oliver Kennedy was approached by fishermen from his parish of Duneane in Toome, for advice on how they might change things so that they could earn a living from the lough.
Fr Kennedy was originally from Andersonstown in west Belfast and knew nothing about eels, but was extremely concerned and felt he had to do something.
In 1965, the Lough Neagh Fishermen's Co-Operative Society (LNFCS) was formed with Fr Kennedy appointed as its chairman.
The co-op began raising money to buy shares in the London-based consortium.
By 1971, they had accumulated enough shares to buy the company out and take control of fishing rights.
Fr Kennedy continued to lead the co-op until his death on 7 August 2013, at the age of 83.
Lough Neagh eels begin their lives in the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic Ocean.
During autumn, elvers (young eels) travel with the Gulf Stream to the estuary at the mouth of the River Bann.
In spring many of them swim upstream aided by special elver ladders at sluices and weirs.
To ensure that as many elvers as possible reach Lough Neagh the LNFCS collect as many as they can and transport them for direct release into the lough.
The eels mature in Lough Neagh for 11-14 years after which they descend the river as silver eels to return to the Sargasso Sea to spawn.
The LNFCS harvest as many of these silver eels as possible using fixed traps at Toome, Portna and Movanagher.
There is a 'Queen's gap' at each eel trap to allow a proportion of eels to escape.
Adds Ms Kearney: "If you've never tasted eel before, the festival is the perfect opportunity."
As well as cookery demonstrations, there will be a restaurant serving a traditional eel supper from noon until 16:00 BST.
The River to Lough Festival takes place on Saturday 29 August.
