Fewster, 20, spent seven months on loan at York in last season, while Heardman, 20, trained with the Pools last week.
Pools manager Craig Hignett previously managed Fewster during the forward's time with Boro's under-13s.
"I know what Craig is all about and I knew when he went to York last season that he would do well and score some goals," Hignett told the club website.
"He's a finisher who comes alive in the box, his movement is good and he's a bit different from the other options we have in the squad so I'm delighted to get him.
"Both Tom and Brad are really hungry to prove themselves and that's one of the big qualities I look for in players."
