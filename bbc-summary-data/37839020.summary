The 26-year-old, who made his limited-overs international debut in June, came through Hampshire's academy.
He scored over 1,300 runs in all formats for Hampshire last season at an average of 45.19 and took 47 wickets.
"The club have shown faith in me which is great," he said. "Having been here since I was 10-years-old, to sign a new long-term deal is great."
Dawson's busy winter schedule continues on Wednesday when he flies out to play in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).
He will join Rangpur Riders in the T20 tournament having taken up a late offer despite advice from the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) not to travel to the country independently.
"I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go and play in the BPL," he told BBC Radio Solent.
Should the Riders reach the final, Dawson would be in Bangladesh until mid-December, just weeks after being involved with England's ODI squad in the same country.
The right-handed batsman and slow left-arm bowler is also be hoping to be selected in England's limited-overs squad to face India in January.
"I'd like to think I've done enough with my performances in the nets while in Bangladesh," Dawson added. "If I do get selected for India and play, I'm sure I'll do myself proud.
"It's a busy winter, I'm fit enough to take care of it. But, it does take its toll mentally being away from home for a long time.
"But, it's something you're paid to do and you love doing too. It's not going to go on forever, so while it does, I'll enjoy it."
