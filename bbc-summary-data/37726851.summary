The device was discovered on an eastbound Jubilee Line train at North Greenwich in south-east London, at about 11:00 BST on Thursday.
Members of the Met's bomb squad carried out the explosion, after the device was described as looking "real enough".
The Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command is leading inquiries.
The TSSA union's general secretary Manuel Cortes, said: "It appears London Underground are stepping up their efforts to reassure staff. We very much welcome this.
"However, details of what actually happened yesterday are incredibly sketchy. That's why we are calling for a security summit involving our union elected representatives, the British Transport Police, the Metropolitan police, the transport commissioner, the mayor's office and senior London Underground management.
"This is the procedure followed after the terrible terror attacks on 7/7 and the tragic shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes and our members wish to stick to this tried and tested security format."
North Greenwich station, which serves the O2 Arena, was evacuated but reopened at about 18:50 BST.
In a statement on Thursday, the Met said: "Specialist officers from the Met and [British Transport Police] are in attendance and a controlled detonation has since taken place to ensure the item is safe.
"While we are keeping an open mind, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is leading the investigation because it has the expertise to deal with incidents of this kind."
Canadian rock band Nickelback were performing at the O2 Arena despite the disruption on the Jubilee Line.
In a statement, the O2 said it remained open for the performance and urged people to also use other forms of transport such as the Thames Clippers, the DLR to Royal Victoria and the Emirates Airline to North Greenwich.
The current threat level for international terrorism in the UK is severe - meaning an attack is "highly likely".
