Q&A;: Political lobbying and rules for MPs and peers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What constitutes lobbying in Parliament and what are the rules governing it?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three peers and an MP have been accused of being prepared to break the rules on lobbying in Parliament.
MP Patrick Mercer resigned the Conservative whip after claims by BBC's Panorama that he broke Parliament's lobbying rules by accepting Â£4,000 to lobby for business interests in Fiji.
Mr Mercer, who was approached by a fake company set up by the programme, denies wrongdoing, saying he took the money for consultancy work outside Parliament and has referred himself to the Parliamentary standards commissioner.
Separately, two Labour peers have been suspended and one Ulster Unionist member of the House of Lords has resigned the whip after allegedly agreeing to do parliamentary work for payment in contravention of the rules. Lord Cunningham, Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate and Lord Laird all deny any wrongdoing.
Lobbying in order to influence political decisions is widely regarded as a legitimate part of the democratic process. Lobbyists are firms or individuals that are paid to influence such decisions.
They are often former politicians or ex-civil servants who have developed personal contacts with those in power.
Alternatively, individuals. firms, charities and other groups can lobby on their own, without paying professional lobbyists.
There has long been concern that, if unregulated, lobbyists will begin to wield an unhealthy level of influence over political decision-making. This, it is argued, could mean the corruption of peers and MPs and undermine democracy.
Before the 2010 election, future Prime Minister David Cameron said lobbying was "the next big scandal waiting to happen".
The coalition agreement, which set out the government's programme in 2010, said: "We will regulate lobbying through introducing a statutory register of lobbyists and ensuring greater transparency."
However, the policy has not yet made it into the government's legislative programme. There was no mention of it in the last Queen's Speech, but ministers say they are consulting on plans.
Cabinet Minister Francis Maude has hinted that a new law could be introduced within the next year.
All MPs, including ministers, are subject to a code of conduct when it comes to their outside interests and dealings.
They have to register their financial interests, including remunerated employment outside Parliament.
They are allowed to work as a consultant or be paid for advice.
However, they are forbidden from acting as a "paid advocate" - taking payment for speaking in the House; asking a parliamentary question, tabling a motion, introducing a bill or tabling or moving an amendment to a motion or bill or urging colleagues or ministers to do so.
They can:
They must:
In addition, ministers must comply with guidelines when they leave office:
The House of Lords Code of Conduct, which says peers must show "selflessness", "openness" and "accountability", states they have to:
It also advises that peers "should be especially cautious in deciding whether to speak or vote in relation to interests that are direct, pecuniary and shared by few others".
Peers, unlike MPs, are paid expenses rather than a salary, and are allowed to give general advice and act as consultants if this does not influence their behaviour.
It is the job of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to look into complaints against MPs. The commissioner reports to the Committee on Standards, which then decides on a course of action to take against an MP, including recommending suspension from the Commons, if this is necessary.
MPs vote on whether to implement the recommendations.
For peers, the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards looks at allegations. The report goes to the Sub-Committee on Lords' Conduct, which reviews the findings and can recommend a punishment to the Committee for Privileges and Conduct. Peers have a right of appeal against this.
The final decision on punishment is made by the House of Lords as a whole.
