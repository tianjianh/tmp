Which pop band did Olympic diver Tom Daley audition for?
And who thought it was a good idea to send their mum on a weight-loss course for their birthday?
The two sporting idols spoke to Clare Balding for her new BBC Two show - and here's 10 things you probably didn't know about either of them.

Tom Daley misses British food
"The food in Dubai is great, but you know things like bangers and mash - I just miss all that kind of stuff.
Lewis Hamilton was stopped by police... for thinking he was Lewis Hamilton
"I've been pulled over by the police one time just because my car was making too much noise and he pulled up alongside me and goes, 'Who do you think you are? Lewis Hamilton?'. He got to the window as he was saying it and he was like, 'Oh, have a good night'."
Whereas Tom isn't driving at all
"Since I moved to London my mum's got my car. I just get on the Tube, get on my way and just go. I read a book. At the moment I'm reading The Hunger Games in Spanish."
Lewis can dive from the top board
"My mum used to work at the local pool and for my eighth birthday we had a pool party. And then this professional diver came over and took me to the top. I'd have to hug him, hold on and he did a back flip with me on him.

"It was sick! It was so cool. I never did it again, obviously."
And he had a Blue Peter badge at the age of five...
"I was racing radio-controlled cars in the garden, but I've been on since."
While Tom is less of an all-rounder
"PE at school - I was terrible. Literally, anything with hand and eye coordination, funnily enough - terrible. I can't throw, catch, kick a ball in a straight line. Terrible."
...although he came close to musical fame and fortune
"Yeah, I auditioned for S Club Juniors. I did, I was only like nine when I did. I think I sang Reach For The Stars."
Lewis pushes his rivals to bizarre behaviour - team-mate Nico Rosberg wore a sanitary towel on his head
"Very, very weird. I wouldn't usually defend that kind of thing; I would never use it no matter what. But in the Malaysian Grand Prix it is so hot, it's like you're doing a work out in the sauna for almost two hours - it's a killer. But after five laps sweat was coming down in my eyes and it was stinging."

Tom buys rubbish presents
"It was my mum's birthday so I went back down to Plymouth to surprise her. This is going to sound really bad, but I got her a four-day weight loss boot camp. She appreciated it, I think."
And Lewis isn't much smoother at birthday celebrations
"I was lucky enough to get invited to Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday in London and it was really cool because I arrived and I was on his table.
"I was two spots away from him. I had Oprah sitting here, which is crazy. But I noticed that Will Smith was there and I'm a big fan of the Fresh Prince, so I was like, 'I want to meet Will.'
"When everyone starting standing up I was rushing to go meet Will and as I was barging past people. I stood really heavily on someone's foot, I turned back and it was Bill Clinton. I didn't even apologise - I just kept going."
