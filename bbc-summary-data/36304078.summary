The number of students seeking help with mental health issues has risen by almost 50%, according to new figures.

NUS Scotland obtained the figures for the last four years to 2014/15 through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.
The union said the statistics were "incredibly worrying" and urged politicians to act swiftly.
Only five of Scotland's colleges have full-time counsellors, with others relying on external help or ad hoc support services.
The figures, released during Mental Health Awareness Week, suggested a 47% increase in students inquiring about mental health services.
They also showed a 39% increase in students going on to receive counselling.
The FOI requests highlighted a 21% increase in the number of counselling staff at Scottish institutions over the four-year period and a 38% rise in national spending on counselling services to more than Â£2.8m.
The union's president Vonnie Sandlan said: "We cannot let the progress we've made in mental health support and awareness go to waste.
"There must now be a real concerted effort to ensure that universities and colleges have the necessary funding to help every student access the support services they need."
NUS Scotland has launched a website offering information and support for affected students.
