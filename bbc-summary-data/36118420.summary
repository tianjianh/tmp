[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 0-2 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United won at Carlisle but their bid for automatic promotion to League One will be decided on the final day of the season as Bristol Rovers beat York.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victory could have taken the Us up had Rovers lost, but Oxford's fate remains in their own hands as they stay third.
Chris Maguire fired Oxford ahead from the spot just four minutes in when he was fouled in the box by Luke Joyce.
Jack Stacey's wide shot was the closest Carlisle came to drawing level but Liam Sercombe's strike sealed victory.
The result means Oxford remain in third place after Accrington won 1-0 against Wycombe while Carlisle slip two places to 12th in the League Two table.
Oxford face Wycombe in their final game of the season on 7 May and will need to match Bristol Rovers' result or, if Accrington lose, draw to secure promotion back to the third-tier for the first time since 2001.
