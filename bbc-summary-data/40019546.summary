Twenty-two people were killed and 59 injured when a suicide bomber struck at an Ariana Grande gig on Monday night.
A minute's silence was held as crowds spilled out on to nearby roads.
Lord Mayor of Manchester, Eddy Newman, began the vigil by thanking the emergency services, which prompted huge applause.
He said: "The people of Manchester will remember the victims forever and we will defy the terrorists by working together to create cohesive, diverse communities that are stronger together.
"We are the many, they are the few."
The Bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev David Walker, lit a candle at the vigil, which began at 18:00 BST.
Senior figures including Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Speaker John Bercow joined Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham on stage.
Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said he was heartened to hear the acts of kindness from emergency service workers and normal people.
He said: "The people of Greater Manchester showed the people of the world how much we care, how much we care about one another, and how much we care for those in need."
He also thanked "the rest of the world for holding us in their thoughts".
Tony Lloyd, former Police and Crime Commissioner and interim mayor for Greater Manchester, said: "We're not going to accept evil acts dividing us.
"You can see throngs of people have come out to pay their respects... but in the end it's the resolution that says 'we're not prepared to be divided'."
Mr Lloyd said "we pride ourselves on our diversity" and that diversity can not be "challenged by one evil individual".
"We'll get through this because that is the spirit of Manchester."
Less than 24 hours after the worst terrorist attack in Manchester's history, its people came together to remember the 22 victims who went to enjoy one of the city's favourite pastimes - going to a gig - but never came home.
Basked in early evening sunshine, the mood in Albert Square was sombre but strong. Manchester is a city of glorious, rebellious positivity and thousands were here to make that point in front of the world's press.
While some had come to simply pay their respects to those killed and injured by an appalling act, others also wanted to stand firm in the face of horror.

Members of the Manchester Sikh Community were providing free refreshment, having arrived in Albert Square singing and receiving a round of applause.
They said they will be giving out food "to help the city at a time when things are bad".
Lu Bowen, 40, brought flowers to lay as a mark of respect, and said it has been a "horrific" day but said she wanted to show a sense of "solidarity and commitment that Manchester always has".
Standing alongside her teenage daughter Lucy, she said: "We watched it all unfold last night.
"When the chips are down, Manchester always pulls together."
Africa Hart, 25, from Manchester, said she and her friends wanted to attend the vigil to show solidarity and demonstrate that "love trumps hate."
Roads around Albert Square will be closed from 17:00 BST until about 19:00 BST.
Vigils were also held in cities across the UK, including in Belfast and Glasgow where people held posters which said: "We stand together. Manchester."
Barbara Anderson, 66, said she attended a vigil in Birmingham with her daughter Carol Cockerill and granddaughter Lauren.
"I was gutted when I heard the news - we have family in Manchester and I needed to make sure they were safe," Ms Anderson said.
However, the event was cut short when police arrested a man.
Superintendent Andy Parsons said: "The man was carrying a bag, and as a precaution Victoria Square where the vigil was being held was cleared for around 15 minutes.
"A small axe was recovered along with a large stick."
Hundreds of people gathered at Newcastle's Monument in a vigil for people of "all faiths or none".
Northumbria Police said there was no specific threat to the city, but had put extra armed officers on the streets to reassure the public.
Newcastle Council leader Nick Forbes said the Manchester attack "could have happened in any of our cities".
