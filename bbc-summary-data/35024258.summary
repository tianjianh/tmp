Power has been restored to all homes in north Wales after heavy rain and wind left 700 without power on Saturday.

Around 70 homes were still cut off from the grid on Sunday as engineers worked round the clock to reconnect them.
Improving conditions later on Sunday enabled them to reach the last of the affected homes.
Rescue team members from Gwynedd, Vale of Glamorgan, Bridgend, Anglesey, Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Neath Port Talbot and Denbighshire had helped.
Meanwhile, specialist flood rescue lifeboat volunteers from the RNLI in Wales have been helping with evacuation efforts in storm-hit Cumbria.
Chris Missen, a volunteer from Porthcawl, Bridgend county, who arrived with others early on Sunday, called the conditions "unprecedented".
"We've probably assisted 200 people since we arrived in Carlisle and there are at least another 200 who still need our help," he said.
"The scale of this isn't like anything I've seen before, it's relentless. I've been involved in six other flood rescue operations with the RNLI and this is by far the worst."
