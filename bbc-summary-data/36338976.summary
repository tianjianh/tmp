The Red Devils have not won major silverware since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.
However, United - who finished fifth in the Premier League - could end the season with a trophy by beating Crystal Palace in the FA Cup on Saturday.
"This club is going to be fighting for titles," Mata told BBC Sport.
"Manchester United is all about winning and having that mentality and winning in style. I am sure this club is going to be fighting for trophies again."
Mata accepted failure to qualify for the Champions League next season was a disappointment but believes there have been positives to take from the current campaign.
The Spain international highlighted the emergence of Marcus Rashford, who has scored eight goals in 17 appearances for the club, and the form of Â£36m signing Anthony Martial as reasons to be optimistic.
"They are both exciting players," added Mata, 28.
"Anthony has done great since the first day he arrived at the club. He has been very important for us. He is showing his talent to everyone in the world.
"Marcus is very good news for the club. We had some injuries and then the manager believed in someone who had come through from the academy.
"It is very important to grow in your confidence at the start of your career. He is Manchester born. He has known the club since he was a kid. We are very happy for him."
