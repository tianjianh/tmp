Jake Taylor and Lee Holmes went close for Exeter early on before Taylor was set-up by young striker Ollie Watkins for his second goal in three games.
Exeter's Bobby Olejnik saved well from Liam McAlinden soon after the break while Shamir Fenelon and Sonny Bradley were also denied by the Austrian.
But Watkins got his fourth goal in six games to seal the win late on.
The 20-year-old powerfully headed in Taylor's cross as Exeter moved up to 11th place - five points off the play-offs - while Crawley stay 16th.
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"I think they showed what a good side they were, particularly in the first half, and we didn't set out not to make tackles or not to stay with runners.
"But I felt the goal was coming, as did the crowd by the sounds of it, we didn't take enough warning from it and we didn't stay with our men properly.
"We watched them and without Matt Harrold in the team we just felt we needed to be a little more solid in the middle of the park. I thought we gave them a right game and their keeper made four or five really good saves."
