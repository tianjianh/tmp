The duo won album of the year for Gift, their first joint record, picking up an extra prize for best traditional track.
Carthy accepted the award on behalf of her mother, who has been in intensive care for more than three months.
Eleven-piece band Bellowhead were also double award winners at the ceremony in central London, taking home prizes for best group and best live act.
Chris Wood was named folk singer of the year while his track Hollow Point - a song about the police shooting of Brazilian man Jean Charles de Menezes - won best original song.
As previously announced, Glasgow-born singer-songwriter Donovan received a lifetime achievement award.
The 64-year-old said he was "honoured" to get the accolade, having been "fired with the mission to bring Celtic music back to popular culture".
The Who front man Roger Daltrey presented the musician of the year award to Andy Cutting, a prize he previously won in 2008.
Married couple Nancy Kerr and James Fagan were presented the best duo prize, while the Levellers were the recipients of the Roots award.
Elsewhere the good tradition award went to Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends in recognition of their contribution to traditional folk music.
The singing Cornish fisherman signed a record deal last March, with their first album of sea shanties made the UK album chart Top 10 a month later.
Trio Moore/Moss/Rutter were awarded the Young Folk award, the result of Radio 2's annual search for the most promising young folk artist in the UK.
Laura Marling and Bellowhead were among the performers at the event, broadcast live on Radio 2.
