Two men have already appeared in court accused of murdering Gary Clampett, 39, in Fernie Place early on Sunday.
Police Scotland said three men - aged 36, 44 and 46 - were now also facing charges.
They were expected to appear at Peterhead Sheriff Court later on Wednesday.
Emergency services were called to Fernie Place in the early hours of Sunday but Mr Clampett was pronounced dead at the scene.
On Tuesday Barry Martin, 31, and Joseph Martin, 39, both from Fraserburgh, appeared in court charged with murder and two counts of attempted murder.
They made no plea and were remanded in custody.
Det Insp Gary Winter of the Major Investigation Team, who is leading the inquiry, said: "Our inquiries are continuing and a police presence will remain in the area at this time. I would urge anyone who has information which could assist in our investigation to contact police."
