Woman fined for using dead grandfather's blue badge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who used her grandfather's disabled parking "blue badge" for nearly two years after he died has been fined.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zoe Carter-Owen of Westfield Close, Backwell pleaded guilty by post and did not appear during the hearing at North Somerset Magistrates Court.
She was caught using the badge in June 2016, issued to her grandfather who died at the end of July 2014.
North Somerset Council has seized more than 100 badges over the past year.
Carter-Owen was fined £220, and also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £30, a parking fine of £220 and total costs of £390.
The parking permit issued to her grandfather Melville Walter Owen was cancelled in September 2014, two months after he died at the age of 89.
The council said it was currently processing 21 cases for prosecution as part of an effort to clampdown on the misuse of the badges.
