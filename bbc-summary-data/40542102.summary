The three-day event is running over the weekend usually taken up by T in the Park, which organiser DF Concerts said would "take a break" in 2017.
The Kooks, George Ezra and Kasabian will take to the stage for day two of the event.
About 85,000 people are thought to have bought tickets for the three-day sold-out festival.
Fans on Friday were able to see bands such as London Grammar, Belle and Sebastian as well as headliners Radiohead.
Despite tight security in light of recent terror attacks in the UK, the atmosphere at the event was praised by festival director Geoff Ellis.
"Friday was a great success so far, and we have a weekend packed with some of the mightiest names in music, the best street food and drink stalls and an atmosphere unlike anywhere in the world," he said.
The event finishes on Sunday, with acts including The View, local band Twin Atlantic, Two Door Cinema Club and headliners Biffy Clyro.
Ch Insp Simon Jeacocke, event commander for Police Scotland, said: "Public safety is our top priority and we'd like to commend those attending the first day of the TRNSMT festival for their behaviour and good spirits.
"No arrests have been made and we've had no issues with the increased security at the entry points.
"We'd encourage those attending over the weekend to plan their journey ahead and make sure they're aware of what they can and can't bring on to the site, so that they can enjoy a safe and fun festival."
