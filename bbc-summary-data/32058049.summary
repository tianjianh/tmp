The men's rugby team at Aberystwyth University was barred from competitions until the end of the year following the "degrading" initiations.
It broke a "total ban" on the controversial initiation ceremonies at the Welsh seaside university.
An investigation was carried out by the students' union.
A union spokesman said: "We are very clear that while social events for clubs and societies are an integral part of their activities, so-called initiation ceremonies are not.
"We received evidence from multiple individuals that Men's Rugby Union had been running initiation ceremonies through the year and felt the decision to suspend the club was a proportional response."
