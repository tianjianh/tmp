Amir Khan says he is unlikely to fight Floyd Mayweather if the American makes his expected return from retirement.

Briton Khan, 29, faces Mexican WBC middleweight champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas on Saturday.
Khan felt he was close to securing a fight last year with Mayweather, who retired in September and has recently hinted at a comeback.
"He messed me around, so I'd probably treat him the same way - I don't think I'd take that fight," said Khan.

Mayweather is a former five-weight world champion considered by many observers to be the best fighter of his generation.
"Floyd's probably missing not having his picture on the MGM," added Khan.
"He must see my picture and Canelo's picture and think 'people have forgotten about me'. As soon as you say you're retired, we do forget about the people who say that.
"Mayweather's feeling that now, he's feeling like no-one's talking about him, that he's old news, and maybe that's why he's trying to get everyone supporting him again by saying 'I want to make a comeback'.
"Whatever Mayweather says, let him say it."
Khan's bout with 25-year-old Alvarez is the biggest of his 11-year professional career.
Alvarez has won 46 of his 48 fights and lost only once - that defeat coming against Mayweather in 2013.
Khan, a two-time former world champion, has won 31 and lost three of his 34 professional fights but has not held a world title since 2012.
He has not fought since outpointing Chris Algieri in May 2015 and has made a jump of two weight divisions to set up the WBC world middleweight title bout.
Khan says he is taking inspiration from Leicester City, who began the football season as 5,000-1 outsiders to win the title but became Premier League champions on Monday.
"It is unbelievable how a team like Leicester have come up from nowhere and took the title," added Khan.
"This is similar to what I am going in to with this fight against Canelo, because I am the underdog.
"I think it is the year of the underdog with Leicester and me going in to this fight. It is our year."
