The visitors scored in the fifth minute when Jordan Thompson, on loan from Rangers, fired into the top corner.
It was 2-0 after 69 minutes when Thompson's cross found Lister and the 35-year-old striker headed home, although moments later the Blue Brazil pulled one back through Lewis Milne.
But Lister fired his second with just over 10 minutes left to seal the win.
Airdrie manager Eddie Wolecki Black took ill during half-time and was taken to hospital. The club said later on Saturday that the 50-year-old was in a stable condition.
