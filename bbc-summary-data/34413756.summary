Alan Davey, who took the helm at the station in January this year, announced the guests as he launched Radio 3's new season of programmes.
Davey highlighted the station's spoken output, alongside a diverse range of musical content and live performances.
"I want people to experience what goes on here - it's a treasure trove," he said.
"We are more than a radio station," Davey told reporters. "We are a whole universe of high quality culture," he said, citing the Proms, BBC performing groups such as the BBC Philharmonic, and the station's 25 hours of original drama.
He said he was "determined Radio 3 will be better known for its speech content", adding that while they were not doing more drama, the station was "talking about it more".
Part of that dramatic output, will see the station join forces with Radio 4 and 4 extra to mark the  centenary of playwright Arthur Miller's birth.
David Suchet, Zoe Wanamaker and director Howard Davies - who performed together in the critically-acclaimed West End production of Miller's All My Sons - will reunite for a performance of Death of a Salesman on 11 October.
The following week will see playwright Tony Kushner - best known for Angels in America - and director Richard Eyre among those talking about their personal connection with Miller and his work.
The commemorative week will end with a special recording of an all-star US cast performing A View from the Bridge, led by Alfred Molina.
Alan Bennett is interviewed in the station's long-standing show Private Passions in December, concluding the programme's 20th anniversary year.
Earlier this year, presenter Michael Berkeley told Davey that Bennett was the person he would most like to interview on the show, after it emerged Private Passions - a show in which guests talk about the music that is most important to them - "partially inspired The History Boys".
"Michael has got his wish," said Davey.
The same month sees Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin share his favourite music on the station's Essential Classics. Authors Ian Rankin and Jeanette Winterson, actor Julian Glover and presenter John Craven will also appear on the show in the coming months.
Diversity
On the music front, Davey talked about improving diversity on the station, and within classical music.
Responding to accusations by commentators that the station's presenters are "too South East", Davey said he wanted "to broaden the range of voices on the radio" to reflect "all of the UK" and all age groups.
In addition, the station is hosting a seminar with BASCA (British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors) to encourage diversity in composition.
Davey also talked about bringing classical music - still 80% of the station's output - to a new audience with BBC Introducing Classical, a new talent scheme.
Like the previous BBC Introducing schemes, it aims to offer unsigned and undiscovered artists and composers the opportunity to appear on the station's In Tune and Hear and Now show.
Davey highlighted the station's new partnership collaborating on a pop-up jazz station with Jazz FM,  and added that he was "happy to get into bed with Classical FM... for the good of classical music as a whole" if the occasion arose.
He stressed, however, that BBC Radio 3 and its closest commercial rival, Classic FM, were "poles apart on what we deliver and the way in which we deliver it".
