[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 5-2 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grimsby recorded their first league win since the opening day of the season by thrashing Stevenage, thanks in the main to Omar Bogle's superb hat-trick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Man-of-the-match Bogle opened the scoring in the 15th minute with a sublime piece of individual skill that saw him turn sharply past his marker before poking past the advancing keeper.
Stevenage responded well to going behind with Ben Kennedy seeing a sharp low effort saved well by James McKeown, but Town doubled their lead on 40 minutes when Luke Summerfield played a clever one-two with Bogle on the edge of the box and the midfielder fired home.
Town were cruising into the break but when they switched off at a cheap free-kick in first-half stoppage time, Fraser Francis rose highest to direct a looping header over McKeown and into the back of the net.
Grimsby came out firing for the second half and plundered two goals in as many minutes.
The first came from Dominic Vose, who played a one-two with Bogle before curling a sumptuous effort past Jamie Jones from 25 yards.
Seconds later, it was four as Bogle grabbed his second of the afternoon after twisting and turning his way into the box before slotting home.
Substitute Jobi McAnuff did pull one back after good work from Matt Godden left him free to tap into an unguarded net, but Bogle completed his hat-trick in stunning style with a superb late free-kick.
