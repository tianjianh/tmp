The FTSE 100 index closed 84 points up at 6,984, a rise of 1.2% on the day.
The pound dropped 1% to $1.284, and was down 0.8% at 1.146 euros.
"There is still a great degree of uncertainty surrounding what Brexit negotiations will involve," said Ana Thaker, at broker PhillipCapital UK.
Among the biggest risers on the London market were Intercontinental Hotels, up 3.1%; Travis Perkins, also up 3.1%; Anglo American, up 2.9%; and Schroders, up 2.7%.
In the FTSE 250, shares in asset manager Henderson Group rose 17% after it said it had agreed to merge with US investment management company Janus Capital.
The deal will create a company managing more than $320bn in assets and was described by both sides as a "merger of equals".
