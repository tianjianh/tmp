A woman has been inspired to shed light on rare medical conditions by her son, who has a syndrome that means she has never seen him smile.

Ceridwen Hughes from Mold, Denbighshire, has set up a photography project with help from lottery funding.
Her eight-year-old son Isaac has Moebius Syndrome, which causes facial paralysis.
"It's about showing the people behind the conditions," Ms Hughes said.
Isaac's condition means he also struggles to move his eyes left and right.
His mother said it "doesn't affect him cognitively, but people make assumptions based on the way he looks and acts".
"He's just like any other eight-year-old boy, he's a cheeky bubbly little character with lots of friends," she told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme.
Ms Hughes started the project to help people "get past the barrier" to not see disabled people as "a threat".
Since setting up her non-profit group Same But Different, she has so far photographed around 20 children with different rare conditions.
"Hopefully people will think they're beautiful portraits and want to know more about the people behind the condition, not just the condition," she said.
The photographs will be displayed at exhibitions in the Senedd and Clwyd Theatr Cymru next year.
