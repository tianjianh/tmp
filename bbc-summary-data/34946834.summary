[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eleri Edwards, 32, made 10 allegations to ChildLine claiming she was a pupil at Ysgol Ardudwy in Harlech, Gwynedd.
A disciplinary hearing in Cardiff heard she told the charity Tudur Williams touched her inappropriately.
Ms Edwards was struck off indefinitely on Friday.
The hearing was told Mr Williams was "devastated" when Ms Edwards, who taught under the name Eleri Roberts, made the allegations via the charity's website after she was dismissed from his school.
Police interviewed Mr Williams, but investigations led to them concluding it was a hoax.
Detectives traced the reports to Ms Edward's computer and she was cautioned.
Ms Edwards was employed at a high school 55 miles (88km) away at Llanidloes, Powys, when she made the bogus claims. She has since left the school.
She told the hearing: "I was a good teacher and I'm honest. I apologise to Tudur Williams. He continued to work after the allegations which makes him a credit to his profession."
Richard Parry Jones, chairman of the professional conduct committee of the Education Workforce Council, said: "The nature of her conduct was too serious to consider a temporary order.
"She has failed to act with honesty or integrity and her conduct has breached key principles set out for registered teachers."
Speaking after the hearing, Mr Williams said: "She obviously decided to try to take her revenge on me personally.
"What she did was inexcusable and could have had a devastating effect on me personally and my career."
