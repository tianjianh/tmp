The Australian full-back, 30, was out of contract at the end of this season.
Hanbury moved to the Vikings in 2012 after a two-year spell at Celtic Crusaders, having previously played for South Sydney Rabbitohs and West Tigers.
"I am really pleased that I have got the deal done, I always wanted to stay at the Vikings and me and my girlfriend are really happy," he said.
"Coming to work every day with your best mates is a dream come true, I get on with the coaching staff and everybody at the club and wouldn't want to leave.
"I came over to the UK as half-back but when I sat down with (head coach) Denis (Betts), he had faith in me and let me take the full-back role. I am so glad to be staying here for a further three years doing so."
He follows Stefan Marsh, Chris Dean, Joe Mellor and Charly Runciman, who have all signed new deals over the past month.
