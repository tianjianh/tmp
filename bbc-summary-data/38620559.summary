[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 2-1 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone ended a run of five National League games without a win by beating Torquay 2-1 at the Gallagher Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts almost caught Torquay napping with a simple ball over the top in the first minute, but Woking loanee Delano Sam-Yorke was unable to get his shot on target.
Maidstone continued to force the issue, with Nana Ofori-Twumasi and Jamar Loza also going close before the break, and they got their rewards when Loza found Sam-Yorke in space to fire home from 10 yards in the 53rd minute.
Substitute Brett Williams briefly levelled things up for Torquay after 63 minutes, but Jack Paxman sealed the win which took Maidstone out of the drop zone six minutes later.
