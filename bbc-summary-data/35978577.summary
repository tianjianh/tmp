Holyrood 2016: Labour's Dugdale quizzed over SNP work experience claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, has played down suggestions she applied for work experience with the SNP 13 years ago.

She told the BBC it was "laughable" that a "supposed" application made in February 2003 should be central to the Holyrood election campaign.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said no-one "should be judged too harshly" on what they did in their youth.
Parties are in the second week of campaigning ahead of 5 May poll.
When asked by the BBC's Glenn Campbell whether she had applied for work experience with the SNP, Ms Dugdale said: "Thirteen years ago I supposedly applied for work experience in the Scottish Parliament.
"Now I applied for lots of work experience, lots of young people at university do just that.
"But the idea that this is a central issue of the Scottish election campaign is really laughable."
The 34-year-old repeated "This is 13 years ago. In February 2003, apparently. I was studying law, I likely applied for lots of opportunities for work experience."
Ms Dugdale said she had never voted SNP and had never been an SNP supporter.
Last week Ms Dugdale was forced to clarify reports she might back Scottish independence if it could secure Scotland's EU membership.
In an interview with the Fabian Review she was quoted as saying it was "not inconceivable" in such circumstances.
But she later insisted she would vote to stay in the UK in any future referendum and opposed one being held.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson questioned whether anyone could trust Labour with a leader that "keeps flip-flopping on this most vital issue".
The pro-Union backer added: "Firstly, Kezia Dugdale says she's happy for Labour MSPs to campaign for independence, then she says it's 'not inconceivable' she'd vote for it herself and now we find out she even asked the SNP for a job - twice."
Ms Sturgeon, who was out on the campaign trail in Edinburgh, was asked about the work experience claim.
She joked that her opponent may have had better judgement when she was 21.
However, Ms Sturgeon went on to say that people should not be judged too harshly on what they did in their youth.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said whether or not Ms Dugdale applied for work experience with the nationalists was "largely trivia".
But he added the SNP had "serious questions" to answer over how the information had become public. Mr Rennie believed it should have been kept private.
