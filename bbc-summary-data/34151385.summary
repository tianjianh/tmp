Would You Still Love Me If... tells the story of a lesbian couple with a baby on the way, one of whom is considering gender reassignment surgery.
Turner, famous for her roles in Peggy Sue Got Married and Prizzi's Honor, plays the mother to one of the women.
The Oscar-nominee previously starred as Charles Bing, Chandler's cross-dressing father, in the sitcom Friends.
Would You Still Love Me If... was written by John S Anastasi and co-stars Rebecca Brooksher and Sofia Jean. Grammy nominated singer Deborah Cox also appears in the role of a doctor.
Anastasi, a little-known playwright from Pennsylvania, said Turner put herself forward for the role after his casting director put out a call for actors.
The actress, also known as the voice of Jessica Rabbit, had once expressed interest in directing one of his plays and, although that did not pan out, she was keen to work on his latest project.
The writer told the New York Times that Would You Still Love Me If... was inspired by the film Blue Is The Warmest Colour, a coming-of-age romance starring Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos.
"I was moved by the relationship of these two women, and was pondering if there was anything that could change their love. For some reason, it crossed my mind - what if one of them decided they wanted to physically change? That was the germ of the idea."
Previews begin on 26 September at New World Stages in New York, with the opening night set for 10 October.
