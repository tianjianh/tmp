Producers of the show, adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel, said it will close on 5 June after 81 performances.
Written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa with songs by Duncan Sheik, the show features torture, orgies and an 80s soundtrack.
It got just two technical Tony nominations.
American Psycho, which stars Benjamin Walker, is on at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre in New York.   It has never made more than $600,000 (Â£409,605) a week, although it has the potential to make $1m (Â£682,710).
The musical is based on Easton Ellis' 1991 novel set in the 80s, about a 26-year-old Manhattan investment banker whose sanity slowly disintegrates, turning him into a brutal murderer.
It is directed by Rupert Goold, who also originated the UK version, which starred former Doctor Who actor Matt Smith.
It got mixed reviews at London's Almeida Theatre but was completely sold out during its two-month run from December 2013.
