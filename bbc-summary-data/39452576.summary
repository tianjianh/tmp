Peter and Tracey Wilkinson and their son, Pierce, were found with knife wounds in Stourbridge on Thursday morning.
The suspect, in his 20s, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and wounding.
He is understood to be known to the victims, West Midlands Police said.
Dashcam footage shows the moments the murder suspect tried to flee the scene in a Land Rover which was stolen from the house.
It shows officers chasing the car, which later crashed into a garden wall after it was rammed off the road by police in Norton Road about 30 minutes after the attack.
Police said they understood the suspect may have been living at the address, although he was not a family relative.
The 13-year-old boy and his mother were found in the house on Greyhound Lane, Norton, with critical stab wounds at about 08:00 BST.
The woman was pronounced dead at the scene, while the teenager later died in hospital.
Mr Wilkinson, managing director for manufacturer Hill & Smith Ltd, was found in the garden of the house.
He remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition with stab wounds to his chest and back.
Peter Wilson, BBC Midlands Today special correspondent, said he understood the couple also have an older daughter who is attending university.
Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the attack.
In a statement, Redhill School in Stourbridge, where Pierce was a Year 8 pupil, described him as a "loyal, caring and conscientious pupil" who will be "sadly missed".
"He always met everyone with a smile and was a kind and thoughtful young man. He was passionate about his football team, West Bromwich Albion, and was devoted to his pet greyhound dog.
"He was a loving son and brother, out thoughts and prayers remain with his family, in particular his father Peter and his sister Lydia.
"Pupils and staff are in school today and are being offered professional help and counselling."
A neighbour of the victims described seeing two people being carried from the house on stretchers into ambulances after the "horrifying" incident.
Asked to describe the family, she said: "We just knew them as neighbours and asked how the kids were when we saw them in the street.
"They were just really, really friendly, they had lived there about seven or eight years and what has happened is just desperately sad."
A woman whose property backs on to the Wilkinsons' house told reporters she heard a man shouting in a neighbouring garden at about 08:00.
"It was definitely a man but I couldn't hear what was said. At the time I thought it was a workman," she said.
Stourbridge MP Margot James said she knew of the family through the local Conservative association and said the community will do all it can to offer its support.
"My reaction is probably the same as everyone else in Stourbridge - absolute shock and horror that anything like this could happen in someone's normal day in my constituency.
"It is a truly tragic and awful event," she said.
