[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Western Railway (GWR) has said overcrowding on its trains on a Rugby World Cup matchday last Saturday was "embarrassing".

The company, which changed its name from First Great Western earlier this week, was criticised by fans travelling to Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.
Some described the situation at Paddington Station in London as "chaos".
Reading, Swindon and Bristol Parkway stations were also busier than normal.
GWR spokesman Dan Panes said: "It certainly was embarrassing.
"We had enough seats - plenty of trains for everyone that was travelling - but we weren't good enough at asking people to travel early."
On Saturday angry passengers caught up in the congestion criticised the rail company for not coping with the high number of customers.
