Rochdale could have had the tie sewn up by half-time but for some wayward finishing, and although Carlisle came back into it later on the home side were unable to make progress against a resolute defence.
Carlisle almost drew first blood with a Danny Grainger shot after a short free-kick 30 yards out, which was smothered by Conrad Logan in the Rochdale goal, but the visitors looked the more threatening side early on.
With Joe Rafferty causing problems on the right, Carlisle goalkeeper Mark Gillespie came to his side's rescue with saves from the Dale defender and from Davies, whose effort was blocked inside the six yard box.
It took Rochdale just three minutes in the second half to grab the lead when Davies whipped in a shot from 25 yards which took a deflection to leave Gillespie stranded as it sailed over the goalkeeper's head and into the net.
Carlisle manager Keith Curle turned to his substitutes for inspiration and one of the introductions, Jamie Devitt, picked out Charlie Wyke with a fine cross-field pass but the striker was unable to keep his effort down.
Joe Bunney almost added a second for Dale 10 minutes from time when Carlisle lost possession deep in their own territory and he latched on to the ball to slide a shot wide of Gillespie, only to see it glance off the far post.
However, Mendez-Laing did make it 2-0 deep into added time when he slotted home a low cross from the right from six yards, as Carlisle slipped to a first home defeat since April.
