Olivier Giroud has overcome the ankle problem he suffered last week, but Theo Walcott is out with a calf injury.
Burnley trio Dean Marney, Ashley Barnes and Johann Berg Gudmundsson are expected to be available after missing the midweek FA Cup win through injury.
However, winger Scott Arfield looks like missing a third successive game with a hamstring problem.
Simon Brotherton: "Arsenal returned to winning ways in the league at Swansea last weekend and will be confident of adding another three points on Sunday afternoon.
"Burnley sit comfortably in mid-table at the moment and have been in decent form, winning three of their last four league games - but their success has been built almost entirely on results at Turf Moor.
"The difference between Burnley's home and away form is stark. Only the top two sides in the table, Chelsea and Tottenham, have won more games at home than the Clarets' total of eight.
"But on the road it's been a very different story with just a single point from a possible 27 so far and only three goals scored."

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "With the number of games we have it's important that we have all our experienced players back and that everybody is focused to do well.
"We're going through a moment of truth now - January until May is five months to go. You want ideally all your players with big experience back in your squad."
Burnley will be competitive and difficult to play against at Emirates Stadium, but they just don't make enough chances to win games on the road.
