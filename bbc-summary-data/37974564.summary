A 30-year-old man sustained serious injuries in an attack, which took place in Loch Leven Road, Lochore, at about 16:30 on Sunday 6 November.
The victim was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy and was later released after treatment.
The 50-year-old man who has been charged in connection with the incident is scheduled to appear at Dunfermline Sheriff Court on Monday.
Police Scotland said officers were continuing to follow a positive line of inquiry to trace another individual believed to be involved.
Det Insp Colin Robson, from Dunfermline CID, said: "Violent incidents like this remain rare within the division, but we recognise the impact they can have on communities when they do occur and we have been carrying out a robust investigation into this attack, while providing appropriate support and reassurance to local residents.
"Thanks to the public support for this inquiry we have arrested one man and are continuing with our efforts to trace a further male.
"Anyone with information they believe can assist our investigation should contact police immediately."
