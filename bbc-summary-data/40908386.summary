Nine-man Wrexham's woes continued as they lost at Maidstone United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wrexham took the lead through Alex Reid who made it two in two for his new club, but the hosts turned the game around thanks to goals from Alex Wynter and Jack Richards to lead at the break.
The second half got worse for Wrexham who saw Manny Smith sent off for a professional foul.
That led to a penalty - saved by Christian Dibble - before Mark Carrington also saw red for dissent.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales:
"It is very disappointing, the fans came in great numbers and deserved better than that.
"Ultimately we've let them have too many chances and our goalkeeper was absolutely outstanding.
"Things are going against us at the moment, but we will keep working hard and hopefully it will change.
"We will appeal Manny Smith's red card, because he's made a clear attempt to get the ball."
