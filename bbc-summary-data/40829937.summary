[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rafa De Vita's extra-time goal put Livingston into the League Cup quarter finals at the expense of Falkirk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Robinson directed Danny Mullen's cross into the net to give Livingston the lead.
It was soon all square when James Craigen turned his marker to fire past goalkeeper Neil Alexander.
Falkirk's Joe McKee went closest to avoiding extra-time when he hit the bar, and De Vita bundled in Josh Mullin's low ball to win it.
Myles Hippolyte and Nathan Austin went close as Falkirk made the early running but Robinson gave Livingston the lead on the break when he turned home Mullen's cross from close range.
After Craigen's equaliser both Alexander and Robbie Thomson pulled off excellent saves just before the 90 minutes were up.
Former Ross County wide player De Vita struck when he converted Josh Mullin's deflected cross.
Livingston manager David Hopkins: "Our fitness levels are incredible. When it went to extra-time I had no qualms that we were going to win the game.
"There's nothing done yet, we face another tough game whoever we get in the next round, but it's a round we never thought we were going to get to. If I'm honest with the group we had I never thought we'd get out of it.
"These young boys deserve to play whoever they're going to play."
