The hosts started well, Karen Bardsley saving from Caroline Weir and Shanice van de Sanden thwarted by Lucy Bronze.
City then began to dominate, forcing Siobhan Chamberlain into saves from Toni Duggan and Bronze's fierce effort.
Liverpool came closest to a goal 12 minutes from time, Rosie White heading a Laura Coombs corner onto the bar.
The draw keeps City clear of Chelsea at the top heading into the mid-season break, while Liverpool are three points behind third-placed Birmingham.
Liverpool captain Gemma Bonner: "City are a great side who are top of league and flying high.
"We know the quality they possess in the team but we also know that we've got it as well, so for us we wanted to play our own game, disrupt them and I think to keep a clean sheet tonight, we're delighted with that.
"For us it's definitely a step in the right direction, I'm really proud of the girls' efforts tonight.
"We've been scoring a lot of goals this season but I think for us it was a really disciplined performance - I think tactically we were brilliant and our defensive shape was superb."
Manchester City midfielder Jennifer Beattie: "We're definitely disappointed not to get three points - with the run we've been on, we've been playing well, but unfortunately we just didn't match up to our standards today.
"A point is a point; we came in to get three - we've been on a good run and it's time to kick on for the next part of the season.
"We'll go onto the break, regroup and hope to get ourselves off to a winning start in the next half.
"It does feel like a loss, we've all said that after the game, but we'll look at it again, figure what went wrong and take it into the next game."
