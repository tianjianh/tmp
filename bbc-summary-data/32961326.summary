The man died on the driveway of an unnamed hotel in St Saviour early on a Sunday morning at the end of May.
St Saviour constable, Sadie Le Sueur-Rennard said the guests were told there were only three ambulances operating at the weekend.
The man who died has not been named but his family were told his body could not be moved because it was a sudden death.
Constable Le Sueur-Rennard said she was bringing it to the attention of the chief minister at the first States sitting after the incident.
She said: "It was a distressing weekend as it was a young person who was there with a young family. I felt very bad because there was very little I could do."
Chief Minister Senator Ian Gorst said health authorities were aware and an investigation was under way.
He said: "I am extremely disappointed to hear what sounds like such a tragic and sad incident and I'm sure the sympathy of every member in this family goes out to them.
"On top of the extremely distressing time in their lives, they should not have had to wait for a response from our emergency services.
"The assistant health minister is undertaking a full review and I'm sure will put in place any necessary changes to ensure this does not occur again."
