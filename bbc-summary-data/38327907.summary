European Champions Cup, Pool 5: Clermont Auvergne v Ulster (Sun)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prop Kyle McCall hopes to be part of a much-improved Ulster scrum in Sunday's important European Champions Cup match against Clermont.

Ulster defeated the French side in last week's game at Kingspan Stadium but the scrum was creaking, especially after front row switches in the second half.
"We weren't scrummaging as a unit.
"Some people were going off on their own and scrummaging as individuals, it's something we need to improve upon," McCall told BBC Sport NI.
Clermont came from 21 points down and scored two converted tries to pick up two losing bonus points in the 39-32 defeat.
The result left Clermont still in charge of Pool 5, three points ahead of both Ulster and Bordeaux-Begles.

McCall admitted allowing Clermont to leave Belfast with two bonus points took the gloss off one of their best displays of the season.
"We know it was a good performance, but it wasn't a finished performance.
"We let them back into it and we weren't happy with that.
"If we can go over there and tighten up our defence and show that attacking threat that we have, hopefully we can do a job.
"We haven't been overly happy with our defence at times. We've been slipping off a few tackles here and there and we need to tighten up on that going over there especially.
"It'll be tough, but we need to tighten up on our defence."
