[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The captain of the KLM aircraft became unwell as he was about to leave for Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.
He was resuscitated by the crew with the help of a passenger, and firefighters helped take him off the plane.
The Dutch pilot was then taken to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was in a "stable condition".
The co-pilot of the plane, which had 128 people on board, took the aircraft back to the gate.
The flight was supposed to leave at about 17:00, but because of the emergency it was cancelled and passengers had their flights re-booked.
A spokeswoman for KLM said: "During taxiing to the runway on this KLM flight to Amsterdam the captain became unwell and the staff treated him with the help of a passenger.
"He was taken to hospital where his condition is stable."
A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: "We took a call that a man was having a heart attack at Glasgow Airport. We attended the scene and arrived at 5.25pm."
