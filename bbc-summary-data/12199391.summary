Bath volunteer centre moves to central library in city

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A charity which encourages people to get involved as volunteers in local community activities is moving to new premises in Bath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Volunteer Centre will be based at the Bath Central Library in Northgate Street from 25 January.
The organisation said it currently had about 400 vacancies for volunteers, with opportunities in social care, conservation, administration and sport.
The service covers the Bath and North East Somerset area.
Marion Cooper, from the centre, said: "Our new home in the central library will be more visible, more accessible and enable us to help more people to get involved in local community activities.
"New opportunities for volunteering come in every day and, with public sector cuts beginning to really bite, the need for volunteers has never been so great."
