Around 2,500 boxes and bags have been donated since they put out a call for donations via social media.
The donations for men and women include food, toiletries and warm clothing.
Many items have already been taken to various shelters, including the Dinas Fechan hostel in Swansea which is run by the homeless charity The Wallich.
Leah Flint, from the Swansea Vale, along with Louise Evans-Leigh and Heidi Rees have been collecting from 50 different drop-off points around south Wales, from Ammanford to Maesteg.
"People have been amazingly generous," said Ms Flint. "They have just gone above and beyond everything we expected."
