[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A petition is calling for a conclusion to the inquiry into three deaths at the Jim Clark Rally in 2014 so the event can return to its traditional format.

Iain Provan, 64, Elizabeth Allan, 63, and Len Stern, 71, died at a stage near Coldstream.
The event has not been held on closed public roads since then and was cancelled this year due to low entries.
A Crown Office spokesman said the investigation into the incident was continuing.
Petition organisers claim the rally generates about Â£3.5m for the Scottish Borders economy and enjoys "substantial support" from Scottish Borders Council, local politicians and the general public.
They said that it was "in the public interest" that the rally should return to closed public roads in 2017.
"Two years with no conclusion has made it difficult to guarantee the future of one of the UK's biggest sporting events," they added.
A revised event was held in 2015 on tracks in Kielder Forest in Northumberland, after starting in Kelso.
However, low entries forced the cancellation of similar plans earlier this year.
A spokesman for the Crown Office confirmed that it was still investigating the events of more than two years ago.
"The investigation, under the direction of the Crown's health and safety division and the Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit (SFIU), into the tragic events at the rally in 2014 continues," he said.
"The families will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments."
Scottish Borders Council withdrew permission for the event to take place on closed public roads while investigations were ongoing.
It would be up to the local authority to decide whether or not it could return.
A council spokesperson said: "Scottish Borders Council continues to liaise with the rally organisers.
"Once the ongoing investigation has concluded we will meet with them and hopefully start working towards preparing for the event to be held on closed public roads at the earliest opportunity - bearing in mind the planning timescales required for such an event."
