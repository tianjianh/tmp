It is the second such incident in the space of three days at the old Interfloor plant in Heathhall.
Emergency services were called out to the latest incident on Tuesday prompting the warning.
The SFRS said the site was dangerous and asked parents to be aware of their children's whereabouts at all times.
SFRS Dumfries and Galloway area manager Hamish McGhie said: "We are always concerned about the possibility of anyone accessing any empty premises.
"We have found from experience that unoccupied buildings can be targeted by malicious fire-raising.
"In such cases, we will always take a preventative approach by working with the owners and other local partners to secure such sites and raise awareness of the risks."
He added that they also tried to educate young people about the dangers of setting fires.
"Such activity is not only reckless and dangerous but can divert SFRS resources away from genuine emergencies," he said.
"However, through robust and flexible strategic planning, our crews are always ready to respond to any incident to keep our communities safe."
