Edinburgh Fringe shows compete in tough marketplace

You don't have to be a mind reader on the Royal Mile in festival time - but it helps.

With thousands of shows competing for audiences, and only seconds to convince them, it is one of the toughest marketplaces in the world.
Scots performer Colin Cloud knows better than most.
His show Colin Cloud Kills is one of  the 3,314 shows from 49 countries in 313 different venues taking place at the Edinburgh Fringe.
However, he is also a self-styled forensic mind reader, whose heightened senses (like his hero Sherlock Holmes) make him the perfect companion for a stroll down the Royal Mile.
"Three and a half million shows means an average 1.5 million flyers," he said.
"Those flyers get an average length of 20 metres before they're binned or dropped so really it's every performer's job to have the biggest impact in those few seconds as possible."
A choir from Edinburgh University is up to the task. Wrapped in disposable plastic macs - branded with their logo - they are singing, while handing out their flyers.
Mr Cloud said: "This is the first thing any performer needs to do on the Royal Mile. They need to get the attention of the crowd.
"Otherwise you're just walking past a stranger. These guys have nailed it. They're a big group, they're singing. People walking past notice they're there and that's part number one, getting attention."
No easy task, in a crowded street in the pouring rain. But there is an additional consideration for any show. They should make sure they have planted a few posters first.
Mr Cloud said: "It's one thing to be handed a flyer but you need to be interested and invested in it.
"These billboards are all over the city and covered in posters. And the more performers can cover with their brand, the more familiarity we feel.
"And when we get the flyer, we feel like we know them already, so we're more inclined to keep it, study it and then hopefully go on to buy tickets."
Then there is the public. A mix of stoney-faced locals, and bemused tourists. For the performer handing out flyers, it is important to choose carefully.
Mr Cloud said: "So if we look at these people with flyers here, it's their job to look enthusiastic but what they don't want to do is exceed the level of enthusiasm of the people walking past.
"Because that can be massively off-putting. If they're really excited about the show and people walking past are annoyed about the rain, the weather and how busy it is, and they then try and sound enthusiastic, it's going to immediately shut them down and make them not want to take a flyer."
"So their job is to essentially read the people who're approaching them and mirror and match their body language so that person who is walking past feels more in tune with the individual.
"They feel familiar, and as human beings we're more inclined to buy from people we like, so if we feel like we know that person, they're like us, we're much more likely to take that flyer.
"But it all then boils down to how good the individuals handing out the flyers are at essentially reading people around them."
It seems to work. A large group of Chinese tourists take flyers, consider them carefully and walk on. The flyers go in their pockets, not in the bin.
Colin hands me a flyer for his show before he leaves (18:20 at the Pleasance). Not that he needs to do much flyering himself. His show is sold out for most of this week.
However, he still appreciates the power of a direct approach at the Fringe.
Mr Cloud said: "Ultimately, we have to remember that everyone on this street is doing their own show once a day, which is exhausting enough, but then coming here, being enthusiastic, handing out those flyers, so the least we can do as audiences is keep a hold of them, look at them.
"They may just point us to some amazing shows this Fringe."
