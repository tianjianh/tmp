Hillsborough Inquests: Coroner to begin summing up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The coroner at the Hillsborough inquests is due to begin summing up after hearing nearly two years of evidence into the 1989 disaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lord Justice Goldring has called more than 500 witnesses including survivors, police and medical experts.
Over the next three weeks, he will review evidence on how the 96 Liverpool fans at the FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield died.
The jury is due to retire to consider its verdicts on 22 February.
The inquests, which began on 31 March 2014, are already the longest in English legal history.
The Hillsborough Independent Panel set up in 2009 reviewed 450,000 pages relating to the disaster before publishing its report in September 2012.
Hillsborough inquests: What you need to know
In November that year, the original 1991 inquests were quashed by the High Court.
Sitting at a purpose-built coroner's court in Birchwood, near Warrington, the jury of seven women and three men have looked at 4,000 pages of documents and hours of video evidence relating to the UK's worst ever sporting disaster.
During 280 days of hearings, evidence was given on the design of the stadium, planning and preparation for the game and emergency response, as well as the movements of the 96 fans and the care they were given.
The victims were caught in a crush on the Leppings Lane terraces of the Sheffield stadium as the FA Cup game kicked off on 15 April 1989.
A police order to open an exit gate to relieve pressure at the turnstiles led to around 2,000 Liverpool fans entering "relatively full" pens via a tunnel, the inquests heard.
During the inquests, the jury heard criticism of the emergency response and were told a number of victims might have been saved by a "sustained and earlier" intervention.
Unlike the previous inquests, which were held in Sheffield, the coroner Lord Justice Goldring did not establish a "3.15pm cut-off time" after which no evidence could be considered.
The 1989 match commander David Duckenfield and South Yorkshire Police are among the 12 individuals and 12 organisations listed as interested parties, along with the families of 95 of the 96 victims.
One victim, Martin Wild, had no surviving relatives who could be traced.
The cost of the new inquests, which were set up in February 2013, had reached Â£14m by November last year.
