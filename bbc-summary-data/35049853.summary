Thousands of tiny jelly creatures have washed up on several Dorset beaches in the wake of Storm Desmond.

Flotillas of velella velella, known as By-the-wind Sailors, have been found on beaches near Lulworth and Bridport.
Julie Hatcher, of Dorset Wildlife Trust, said: "They are designed to blow around and never come to land so to get a big mass stranding is rare."
The trust advised people not to handle them as the sting on their tentacles could cause discomfort.
Native to the Azores it has a 'sail' on its back which enables it to be blown by the wind across the sea.
The creatures, which resemble jellyfish, are a colony of animals related to the Portuguese man-of-war.
The Dorset Wildlife Trust is asking people to report their sightings on the charity's website.
