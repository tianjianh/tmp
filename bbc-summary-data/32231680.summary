Gary Powell, 27, from Chard, died on Saturday after his Ford Focus collided with a Ford Mondeo on a minor road at Whitelackington, near Ilminster.
His family says he was a "loving husband, father, son, brother, friend and recently father to his four-week-old baby girl".
"We will never forget you. You will be forever in our hearts," they added.
The other driver received hospital treatment for a fractured pelvis and a broken leg.
