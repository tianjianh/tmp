[SN]TITLE[SN]
France women 11-0 England women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England were beaten in the first of their two autumn internationals, failing to register a point against France in Martigues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both teams fielded inexperienced line-ups and England continued their run of failing to beat France for two years.
Trailing to two first-half penalties from Audrie Adabie, they saw French wing Elodie Poublan cross for a try midway through the second period.
England play Ireland at the Twickenham Stoop on 14 November.
Simon Middleton's squad included six members of the World Cup-winning squad from Paris in August 2014, but was without players on the full-time England Sevens programme, who are targeting the Rio Olympics next year.
Number eight Sarah Hunter captained the side as Katy McLean was one of those on Sevens duty.
England: Sarah McKenna; Katie Mason, Lauren Cattell, Ceri Large, Charlotte Clapp; Emily Scott, Leanne Riley; Rochelle Clark, Amy Cokayne, Laura Keates; Tamara Taylor, Abbie Scott; Hannah Gallagher, Marlie Packer, Sarah Hunter (captain).
Replacements: Vickii Cornborough, Emma Croker, Justine Lucas, Harriet Millar-Mills, Izzy Novel-Smith, Latoya Mason, Rachel Lund, Ruth Laybourn
