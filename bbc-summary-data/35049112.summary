About 1,200 jobs could go at Birmingham City Council in the next financial year in a bid to save £250m over four years.

The proposal was revealed in the Labour-led authority's 2016-17 budget consultation document.
The council said it needed to save £90m in the next financial year and £250m over the next four years.
Council leader John Clancy said the "challenging" budget meant "the council's organisation will become much more strategic and much smaller".
Adult social care is expected to be one of the hardest areas hit by the cuts with care centre closures anticipated.
Public realm CCTV could also lose funding, and fewer staff employed to monitor cameras.

The draft budget includes plans to phase out lollipop men and women and to bring in parking charges at some free council car parks.
The authority plans to reduce its staff from 20,000 in 2010 to about 7,000 by 2018.
Currently 12,400 people work for the authority and the plan would see that drop to 11,200 by 2017.
Council workers who keep their jobs could see their terms and conditions change, according to the consultation document.
Mr Clancy said changes to local government would bring benefits and challenges.
"We will have more independence, but there are also big questions about how this will impact on the resources available in Birmingham and the additional responsibilities councils will be expected to undertake in return," he said.
Robert Alden, leader of the city council's Conservative group, criticised leaders for "slashing front line services while failing to modernise services quickly enough".
He said: "[This budget] is closing seven leisure centres in the next four years, placing libraries at risk of closure.
"They plan to build on eight acres of parkland a year, equal to six football pitches. Land which, often, was given to the city in trust and was set up to protect residents' health."
However, Caroline Johnson, secretary for the Birmingham branch of the Unison trade union, blamed central government for imposing cuts on the authority and sympathised with the council for being "in a very difficult position".
