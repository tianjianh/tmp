The Loganair service was due to fly to Glasgow at about 08:30. It is thought it may have been caught in strong crosswinds.
Police Scotland said two men were taken to hospital and two women received minor injuries but declined medical assistance.
A full air accident investigation into the incident is under way.
There were 25 passengers and three crew members on board the aircraft.
After leaving the runway the plane came to rest on the grass next to it. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent three appliances to the scene.
One passenger told the BBC it felt as if the tail was caught by a crosswind.
Murdo John MacAskill, who was on board, said: "The plane came down with a bump and we veered far off to the left.
"I looked out the window and I saw the grass coming up and I knew that there was something wrong so entered the brace position and that's when the plane crashed.
"We were evacuated from the plane within, I would say, under five minutes. Everyone was standing on the tarmac then and by that stage you had the fire service and the police there."
A statement from the airport operators said: "An outbound Saab 340 aircraft operated by Loganair veered off the runway at Stornoway Airport at 8.33am this morning.
"Efforts to remove the aircraft from the runway are ongoing and investigations into the cause of the incident are under way.
"It is it our intention to resume normal operations as soon as the aircraft is safely removed from the runway. There are no scheduled arrivals or departures at Stornoway until later this afternoon."
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "As a result of the incident two male passengers received injuries and were taken to Stornoway Hospital for further assessment/medical treatment. Two female passengers received minor injuries and declined medical assistance."
"A full air accident investigation has now been launched and will be carried out by the AAIB in conjuction with Police Scotland."
A Loganair spokesman added: "All passengers and crew were safely evacuated and returned to the airport's terminal. Two passengers sustained what we understand are minor injuries and have gone to the local hospital.
"A full investigation is now under way to ascertain the cause of the incident and the Air Accident Investigation Branch has been notified."
