In an emotional appeal, Ms Downey said: "Micky was the love of my life, my rock, my best friend, my world, my everything. I will never stop missing him or loving him.
"I feel so lost without him and the pain never ends. I still can't accept he's gone."

Ms Downey added: "I just want to know what happened and get justice for something that is so, so cruel."
