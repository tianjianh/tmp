Ospreys must stop "learning" the hard way about failure and find a way to succeed, says captain Alun Wyn Jones.

Lock Jones, who returned from injury for Saturday's 23-3 Pro12 semi-final defeat at Munster, believes Ospreys are missing out on success too often when well-placed.
He said: "There's plenty there to work on, but we've got to stop learning and get on with it."
Munster will meet Scarlets in the final on Saturday, 27 May.
Ospreys reached the top four play-offs in 2014-15, but missed out on the final.
They did not make European Champions Cup qualification at the end of 2015-16 and began 2016-17 strongly only for performances to dip as it drew to a close.
A home semi-final seemed likely at one stage, but an away defeat against Italian strugglers Treviso in March knocked them off course.
Jones, who will head to New Zealand with the British and Irish Lions in June, added: "I'm fortunate or unfortunate enough to be on the inside looking out.
"If I was on the outside looking in, I think - pardon the cliche - better to finish strong than start strong and falter at the end.
"But that's probably what we feel we've done, without being too down on ourselves, there've been some great parts to our season.
"But I'm comfortable saying we've got to a point now where we've got to stop learning at this time of year.
"I think you look at our season, the last three [seasons] in terms of play-off, falling out of the Champions Cup, then back in, then got to another play-off and faltered around this time of year.
"So something we'll probably definitely have to look at whether it's the health of the squad, sheer performance or just will the players (perform)?"
Jones had not played since injuring his shoulder in Wales' Six Nations loss to France in March and said he felt "fine" on his return.
He added: "Credit to Munster. The possession and territory will probably be the interesting stats for us.
"What we did with it in the 22 is probably disappointing aspect and the fact that we probably coughed up ball unnecessarily under perceived pressure.
"We were always going to be under pressure at set-piece, but when we did win the ball, we can't give it away that easy so I'm sure the Scarlets won't need to take heed of that.
"Credit to the team - we kept playing until the end. We're not going to take solace in the two (late) disallowed tries, but credit to the guys that still wanted to play out there."
