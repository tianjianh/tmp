The mission is called Luna 27, and hopes to launch in five year's time.
One of the aims will be to try to discover if there is enough water and raw materials to make fuel and oxygen.
They will do this by sending a probe to the an area near the Moon's south pole which has never been explored, is freezing cold and has areas of constant darkness.
