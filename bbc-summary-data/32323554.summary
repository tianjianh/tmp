[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A row between a Conservative candidate and his chairman is "a little bit embarrassing", Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has admitted.

Guto Bebb, seeking re-election in Aberconwy, referred to Gary Burchett as an "idiot" after he told Mr Bebb he no longer had his backing.
Mr Crabb told BBC Radio Wales political parties were like families which had "tiffs and rows".
But he insisted Mr Bebb was a "great candidate" with "huge" support.
The row broke out when Mr Bebb sent an email questioning Mr Burchett's lack of involvement in his campaign for re-election.
Mr Burchett, a former mayor of Llandudno, replied by suggesting Mr Bebb had been promoting himself more than the party, saying he had "spent the last 18 months making excuses for you not using the Welsh Conservative brand".
Asked about the row by presenter Jason Mohammad, Mr Crabb said: "Like every family you don't want your arguments in public and disagreements.
"It's a little bit embarrassing, but people on the doorsteps are much more interested in the big issues."
