He slumped over his keyboard and did not move for a couple of minutes before being helped off stage, Chicago Sun-Times reporter Dave Hoekstra wrote.
Berry, 84, later re-emerged but told fans he had no strength to continue performing, the Sun-Times reported.
His agent told AP he had been suffering from exhaustion and that he had now flown home to St Louis, Missouri.
With hits like Johnny B Goode and Roll Over Beethoven, the singer and guitarist is one of the pioneers of rock 'n' roll and influenced artists including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys.
