[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Dixie, 46, was jailed in 2008 for repeatedly stabbing Miss Bowman then raping her as she lay dead or dying in Croydon, south London in 2005.
Dixie now admits raping a woman in her car in Croydon when he was 16.
The former chef also molested another woman near a railway bridge in 2002 and will be sentenced on 22 September.
'He got what he deserved', model's family say
The secret history of Sally Anne Bowman's killer
A previous hearing was told he ambushed a woman in an isolated car park in 1987 then raped her.
Following the sex attack, he tied her to the back seat of her car then set fire to the front seat.
"He later told police he had set fire to a Tampax," prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told Southwark Crown Court earlier.
She managed to escape and raised the alarm.
Dixie has also admitted charges of indecent assault and GBH after hitting another woman on the head several times with a chef's steel - used to sharpen kitchen blades.
He attacked her near a railway bridge in Croydon and told his victim "I'm going to kill you".
Dragging her up the stairs he proceeded to assault her but was interrupted by another woman who heard the commotion.
"When she asked what was going on, Dixie said 'nothing, nothing, it's just a row with my girlfriend,'" the prosecutor said.
Dixie fled after the victim said: "help, help, he's attacking me".
Mr Aylett QC told the court Dixie had revealed the attacks to police after finally admitting in January 2015 that he had killed Miss Bowman.
Miss Bowman's murder was something Dixie had previously denied.
"He wrote to police indicating he wanted to tell them the truth of what had happened to Sally Anne, because at the trial he said that he was not responsible for her murder," Mr Aylett said.
During the original three-week murder trial Dixie claimed to have found Miss Bowman dead and proceeded to have sex with her lifeless body after he had been on a drink and drugs binge.
The 18-year-old's body was found next to a skip in Croydon in September 2005.
