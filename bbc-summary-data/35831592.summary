Gwent PCC Ian Johnston 'not seeking re-election' in May

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent will not be seeking re-election in May, he has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Johnston will officially announce his decision to members of the Gwent Police and Crime Panel at their meeting in Usk, Monmouthshire, on Friday.
He described his tenure as "a challenging time but very fulfilling" and said he felt he had "achieved everything I set out to do".
Mr Johnston was elected Gwent's first PCC in November 2012.
Prior to that, he was a Gwent Police officer for 33 years and then served as vice-president and president of the Police Superintendents' Association.
"It has been a huge privilege and an honour to serve the people of Gwent as commissioner and the decision not to stand for a second term has been a difficult one for me to make," he said.
It is now time for me to move on and hand over to the next commissioner.
"Some people still don't accept the concept of the role but I believe that for members of the public, PCCs have brought much more visibility and accountability to policing and have been able to make things happen effectively at a local level."
Mr Johnston said he considered his key achievements to be the launch of a Victims' Charter and the establishment of the Connect Gwent victim's hub - the first multi-agency service of its kind in Wales which supports victims of crime.
He is also known for ordering former chief constable Carmel Napier to "retire or be removed" and for criticising the Welsh Government's attitude to PCCs which he said had "made life difficult".
Last Monday, North Wales PCC Winston Roddick announced he would also be standing down.
Dyfed-Powys PCC Christopher Salmon and South Wales PCC Alun Michael are both seeking re-election on 5 May.
