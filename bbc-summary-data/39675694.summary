[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham v Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham midfielder Stefan Johansen should be fit to start despite being substituted with a knock in last Saturday's 4-1 win over Huddersfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Chris Martin is unavailable as he completes a three-match ban.
Lasse Vibe (ankle) and Ryan Woods (swollen foot) are now both "fighting fit" and available, according to Brentford boss Dean Smith.
However, Alan McCormack (groin) is unlikely to feature and Andreas Bjelland is lacking match fitness.
Slavisa Jokanovic's Fulham go into the match occupying the final play-off place and are three points ahead of seventh-placed Leeds with two games remaining.
Brentford, who have won five of their last seven games, are 13 points behind in ninth, but need two points from their closing matches to better last season's points tally of 65.
