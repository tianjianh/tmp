The 29-year-old from New Zealand, who can play at both fly-half and centre, joins from Auckland-based Super Rugby franchise the Blues.
He will arrive at the club in January 2016 and previously played for London Irish and Leicester Tigers before returning to New Zealand in 2014.
"He's a good footballer, an intelligent footballer," Bath head coach Mike Ford told BBC Radio Bristol.
"We have a little bit of money left in the salary cap and it's an area where we think can be improved and have more rotation.
"It's a two-and-a-half-year contract and I think the fans at the Rec will enjoy watching him.
"I've got a lot of money left, so we're looking to sign one more in the forwards and in the backs."
Bowden himself added: "I know what a tough, entertaining competition the Premiership is, so I can't wait to get back to England and get started with Bath."
