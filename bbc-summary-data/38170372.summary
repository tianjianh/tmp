Carmarthen taxi driver suspended for refusing woman with MS

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Carmarthenshire taxi driver has had his licence suspended for seven days for refusing to take a woman with multiple sclerosis on a short journey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barbara Stensland, 43, from Cardiff, travelled to Carmarthen on 5 August for a meeting of the MS Society.
When she tried to get a taxi from the railway station to the venue less than one mile (1.6km) away, she said driver David Maynard refused to take her.
Mr Maynard said the allegations were a "total fabrication".
He said Ms Stensland told him she would walk "as it was a nice day".
Carmarthenshire council made the decision to suspend Mr Maynard's licence at Thursday's licensing committee.
It found he had refused the fare despite being made aware of Ms Stensland's condition.
The council had considered suspending his licence for longer, but decided against it after Ms Stensland said she did not want Mr Maynard to suffer hardship, especially before Christmas.
Speaking after the meeting, Ms Stensland said: "I'm not a vindictive person.
"All I wanted was an apology. I still haven't received an apology, but I wouldn't go back on saying I wanted as low a sanction as possible."
She said she was pleased her case had raised awareness not only of MS, but of other disabilities.
