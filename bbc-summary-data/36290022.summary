Hotelier Ranjit Singh Power, from Wolverhampton, disappeared on a business trip to the Punjab last year.
A taxi driver has confessed to his murder, but local police now believe he was not working alone, Sanjoy Majumder, BBC India Correspondent said.
Mr Power's family said they want to find out the truth.
They said they are struggling for information from the Foreign Office and other officials in India.
"I keep asking them questions, but I don't seem to be getting any answers... even today I'm pleading.. asking for information from the Foreign Office," Ranjit's brother, Amrik Singh Power, said.
Mr Power was last seen at an airport in Amritsar, Punjab on 8 May. After he did not contact his family for a week, they reported him missing.
Taxi Driver Sukhdev Singh, who was arrested last May, appeared in court on Thursday when his custody was extended until another hearing in July, Sanjoy Majumder said.
He said detectives in the Punjab believe he was acting at the behest of someone else which may have something to do with Mr Power's business dealings in India and the UK.
Local police have yet to find the 54-year-old's body but are treating his death as murder.
In October, his daughter said a body returned to the UK by Punjab police was not her father's.
The body, found in an Indian river, was initially thought to be that of Mr Power but DNA and dental analysis ruled out this possibility.
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said it understood the frustration the family was experiencing but said it was providing help in every way it could.
"We always advise those involved in this kind of case that it is important for them to appoint their own lawyer, as the British High Commission cannot act as a party to legal proceedings."
