The 20-year-old was found dead on Tuesday morning near the refugee home in which he lived.
A post-mortem examination found he had died from wounds to the neck and chest.
An initial police statement reported no suspicious circumstances but a murder investigation was opened on Wednesday.
Volker Beck, a Green MP, accused the police force of negligence and amateurism.
Police have so far not commented on the case but prosecutors say they have assigned 25 detectives to investigate, Reuters news agency reports.
On Monday an estimated 25,000 protesters joined a march in the city organised by Pegida, a group campaigning against the influence of Islam in Europe.
The rallies began in October and have been growing in strength in recent weeks.
Counter-demonstrations have taken place across Germany involving large numbers of protesters.
