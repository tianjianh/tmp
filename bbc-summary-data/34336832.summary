A campaign is being launched to try to encourage more people to enter the teaching profession in Scotland.

The Scottish government's #inspiringteachers campaign will focus on science, technology, engineering and maths.
It will feature people in public life sharing their memories of teachers who inspired them.
The move comes as councils in northern Scotland prepare for a summit to try to tackle local teacher shortages.
Details of the campaign were announced by the Education Secretary Angela Constance at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow.
Ms Constance also announced funding for projects to boost resources for schools in disadvantaged areas.
The government said the Â£1.5m Access to Education Fund would give young people access to additional resources to remove barriers to learning and raise attainment.
This could be delivered in several ways, for instance through improved IT, mentoring schemes and projects to enhance language skills.
Ms Constance said: "We all remember a teacher who inspired us, who brought their subject to life, and we want everyone to share their stories to help attract the best talent into educating young people today.
"We hope that the #inspiringteachers campaign will attract more high-quality, passionate teachers into the profession, particularly in science, technology, engineering and maths where we know there is a demand.
"This is alongside action we are already taking to maintain teacher numbers, encourage and support extra graduates into hard-to-recruit subjects and rural areas. For example, the first students graduating from the part-time distance course we funded at the University of Aberdeen are now teaching in Aberdeenshire and Highland Council schools as probationer teachers."
Next month six councils in northern Scotland will hold a summit meeting to discuss how to tackle local teacher recruitment problems which have left vacancies unfilled.
The issues facing the councils include high housing costs and the broader challenge of attracting people into rural communities.
