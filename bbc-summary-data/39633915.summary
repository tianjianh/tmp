Derek Adams: Plymouth Argyle boss credits wholesale changes for promotion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Having had only four players signed on by mid-June, Plymouth boss Derek Adams says their promotion is down to the wholesale changes made to his team.

A mass exodus after their play-off final defeat meant that 50 days before the new season they had half a team.
However, after starting the season with three defeats, the new-look Pilgrims clinched promotion to League One on Monday, thrashing Newport 6-1.
"People that stand still are a problem," Adams, 41, told BBC Devon.
"You're going to manage to get success if you keep on moving with the times - if you stagnate, you're history.
"I've done it throughout my managerial career, I've done it in six months - you've got to change things to be successful. I was born in Glasgow, so I know what it's like to live under a pressure cooker."
Playmaker Graham Carey was one of the few signed on for this season by mid-June and cannot speak highly enough of his manager, who brought in 14 players over the summer.
"I don't think I can put into words what he's done - to have four players at the start of the season, and to bring in the squad that he's brought in, is testament to him.
"It took us a while to get over that defeat at Wembley but I think the recruitment from the manager and the club has been first class."
Argyle were in the second tier as recently as 2010, but consecutive relegations and administration brought the club to the brink of extinction.
Chris Webb, now club president, was one of many supporters to galvanise Plymouth in their hour of need and is keen not to forget those times.
"The players, the fans, the staff; it's just great for everyone at the club, and finally there's some enjoyment after the dark days."
With the Devon side finally going up after a six-year stay in League Two, chairman James Brent added to BBC Sport: "I've always passionately believed that we are a Championship club in the making."
But despite looking up the league pyramid, he insists they will not spend beyond the club's means.
"We're currently one of the very few profitable clubs - we've made a cash profit for the last three years," says Brent, who claims clubs in the EFL suffered combined losses of Â£245m last season.
"We will still target profitability; we plan to remain as a sustainable club."
Of Plymouth's four out-and-out strikers, remarkably, none have scored more three goals for them this season; midfielder Carey being the shining light with 14 league goals and 14 assists.
The 27-year-old, who has been tipped for a Republic of Ireland call-up by his boss, is out of contract in the summer but has given a positive response to his chances of staying at Home Park.
"At the minute I see my future here, but that's not up to me really - it's up to the manager and the board.
"You never know what can happen in the summer - I'm not saying yes, I'm not saying no, but that's not even in my mind at the minute."
Brent is similarly non-committal, but appreciates that keeping their most post potent attacking threat would be a signal of intent.
"I'm very confident that we want to keep him and I'm very confident that Derek does too and we'll try to achieve that, so we're keeping our fingers crossed."
