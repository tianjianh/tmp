Michael Coulson's low drive past Sam Beasant put the hosts ahead.
John McCombe curled home to double York's advantage, only for Mark Roberts to pull one back from close range.
Roberts was denied a second by goalkeeper Scott Flinders before Corr's tap-in finish on his return from an ankle injury completed their comeback.

York City manager Russ Wilcox told BBC Radio York:
"That first hour we were outstanding. We had to be patient with the ball because Cambridge are a big side.
"We probed and moved the ball around the pitch and it's amazing when you get that bit of quality back in the team.
"The turning point in the game was Michael Coulson coming off but we have to look at the bigger picture with him.
"If we can reproduce that first hour we'll win games but the last half hour was disappointing."
