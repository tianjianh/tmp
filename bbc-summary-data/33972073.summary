The Swedish furniture giant has spent £4m to improve junctions and access to a new store planned for Pincents Lane Retail Park in Reading.
Construction is now set to begin immediately on the site.
A church minister in Calcot asked what Ikea would do for residents to compensate for the "disruption they are going to experience".
Yinka Oyekan, of Reading Community Church, said:"Do they have any plans for apprentices, are they planning to take kids from the local area? It would be great to know there are programmes for youngsters."
Ikea says it is focused on having "a positive impact on people, communities and the environment" and promises to work together on "sustainability projects and social initiatives that focus on children".
A £10m three-level store was approved in 2012 but the furniture company reduced its proposal to two storeys last year to reflect the "ever-changing retail environment".
Some residents and businesses had objected to the original plans because of traffic congestion fears.
Theale councillor Alan Macro said he was still concerned about traffic congestion and parking.
"In the latest plans there's no reserved parking for staff," he said.
