European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley says Wentworth will continue to stage the PGA Championship for years to come but believes the course needs to "significantly" improve.

The tournament has been staged at the prestigious Surrey club since 1984.
But the quality of the greens and course layout changes in 2009 have kept some of Europe's star players away.
"We have every intention to be at Wentworth for a long period of time," said Pelley.
Another issue involves Wentworth residents, who are seeking an increase in the fees paid by the European Tour to hold the event on the estate's West Course.
However, Pelley is confident issues with the course and local residents can be resolved.
"We have to significantly improve the golf course," added Pelley.
"The golf course in particular, where our interest lies, is a golf course that we believe our top players will want to play on year after year."
