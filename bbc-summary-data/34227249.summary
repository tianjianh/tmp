The MoD said fighter jets from RAF Lossiemouth intercepted Russian "blackjack" aircraft flying in international air space on Thursday.
The Typhoon pilots escorted the Russian planes "whilst in the UK area of interest".
Air-to-air refuelling was provided by an aircraft from RAF Brize Norton.
Sqn Ldr Jim Calver, who flew one of the RAF Typhoons involved in the mission, said: "Given the Royal Air Force's enduring commitment to secure the UK's skies, yesterday's sortie once again proved Typhoon's capability to successfully scramble and intercept Russian long-range aviation.
"Protecting our skies is especially poignant in this 75th anniversary year of the Battle of Britain. Working together with ground-based radar and air-to-air refuelling aircraft today's RAF continues to come together as a team to protect our country."
