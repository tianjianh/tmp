Kevin Swindells, 39, carried out the attack after buying alcohol for a number of young teenagers.
He was jailed for seven-and-a-half years after admitting raping the girl at a house in Cupar in May last year.
At the High Court in Edinburgh judge Kenneth Maciver said: "The rape of this 14-year old girl was, in any view, despicable."
He added: "You took violent advantage of her condition and forced yourself on her while she was unable to resist".
Advocate Depute Alison Di Rollo said the victim and her family had found the incident very stressful and difficult to cope with.
Swindells pled guilty to raping the girl on the day his trial was due to begin, after the jury had been selected.
The court heard Swindells had 61 previous convictions, including a 15-month sentence for assault, but no convictions for any sexual offence.
Defence advocate Matt Jackson said Swindells claimed he had been drunk and could not remember anything, but he accepted full responsibility for what happened that night.
Judge Maciver told Swindells the only favourable or mitigating factor was his decision - albeit at a very late stage - to plead guilty and save the victim and others from having to give evidence.
The judge said he had "betrayed the trust of the children".
He said: "You knew she and other friends were staying the night in your house. You knew they had been drinking.
"They were entitled to feel they would be safe in your house. They were not safe. She was not safe".
