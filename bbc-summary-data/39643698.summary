Widnes' Chris Houston and St Helens' Kyle Amor escape suspensions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Widnes Vikings forward Chris Houston and St Helens prop Kyle Amor have avoided suspensions after disciplinary hearings on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Houston was found not guilty of making contact with a match official in Widnes' loss to Warrington on 13 April.
Amor was sent off for a high tackle on Wigan's Liam Marshall in Saints' local derby defeat at Wigan a day later.
He was found guilty but the charge against him was downgraded and the red card was deemed sufficient punishment.
Huddersfield half-back Danny Brough has been suspended for one match and fined Â£300 after being found guilty of using foul and abusive language towards a match official.
Warrington hooker Daryl Clark, Wigan centre Anthony Gelling and Leigh's Gregg McNally all took early guilty pleas to their respective charges.
Clark and Gelling have received one-match bans, while McNally will miss his side's next two games.
