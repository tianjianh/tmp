Military commendation for Swindon shell case engravers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Swindon engraver who has inscribed hundreds of shell cases in tribute to soldiers killed in Afghanistan, has received a military commendation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Since 2009, Vince Ayris has engraved 322 ceremonial shells - fired in honour after a soldier is killed in action.
The polished shells, inscribed with the soldier's name, cap badge and details, are then presented to family members.
He said: "We're happy to have been of service to the Armed Forces but we don't want to do another one at all."
Mr Ayris, who runs a trophy shop in the town, began engraving shells for the families of the fallen after a friend in the army suggested it would help the grieving process.
"He called me up and said: 'How much?' and I said I couldn't possibly due to the fact this guy's given the ultimate sacrifice for his country," he said.
Since then, Mr Ayris and his staff have given their time to inscribe hundreds of shells, brought back with the repatriated bodies of UK service personnel.
"There's a lot of work that goes in, and the regimental cap badges are quite intricate and can take anything from four hours up to two days," he said.
"But it's an important thing that I wanted to do, and is something that you can't do for one and not the rest."
In recognition of their work, Mr Ayris and his co-worker Luke Seago were presented with a commendation of thanks by the Mercian Regiment.
"We've had 25 Mercian soldiers killed in all and it does mean such a lot to the families," said Lt Col Temminick.
"They have dedicated so much of their time and we wanted to show our gratitude."
