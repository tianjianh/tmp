Scottish League One: Livingston held as Queen's Park go fourth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish League One leaders Livingston were held to a 0-0 draw with Stranraer while nearest challengers Airdrieonians saw their game postponed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The result moved Stranraer off the bottom of the division while Airdrie's visit to Brechin City was called off because of a waterlogged pitch.
Queen's Park moved into the top four with a 2-0 win over Stenhousemuir, who slipped to bottom on goal difference.
And Peterhead drew 1-1 with Albion Rovers in the other League One game.
Alloa Athletic v East Fife had previously been postponed due to the Fifers' Scottish Cup meeting with St Mirren. East Fife lost 3-2.
At Ochilview, on-loan Hearts forward Dario Zanatta fired Queen's Park ahead and although the Spiders had Ross Millen sent off for two bookings, Anton Brady added a stoppage-time second for Gus MacPherson's side. They are two points in front of Brechin, who have a game in hand, and a point off Alloa.
Eighth-placed Peterhead led Albion Rovers through Rory McAllister's cool first-half finish but Ross Stewart swept in an equaliser in the second half.
The two sides are level on points - four ahead of Stranraer and Stenhousemuir.
Livi, who threatened through Scott Pittman at home to Stranraer, are 11 points clear of Airdrie and 12 ahead of Alloa.
