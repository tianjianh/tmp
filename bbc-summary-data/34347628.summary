Southampton boss Ronald Koeman says he is happy at the club amid fresh speculation he could be offered the Netherlands manager's job next month.

The Dutch have two Euro 2016 qualifiers in October and need Turkey to drop points to make the play-offs.
Dutchman Koeman, 52, has been touted as a potential candidate to take over if coach Danny Blind does not stay on.
"I'm very settled here. I have a contract with Southampton until the end of next season," Koeman said.
"What will happen after that nobody knows, but until that date I am the coach of Southampton."
Blind took over following the departure of previous boss Guus Hiddink earlier in the year but presided over back-to-back qualifying defeats in September.
Koeman, who took over as Southampton manager in June 2014, made 78 appearances for the Netherlands between 1982 and 1994.
