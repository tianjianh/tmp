The so-called Islamic State (IS) group said it carried out both attacks.
A bomber killed at least eight people and wounded 29 in the Jadida district. At least nine died and 30 were injured in another attack in the Bayaa area.
IS has carried out a series of bombings in government-held areas this year, although the group continues to lose ground to US-backed government forces.
