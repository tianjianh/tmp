The 19-year-old was walking on Wilson Street towards Glassford Street when she was spoken to by a man who then attacked her at about 03:35 on Sunday.
Police said the suspect was described as eastern European, around 5ft 10in, with a slim build and short dark hair.
He was wearing a waist-length black leather jacket, jeans and dark-coloured shoes.
Following the attack, the woman was helped by two other men who escorted her until she was met by a friend.
Detectives are appealing for these two men to contact them as they could provide further details on the suspect.
Det Insp Craig Willison said: "It's imperative we trace the man responsible for this attack.
"We are still in the process of gathering relevant CCTV images in the hope that they will provide us with additional information about the suspect.
"However, I would like to appeal to the two men who came to the aid of the young woman as I'm sure they will have information which could assist our inquiries and I'm urging them to get in touch."
The first man is described as around 5ft 6in, with short dark hair. He was wearing a black bomber-style jacket, dark trousers, and white trainers.
The second man is around 5ft 10in with short grey hair. He was wearing a black jacket with the hood up, dark jeans and dark trainers with white on the heels and soles.
