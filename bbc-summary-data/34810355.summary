Joe Daniels, 18, of Bargoed, Caerphilly county, died on 9 November after a Seat Ibiza hit a pole on Aberdare Road at about 22:30 GMT on 11 October.
Best friends Rhys Jones, 18, and Ryan Gibbons, 20, also from Bargoed, died at the time.
A 20-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and released on bail.
Mr Daniels's family said in a statement: "We are completely heartbroken and devastated at the loss of Joe at such a young age.
"He was an amazing personality who loved life, his family and his friends. Joe was a much-loved son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin.
"He will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him. We take comfort knowing that he has been reunited with his 'brothers' Rhys and Ryan."
