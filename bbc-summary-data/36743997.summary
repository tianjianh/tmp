A man, said to be in his late teens, got into the Vauxhall Astra after their mother left it to go to a shop in Kempe Road, Enfield, at 12:45 BST on 2 July.
The boy was found 35 minutes later outside a property in Cheshunt.
The Met said: "The fact that she threw herself out of moving vehicle just shows how frightened she was."
Det Insp Chris Rixon said: "All the victims involved have been put through an awful ordeal, none more so than the little 12-year-old girl.
"She is a very fortunate little girl as the situation could have been so much worse, it could have resulted in her sustaining significant injuries or could have resulted in her dying had she been hit by an oncoming car."
She was treated for minor injuries.
The driver has been described as white, with light spiky hair and was possibly wearing a hooded top. Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.
The car was found abandoned on Coopers Walk in Cheshunt at 13:00.
Det Insp Rixon said: "The suspect is an opportunist who showed little regard for the welfare and the safety of the children.
"What happened is every parent's worse nightmare and I'm specifically appealing for the suspect to give himself up now before it is too late.
"I'm certain that friends and family of the suspect know what he has done."
