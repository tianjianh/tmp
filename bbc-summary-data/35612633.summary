Researchers at the University of Roehampton, in England, studied a group of ten king penguins.
They measured the penguins' weight and studied their movements on a treadmill, finding that fatter birds were less steady on their feet.
The team think wobbly penguins may face greater danger from predators as they slide around and struggle to stay upright.
