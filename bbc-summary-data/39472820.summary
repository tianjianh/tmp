Brendan Rodgers' side had already lifted the Scottish League Cup before securing the Premiership title with a 5-0 thrashing of Hearts on Sunday.
Celtic are in the Scottish Cup semi-finals, so a clean sweep is possible.
"It's our main goal now," Lustig told BBC Scotland. "We play for Celtic and every game we want to win."
Celtic are unbeaten domestically in both cup and league since the start of the season and face city rivals Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-final on 23 April.
Asked if finishing the season unbeaten is realistic, despite Rodgers promising to rest some players before the end of the campaign, Lustig said: "Absolutely. It is going to be tough and we have to stay humble and remain focused, but we've got a big squad and people coming in who can do the job."
Previous manager Ronny Deila won two successive titles and Lustig believes performances have improved this season under Rodgers.
"The players got a lot more confident and the main thing is the manager and backroom staff work with us every day to keep us focused," said the Sweden defender.
"We knew we had really good players in the squad and we took in some players for this season who made a really big impact.
"But, even with the same players as last season, the confidence is much higher now."
Celtic also began their league campaign with a 2-1 win against Hearts at Tynecastle.

"It has been a brilliant season and it's really nice to settle it here," said Lustig.
"We set up some goals before the season and the first game of the season was against Hearts here and it's really nice to win the title here as well."
Celtic have another Glasgow derby to contend with before the cup semi-final, with in-form Partick Thistle visiting on Premiership duty.
"It doesn't matter that we have won the league," said Lustig.
"We will focus again on Partick Thistle on Wednesday and getting three points there."
