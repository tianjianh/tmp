[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Bishop of Llandaff considered in second meeting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fresh meeting to consider nominations for the new Bishop of Llandaff is set to take place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last month, an electoral college of 47 people, including all the bishops in Wales, met over three days to vote on a confidential candidates list.
But it ended with no result as none of the candidates received the two-thirds majority needed.
On Tuesday, the bishops will consider new nominations which were put forward in a consultation.
Under the terms of the Church's constitution, the responsibility of filling the vacancy following the first failed vote falls to the Bench of Bishops.
The Bishop of Swansea and Brecon, John Davies, who is president of the electoral college, had called for a "wide-ranging" consultation involving both the laity and the clergy.
From that, the bishops will now consider the names put forward as potential candidates.
The election follows the retirement of Dr Barry Morgan at the end of January.
