It could be seen soaring about 70m (230ft) above houses in Cartbridge Lane, Halewood, from about 12:00 BST.
The leak erupted close to the former Bridgefield Forum site, which is being developed for housing.
A spokesman for United Utilities said engineers had been sent to the scene to carry out a "controlled shut-off".
