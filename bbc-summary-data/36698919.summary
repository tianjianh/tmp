Southern Rail is to announce an amended timetable to deal with ongoing disruption to services caused by a dispute over the role of conductors.

The network has been hit by strikes and short-notice cancellations since April.
Managers faced passengers at a public meeting in Hove on Saturday, where it was revealed details of the new timetable would be given on Tuesday.
Dyan Crowther, chief operating officer of Southern's owner Govia Thameslink, said it would be brought in on 11 July.
"We're doing that to match the number of staff that we have to the timetable," she said.
"It's really, really important we accept that what we have not been able to do is to provide customer certainty.
"By putting in an amended timetable that's what we're going to be able to do."
Southern trains from the south coast into London have been disrupted because of industrial action by RMT union members and high levels of staff sickness.
Last week, Hove MP Peter Kyle revealed some commuters had been given written warnings for consistent lateness at work because of the "shameful" service.
"The shambles we have seen is turning into a crisis," he told the House of Commons.
