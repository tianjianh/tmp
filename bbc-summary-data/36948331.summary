Three Pokestops, the game's real-world locations, attracted hundreds of players to a park in inner Sydney.
Nearby apartment residents endured traffic jams, piles of rubbish and noise until the early hours.
The creators of the game are working to remove some real-world locations that do not wish to be included in the mobile game.
"There is loud shouting throughout the night, people dumping rubbish and cigarette butts and constant traffic jams," one of the apartment's residents told the Sydney Morning Herald last week.
The local council has put on extra rangers and undertaken extra garbage collection to deal with the influx of players at Peg Paterson Park in Rhodes.
There were also reports of disgruntled apartment residents water bombing Pokemon Go players.
"When playing  Pokemon Go, we ask that people do this with consideration to where they are: in residential areas, keep noise levels to a minimum and bin any rubbish," Canada Bay deputy mayor Helen McCaffrey said.
The Anzac Memorial in Sydney, Arlington National Cemetery in the US and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan have asked to be removed from Pokemon Go.
