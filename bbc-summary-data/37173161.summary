[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Indies & South Africa pitches rated 'poor' after rain-affected Tests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The outfields for the Tests between West Indies and India, and South Africa and New Zealand, have been rated "poor" by the International Cricket Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Only 22 overs were bowled in the fourth Test in Trinidad as the surface was unplayable following pre-match rain.
The last three days of the first Test in Durban were wiped out after heavy rain saturated a newly laid outfield.
The West Indies Cricket Board and Cricket South Africa may be warned or fined up to $15,000.
Both boards have 14 days to respond to the match referees' reports.
A draw at Port of Spain meant India, who won the four-match series 2-0, were usurped at the top of the ICC Test rankings by Pakistan.
