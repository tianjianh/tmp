Keith Heslop's victim lost a tooth and was left covered in bruises following the attack at the Premier Inn at Airth, near Falkirk, in March 2011.
Heslop, 45, formerly of Spennymoor, County Durham was jailed at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Judge Lord Malcolm told him: "Only a substantial prison sentence is appropriate."
Lord Malcolm said it was clear from a victim impact statement prepared by the woman that the attack had "a devastating effect on her".
The victim was in a distraught state when she spoke to a relative on the phone after the attack and was still upset when she later saw her.
The woman later told a friend in a text that Heslop "wouldn't take no for an answer."
The victim's friend told the trial: "She did say that he had raped her after that.
"She said a tooth was missing and that she was covered in bruises."
Defence counsel Margaret Breslin said Heslop continued to maintain that he was innocent of the rape.
She said: "There is no record for violence and certainly no record for offences similar to this - nothing of a sexual nature."
Heslop was also placed on the sex offenders' register.
