Norfolk mental health support line given reprieve

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mental health crisis line in Norfolk, threatened with closure, has won a reprieve.

The support line, run by staff from the charity Mind, received more than 6,000 calls in its first six months.
It was due to close this month after the local NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) failed to agree to a way of funding it.
Now the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust (NSFT) is to pay for the service, until at least the end of the year.
The helpline offers support to existing NSFT service users over the age of 18 or those who were discharged up to 12 months ago, to avoid a mental health crisis occurring or escalating.
About 90% of callers to NSFT's crisis team are from people who know they need support but are not in crisis - so many can be helped before their issues become too serious.
Michael Scott, chief executive at NSFT, said: "The helpline has been a great benefit to our service users and we know that local feeling ran very high when it looked like it may close."
Amanda Hedley, chief executive at Norwich and Central Norfolk Mind, said: "This is really, really great news for Mind, the trust and above all those who have found the helpline to be an invaluable lifeline."
Mind will be looking at ways to raise additional funds to further enhance the helpline, she added.
The pilot project was launched by former health minister, North Norfolk Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, in January this year.
Earlier in the month a new mental health telephone helpline for patients in west Norfolk was announced.
It was developed jointly by West Norfolk CCG, West Norfolk Mind and NSFT.
The service in King's Lynn, which goes live in September, will provide west Norfolk patients with help and support closer to home from Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00.
