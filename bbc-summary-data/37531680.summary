Valencia: La Liga club appoint ex-Italy boss Cesare Prandelli

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spanish side Valencia have appointed former Italy boss Cesare Prandelli as their new full-time manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prandelli, 59, replaces former Liverpool assistant manager Pako Ayestaran, who was sacked after Los Che lost their opening four La Liga games.
Valencia won both games under caretaker boss Voro to move off the bottom.
Prandelli, who has not managed since a brief spell at Galatasaray in 2014, will take over after Sunday's home match against Atletico Madrid.
He will watch the game against fourth-placed Atletico from the Mestalla stands before leading his first training session on Monday.
The Italian led his nation between 2010 and 2014, taking them to the Euro 2012 final where they lost against Spain, then resigning after group-stage elimination at the World Cup in Brazil two years later.
He returned to management shortly after at Turkish giants Galatasaray, only to be sacked 147 days later.
