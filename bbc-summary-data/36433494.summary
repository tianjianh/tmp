The 23-year-old was Dagenham's top scorer in League Two with eight goals as they were relegated.
Forest Green, who lost the National League promotion final, have also added defender Jon Moran from Nantwich Town on a contract until 2018.
"I want to score 20-plus goals," Doidge told the club website.
"I want to top score in this league - that's my target - if I don't score that many I'll be very disappointed."
Moran, who can play centre-back or right-back, added: "Ambition has brought me here - every young kid wants to get as high as they can and I know that Forest Green can take me there."
The pair are Mark Cooper's first signings since becoming Forest Green manager in May.
Meanwhile, Cooper has appointed Scott Lindsey as his assistant, with Steve Hale becoming goalkeeping coach and Tom Huelin coming in as fitness coach - all three joining from Swindon.
