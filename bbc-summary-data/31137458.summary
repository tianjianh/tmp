Part of the Belfast to Dublin railway line has been closed due to a security alert in Lurgan, County Armagh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said there were made aware of suspicious activity around the Bells Row crossing at the town's Antrim Road.
Translink has said bus substitutions are in place between Lisburn and Portadown.
The Antrim Road and Cornakinnegar Roads are closed at the railway crossing point. There are no further details.
The deputy mayor of Craigavon, Sinn FÃ©in's Catherine Seeley, condemned those behind the alert.
"This is another attack on the local community and on commuters travelling to and from Belfast," she said.
"Those responsible should be under no doubt that it has done nothing except disrupt the lives of people going about their daily business."
