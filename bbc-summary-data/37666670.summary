Hoilett joined on a free transfer on 10 October and was Warnock's first signing as Bluebirds boss.
The 26-year-old Canadian, who worked with Warnock at previous club QPR, made his Cardiff debut in Friday's 2-1 Championship win over Bristol City.
"It's great when you have a manager who believes in you," said Hoilett.
"I was 100% ready to go. I worked with him at QPR and he gave me an extra boost. I love working under Neil Warnock, so it was a no-brainer to come here to Cardiff," he added.
Warnock's first game in charge attracted the biggest crowd of the season so far at Cardiff City Stadium, 22,776, and Canada player Hoilett loved the experience.
"You could see everyone was giving their all. Everyone was running that extra yard for each other, putting tackles in," he added.
"We got the result, which is great for getting the bragging rights in a local derby. The atmosphere was magnificent."
