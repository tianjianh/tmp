Fertility treatment: Lesbian couple 'had to go private' to get names on baby's birth certificate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lesbian couple expecting their first child have said they had no option but to pay for private fertility treatment to ensure both of their names would be on the baby's birth certificate.

Sarah Murphy and Jenny Doherty tried to get treatment from the NHS, but were told they were ineligible.
The women, from Greysteel in County Londonderry, have been together for almost five years.
They said it was important that the procedure was legal and above board.
"That was one of the main reasons why we chose to go through a clinic and not to do it ourselves," Ms Murphy said.
"As we aren't in a same sex marriage or in a civil partnership, Jenny's name will now be on the baby's birth certificate as the legal parent.
"If we had done it ourselves, there could have been a court battle.
"This process makes it easy - from the day she's born, she is Jenny's child as well as mine."
The couple contacted the BBC after an interview with another same-sex couple who were also unable to access fertility treatment on the NHS.
Ms Murphy said she was left feeling inferior and embarrassed when she attended the Western Health Trust and the regional fertility centre.
"The health service weren't very helpful to be honest," she said.
"I think from the moment we walked in the door, we were almost dismissed.
"We felt embarrassed for wanting something that every other human in the world wants."
In a statement, the Western Health Trust said it did not comment on individual cases.
But it added that anyone who has an issue in relation to their treatment should raise it through its comments and complaints system.
Ms Murphy, who is 25, said the procedure by which gay people become parents must become easier.
"For one, [there needs to be] better knowledge among GPs," she said.
"Even if you could be told: 'We can offer you this or we can't offer you that' - that would be a massive help, instead of walking out with more questions than you walk in.
"We've been through a lot of heartbreak."
Although the couple said they felt disappointed by their experience with the NHS, they have no regrets about using a private clinic to enable Ms Murphy to become pregnant, despite it costing them about Â£6,000.
"We were treated as a couple who wanted to have a baby, just the same as every other couple who were there," Ms Murphy said.
"It has been expensive, and without loans and credit cards and help from my parents we wouldn't have been able to afford it.
"It has been priceless and we would do it again in a heartbeat, but at the same time we wish we didn't have to spend that much."
She said that her parents are particularly delighted that they are going to become grandparents.
When she first told them she was gay, they thought it was "almost like a door shut for them".
"Now they can't wait," she said.
