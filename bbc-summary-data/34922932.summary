Radio X - the new name for Xfm - launched in September with DJs Chris Moyles and Johnny Vaughan.
But the registration of Radio X as a trademark with the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has been opposed.
The similarly-named independent station Radio EXE owns the IP of "Radio EXE and similar sounding marks" in the categories Radio X was refused.
But the established Exeter-based operation has refused to comment on speculation it was behind the opposition.
Global, whose other stations include Smooth, Classic FM and Capital, will have to either stop using the name, appeal the decision, or strike a deal with the opposing party.
A spokesman for Global was not available for comment.
The launch of Radio X saw former BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles return to the airwaves,
His breakfast show sees him go head-to-head with his successor on BBC Radio 1's breakfast show, Nick Grimshaw.
Moyles attracted eight million listeners at the peak of his Radio 1 show. Grimshaw currently attracts an audience of about 5.8 million.
Vaughan, Vernon Kay and the Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson also have their own shows on Radio X.
When it was announced that Xfm would be revamped, Radio X promised to play the "best fresh rock and guitar-based music across the UK" and be the "first truly male-focused" station, targeted at 25-44 year olds.
