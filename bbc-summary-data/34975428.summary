[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee residents who were forced to move out of their homes two years ago after a wall collapsed have finally been allowed to move back in.

The collapse of the retaining wall in December 2013 caused a landslip next to the flats at 2 Gardner Street.
The block was evacuated after fears the collapse could affect its "structural stability".
Repairs to the wall have cost almost Â£777,000. Residents will be allowed back in on 7 December.
Dundee City Council said councillors had approved the work to repair the wall in March 2015.
Ken Guild, convener of the council's policy and resources committee said: "I am delighted that residents will be able to get back into their homes.
"When no one took responsibility for the necessary work, the council stepped in to carry out permanent repairs which has proved to be a success.
"Now that we have reached a conclusion, residents can get settled as soon as possible."
The council said work still needed to be done in the rear garden of the property.
