Documents and other items have been removed from the Eagle Medical Practice since the raid on Thursday morning.
No arrests have been made but Dr Rory Lyons, who runs the surgery, has been suspended.
Guernsey's health department said concerns about one death this year triggered its initial investigation.
Police entered the surgery, which has about 500 patients out of an island population of about 1,900, at about 10:30 BST on Thursday.
As well as the surgery in Ollivier Street, St Anne's, a private residence on the island has also been searched.
Guernsey Police Chief Patrick Rice said it began looking at the surgery after "concerns were raised with the Health and Social Services Department following the death of a patient who had been under the care of the Eagle Medical Practice".
Dr Carol Tozer, chief officer of Guernsey's Health and Social Services Department (HSSD), which is responsible for the health and well-being of the people of Alderney, said: "We can confirm that concerns were raised with HSSD shortly after the death of a patient earlier this year.
"The internal HSSD investigation began immediately and identified three further deaths of concern, all occurring within the last 18 months."
The General Medical Council had also been informed, the department added.
HSSD staff have been sent to Alderney to provide information and advice to concerned patients.
