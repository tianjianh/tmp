Carvalhal has guided the Owls to successive top six finishes in his two seasons with the club.
They were beaten by Hull City in last year's final before losing on penalties to Huddersfield this year.
The Owls have not disclosed the length of the contracts the Portuguese and his coaching staff have signed.
There had been speculation that the Portuguese would leave the club after the defeat by the Terriers last Wednesday.
However, the former Besiktas boss said: "In the club there are two people who make decisions: the chairman and me.
"I will have some time back home and then I will sit down with the chairman next week. I like the club and I have a good relationship with the chairman. I have no problems here. We will see what is decided."
