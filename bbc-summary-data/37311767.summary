The salary cap limit currently stands at £6.5m, but this will rise to £7m at the start of the 2017-18 season.
"We have a very strong and highly competitive league," Premiership Rugby chief executive Mark McCafferty said.
"The salary cap framework is essential to maintaining its strength and protecting the competitive uncertainty which is its hallmark."
The board of Premiership Rugby decided unanimously to retain the level of the cap at £7m, following the increases for next season announced in October 2015.
The decision will be welcomed by some club bosses, who are concerned that a continuous rise in the salary cap will lead to wage inflation.
In July, McCafferty warned the league must monitor player wage inflation after the Rugby Football Union and the Premiership signed a new agreement regarding access to England players worth in excess of £225m.
