Top Northern Ireland prosecutor Barra McGrory 'to step down'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's director of public prosecutions is expected to announce on Wednesday that he is stepping down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood that Barra McGrory QC will stay in office until the autumn.
He became the first Catholic to hold the post when he was appointed in November 2011.
In recent months he has been in the eye of a political storm for prosecuting former soldiers for killings during Northern Ireland's Troubles.
His appointment five-and-a-half years ago ruffled the feathers of some unionist politicians.
As one of Northern Ireland's best known criminal lawyers he had represented Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and other senior republicans.
Mr McGrory pointed out that he had also represented loyalist paramilitaries, unionist politicians and former police officers.
He has been strongly criticised by a number of Conservative Party MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party in recent months for decisions to prosecute former soldiers.
They claimed that cases involving soldiers were being unfairly prioritised.
There were even calls for him to be sacked.
Earlier this year, he told the BBC that those who accused him of treating former soldiers unfairly had insulted him and his office.
Mr McGrory said he was mystified by the claims that he did not act impartially when he brought charges against a small number of ex-soldiers.
His decision to leave the post is expected to be announced at a staff meeting on Wednesday morning.
It is understood he plans to return to his private legal practice.
Sources have said that his decision is not connected to the criticism he has faced in recent months.
