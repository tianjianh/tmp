Plans for a waste transfer station to replace a landfill site in the Borders are to go on public display.

Design proposals for the Â£5.5m facility at Easter Langlee near Galashiels will go on show on later this month.
Councillors decided in August last year to close a landfill site in the area when it reaches capacity in 2018.
It would be replaced by the new facility which will prepare household waste for transfer outside the Scottish Borders.
Councillor Gordon Edgar said: "The plans for a waste transfer station are important due to changing legislation which led to the council deciding to close the landfill site at Easter Langlee.
"The project team has already met with resident groups close to Easter Langlee but we would encourage members of the public to come along to this consultation event to see the plans and ask council officers any questions they may have about the project.
"After the public exhibition, the aim is for the full planning application to be submitted next month, and if approved the waste transfer station is expected to open in 2018."
The proposed design of the facility will be available to view from 15:00 to 20:00 in the Blue Room at Langlee Community Centre on 29 September.
