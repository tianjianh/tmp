[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough ended a five-match winless run with a well-deserved win over Cardiff City in the Championship.

Fabio put City ahead with a half-volley from 25 yards, but the hosts levelled when Matthew Connolly turned Gaston Ramirez's header into his own goal.
Ramirez then side-footed Boro into the lead, before Grant Leadbitter had a penalty saved after a trip on Ramirez.
David Nugent sealed the win shortly after, slotting in from close range after good work by Albert Adomah.
Jordan Rhodes, making his first home start since joining Middlesbrough from Blackburn in January, could have given his side an unassailable lead in the first half, as he squandered a host of chances.
Fabio made the hosts pay for their wasteful finishing with a stunning effort after the Teessiders failed to clear a corner, but Connolly's third own goal of the season quickly brought Boro back on terms.
The hosts continued to dominate after the break and got their reward when Rhodes turned provider to set up Ramirez, who coolly slotted home from eight yards out.
Leadbitter's tame penalty was saved by Marshall, but the City keeper could do nothing to prevent substitute Nugent from wrapping up the three points with a right-footed effort moments later.
Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka:
"Now, we are good again. It was really important for the mentality of the players. Not for me, because I was calm. I know the players and know how good we are, but for them, I think it is important to have won again.
"Hopefully, now we can start a good run again. I was really pleased with them.
"It was difficult, and we conceded a goal even though it wasn't really a chance for them. After that, though, the players had a really good reaction."
Cardiff City manager Russell Slade told BBC Radio Wales: "It was a fantastic goal from Fabio.
"It was an absolute wonder goal that gets us in front, but then we almost conspired even before they equalised to help give them a lift and get back in the game.
"And as it happens we've given the ball away - Scott Malone's given the ball away on the half-way line and they've punished us.
"And you can't afford to do that against sides of this calibre away from home and the same happened with the third goal.
"We give it away again on the half-way line and we got punished."
