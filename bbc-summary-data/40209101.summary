Chris Ruane beat James Davies, regaining the seat he had held for 18 years before losing it in 2015.
Labour's Ian Lucas held on to Wrexham, a key Tory target, with a 48.9% share of the vote.
The party also retained Clwyd South with Susan Elan Jones, Delyn with David Hanson and Alyn and Deeside through Mark Tami.
But the Conservatives' David Jones, Brexit minister and former Welsh Secretary, held on to Clwyd West.
Mr Ruane said he was "elated" to win back Vale of Clwyd, adding one of his priorities was to ensure the constituency did not lose out financially from Brexit.
He said: "If we are leaving Europe, I want to make sure that those Tory pledges that we wouldn't lose out are kept."
Susan Elan Jones tweeted to say she would be back to work on Saturday, adding: "Thanks to all for kind messages".
Mr Lucas, Mr Tami, Mr Jones and Mr Hanson also all tweeted to thank their supporters.
