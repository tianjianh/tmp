Moya, 40, will join Toni Nadal and Francis Roig in working with the 14-time Grand Slam champion.
Moya, who parted with Milos Raonic last month, said he and world number nine Nadal's team had a "common project".
"To have someone like Carlos who is not only a friend but also a very important person in my career is something special," said Nadal, 30.
Moya will also work at the Rafa Nadal Academy.
He said: "Rafa is a special player and, above all, a great person and friend."
