[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torquay United P-P Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Torquay United's National League match with Chester has been postponed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Standing water on parts of the Plainmoor pitch has led to Saturday's game being called off, after an inspection at 12:00 GMT on Friday.
It is the second successive Saturday postponement for both clubs, with the Gulls' FA Trophy game at home to Macclesfield succumbing to the weather, as did Chester's tie at Halifax.
No new date has yet been announced for the fixture.
