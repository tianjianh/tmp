[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot made it six league games unbeaten with an excellent National League win at Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Teenager Kundai Benyu lit the blue touch paper on 19 minutes for Gary Waddock's men, netting with a fabulous free-kick that whipped past the wall.
Jay Saunders' strugglers belied their status in the relegation zone and pressed Aldershot back for long spells after the break.
However, the Hampshire side put matters beyond doubt late on when Jonny Giles swung in a terrific cross from the left and Jake Gallagher volleyed the ball into the net.
Alex Flisher crashed a shot against the bar for Maidstone in stoppage time, but it was too little too late for the hosts.
