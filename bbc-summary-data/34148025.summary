The visitors had found themselves frustrated for large periods but Gareth Bale headed home from Jazz Richards's cross to secure the win.
How well did the Wales players perform out of 10 at the GSP Stadium in Nicosia?
The out-of-favour Crystal Palace goalkeeper dealt with crosses well and was generally solid, but did not have to produce any outstanding saves.
Kept his place after impressing in June's win against Belgium and the right wing-back caught the eye again with an excellent cross for Bale's winner.
Had little to do defensively but tracked opposition runners diligently and remained calm on the ball.
An imposing presence and calming influence at the heart of Wales' defence, extinguishing the fleeting moments of danger with some assertive challenges.
Despite a couple of nervous moments as he tracked back, the Tottenham defender was neat in possession on his return from injury.
Offered Wales width with overlapping runs on the left wing and accomplished his defensive tasks efficiently.
Asked to play a holding role in Joe Allen's absence, the Leicester midfielder offered defensive cover but was occasionally a little sloppy in possession.
Brought in as a late replacement for Joe Ledley, the Wolves midfielder was also careless with the ball at times but stuck to his defensive duties well.
Impressed in the first half having been given licence to roam in front of King and Edwards but his influence waned in a disappointing second period.
Below par for 82 minutes, Wales' talisman came alive in the nick of time to provide the game's defining moment.
Worked tirelessly with very limited service but could have done better with his passing on the rare occasions he found himself in space in Cyprus's half.
Robson-Kanu was replaced by Sam Vokes and Simon Church replaced Bale with 90 minutes on the clock, while Shaun MacDonald came on for Ramsey deep into stoppage time as Chris Coleman looked to see the game out.
None of the three had enough time to make an impression on the match.
