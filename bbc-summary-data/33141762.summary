[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martyn Rogers, 66, from Newport, died of blood poisoning and acute liver failure at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, in July 2012.
Liver specialist Prof David Paul Berry will not face police action after the "avoidable" deaths of eight patients in his care.
His practising restrictions were recently extended to February 2016.
The settlement figure has not been disclosed.
A Cardiff and Vale University Health Board spokesman said: "Mr Berry is not currently carrying out any clinical duties for the health board pending the conclusion of the health board's internal procedures."
The General Medical Council (GMC) placed restrictions on Prof Berry in March 2013.
A professional review of 31 of his patients found 10 died and "eight of those 10 deaths were avoidable".
Maria Davies, Mr Rogers' partner of 40 years, said: "Neither myself or my family feel that we have secured justice for Martyn and we will continue to campaign and search for answers and I hope by highlighting what happened to Martyn that we are able to ensure that no further people will suffer from the same substandard care as he did."
