[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Snow spot census' being carried out on Scottish hills

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walkers and climbers are being asked to take part in a summer survey of the last remaining patches of snow on Scotland's hills.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
August's "snow census" will be the eighth time the survey has been carried out - covering the Cairngorms to Glencoe, the Nevis range and beyond.
Researchers say this year's findings should be especially interesting.
The amount of snow remaining on the hills so far means there is likely to be even more data than usual.
The survey will take place over a weekend in late August and will rely on the help of volunteers.
Last year's survey recorded almost 300 patches of snow in August - the largest was on Ben Nevis and was 10m deep.
