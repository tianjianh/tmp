The Bristol-born 31-year-old played 136 times for Ulster and has 11 Ireland caps, the most recent of which came against Scotland in 2015.
He returned to action in October after 10 months on the sidelines with a fractured ankle.
"He's a formidable presence in the second row and an experienced lineout operator," Bristol's acting head coach Mark Tainton told the club website.
"I know Dan well from his time in the Ireland international set-up. His knowledge of the game at the highest level, as well as his leadership skills, will be of significant benefit to the team."
Tuohy is a product of Weston-Super-Mare RFC's youth system and had spells at Gloucester and Exeter before joining Ulster in 2009.
He has been troubled by injuries in recent years, also suffering a broken arm against Wales during the 2014 Six Nations.
"I know what Bristol Rugby is all about and what it means to the passionate supporters," Tuohy said.
"I want to thank Ulster Rugby and the IRFU for the past seven and a half years and wish them the very best in the future. My attention now turns to helping Bristol retain their place in the Premiership."
Ulster director of rugby Les Kiss said: "When Bristol made the approach, it was only fair that we considered it and the outcome is very suitable for all parties."
Details of Tuohy's contract with Bristol have not been disclosed.
