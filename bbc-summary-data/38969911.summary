The 29-year-old's two-year extension comes after more than 370 appearances for the Dons, the only club he has played for.
He made his senior debut in 2004 and won the Scottish League Cup with Aberdeen just under 10 years later.
"I'm delighted to have signed again," said Considine. "I've always enjoyed playing football here."
In recent weeks, left-back Graeme Shinnie and winger Jonny Hayes have committed themselves to Aberdeen until the end of season 2018-19.
"We've got quite a small squad and the unity amongst the boys is fantastic and I just want to be part of that," Considine explained.
"At the moment, the team's doing very, very well and that helps. This team really is going places."
Aberdeen, who reached the Scottish Cup quarter-finals by beating Ross County on Saturday, play Motherwell in Wednesday's rearranged Scottish Premiership fixture and can go three points clear of third-placed Rangers.
Forward Niall McGinn, defender Ash Taylor and captain and midfielder Ryan Jack are nearing the end of their current contracts with Aberdeen.
And manager Derek McInnes said: "Hopefully, over the next few weeks there is more clarity about that.
"All these talks are ongoing and hopefully we can, as we have done, go quietly about our business.
"Andy thoroughly deserves his new deal. If he plays another few games, he's into the top 10 of all-time appearances for Aberdeen, which is testament to him. He's played under a lot of managers.
"He's a player who has really improved. His level of performance has been excellent. Athletically, Andy's in great nick. He looks after himself, a top pro. The experience he's now earned will help him over the next few seasons.
"He's an Aberdeen supporter and he plays the game in that manner."
