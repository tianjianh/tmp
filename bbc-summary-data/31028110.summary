Fortitude: TV's most expensive experiment?

The budget is big: close to Â£30m. It has the big names and everyone's saying it's a big moment for British drama.

Fortitude, which starts tonight on Sky Atlantic, stars Michael Gambon and Christopher Ecclestone.
The 11-part epic is the most expensive British drama ever made.
Its makers say they are not chasing "cult" status but could it be the next True Detective or Broadchurch - in other words, the new show we're all going to become obsessed with?
"Surrounded by the savage beauty of the frozen landscape, Fortitude, a small town in the arctic circle, is one of the safest towns on earth. There has never been a violent crime here. Until now," the show promises.
But despite all the hype, Director of Sky Atlantic Zai Bennett told Newsbeat the show is "not really an experiment".
"It's definitely a step change in original drama on Sky Atlantic and it sort of signals where our ambitions lie.
"We don't really want it to be a cult TV show, because that means small.
"The idea with all the shows that we put on is that they get talked about and that they get into the mainstream, they become zeitgeisty."
The show's executive producer, Patrick Spence, says as a programme maker, the focus is on telling a good story, not targeting a particular audience.
"That's not how Simon Donald, the writer, would think," he explained.
"We have a story that we want to tell and we took it to a broadcaster who loved the story and loved the ambition of the show.
"So I don't think when you're creating or making a television show that you try and predict the audience... or second guess the audience you're going to get.
"All I can say is, we had a story we wanted to tell and we were lucky enough to find a broadcaster to give us that space."
Cult viewing with drama also comes with problems, especially when a popular show with a hardcore fanbase is axed. Take BBC Three's In The Flesh.
The show was cancelled despite the second series ending with just over half a million people watching the finale.
"We loved the show but have to make hard choices to bring new shows through and create room for emerging talent," BBC bosses said.
Director of Television Danny Cohen said more content is being made exclusively for iPlayer and "you have to keep creating space to try new things".
Meanwhile, Channel 4 is testing the waters with content made only for Microsoft's Xbox.
ITV said "Drama is and continues to be a really important part of the broadcast schedule for a mainstream channel, with all shows made available on demand on ITV Player platforms after transmission. New dramas in store on ITV in 2015, include Arthur and George, Code of a Killer, Black Work, The Trials of Jimmy Rose, Safe House and Home Fires."
