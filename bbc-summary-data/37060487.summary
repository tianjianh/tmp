The Department of Infrastructure at the Northern Ireland Executive has proposed banning vehicles.
It said the plans were in the early stages of consultation.
Earlier this year, the County Antrim road was temporarily closed after high winds ripped up two trees causing them to collapse.
The department said it intended to publish a "notice of intention" to for the proposal in the autumn.
"Following discussions with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and other interested parties, the department has agreed to take forward an order prohibiting vehicles using Bregagh Road," it said.
The iconic tunnel of trees near Armoy has become a major tourist attraction since featuring in the smash-hit television series.
The trees were planted by the Stuart family along the entrance to their Gracehill House mansion.
