Mr Obama was joined at Arlington National Cemetery by former President Bill Clinton.
The 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination is on Friday.
Earlier, Mr Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest US civilian honour, to Mr Clinton and other prominent Americans.

A recent political book reported that Mr Obama had gone to play a game of golf with Mr Clinton during the 2012 election campaign, but left the course early, supposedly saying he could only tolerate his fellow Democrat "in doses".
