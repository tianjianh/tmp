He said TV footage and photos of this event had made the crowds look smaller than they were.
Speaking on Saturday, President Trump said "it looked like" some 1.5m people had been at his inauguration the day before.
Pictures taken of both Donald Trump's inauguration and Barack Obama's in 2009, seem to show the crowd was much smaller for Mr Trump's event.
After President Trump saw reports about the low numbers of people who attended his inauguration he claimed that news reporters are "among the most dishonest human beings on earth".
There are no official figures for the number of people who went to the events, but it's thought that 1.8m people attended President Obama's inauguration in 2009.
