Roseanne Rowan Armstrong, 43, told firefighters she was making a wreath when the accident happened at her home in Old Craighall on Sunday.
She later died in hospital.
The fire service said she probably saved her parents' lives by going back into the house twice to rescue both of them from the blaze.
Ms Armstrong, who was a carer to her mother and father, collapsed after getting her father out of the burning house at about 02:00. She was treated at the scene and then taken to the ERI.
Her parents, Bobby, 77, and Margaret Rose, 76, are being treated at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for smoke inhalation.
There were 10 aerosols in her bedroom where she had been making the wreath.
An investigation is being conducted at the ground floor flat in Old Craighall Road.
A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) spokesman said: "Our thoughts are with her family at this sad time.
"A joint investigation between Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Police Scotland is taking place to establish the cause of the fire."
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police in East Lothian are investigating following a house fire in Old Craighall in the early hours of Sunday.
"Three people were injured and taken to hospital for treatment.
"A 43-year-old woman was taken to the St Johns Hospital, Livingston with serious injuries where she sadly died.
"A man aged 77 and a woman aged 76 are being treated for minor injuries at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
"Inquiries are ongoing into the full circumstances."
