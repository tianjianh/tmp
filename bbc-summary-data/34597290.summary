The ceremony will also feature sets from Hozier, Jess Glynne and OMI, whose single Cheerleader was one of the songs of the summer.
Many of the acts will be backed by the BBC Concert Orchestra.
The ceremony, at Birmingham's Genting Arena, will be hosted by Chris Evans and Fearne Cotton.
More than 10,000 tickets are available for members of the public; while nominees for the awards will be announced in the run-up to the show on 10 December.
Launched in London's Earl's Court last year, the inaugural ceremony saw Pharrell Williams receive two of the four prizes on offer - best international artist and song of the year, for his exuberant, gospel-inspired single Happy.
Ed Sheeran was named British artist of the year, while newcomers Catfish and the Bottlemen won BBC Introducing award for best new act.
This year's show will add one further category: Best live performance, given to the band or artist who has delivered "the stand out live moment" on the BBC over the past 12 months.
The first seven performers were announced live on BBC Radio 1 and 2, both which will broadcast the award ceremony, alongside the TV screening on BBC One.
Jess Glynne, who has scored three number ones in the past year with songs like Hold My Hand and Don't Be So Hard On Yourself said she was "really excited" to be invited.
"I was there last year at the inaugural awards, performing with Clean Bandit, and it was a great night, with a brilliant performance from Ed Sheeran among my personal favourites."
Jamaican-American star OMI said: "I'm extremely excited as usual. I love being in the UK and feeling the British energy. I can't wait to perform for my fans."
Chris Evans added: "We had such a blast last year so I can't wait to get back on stage and relive this amazing musical year of 2015."
In the run-up to the ceremony, a week of live concerts will be held across Birmingham, showcasing new talent from the city.
A series of BBC Music workshops and seminars will also take place, providing advice and guidance to aspiring musicians - with topics including How To Make Money in the Music Industry and The Art of Song Writing.
