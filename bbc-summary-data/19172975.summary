Sir Chris Hoy says Britain's "incredible" success in winning seven track cycling gold medals at London 2012 is beyond his wildest dreams.

I don't think any of us dreamt we could match what we did in Beijing.
The total from the 10 events matches Team GB's tally at Beijing 2008.
Hoy won two of the golds - in the team sprint and keirin - to become Britain's most successful Olympian with six titles in total.
"I don't think any of us dreamt we could match what we did in Beijing, but this is way more special," said Hoy.
The Scot praised the coverage and atmosphere of the Games.

"Here you are able to see it every day - the crowd, the stadium and the flame are there 24/7," he said. "You are watching the BBC seeing all these other events and you feel part of it. It is so great to have home Games and home support."
Hoy, who won three golds in China, brought down the curtain on a remarkable six days for Britain at the London Velodrome with a thrilling win in the keirin on Tuesday evening, a victory he describes as the sweetest of his career.
"I didn't think I could top the team sprint win, but that did because these are my last Olympics, that was the last gold medal I will win and it was my sixth gold medal," he explained.
"Because of the nature of the keirin event and the fact that any of the six men in the race could have won, I had feelings of relief and delight."
I wouldn't go through it again even if you offered me a million billion pounds.
The 36-year-old Scot, whose six golds surpass the five that Sir Steve Redgrave won in rowing between 1984 and 2000, says his "dream" now is to compete at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014, but that he will make a decision on his future after taking a two-month break.
Hoy's team-mate Victoria Pendleton had already announced her intention to retire after these Games but was unable to sign off with a victory.
The 31-year-old defending champion was beaten by her great Australian rival Anna Meares in the final of the women's individual sprint, adding a silver to the keirin gold she won on Friday.
Pendleton, who with Jess Varnish was disqualified from the final of the team sprint for a technicality, was on the wrong end of another controversial decision after winning her first race with Meares, being relegated to second place for leaving her lane.
Well beaten in the second race, she said: "I can't believe I've been disqualified twice in the same competition.
"But such is life. I cannot change it now. I thought she bumped me and that might have caused it but it is up to the judges to decide that."

A tearful Pendleton said she was relieved to be leaving the sport, and admitted the pressure of defending her Olympic sprint title had been affecting her.
"It has been the hardest four years of my life dealing with being the Olympic champion and trying to maintain that form in the meantime," she added. "I wouldn't go through it again even if you offered me a million billion pounds.
"If you had offered me gold and silver before the Games, I would have taken it. People have been asking me for four years solid what my ambition is for the Games and I said to get on the podium at least once.
"I think a gold and a silver is a bit more than getting on the podium at least once and I am really pleased and satisfied. Now I am ready for a new chapter of my life."
While six-time sprint world champion Pendleton is preparing for life outside of the velodrome, 20-year-old Laura Trott looks set for an equally glittering career on the track.
Trott secured Britain's first gold in the velodrome on Tuesday with victory in the omnium, to follow up her success in the team pursuit on Saturday.
"I am definitely up for stepping into Victoria's shoes," said Trott. "Vicky is awesome and she is my idol. She has been there throughout my childhood and I want to follow in her footsteps."
