Zain Khan, a friend of the dead teenager, said: "All communities have turned up, not just Muslim, people of all ethnicities and that's amazing. It means a lot to us.
"It is at times like this you realise everyone can come together."
Idrees Azil, another friend, said: "Irfan was humble, very fearless, he was full of love and always smiling. He was our brother, he was that perfect personality, he's looking down on us and he's smiling."
Janet Spence, Irfan's former headteacher said at the vigil: "What has happened has just been terrible. He is going to be so missed."
The main message of the vigil was one of love, respect and forgiveness. The family of Irfan Wahid attended and his uncle spoke of his forgiveness.
The hundreds of people present spilled out across the road at Strathmore View near to where the teenage was stabbed.
Friends and former teachers were among those who paid tributes and Imam Adam Aslam told the crowd: "We have no place to say we are angry, violence is against Islam.
"In Harehills we have to stand together and stand in peace."
Richard Burgon, the Labour MP for Leeds East, who was at the funeral said: "Harehills is an area which is a strong community full of decent people and actually the community is showing itself at its best in the response to its tragedy."
A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was remanded in custody at Leeds Crown Court after he was charged with Irfan's murder.
A further court hearing is due to take place on 23 March.
