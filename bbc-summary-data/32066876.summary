Edinburgh police have deleted a job advert tweet which included a picture of Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

The post, which also also included an image of pop star Zayn Malik, said: "Looking for a new job? Police Scotland are recruiting now."
It was posted the day after Malik left One Direction and it was announced that Clarkson's contract with the BBC would not be renewed.
However, the use of Clarkson's image angered some Twitter users.
The presenter is departing the BBC after an investigation into an "unprovoked physical attack" on a producer.
The police tweet had linked to its officer recruitment page.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Social media is an important tool for communicating with the public.
"It is never our intention to cause offence to our communities whenever humour is used during our online interaction and this post has now been removed."
Some twitter users were far from impressed with the post.
Kenneth Douglas(@KennethDouglas) commented on the post, saying: "are @EdinburghPolice looking to employ a violent bully? https://twitter.com/EdinburghPolice/status/581004307962556416 â€¦ #socialmediafail #tryingtohard"
Tipa indy italiana(@CaroleMagoha) also disapproved, writing: "How about protecting our kids from neighborhood harassment instead of exalting a racist bully?"
But others defended the tweet, taking it as purely tongue-in-cheek.
Margaret Millar(@Windy_West_Lady) was left asking: "Has everyone lost their sense of humour", while Carlyn Crawford(@_carolyncrawf) commented: "some people are so touchy".
Big Sleepy(papsmann) wrote: "so what? clearly a bit of banter!"
The advert also found a fan in twitter user Ka(@GreechanKate), who posted: "That advert is inspired. Still laughing."
