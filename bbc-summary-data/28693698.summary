[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Asda to be built in Norwich without community gym

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Asda has been given the go-ahead to press on with a new superstore in Norwich without providing a gym for community and school use on the site.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Asda property firm McLagan Investment Ltd was given permission for a store on the former Bally Shoe factory site on Hall Road, Lakenham, in December 2012.
Permission was given on condition a gym was built which could be used by schools and discounted for local use.
Plans to remove the conditions have been approved by the city council.
A report to the Norwich City Council said a gym operator that specialised in providing fitness gyms "has indicated that, given the nature of the equipped gym, it would be unsuitable for school use and that, given the level of monthly membership fees, it would not be viable to offer a 50% discount to local social, community or sports clubs".
In the report to the planning applications committee, council officers said the supermarket had pledged to provide a community centre and funds of about Â£20,000 to help towards a health fitness programme in Norwich.
The supermarket is expected to create at least 400 jobs.
The officers recommended the conditions were changed.
