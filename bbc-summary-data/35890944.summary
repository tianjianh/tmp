Devon maths teacher Richard Ariss jailed for sex abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A maths teacher whose sexual abuse of a teenage girl led her to attempt suicide has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Ariss, 28, of Alford Close, Exeter, Devon, admitted three counts of inciting a child to take part in sexual activity.
His victim was 14 when Ariss coerced her into abusing herself while he listened to what she was doing.
He was jailed for 12 months at Exeter Crown Court.
Recorder Mr Andrew Oldland, QC, also imposed a seven-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order on Ariss, restricting his contact with children in the future and ordered him to remain on the sex offenders register for 10 years.
Ariss started grooming the teenager in September 2014 after her parents contacted him through Facebook to arrange private tuition.
The girl, now aged 16, told the court she had lost her trust in teachers and lived in fear of Ariss coming after her for reporting his abuse.
"I have struggled to sleep, I have self-harmed and taken an overdose," she said.
"My grades have suffered and I cannot do the subject he taught because it reminds me of it all.
"I am scared of teachers who are nice to me because it reminds me of how it all started. My trust in teachers has vanished."
The recorder told Ariss his actions had been a gross breach of trust and that teachers were "supposed to protect pupils, not to abuse them."
"This was planned and pre-meditated... it was a classic case of what is called grooming."
