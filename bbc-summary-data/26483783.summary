Volunteer call in post-storm Isle of Man beach clean

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Volunteers have been asked to help in a post-storm beach clean in the south of the Isle of Man.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beach Buddies said it is doubling its efforts with two sessions over the weekend after severe storms washed up "mountains of litter" onto the beaches.
Clean-ups will take place at Derbyhaven on Saturday and Sartfield on Sunday.
Beach Buddies, established in 2012, has recently applied for charity status and is challenging its volunteers to make Manx beaches the cleanest in Europe.
More than 1,600 people took part in 220 sessions held across the island last year - a 75% increase on the organisation's first year.
