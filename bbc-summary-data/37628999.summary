Gordon Anglesea: Ex-policeman 'victim of abuse conspiracy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former police chief accused of sexual abuse in the 1980s has told a court he is a victim of a "conspiracy purely to obtain compensation".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gordon Anglesea, 79, of Old Colwyn, Conwy, denies abusing two boys.
Mold Crown Court heard since his libel action against a newspaper, there had been no allegations against him.
However, following the Jimmy Savile scandal there was a "swell of complaints" which he said was due to police officers "revisiting boys".
He added: "That to me was abhorrent. I believe it was a complete conspiracy purely to obtain compensation."
Mr Anglesea was awarded Â£375,000 in libel damages in 1994 after a national newspaper published a story in 1991 under the heading "New Child Abuse Scandal".
The prosecution claims the offences took place in the 1980s when Mr Anglesea was a police inspector based in Wrexham.
His trial has been told Mr Anglesea allegedly had links to convicted paedophiles, including care home owner John Allen, who is serving a life sentence.
One alleged victim of the former police officer said he was first sexually assaulted by Allen while in care at Bryn Alyn Children's Home in Wrexham before being "used like a toy" by other men at an address in Mold, including Mr Anglesea.
Mr Anglesea also denies abusing the boys at Wrexham's Bryn Estyn home - he said he visited the home but was only there to administer police cautions.
He explained he would have to ring the bell and wait outside until the appropriate staff member would come to let him in.
He denies one charge of indecent assault against one boy and two charges of indecent assault and one serious sexual assault against another.
The trial continues.
