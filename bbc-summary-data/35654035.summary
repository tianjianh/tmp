[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The wife of a man who died after being attacked outside a pub told a court he was targeted for "being loud".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven McKinnon, 44, died in hospital two days after he and his stepson were allegedly set upon at the Durham Ox pub in Leicester last June.
Ross Lowndes, 27, Gurdev Sangha, 24, Phillip Merry, 28 and Eugene Bell, 29, are all accused of murdering Mr McKinnon.
The four men, on trial at Nottingham Crown Court, deny the charges.
The dead man's wife, Clare McKinnon, told the court: "I saw someone - I now know to be Eugene Bell - and said, 'why the hell are you hitting my son and my husband?, and they said, 'they were being loud'."
The court heard that Mr McKinnon's stepson, Cortney Hughes-Smith, had been asked by Mr Lowndes to leave the pub for allegedly taking a drink off the bar.
CCTV footage played to the court showed Mr Lowndes being "chased off" by pub revellers before the attack.
William Harbage QC, prosecuting, said Mr Lowndes returned to the pub with Mr Bell, Mr Merry and Mr Sangha.
Mr Merry punched Mr Hughes-Smith in the face before the others joined the attack on him and Mr McKinnon.
Mr McKinnon, of Uppingham Road, Leicester, suffered a fractured skull and bleeding around the brain, from which he died.
Mr Lowndes, of Windley Road, Leicester; Mr Sangha, of Overdale Avenue, Leicester; Mr Merry, of Pinewood Avenue, Leicester; and Mr Bell, of Helmsley Road, Leicester; deny murder and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
The trial continues.
