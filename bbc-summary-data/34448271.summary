Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has said there was an "open and candid" exchange of views on the existence of paramilitary organisations during the inter-party talks.

Ms Villiers said significant differences remain between the political parties on the issue.
However, she said there was an acceptance that a broad approach was needed.
She said the talks would focus on welfare on Tuesday.
"While significant differences still clearly exist between the parties on what the right answer is, there is an acceptance that we need a broad approach which engages right across society if we are to see an end to paramilitary activity and an end to the control these organisations seek to exert over parts of the community," Ms Villiers said.
The secretary of state left the Conservative Party conference in Manchester and returned to Belfast for the talks.
On Sunday, she said a deal must be done in the coming weeks as the talks cannot continue until Christmas.
Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron set the end of October as a deadline.
