Two European wolves have settled into their new home at Dundee's Camperdown Wildlife Centre.

The male and female wolves, called Loki and Aurora, spent a day getting used to their enclosure before the public could see them.
The pair, who have been together a year, were transferred from West Midland Safari Park.
Zookeepers at the Camperdown Wildlife Centre hope the new arrivals will eventually breed.
Keeper Kellie Ross said: "They have been together for about a year in their old zoo, so they're well used to each other. They get on very well.
"We love them. It's only been two days and they're definitely popular amongst all of us.
"Hopefully they'll carry on growing and the public will love them as well."
Ms Ross said the wolves' move from West Midland Safari park to Dundee went smoothly.
She said: "They both arrived in crates the night before and they were allowed to rest ahead of going into the enclosure.
"Then they were taken out to the enclosure and we let the male out first because we were told he was the calmer of the two and he could have a nosey round.
"They both had a wander round the enclosure and it went really well, better than we expected."
Aurora was born at the Highland Wildlife Park in 2013 and Loki born in 2012 in the Netherlands.
Ms Ross said: "They're really fun to watch because they are so social and interact with one another.
"We don't go into the enclosure with them but we can interact from the other side of the fence.
"We've spent quite a lot of time sitting down at the enclosure just talking to them if they're coming up to say hello.
"We'll try to start doing hand feeds or pole feeds to get their trust up, but it's a slow process and we go by how they progress it."
