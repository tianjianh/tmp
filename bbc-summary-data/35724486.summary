HMS Hood was sunk by the Bismarck on 24 May 1941 with the loss of 1,415 lives and only three survivors.
The ship's bell will go on display in May at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth.
It forms part of an exhibition commemorating the biggest naval battle in World War One.
The bell was recovered from the bottom of the Denmark Strait, between Greenland and Iceland, in August.
It bears an inscription in memory of Rear-Admiral Sir Horace Hood, who died in the Battle of Jutland.
Nick Hewitt, head of heritage at the museum, said it provided an "extraordinary and moving link" between the two wars.
"The bell is a memorial to two battles, separated by 25 years but joined by centuries of tradition and sacrifice," he said.
