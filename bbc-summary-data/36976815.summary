[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Openers Jimmy Adams and Will Smith gave bottom club Hampshire a strong platform on day one of their Division One match against Lancashire at the Ageas Bowl.

Captain Smith (99 not out) neared his first Championship century of 2016 as Hampshire closed on 276-1.
Lancashire did not make a breakthrough until the 69th over, by which time Adams and Smith had added 191 together.
Adams (88) was caught at point off Jordan Clark, while Tom Alsop reached his half-century in the final over.
The Hampshire pair were watchful for much of their sizeable opening stand, which was a record for Hampshire against Lancashire since their move to the Ageas Bowl in 2001.
Smith has so far faced 284 balls, with his innings containing 13 fours.
Championship debutant Saqib Mahmood was one of seven different bowlers used by visiting captain Steven Croft but Lancashire, who began the match 20 points behind Division One leaders Middlesex, were unable to make any further inroads.
