About 500kg (1,100lb) of the class A drug was discovered in eight holdalls at London Gateway Port in Essex by Border Force staff on Monday.
The drugs originated in Ecuador and were shipped to the UK via Belgium.
It was described it as a "substantial find" that would have "significantly disrupted" criminal activity.
The cocaine is thought to have been destined for mainland Europe but Matthew Rivers, from the National Crime Agency's (NCA) Border Policing Command, said it was "likely a proportion would still have ended up back in the UK".

The discovery was the largest-ever drugs find at the port in Stanford-le-Hope, according to Border Force assistant director Mike Kennedy.
When adulterated and sold to drug-users, the shipment would have been worth more than £50m, he added.
The NCA is now trying to establish the source of the shipment.
