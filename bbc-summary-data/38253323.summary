Ritchie Sutton's first half header from Jeff Hughes's free-kick proved to be the only goal of the game.
Jordan White should have levelled for Wrexham before the break but his header was acrobatically saved by Scott Davies.
Former Wrexham midfielder Jay Harris could have scored a second in stoppage time but he fired over the crossbar.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It was a better performance but we're obviously disappointed with the result.
"Jordan White had a great chance in the first half with a great header and if that had gone a yard either side it would have been a goal.
"If we would have got a goal you might have seen a different outcome and score."
