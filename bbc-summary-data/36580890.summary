[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tattoo artist has been sentenced to 23 months in jail after pleading guilty to a string of sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Abram of Indelible Tattoo Studio, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault, outraging public decency and five counts of voyeurism.
The 46-year-old from Bournemouth filmed women at the former tattoo parlour undressing and using the toilet.
Footage of two women who were sexually assaulted in their sleep was also found on Abram's phone.
Dorset Police first investigated the tattoo artist in June last year after a woman thought she had been filmed by Abram in the bathroom.
He was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years on Friday at Bournemouth Crown Court.
Det Con Shanena Cornwell said: "I would like to praise [the victims] for coming forward and supporting this prosecution.
"I hope the sentence handed out will go some way to help them come to terms with what has happened."
