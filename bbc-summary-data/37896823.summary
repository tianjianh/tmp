Charlie Adam has worked hard to win back his place in the starting line-up, says Stoke City boss Mark Hughes.

Adam was a regular in his first three seasons with Stoke, but has only played 34 games since the start of 2015-16.
The Scot, 30, has started for Stoke in their past two games but he will not feature in the World Cup qualifier against England on 12 November.
"He's in good physical condition at the moment. That's really encouraging for him and for us," said Hughes.
"In the past, Charlie will admit himself that, in games, to keep the intensity he plays at and the energy that he shows, he has found it difficult to complete 90 minutes on occasions.
"It's difficult when you're out of the side. You have to keep your focus and Charlie has been able to do that."
Adam, who has 26 caps, revealed last week that Scotland manager Gordon Strachan has not spoken to him in more than a year.
After been overlooked, Adam says he is now looking no further than Stoke's next Premier League game at home to Bournemouth on 19 November.
"Football can change from one week to another," he told BBC Radio Stoke. "I'm just enjoying the way I'm playing and hoping that's good enough to keep me in the team.
"If the team keep performing well, then you've got a good chance of staying in."
After their poor start to the season, Stoke have now climbed to 12th in the league.
Now into his fifth season at the Britannia Stadium, former Rangers, Blackpool and Liverpool playmaker Adam has made a total of 130 appearances for the club, but only 71 Premier League starts.
He signed a three-year contract extension with Stoke in July 2015.
