It leaves them two points behind Livi, having played a game more.
Meanwhile, Albion Rovers edged a five-goal thriller with Stranraer at Cliftonhill.
And, at Hampden, Queen's Park were held to a goalless draw by 10-man Peterhead, who remain one point ahead of the seventh-placed Spiders.
Airdrie were awarded a penalty against Brechin when Dougie Hill handled in the area.
Iain Russell stepped up to convert, with City's Paul McLean later dismissed for violent conduct.
At Cliftonhill, Albion Rovers opened the scoring on the quarter-hour through Ross Stewart, who coolly slotted home following a defence-splitting pass from Stevie Boyd.
Stranraer were back on level terms courtesy of a Willie Gibson effort from just outside the box, but the hosts regained the lead before the interval through Ryan Wallace's penalty following a foul by Scott Robertson.
The visitors equalised through on-loan Aberdeen striker Joe Nuttall before Wallace grabbed his second of the game from close range to wrap up the points for the hosts.
Peterhead earned a point away to Queen's Park despite being reduced to 10 men when Simon Ferry was dismissed late on.
The league leaders, third-placed Alloa Athletic and bottom two sides East Fife and Stenhousemuir were not in league action due to Alloa and Livi's Challenge Cup matches this weekend.
The Wasps lost their quarter-final tie against Queen of the South, while Livingston host Welsh side The New Saints on Sunday.
