A shopkeeper was seriously injured as he fought off two attackers during an attempted robbery in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened at about 17:20 on Friday at a newsagents on the corner of South Trinity Road and Cargil Terrace.
Two men entered A&A Stores and demanded money, before attacking the shopkeeper and then running from the scene empty-handed.
Police described it as "a cowardly attack". The shopkeeper's injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
Officers are hunting for the two suspects, who were last seen running along Cargil Terrace.
The first is described as being 20 to 25 years old, of medium build, with a pale complexion and unshaven.
The second man is described as 35 to 40 years old, of slim build, with a pale complexion and gaunt features. He was also unshaven.
Both suspects were wearing dark clothing and dark woollen beanie hats. One was wearing a dark body warmer.
Det Sgt Todd Rutherford said: "This was a cowardly attack, and the shopkeeper bravely fought off the attackers despite a shocking level of violence and the serious injuries he sustained.
"At the time of the incident, it is likely there would have been pedestrians and drivers in the Cargill Terrace area and we know the suspects were loitering nearby the shop before the incident took place.
"If anyone has seen these men before, during or after the attack, please contact us."
