[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jack Marriott scored a hat-trick as Peterborough made it maximum points from their opening two League One matches with an impressive victory at Bristol Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Posh took a sixth-minute lead when Ryan Sweeney failed to clear a cross from Gwion Edwards and Marriott pounced to fire home from close range.
A Junior Morais pass set up strike partner Marriott to score his second in the 55th minute and Steven Taylor forced the ball over the line for a third with 12 minutes remaining after Jack Baldwin had headed on a left-wing corner.
Rovers grabbed a consolation five minutes from time when substitute Rory Gaffney headed home a Lee Brown cross at the far post.
But Marriott completed his treble in time added on, tapping in a low left-wing cross from substitute Andrew Hughes.
Posh had the better of the first half but survived a scare just before the break when Billy Bodin's left-footed drive from the edge of the box crashed against the crossbar.
Rovers also hit the woodwork in the second half through a looping header from substitute Ollie Clarke.
