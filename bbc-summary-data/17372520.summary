Greece country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The historical and cultural heritage of Greece continues to resonate throughout the modern Western world - in its literature, art, philosophy and politics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Situated in the far south of the Balkan peninsula, Greece combines the towering mountains of the mainland with over 1,400 islands, the largest of which is Crete.
Post-World War II Greece saw rapid economic and social change, with tourism and shipping becoming major contributors to the economy.
The global financial crisis of the late 2000s had a devastating effect on Greece, as the legacy of high public spending and widespread tax evasion combined with the credit crunch and the resulting recession to leave the country with a crippling debt burden.

President: Prokopis Pavlopoulos
Born in 1929, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, a veteran politician of the centre-right New Democracy Party was elected president by parliament in February 2015.
The vote was the fourth attempt to elect a successor to Karolos Papoulias, of the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), after previous failures triggered the downfall of the government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and snap parliamentary elections.
The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, as executive power resides with the prime minister.
Prime Minister: Alexis Tsipras
Alexis Tsipras swept into power by winning snap elections in January 2015 on promises to ease the tough austerity imposed on Greece as part of international bailouts.
He vowed to renegotiate the bailouts worth â‚¬240bn (Â£179bn; $268bn) granted by the European Union, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund to keep heavily indebted Greece afloat in return for painful government spending cuts and restructuring.
But the creditors refused to budge, and Mr Tsipras - after winning a "No" vote to the bailout package in a referendum that only left Greece facing even tougher requirements - bowed to their conditions in dramatic negotiations in the summer of 2015.
Television is Greece's medium of choice, followed by the press, the internet and radio.
News, variety programmes, comedy and game shows dominate peak-time TV. There are about a dozen private TV channels and a plethora of private radios.
The media have been badly hit by Greece's economic, social and political crisis. Facing declining circulation figures and advertising revenues, some outlets have imposed cuts or closed altogether.
In June 2013, the conservative-led government abruptly took state broadcaster ERT off the air and dismissed its 2,600 staff, citing endemic mismanagement. The move drew international criticism and sparked a domestic political crisis.
A replacement public broadcaster, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and TV (NERIT), made its debut in May 2014.
