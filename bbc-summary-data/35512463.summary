York's National Railway Museum (NRM) has launched an appeal to mark the Flying Scotsman's 93rd birthday.
The engine, which retired from service in 1963, has been restored for the NRM in a decade-long, Â£4.2m refit.
On Saturday it ventured on to the mainline network for the first time in 40 years as it took a test run through Cumbria and Lancashire.
Last month, the locomotive emerged into the East Lancashire Railway's Bury Bolton Street station after the final stages of the work at a nearby yard, thrilling hundreds of rail enthusiasts.
It is due to be painted in its new green livery on Wednesday and have its nameplates reattached before making its journey between London Kings Cross and York on 25 February.
Public services will begin later this month, alongside an exhibition at the museum.
Former fireman John Morgan, from Peterborough, said he was looking forward to seeing the Flying Scotsman steaming between the two cities again.
The 77-year-old became a fireman at 16 and worked on some of the most famous locomotives of the age, including the Flying Scotsman and the Mallard, the world's fastest steam train.
"I have a lot of very good memories of 60103 [Flying Scotsman's British Rail number]," he said.
"I did a lot of trips on the footplate and shovelled a lot of coal.
"There was a lot of interest, even back then. Whenever we'd back up into King's Cross there'd be a crowd of people around wanting to get up into the cab."
Bob Gwynne, associate curator of collections and research at the NRM, said: "As we've been planning our highly anticipated Scotsman Season, many people have already approached us with their special connections to the iconic steam locomotive and the famous train it was named after.
"We've heard from crew members that worked on board and their families, and even of some babies born on the train."
