'No consolation' in Labour's defeat for David Miliband

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Miliband says he finds "no consolation in any sense of vindication" about Labour's performance in the general election.

Mr Miliband, who was beaten to the leadership by his brother Ed, also said Labour's consecutive election defeats had "come for a very clear reason".
Voters had decided Labour had "turned the page backwards", he said.
Mr Miliband quit Parliament in 2013 to work for the International Rescue Committee charity in New York.
He had been the favourite to replace Gordon Brown as Labour leader but lost out to his younger sibling in the 2011 contest.
Labour's defeat was "doubly painful" because of his brother's involvement, he told the Times.
"I don't want him to be hurt and I don't want him to be vilified," he said.
"There is no consolation in any sense of vindication, frankly, because I care about the country and I care about the party."
A contest to replace Ed Miliband is under way, with Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh and Jeremy Corbyn vying for the job. The winner will be announced before the party conference in September.
In a separate interview with CNN, Mr Miliband refused to say which of the candidates he was supporting, urging them all to reflect on the reason for Labour's election losses.
"And the reason is that the public have concluded that instead of building on the strengths and remedying the weaknesses of the Blair years the party has turned the page backwards rather than turning the page forward," he said, calling for a return to the "combination of economic dynamism and social justice that defined the success of the Labour Party in the 1990s and early 2000s."
He also used his CNN interview to warn against Britain leaving the European Union, saying it would no longer be taken seriously by the United States if it withdrew.
"It's almost like Britain would be resigning from the world," he added.
