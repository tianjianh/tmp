The DJ's first set of posts has been deleted, but in a later series of tweets he claims that it was an "insult" to have been treated that way.
There is no word yet on exactly why Felix Da Housecat, whose real name is Felix Stallings Jr, was refused entry.
Berghain is yet to issue a statement and also chose not to give a comment when Newsbeat contacted them.
The DJ and record producer is credited with influencing the second wave of Chicago house music.
A number of his Twitter posts focused on his feeling that the club have a lack of respect for the genre and his role within its success.
Felix says his first set of tweets were deleted by his management and that he "stands by every word" that he wrote.
"Woke up this morning. Have no regrets," he explained.
Berghain is notorious for being difficult to get into, with plenty of websites offering advice on how to maximise your chances of gaining entry.
Last year bouncer Sven Marquardt released a memoir about his time working on the door.
