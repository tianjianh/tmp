Deontay Wilder: Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury fights on table for American

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Deontay Wilder wants to fight Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua after retaining his WBC heavyweight title with a technical knockout of Chris Arreola.

The American, 30, dominated Arreola, whose corner stopped the fight after eight rounds in Birmingham, Alabama.
That came despite Wilder suffering a suspected broken hand and torn bicep.
"Of course I want the Furys, of course I want the Joshuas, but the question is, do they want me?" Wilder said.
"My goal is to unify the division. I'm one of the baddest, hardest-hitting heavyweights in the business, so whoever's got those belts, that's who I want."
Wilder extended his undefeated record to 37 wins with 36 knockouts with his fourth title defence, but went to hospital for treatment on his right hand.
American Arreola, 35, only took the fight - his fourth world heavyweight title bout - when Alexander Povetkin failed a drugs test in May.
