Hearts: Europe will help with signings - Robbie Neilson

Head coach Robbie Neilson says Hearts have already identified a number of potential signings for next season.

Hearts will confirm a European spot if they can secure full points in their next two matches against Inverness CT and Aberdeen.
But Neilson insists there will be no big-spending over the summer.
"We have to recruit guys that are out of contract, free agents," he said. "We have got quite a few players we have targeted but nothing concrete yet."
Hearts have reshaped their squad considerably since winning the Championship title last season.
With the Edinburgh club on course for a top three finish on their return to the top flight, Neilson admits that success makes it easier to bring in new recruits.
"The standard of player we are looking is better," he told BBC Scotland.
"When you come up from the Championship players are looking at a team being promoted and they don't know where they will finish. Now if we can qualify for Europe it would be a huge draw and we can recruit even better."
Neilson and his players will travel to Inverness on Monday for Tuesday's match and will stay a second night in the Highlands before preparing for Friday's home fixture against second-placed Aberdeen.
"It's a great week to be involved in," added Neilson.
"We get two nights in sunny Inverness! I just feel it's the best way to prepare. We didn't want to be travelling straight back and getting in about 3.00am."
