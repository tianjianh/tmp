Election 2015: Conservatives promise law to curb tax rises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Tory government will introduce a law guaranteeing no rise in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance before 2020, David Cameron has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Conservative leader pledged legislation within 100 days of assuming office to ensure rates do not rise in the next Parliament.
But Labour said the pledge was a "gimmick" and it expected VAT to rise.
Party leader Ed Miliband said that Tory plans to reduce the welfare budget would mean cuts to tax credits.
Elsewhere in the election campaign;
Both the Conservatives and Labour are focusing on economic issues with just over a week to go until polling day and with opinion polls suggesting neither has been able to open up a decisive lead.
The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the pledge all came down to which party the electorate trusted on tax and said it was a "big call" for any government to essentially set aside one of the "main levers" it had for managing the economy.
As well as ruling out rises in headline tax rates, Mr Cameron said VAT would not be extended to new items and the upper earnings limit on national insurance will be aligned with the higher rate threshold for income tax.
The prime minister said he could make the difficult decisions needed to balance the public finances through spending cuts, reducing government waste and clamping down on tax avoidance "without reaching into the pockets of hard-working people and taking their money".
This election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes.

"I have seen the books," he told workers at a factory in Birmingham. "I know what needs to be done.
"Working people in this country have paid enough tax. As this economy recovers, I want you to be able to keep more of the money to spend as you choose. That is the choice. Take home pay going up with the Conservatives.... or going down with Labour."
The Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government raised VAT from 17.5% to 20% in 2011 despite the Conservatives saying they had no plans to do so before the 2010 election.

In most British people's minds, the great crash and recession of 2008 probably feels like yesterday - the defining economic shock of our age, we continue to live with its noxious effects.
But the Tories and Labour are today behaving as if the risk of another such shock in the current parliament is nil, because in different ways they've both limited their room to offset the impact of one.

But former Conservative foreign secretary William Hague said the financial situation was much more serious in 2010, telling the BBC the coalition inherited an "almost Greek-level size of deficit" and the action it had taken since then now enabled it to offer a "clear guarantee" on taxes.
"It is possible to give this guarantee in this Parliament which would not have been possible in previous Parliaments because we have put the finances back on track," Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The public finances, he added, were now in a "far stronger position" to weather an unexpected economic crisis in future.
But shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the Conservatives legislated to balance the books by 2015 and had failed to do so, suggesting their tax pledge could easily be overturned by Parliament in the future.
"These promises from David Cameron are two a penny," he told Radio 4's Today Programme.
Analysis by Political Editor Nick Robinson
Don't worry. Not long to go. The election that never seems to end will be over by next Fridayâ€¦ or maybe it won't.
On the morning after the night before, you might imagine that you won't have to hear from that seemingly endless parade of political leaders anymore but, and I'm sorry to have to break this news to you, you may be wrong. Very wrong.
If (and it is still an if) the opinion polls don't budge, as they have stubbornly refused to do not just for days or weeks but many, many months, the people may have spoken but no-one will quite know what it is that they have said. There will be no clear winner. No instant answer as to whether David Cameron stays in Number 10 or calls the removal men.

Labour has said it would increase the top rate of tax from 45p to 50p but has "ruled out" any increase in VAT or national insurance as part of a "clear and balanced plan" to achieve a budget surplus by 2020 at the latest.
Mr Balls said he expected the Conservatives "would end up raising VAT" to meet their target of eliminating the current deficit by 2017-8, saying they had been unable to provide any details of their proposed Â£12bn cuts to welfare - a key element of their deficit strategy.
"The Tories will raise VAT to make their sums adds up while my sums already add up," he said.
In a speech in London, Mr Miliband promised to protect family budgets, ensuring tax credits rise at least in line with inflation until 2020.
Tax credits were "in the firing line" under the Conservatives, he claimed, with likely cuts of up to Â£3.8bn as part of a "secret plan" to pay for their deficit commitments.
He said: "Today I am here to reveal the truth: if the Tories get back in on 8 May your family budget is at risk."
The Lib Dems dismissed the Conservative "tax lock" as "yet another gimmick" from David Cameron "to deflect attention from the fact that the Tories have abandoned the plan followed by the coalition and instead want to slash and burn support for millions of families".
