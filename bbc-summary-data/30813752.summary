Ian Bell smashed 187 from 145 balls as England beat the Prime Minister's XI by 60 runs in Canberra.

Bell, back in the side after Alastair Cook was removed as captain, hit 20 fours and three sixes to help the tourists to 391-6.
Moeen Ali and James Taylor each contributed 71.
But the touring bowlers also took some punishment, with Glenn Maxwell making 137 as the Prime Minister's XI were all out for 331 in the 49th over.
England now move on to a tri-series with Australia and India, which begins on Friday, before they start their World Cup campaign against Australia on 14 February.
Bell's knock has answered any questions over who should replace Cook at the top of the order, while the continuing good form of Moeen and Taylor cements their places in the top three ahead of Alex Hales and Gary Ballance.
"It's a good start for all of us, a good win on a very good pitch against a strong XI," said Bell.
"I haven't played a lot of cricket recently, so it was good to go through the gears and enjoy myself at the end.
"We've enjoyed our week here in Canberra and we're looking forward to the tri-series and the World Cup after that."
England's bowling line-up also looks to be taking shape, with Chris Woakes's 1-46 from nine overs outperforming the expensive Chris Jordan, who took 2-60 in six overs.
With the rested James Anderson set to come back to share the new ball with Stuart Broad, whose 4-40 were the pick of the figures, only the balance of England's attack is left to be determined.
Off-spinner James Tredwell returned 2-64, but England may opt for a fourth seamer if they feel the slow bowling can be done by Moeen and Joe Root.
But, it is the performance of Bell that will satisfy new one-day captain Eoin Morgan the most, with the Warwickshire man batting all but one ball of the entire 50 overs against an attack that included Australia pace bowler Pat Cummins.
Maxwell took three fours and a six from a single Jordan over as he made a fanciful chase seem possible, before Broad returned to have him held in the gully.
The same bowler took two wickets in two balls late on, before ending the match with a skied caught and bowled.
