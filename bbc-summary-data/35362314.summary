Ashley Daniel Talbot was run over by PE teacher Chris Brooks, 34, at Maesteg Comprehensive School, Bridgend county, on 10 December 2014.
A second 13-year-old boy suffered minor injuries.
South Wales Police said it had questioned Mr Brooks but confirmed no action would be taken against him.
The force said Ashley's family had been informed and a police investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident continued.
In a tribute released after his death, Ashley's family described him as a "typical teenager, a practical joker with a wicked infectious laugh".
Pupils at the school also paid tribute to a "good friend" and said the gap he had left could never be filled.
