The tribute was made in front of thousands of fans during a concert Ms Carey gave in Las Vegas on Wednesday.
It is the latest sign the singer is in a serious relationship with Mr Packer, one of Australia's most powerful businessmen.
The pair were photographed cruising the Mediterranean last month on Mr Packer's super yacht, with Ms Carey's children.
"I have a new heart tonight," the 45-year-old singer said at the concert.
"James is in the house. Thank you so much," she said, according to concert footage published by celebrity website TMZ.
Mr Packer, 47, is Australia's fourth richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated wealth of more than A$6bn ($4.7bn Â£3bn).
Mr Packer, who inherited an Australian media empire from his father Kerry Packer, and now operates casinos, split from his second wife model and singer Erica Baxter in 2013.
Ms Carey announced her break-up from "America's Got Talent" host Nick Cannon, last year.
The love ballad 'Hero' about finding a hero inside yourself earned the singer a Grammy nomination for best female pop vocal performance in 1994.
The couple went public with their relationship last month after they were seen strolling hand-in-hand around the famous holiday town of Capri in Italy.
