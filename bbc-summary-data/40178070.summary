[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Winger Greg Eden scored five tries in Castleford's win over Warrington Wolves, which extended Tigers' lead at the top of Super League to six points.

Eden's fourth hat-trick in five Super League games gave Tigers a 26-6 lead at the break and he eventually took his tally of tries for the season to 30.
Greg Minikin and Mike McMeeken also crossed, while Wire trio Tom Lineham, Joe Westerman and Jack Hughes replied.
The Wolves are 10th, two points below eighth-placed Huddersfield Giants.
Last season's beaten Grand Finalists suffered a fourth consecutive Super League defeat after enduring a horrendous opening 15 minutes.
As well as conceding four tries without reply, they lost centre Matty Blythe to injury and prop Chris Hill was sin-binned for a late hit on fellow England international Luke Gale.
Castleford prop Andy Lynch, who has announced he will retire at the end of the 2017 season, made his 500th career appearance.
Eden fell just short of the record for the most tries in a single Super League match - Lesley Vainikolo scored six in a game for Bradford against Hull in 2005.
However, the 26-year-old is on course to break the record for the most tries in a Super League campaign with 12 matches remaining.
Denny Solomona scored 40 for Castleford in 2016, before he made a controversial cross-code move to Sale Sharks.
Castleford coach Daryl Powell:
"Greg [Eden] is such a great finisher but there are some smart things done by the people inside him.
"Some of the stuff the left edge did was special. I thought Zak Hardaker getting into the line and creating overload situations was great.
"It wasn't perfect from us. There were flashes of absolute brilliance but in the second half we were disappointing.
"Ultimately, we are six points clear and at this stage of the season we are in a good position. It is about us going on with it and staying focused."
Warrington coach Tony Smith:
"When you are down to 12 men it could have been worse. There was a fair bit of damage done in that first period.
"The captain was hard on himself in the changing room afterwards. But we still shouldn't have leaked as many points in that period.
"The response in the second half showed some character, particularly with the troops down.
"We had seven or eight out injured that you would suggest would be in our starting team. Bearing those two things in mind there was a bit about us."
