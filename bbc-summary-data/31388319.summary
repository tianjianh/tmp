A mixture of ash and concrete will be put into the 40m (130ft) deep chasm outside The Laurels, in Oakamoor, in April.
The business had already been forced to close after cracks appeared in the property and the car park.
As BBC Midlands Today's David Gregory-Kumar reports, the work forms part of a Â£2m scheme to stabilise the whole area.
