The 25-year-old, who joined the Lions from Wycombe in 2015 after scoring 11 goals in 53 games, spent the final part of last season on loan at Adams Park.
An ankle injury restricted him to five matches for Gareth Ainsworth's side.
"Paris was one of my main targets and I'm delighted that we've been able to bring him back," said boss Ainsworth.
"This is where Paris has played the best football of his career and he's had two very happy spells here.
"I'm sure he'll benefit from having a full pre-season with us and we look forward to seeing him back on the pitch where he's capable of getting the fans on their feet and being a match-winner."
