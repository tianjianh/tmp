The captain alerted Dyfed-Powys Police on Saturday morning when crew realised Josh Winsper from Cornwall was missing.
Police divers and HM Coastguard are involved in the search.
Mr Winsper's family posted a plea to find him on social media. His aunt told the Cornish Guardian the family were "holding out for a miracle".
Mr Winsper was last seen at Astoria nightclub in the town at 02:30 BST on Saturday.
Rachel Gerred-Hartâ€Ž told the newspaper: "His mother Sandra Winsper is beside herself with worry.
"You wouldn't believe the support coming from the town of Milford Haven. On behalf of the family we want to say the Welsh police have been incredible."
