[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Veteran war photographer Don McCullin has been awarded a knighthood in the New Year Honours list.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Don has documented conflicts in the Congo, Afghanistan and Iran, in a career spanning 60 years.
Last month, he travelled to Iraq to photograph the Battle of Mosul and took pictures of people fleeing the city.
The 81-year-old said he felt "warmed" to be recognised for services to photography and it would bring "a lot of honour" to his family.
"I've made this huge journey from the beginning of my life where it was very poor and impoverished.
"I've managed to get away from that and I've managed to educate myself by travelling with great journalists.
"So in a way, I've been duly rewarded before I even got this knighthood."
Sir Don, who received a CBE in 1993, said he hoped the Queen would knight him as he has "massive respect" for her work.
"My only hope is that the Queen will be the person who tips my shoulders with the end of that sword.
"She would be the one person who would make the whole thing marvellous for me."
Sir Don has lived in Somerset for 34 years, having first visited the region as a young evacuee.
He said the Mosul trip would be his last covering conflicts, but vowed to continue with his work until he "can't press that button any more".
Future projects include a potential exhibition at the Tate in London in two years' time.
