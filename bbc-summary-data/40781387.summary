Eighteen-year-old Sang did not turn out for the Latics' first team before his release from the club this summer.
Whitmore, 21, who is yet to make a senior appearance for the Clarets, spent 2016-17 on loan at Morecambe.
"I'm happy to get Alex in before the start of the season, he's a no-nonsense defender," boss Lee Clark said.
