Police were called to Nuthurst Park in Moston, Manchester, just before 18:55 BST on Saturday.
Greater Manchester Police said officers responded to reports of a girl being raped and the offender being chased off by members of the public.
A boy, believed to be 14 or 15, was arrested in a nearby shop and is being held for questioning.
The victim is being provided with support from specially-trained officers.
Insp Dave Whelan said: "I know this incident has understandably caused a lot of unrest in the local community, particularly among those who were in the nearby area at the time, but I want to assure everybody that we have launched a full investigation.
"We treat all reports like this with the utmost seriousness and as such officers swiftly attended the scene and arrested a teenage boy within 16 minutes of the initial call coming in."
