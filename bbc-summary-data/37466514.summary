The collapsed retailer BHS is to re-launch as an online shop, selling some of the most popular items previously available on its website.

BHS.com will employ just 84 people, a fraction of the 11,000 who lost their jobs after efforts to find a buyer for the high-street business failed.
The last of BHS's 163 department stores was closed last month.
The new website, which is owned by the Qatari Al Mana Group, will go live in the UK on Thursday.
"We are nimble and efficient, but with a great brand, strong customer base and a proven and dedicated team," said David Anderson, the managing director of the new online operation.
Mr Anderson added that the website would have "a number of advantages over a typical start-up", including an "iconic" brand and a loyal customer base in the UK, including 1.2 million former online shoppers.
BHS.com will sell roughly 75% of the items available on the former online shop, including bedroom, bathroom, cushion and lighting ranges.
The new owner of BHS' online shop, Qatari conglomerate Al Mana Group, already works with a number of high-street brands, such as Zara, Mango, United Colours of Benetton and Reebok.
Mr Anderson said an all-new online technology platform had been developed for BHS, "so we are not inheriting any legacy systems".
He said the majority of people who worked for the previous BHS online operation had been recruited for the new business.
