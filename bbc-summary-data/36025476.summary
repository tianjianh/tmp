Plymouth Leander head coach Jon Rudd is confident British record-holder Ben Proud will produce "a peak performance" at this week's Olympic trials.

The double Commonwealth champion, 21, is looking to confirm his place in the 50m and 100m freestyle events in Rio.
"Physically he'll be the best shape of the season so far when we get to Glasgow," Rudd told BBC Sport.
"All things being equal he'll be faster than he's been and I hope that's then good enough to secure his place."
Proud broke Mark Foster's 14-year short-course 50m freestyle British record in December and also holds the best long-course time.
He will compete in the 100m trial in Scotland on Thursday and the 50m on Saturday.
"We've got to get the rest, the preparation and the taper right so we see a peak performance, and I'm confident that'll happen," added Rudd.
"We all know an Olympic trial is a funny old thing - it's not like any other trials, it doesn't feel like anything else.
"For the last year-and-a-half we've not switched off from the 50m, but very much focused on the 100m, because we strongly believe that a faster Ben Proud on the freestyle leg of the medley relay gives Great Britain an excellent medal shout in that event."
