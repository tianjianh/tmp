[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 2-2 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from Matt Bloomfield helped struggling Wycombe Wanderers earn an impressive point in the League Two draw at promotion-chasing Doncaster Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bloomfield owed a debt to Ross Etheridge for both goals after a pair of mistakes from the Doncaster goalkeeper.
Etheridge dropped a cross under pressure which allowed Bloomfield to hook home an over-head kick and give Wycombe a 19th-minute lead.
Doncaster responded well and were level 10 minutes later. James Coppinger - who missed an open goal from two yards before Wycombe's opener - was played in on the right and curled a wonderful low cross which Tommy Rowe met to score.
The home side were in the ascendancy and took a deserved lead on 40 minutes through John Marquis, who weaved his way into the box and confidently finished.
But Doncaster became increasingly sloppy after the break and an equaliser looked inevitable. It came on 78 minutes as Paris Cowan-Hall drilled a low shot from 20 yards which Etheridge fumbled, allowing Bloomfield to tap home the equaliser.
Wycombe almost snatched an injury-time winner but the unmarked Cowan-Hall could only flick a header narrowly wide.
