Swansea tidal lagoon 'endangered' by Labour questions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Tory MP has accused Labour of "endangering" plans for a Â£1bn tidal lagoon power project in Swansea by asking for assurances over its future.

Craig Williams was responding to Neath Labour MP Christina Rees, who said she was concerned the "vital" lagoon was not mentioned in the Autumn Statement.
She suggested it might show a lack of commitment to green energy.
Mr Williams said investors were being "shaken" by Labour comments at a "very critical time" in negotiations.
Tidal Lagoon Power - the company behind the scheme - warned in October that building work was being delayed by a year to 2017.
It said it was still negotiating with UK government ministers over an agreed price for the energy generated.
The lagoon came up for discussion during a Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday about George Osborne's Spending Review.
"Despite its strategic importance to the Swansea Bay city region, of which my constituency is a part, there was not a single mention of the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon in the chancellor's statement," said Ms Rees.
"In light of the landmark [UN climate change] agreement reached in Paris this last weekend, we know that projects like the tidal lagoon are essential if this country is to meet its international obligations to combat climate change."
Cardiff North Conservative Mr Williams intervened, saying: "Investors around the world are being shaken by what you and mainly members of the Labour party are saying about the tidal lagoon at a very critical point when we're negotiating the strike price.
"You are endangering lagoons, not just Swansea."
Ms Rees replied: "We're not giving the uncertainty - the government are."
She said the lagoon was critically important to south Wales because of the potential investment and up to 1,900 jobs being created during construction.
"It will be a travesty if the UK government were to fail to deliver this opportunity," Ms Rees added.
