Farrah Fadli, 29, has not been seen since dropping her two children off at a friend's house in Irvine, North Ayrshire, on Friday.
The family had initially gone missing from their home in Ayr two days earlier.
Ms Fadli, also known as Gillespie, is 5ft 4in, slim, with dyed blonde hair.
Insp Jim Hendrie said: "It is now almost a week since Farrah has gone missing and as time progresses we remain concerned for her wellbeing.
"It is extremely unusual for her to leave her children for such a long time and not be in touch with her family and friends.
"I would urge anyone who knows where she is to get in touch with police immediately. If Farrah herself is seeing these appeals, I would ask her directly to get in touch with police.
"Your friends, family and children are desperate to have you back safe and well."
