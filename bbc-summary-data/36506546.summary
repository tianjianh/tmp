Debbie Bestwick was recognised for her services to the computer games industry after a career which started in Nottingham almost 30 years ago.
She is the founder and owner of label Team17, based in Mansfield and Wakefield, responsible for more than 70 games over the past 25 years.
Its titles have included Worms, The Escapists and the soon to be released Yooka-Laylee.
Ms Bestwick, who lives in Nottinghamshire, said: "I played my first game when I was 12-years-old. It's such an engaging form of entertainment. Cinema and reading books are passive whereas playing a game is interactive.
"It's a fantastic honour to be made an MBE. I keep thinking 'I'm just doing my job!'
"Also being a woman in this industry - I'm one of the only female owners of a business in the games industry."
As well as making its own games, like 90s classic Worms, Team17 works with independent developers.
Hits have included The Escapists - designed by an ex-roofer from Derby - and Beyond Eyes, a game about a blind girl.
Its latest title, Yooka-Laylee is being officially unveiled at the E3 conference in Las Vegas  and is described as a successor to Banjo-Kazooie.
