Aberdeen 2-1 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevie May scored twice on his home debut as Aberdeen edged past a dogged Dundee at Pittodrie.

May headed Greg Tansey's corner past goalkeeper Scott Bain for his first.
Marcus Haber headed off the crossbar for Dundee before Roarie Deacon equalised when he intercepted Ryan Christie's poor pass and drilled the ball into the net.
The Dons re-took the lead when Graeme Shinnie's shot rebounded to May, who rifled in a second.
It means Aberdeen are one of three teams - along with Celtic and St Johnstone - to boast a 100% start to the season.
For Dundee, though, it leaves manager Neil McCann still searching for their first points of the season, with his side rooted to the bottom on goal difference.
Aberdeen's strength and consistency has added a swagger to their play, such is the confidence in their ability to win.
They swarm forward - an attacking threat offered from every angle - and when they went ahead early in the match it looked ominous for Dundee.
Tansey's set-piece delivery means the absence of Jonny Hayes and Niall McGinn is being less keenly felt and his corner found the head of May, who directed the ball past Bain.
Aberdeen dominated the opening period but allowed Dundee a couple of sights of goal.
McCann had bemoaned his side's inability to turn chances into goals last weekend and the same was true here as James Vincent dithered in front of goal and allowed Aberdeen goalkeeper Joe Lewis to smother the opportunity.
Haber showed greater conviction when he met Deacon's cross with a powerful header, but on this occasion the crossbar intervened.
McCann stressed beforehand that two defeats from two didn't have him worried and his players continued to show composure as they sought a way back into the game.
In the end, that came from an unlikely source. Christie's cross-field pass was aimless and Deacon was able to burst towards the edge of the box before firing a low shot through the legs of Lewis.
The wet surface did the goalkeeper no favours, but he will be disappointed nonetheless to lose a goal in such fashion.
Dundee's profligacy in front of goal came back to haunt them at a pivotal moment, though. Scott Allan slid the ball past the post after being picked out unmarked by Deacon.
A further opening was passed up as Haber failed to pick out Faissal El Bakhtaoui and, perhaps crucially, both players pulled up injured.
Before they could be replaced, Aberdeen stormed forward and although Shinnie's shot was charged down, May swept a beautiful strike past the diving Bain.
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: "It wasn't our normal flow and we didn't have the normal control we're used to at Pittodrie. There were some spells of the game I didn't particularly enjoy but I enjoyed winning.
"Dundee showed they're a good team. We needed to show more confidence to go and work them and ask questions. Ultimately it's about taking your chances, and it's a hell of a strike from Stevie May. He's already proved his worth. He's a fantastic player capable of big moments.
"I think Dundee will probably go back down the road feeling aggrieved they didn't get something from the game and I can understand that."
Dundee boss Neil McCann: "Sometimes you just think luck is not going for you. We go down to nine men [with Haber and El Bakhtaoui injured] and are desperate to get people on.
"I am angry with myself because I could have just walked on to the pitch and tried to stop the game. I felt we had a sub ready but [referee] Kevin [Clancy] wouldn't let us get him on.
"Then we have a chance to put the ball out but for some reason we don't, we try to keep the ball alive and it is just silly decisions like that which come back to bite you.  It's hard to take because we have played really well in spells today."
