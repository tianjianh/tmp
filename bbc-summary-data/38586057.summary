A woman who fraudulently claimed £32,000 in benefits by claiming to be a single mother was caught after posting a holiday photo with her husband on Facebook.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elizabeth Hughes told the Department for Work and Pensions she had broken up with husband Arthur in January 2010 before reconciling in 2013.
But a court heard that the couple were together during the three-year period.
Hughes, 36, of Dundee, will be sentenced in February.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told that none of the money had been repaid.
Depute fiscal Vicki Bell told Dundee Sheriff Court: "She claimed tax credits in 2009 and then in August of that year informed DWP she and her husband had separated.
"She confirmed that position over the next three years before declaring they had reconciled in 2013.
"An investigation revealed there had never been a separation."
Miss Bell said the couple held joint bank accounts.
She said: "Holiday payments, TV licence and other household expenses were paid jointly.
"Her Facebook page had a photo of them on holiday together during the period of the claim.
"There was also a post on Facebook saying he was 'the bestest husband' posted during the period of the claim that she was single."
Hughes was released on bail ahead of her next court appearance.
