The team bought the former Marussia base in Banbury to use as a European headquarters for its team in February.
It said it was expecting some of the technical personnel, engineers and mechanics to come from the former Caterham and Marussia F1 teams.
About 15 have already been recruited with a further 65 due to be taken on, the team said.
Ex-Marussia staff Dave O'Neill and Rob Taylor have already been appointed team manager and chief designer for the team.
"We're taking our time to set up properly and choose our people carefully," its team principal Guenther Steiner said.
"We need to show people we are serious, especially with what happened with other teams.  We want to be here for a long time."
The team is currently extensively re-modelling the site ahead of joining next year's F1 events which start in Melbourne.
