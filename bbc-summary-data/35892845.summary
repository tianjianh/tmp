Rhys Jones, 36, originally from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, died from his injuries after the attack in Clarence Place on 24 November.
Rhys Barnes, 28, from Newport, admitted his murder at Cardiff Crown Court.
On Thursday, he was told he had shown "no remorse or regret" for the "brutal" attack and was jailed for life. He must serve a minimum of 26 years.
The court heard the stabbing followed a row over a woman who Barnes believed to be his girlfriend, but was also having a "physical relationship" with Mr Jones.
Barnes stabbed the father-of-two after the woman claimed he had punched her in a row.
The court heard Barnes told her: "I'm not having somebody hitting a girl" and threatened to kill him before picking up a knife.
Prosecutor Michael Jones said Barnes was "crying and angry that someone hit a girl he liked" and told a friend: "He's not going to get away with it."
Mr Jones was found dead the following morning. Police went to Barnes's neighbouring flat at the Solas homeless shelter where he was found covered in blood next to a steak knife.
Barnes told police: "He hit my girlfriend this morning so I... stabbed him."
Mr Jones suffered 16 different wounds to his chest, back, left arm, his trunk and thigh after being stabbed 13 times.
Records of Cardiff Eleri Rees said: "It was a brutal and sustained attack."
