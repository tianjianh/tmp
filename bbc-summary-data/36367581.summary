Against a competitive field including four-time Olympian Jo Pavey, Isle of Wight-born Andrews beat her personal best by 83 seconds on Saturday.
The 23-year-old, who now lives and trains in Andorra, had previously run shorter distances and cross-country.
"I've got three months until Rio, so for now I'm just taking everything in," she told BBC South Today.
"The reaction has been incredible. I've had tweets and social media messages from people back home including old teachers and family friends."
Andrews, from Shanklin, is engaged to Irish road cyclist and Olympic contender Dan Martin.

A former Aldershot & Farnham District club member, she teamed up with a new coach a year ago after choosing to relocate to Andorra with Martin.
Eventually she decided to train for the 10,000m and her win at Parliament Hill, 17 seconds inside the GB qualification time, came in only her second track event at the distance.
"I've not really been telling people what I've been up to while living here," Andrews added. "I haven't been racing on the British scene recently, so that's why it's come as quite a shock.
"I'll allow myself some time to take it a bit easy and then I'll sit down in the next week with my coach," she added.
"We'll start to plan the build-up, the training and the races I'll compete in before Rio."
