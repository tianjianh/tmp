'Trojan Horse': The 21 schools in detail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The results of Ofsted inspections into 21 schools at the heart of the alleged Trojan Horse plot have been published.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The anonymous letter, which was sent to Birmingham City Council, alleged a socially-conservative sect of Muslims was trying to get their own members on to governing bodies and ousting head teachers.
After visiting the schools, inspectors decided to fully re-inspect five and review their Ofsted ratings.
The remaining 16 were deemed to have reasonable safeguarding measures in place. In those cases, Ofsted's findings were published as monitoring reports - which are briefer and do not recommend changing a school's rating.
Full inspection:
The report said staff views were "polarised" about the leadership of the school, while "some female members of staff complained that at times they are spoken to in a manner which they find intimidating".
Inspectors added that there were "fundamental weaknesses" in leadership and management.
The report also stated: "Students' understanding of other religions is scant as the religious education curriculum focuses primarily on the study of Islam."
In response vice-chair of Park View Educational Trust, Dave Hughes, said it "wholeheartedly disputed" Ofsted's findings and accused inspectors of operating in a "climate of suspicion".
Full inspection:
Ofsted said pupils did not get a broad education, adding: "The governing body has removed some subjects, such as music, from the timetable."
The report also said pupils have a "limited knowledge of religious beliefs other than Islam" and that staff were fearful of losing their jobs if they challenged the governors.
The watchdog said senior leaders and governors had failed to adopt "effective strategies that develop pupils' awareness of the risks of extremism".
It added that the school "does not prepare pupils adequately for life in modern Britain".
Full inspection:
Ofsted said the academy had not effectively raised students' awareness of the risks of extremism and that external speakers, including those as part of a series of Islamic-themed assemblies, were not vetted.
Inspectors also criticised the governors' handling of the budget.
Full inspection:
The report said a small group of governors were "making significant changes to the ethos and culture of the academy without full consultation".
"They are endeavouring to promote a particular and narrow faith-based ideology in what is a maintained and non-faith academy," it said.
The report also said governors used the academy's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia exclusively for Muslim staff and pupils.
"The choice of destination meant that pupils from other faiths were not able to join the trip," it said.
Full inspection:
Ofsted's report criticised every aspect of the school, and said governors refused to accept that "the school is in a state of crisis".
Inspectors also criticised financial management at the school and relationships between senior staff and governors.
In response, the governing body at Saltley School said it believed two Ofsted reports published last year gave "a far more accurate and fair description of the school" than that published on Monday.
Monitoring report:
Ofsted found its safeguarding arrangements met requirements. The report said: "The headteachers and members of the interim executive board have a strong track record of supporting school improvement. They have brought tried-and-tested improvement methods to Alston."
The school refused to comment.
Monitoring report:
The report said the school had a high turnover of staff and governors were, "not well-informed about the potential risks associated with radicalisation and extremism and how these might impact on the school".
The school refused to comment.
Monitoring report:
The report said governors, "have advocated polices such as single-sex swimming lessons that do not reflect the inclusive ethos of the school."
The school refused to comment.
Monitoring report:
The report said: "Nothing has been done to further staff awareness of the risks surrounding forced marriage and female genital mutilation. Staff have not been well trained in teaching sex and relationships education."
The school refused to comment.

Monitoring report:
The report said the school's safeguarding arrangements met requirements but the quality of leadership and management required improvement. The report said: "While teaching is monitored regularly by all leaders, their analyses of strengths and weaknesses are not sharp enough."

The report said the local authority's support for the school was "light-touch".
