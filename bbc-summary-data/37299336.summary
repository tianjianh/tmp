Dan Draghici attacked Elena Draghici, 31, during an argument at the house they shared in Smethwick, in the West Midlands, police said.
Mrs Draghici fled and hailed a passing taxi after her sister intervened.
Her husband, who had denied attempted murder, was found in his car having stabbed himself in the leg. He was jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
Draghici, who admitted a charge of assault by beating, was jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Wednesday.
Police said 42-year-old Draghici, of Fenton Road, attacked his wife while their daughter was upstairs with his sister-in-law in March.
"After hearing the screams her sister came downstairs and jumped on Draghici's back, managing to pull him off Elena who then managed to escape," a West Midlands Police spokesman said.
Det Insp Jason McMahon, said: "This has been a truly horrific time for Elena and her family, who are trying to come to terms with what has happened to them.
"Elena sustained serious injuries during the assault which she is still recovering from, I hope that the sentence will be of some comfort to them and help them rebuild their lives."
