Lawro's Premier League predictions v comedian & actor Elis James

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of guests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this week's Premier League fixtures is comedian and actor Elis James.
James, who co-stars in the BBC Three sitcom Josh, is looking to improve on his showing when he took on Lawro last season and only scored 10 points - leaving him joint-bottom of the guest leaderboard.
He is a Swansea City fan and says: "This season so far has not been great for the Swans but it is only the end of September so we live in hope.
"I think we have got enough to stay up, but I will let you know in a couple of months."
You can make your own predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro and other fans, and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last week, Lawro got six correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 90 points.
He was beaten by world darts number one Michael van Gerwen, who got five correct results, but with two perfect scores, for a total of 110 points.
All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.
