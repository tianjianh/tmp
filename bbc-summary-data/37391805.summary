National Lottery operator Camelot said that, subject to validation, the prize could be paid out on Monday.
It was the eighth ticket in the UK to take the top Euromillions prize so far this year and the fourth this month.
A £19.7m jackpot was shared by three tickets from the UK on 2 September. Friday's winning numbers were 5, 8, 14, 22, 32, and Lucky Stars 2 and 11.
When jackpots are paid, winners can decide whether to reveal their identities or stay anonymous.
A family syndicate from Monmouthshire won more than £61m in the Euromillions jackpot in August.
UK ticketholders also won jackpots of £24.6m and £24m in February this year, and £51.8m in April.
The biggest lottery prize in UK history is the £161m Euromillions jackpot won by North Ayrshire couple Chris and Colin Weir in 2011.
Tickets for Euromillions are sold in nine countries - the UK, Austria, Belgium, France, the Irish Republic,  Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland - with ticket-holders in all each country trying to win a share of the same jackpot.
