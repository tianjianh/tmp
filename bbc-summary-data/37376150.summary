Star Wars actor Mark Hamill slams fake autograph sellers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Star Wars actor Mark Hamill has spoken out against the sale of fake celebrity autographs, suggesting that up to 90% of signed memorabilia is bogus.

"There are more fake autographs than real ones," the 64-year-old told BBC One's Rip Off Britain, saying "it just breaks your heart" to see fans duped.
The proportion of fake autographs, he said, was "in the 50 to 90 percentile".
The actor went on to reveal he tries to personalise the autographs he gives in order to limit their commercial value.
"A true fan would love that," he told presenter Angela Rippon on Friday's edition of the consumer advice programme.
Hamill said he is also prepared to authenticate his own signature, based on pictures of items he receives from fans.
"Every day it's like homework," said the 64-year-old, who reprised his Luke Skywalker role in last year's Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
"You have to sit down and go through 30, 40, 50 of these things, and sometimes they're really close calls.
"It doesn't bring me any pleasure to disappoint someone and say, that's a fake," continued the star, who will next be seen as Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode VIII.
"On the other hand, [forgeries] are just so pervasive - there are more fakes than there are reals [sic]."
