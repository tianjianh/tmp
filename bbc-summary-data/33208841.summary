Tour of the North: Orange Order abides by parade ruling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Orange Order has abided by the Parades Commission's ruling during Friday's Tour of the North parade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Commission had applied more stringent restrictions to the march than in previous years.
The parade observed a single drumbeat passing by St Patrick's Catholic Church in Belfast on Friday evening.
Earlier, the Order lost a High Court bid to overturn restrictions on the parade along Clifton Street and Donegall Street.
The judge rejected claims that the Commission had not followed proper procedures in its Tour of the North determination.
Instead, he upheld the restrictions placed on the parade.
Afterwards, the Order said it was disappointed but would abide by the ruling.
Police said on Friday night that they were "encouraged by the manner in which all those present tonight conducted themselves and appreciate the efforts those involved went to in ensuring this was the case".
