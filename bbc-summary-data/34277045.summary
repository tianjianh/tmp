What was behind the coup in Burkina Faso?

The BBC's Lamine Konkobo looks at the issues behind the week-long coup in Burkina Faso, when members of the presidential guard overthrew the interim government.

Days after the coup ended, the reinstated interim government said it was disbanding the presidential guard.
A new president is due to be elected next month to replace long-serving ruler Blaise Compaore, who was ousted in a popular uprising last year.
Members of the presidential guard (RSP), set up by President Compaore, said they were unhappy with the new electoral law banning candidates linked to last year's bid to extend the president's time in office. It was that attempt which triggered his overthrow in October 2014.
But what was really bothering the RSP was its future. Soldiers were worried that the election of a new president would spell the end of the unit.
The presidential guard was an elite unit of around 1,300 soldiers loyal to Mr Compaore.
He set it up to ensure his own protection in the wake of the 1987 killing of his predecessor, and close ally, Thomas Sankara during a coup which led to Mr Compaore taking over.
It was a well-trained and well-equipped group of soldiers who have often acted independently from the country's army, which is larger but less well armed.
Army chiefs distanced themselves from the presidential guard by asking the coup supporters to hand in their weapons to barracks in exchange for safety guarantees.
Most of the people who backed the overthrow of Mr Compaore were keen to see the presidential guard disbanded, but less so members of the CDP, the former ruling party.
They were concerned that they had been excluded from October's election because of their ties to the former president.
They argued that the election should have been an inclusive process and the electorate allowed to decide who was fit to be the next president.
One of the people banned from contesting the election was the coup leader's wife, Fatoumata Diallo Diendere who was an MP for CDP.
After handing back power, the leader of the coup, Gen Gilbert Diendere, admitted it had been "the biggest mistake".
"We knew the people were not in favour of it. That is why we have given up," he told local media.
There are some who thought that Mr Compaore, currently in exile in Ivory Coast, quietly backed the coup and with the presidential guard in power, it could in theory have paved the way for his return.
Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara was supported by Mr Compaore in his effort to take power after a disputed election, and he is thought to have been unhappy about the transitional arrangements.
Life is hard for many in Burkina Faso, one of the world's poorest countries.
Many university graduates struggle to find work and often blame corruption for their difficulties.
They were hoping that the transition and a democratic election would lead to improvements, so the coup is a set-back for them.
