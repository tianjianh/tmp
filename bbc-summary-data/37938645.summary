A 24-year old man was shot dead in Luton by a firearms officer who was responding to reports a woman had been attacked in a flat.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has begun an investigation into the incident.
Bedfordshire Police chief constable Jon Boutcher said the force will "co-operate fully" with the investigation.

He said: "I have met all the officers directly involved in the incident in Luton and I am incredibly grateful to them, and all of my officers who do such a difficult job in often extremely challenging circumstances in order to protect the communities we serve.
"The officers involved in the tragic death yesterday know they have my full support.
"The force will co-operate fully with the IPCC investigation to establish the exact circumstances of what took place."
He said the force's thoughts are with the family of the man who died, and all those involved.
Officers were called to Tracey Court, a block of flats off Hibbert Street in the town, at about 13:30 GMT on Wednesday.
Neighbours said they saw officers trying to save the man in the street outside the block of flats where it is believed the woman lived.
At the same time a blonde-haired woman was seen being escorted from the building, neighbours said.
The man, who was described as white and British, was initially treated at the scene by officers and paramedics.
His family has been informed.
In a statement, the IPCC said: "The investigation is in its early stages and no further information is available at this time."
