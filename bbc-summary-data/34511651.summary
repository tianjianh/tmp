And the 58-year-old says Gordon Strachan has asked him to carry on in his national role should the Scotland boss decide to remain in charge.
"I was really keen to get back into club management, but the destination was important," said McGhee.
"It was important I returned at a club close to my heart and was a challenge."
Motherwell, who sit ninth in the Scottish Premiership, sacked Ian Baraclough last month.
McGhee was in charge at Fir Park for two years before leaving to join Aberdeen in 2009.
The former Scotland striker, who also managed Reading, Leicester City, Wolves, Millwall, Brighton and Aberdeen, had his last managerial stint at Bristol Rovers in 2012 but lasted less than a year.
McGhee, who has been Strachan's assistant since January 2013, said "I've had several things put to me over the last few years" in his desire to return to club football.
"I am delighted to be back at Fir Park and Motherwell, a club in which I have a real affection for after some fantastic highs and tragic lows in my last spell," he said.
McGhee steered Motherwell to a third-place finish and European qualification for the first time in 13 years in his debut season.
During his time at Fir Park, he was short-listed for the Scotland manager's post, losing out to George Burley.
Asked about inheriting someone else's squad, McGhee said: "I have done it before and have no worries about that.
"I am not getting ahead of myself here, but I went to Brighton after a few games and we got promoted through the play-offs and I went to Millwall after a few games and won the title."
As for his targets, he said: "I think not being in the embarrassing situation they were in last season and scrambling at the end to avoid relegation.
"After that, the expectations have not been defined."
Youth team coach Stephen Craigan had been appointed on an interim basis while a successor to Baraclough was sought.
Majority shareholder Les Hutchison added: "The football committee have undertaken a very rigorous selection process and considered over 80 applicants and interviewed a very strong shortlist of candidates before making their recommendation to the chairman and myself.
"I was delighted to talk in detail with Mark about the future plans for the club and he demonstrated a real enthusiasm for the task ahead.
"I was pleased he was the unanimous choice of the board."
