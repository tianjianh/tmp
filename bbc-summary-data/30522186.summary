The movie, is the sequel to Dumb and Dumber, which was made 20 years earlier.
But Peter added they couldn't do it without the original stars, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels.
Peter didn't disclose names of any female comedic stars they were thinking about using.
"The comedy climate right now for women has never been better. I mean, they're the biggest stars right now. Comedic stars actually are the women.
"Bridesmaids, that kind of thing, sure. I think at one point we actually thought about it for a moment, but then we really realised that we can't do it without Jim and Jeff."
Peter is also behind the much-loved There's Something About Mary movie.
He also confirmed that there had been talks to do a sequel to that.
"The studio had asked us to do There's Something Else About Mary. Our feeling was that was a money grab, it didn't feel like a natural sequel.
"But they wanted to do it and we actually said at some point, well if the something else about Mary, turns out that she has testicles, then we're in.  And they said no, we don't want to do that, so we forgot it."
Dumb and Dumber To hits cinemas 19 December.
