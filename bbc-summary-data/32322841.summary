They are the first quintuplet sisters ever born in the US, according to the Women's Hospital of Texas in Houston.
Mother Danielle Busby said she felt blessed and that Olivia Marie, Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Parker Kate and Riley Paige were "thriving".
It is believed that the last time five sisters were born at once was in 1969 at Queen Charlotte's maternity hospital in London.
More than a dozen doctors and nurses assisted in the premature birth, which was delivered by Caesarian section.
Father Adam Busby praised the hospital staff at a press conference and said their elder sister Blayke cannot wait for them to come home.
"She thinks it's normal for mommies to have five babies," said Mrs Busby.
Mrs Busby had received intrauterine insemination for both her pregnancies after having difficulties becoming pregnant.
