Isabelle Solly's mum Kay passed out at their home when no other adults were present.
Isabelle got hold of her mum's phone and called the emergency services - something paramedics said had "astonished" them.
Paramedic Matt Cooper, who arrived at the scene, said: "It would have been quite scary for a child but she did extremely well staying on the phone until we arrived."
Isabelle's mum, Kay, regained consciousness, and tests discovered nothing serious was wrong with her.
