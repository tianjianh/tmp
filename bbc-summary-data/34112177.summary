Manoj Bakkarwala, who is being held in Delhi's Tihar jail and is described as a notorious gangster in Indian media reports, had offered to buy shoes for the policemen too, reports said.
Six Delhi policemen, who had escorted the prisoner, have been sacked.
Five policemen in Agra have also been suspended, police said.
Bakkarwala, who is accused in more than 300 cases of car thefts, was taken to an Agra court last Thursday in connection with a murder case.
He managed to persuade the police team to take him to a shoe store on Agra's MG Road, local journalist Vivek Jain told the BBC.
On seeing the handcuffed man trying out shoes along with the policemen, the shop owner recorded a video on his mobile phone, adds Vivek Jain.
Reports say Bakkarwala has in the past also managed to persuade his police escorts to take him to a restaurant for a meal or go shopping and that on at least two occasions, he even managed to escape.
