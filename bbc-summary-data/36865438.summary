[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Maher was the drummer in 1970s band Buzzcocks, whose hits included Ever Fallen In Love.
Maher is now a photographer based on Harris and usually takes night-time and long exposure images of decaying manmade objects in the Hebrides.
The exhibition, Nobody's Home, has opened at the Lighthouse in Glasgow.
It forms part of Architecture and Design Scotland's Say Hello to Architecture programme.
Maher was 16 years old when he was recruited as a member of the Buzzcocks. Chart success followed before the band broke up in 1981.
In 2002, he relocated from his home town of Manchester to the Isle of Harris in the Western Isles.
Maher has previously exhibited his photographs at venues in the Highlands and Islands.
Speaking ahead of the opening of the Lighthouse exhibition, he said: "Taking this exhibition to Glasgow is the realisation of a long-held ambition.
"What started out as a personal project - documenting abandoned croft houses in the Outer Hebrides - has had an unexpected side effect.
"As a result of displaying my photographs, there's now a real possibility of seeing at least one of the properties becoming a family home once again."
He added: "Putting on this exhibition in collaboration with the team at Architecture and Design Scotland means Nobody's Home is about more than pictures on a gallery wall. It shows that looking through a lens to the past can help shape things in the future."
