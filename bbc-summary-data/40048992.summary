The 26-year-old, who has 117 senior caps, sustained the injury in training with her club, Arsenal.
"Our medical team will be working hard to ensure she returns to full fitness as soon as possible," the club said.
Scotland women, who will feature at their first major finals, will play England (19 July), Portugal (23 July) and Spain (27 July) in the Netherlands.
Prior to the tournament, Anna Signeul's side will face Romania (9 June) Sweden (13 June) in friendly matches.
The midfielder, who was BBC Women's Footballer of the Year in 2016, has scored more than 40 goals for her country and also played for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics.
Little started her career at Hibernian and first joined Arsenal in 2008, moving on to Seattle Reign in 2014.
She had a loan spell at Melbourne City before re-signing for Arsenal in October.
Little missed Scotland's friendly defeat by Belgium last month through injury and was also left out of the squad named this week for Euro warm-up games against Romania and Sweden.
However, Signeul was hopeful that her most renowned player would return to action in time to play in the finals.
Arsenal are fourth in Women's Super League One, five points behind leaders Liverpool, and Little was an unused substitute in Saturday's 4-2 defeat of Birmingham City.
BBC Sport Scotland's Chris McLaughlin:
It's difficult not to underestimate just how big a blow Kim Little's absence from the Scotland team actually is.
The 26-year-old has been the lynchpin in the national side's midfield for many years and, when fit, she is the first name on Anna Signeul's team sheet.
Having played at the very top in England and the US, she brings experience to the side but also goals. She was desperate to lead her country in their first major championship.
Her ability is clear but her influence in the dressing room is also huge. To say she will be missed is something of an understatement. A tough looking tournament for Scotland just got a whole lot tougher.
