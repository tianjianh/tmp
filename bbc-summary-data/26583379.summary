Alexandra Hospital in Redditch and Kidderminster Hospital have reopened to visitors, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said.
Some restrictions remain in place at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, it said.
The acute stroke unit, Avon 3 and acute medical unit are still affected by the bug and remain closed to visitors.
"Patient safety is our priority, and we take any risk of infection very seriously, taking steps where necessary to prevent the spread of infection," chief nursing officer Lindsey Webb said.
"We are very aware of the impact visiting restrictions can have on patients and families.
"However, we took the difficult decision to close our sites to visitors as a way of preventing the spread of norovirus," she said.
