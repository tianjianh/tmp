[SN]TITLE[SN]
Murderer Avni Metra to be extradited from UK to Albania

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A double murderer who posed as a refugee to enter the UK illegally is to be extradited.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Avni Metra, 53, came to Britain in 1998, one year after he killed two brothers in his native Albania.
He was convicted in his absence of both murders and possession of firearms, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.
District judge Margot Coleman told Metra, who had argued he would not get a fair trial abroad, his life in Britain was "based on a lie".
Metra, who was living in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, was arrested by Scotland Yard detectives on 8 June as he drove through Watford, after a tip-off from the Daily Mail.

He told an earlier extradition hearing: "There is no justice in Albania. There is only corruption."
The labourer, who claimed he had originally fled to Britain because his life was in danger after a friend was killed, also argued that he had a right to a private and personal life.
But Judge Coleman said: "You called absolutely no evidence to support your assertion that you would be denied the right to a fair trial.
"There are no grounds that have been heard before me to reach that conclusion.
"As far as your family are concerned, you were convicted of assaulting [your wife] and subjected to a restraining order."
Metra is also barred from seeing his children without permission, the court heard.
The case will be sent to the Home Secretary, who will make the formal decision on whether he should be extradited, and Metra will remain in police custody, the court was told.
