Her body was found in a lock-up store on the allotments on Sheaveshill Avenue in Colindale.
Ms Adri-Soejoko, who was secretary of the Colindale Allotment Association, was reported missing at 01:40 GMT on Tuesday and found 20 minutes later.
Police have not released the cause of death but said she lost her life "in the most tragic way possible".
Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh of the Met Police said: "At this stage we are keeping an open mind about any possible motive and would ask any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.
"An elderly woman lost her life in the most tragic way possible and was left inside a storage unit similar to a garage."
According to police, Ms Adri-Soejoko was last seen at 18:30 on Sunday and spoke to a friend on the phone on Monday afternoon.
Det Ch Insp McHugh said a friend "became concerned and alerted family members" after the 80 year old did not turn up to a meeting in the Barnet area.
Cindy Matthews, who gardened in the allotment, described Ms Adri-Soejoko as "a lovely lady".
Another neighbour, Danila Catruta said the murder had left her "scared" and "very surprised".
Extra police patrols have been added in the area, Scotland Yard said.
