[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four people have escaped injured in two separate overnight arson attacks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A man and a woman were caught up in a fire at a flat at Broombeg, Ballycastle, at about 01:50 BST on Saturday. They escaped by climbing out of the first floor window onto a porch.
In Craigavon, the front door of a house at Trasna Way was set alight at about 01:00 BST.
A man and woman escaped through the back door.
The fronts of both properties were damaged in the attacks.
John Bacon, Coleraine district commander for the fire service, said the couple who managed to climb out the window were "incredibly lucky".
"We are investigating the cause of the fire at the moment, but we believe it to be deliberate, he said.
"The couple were very fortunate that they have working smoke alarms in the premises and the fire wasn't able to develop to the point where they possibly wouldn't have been able to escape."
