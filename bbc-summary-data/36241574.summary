Competitors aged 14 to 19 hiked distances of up to 55 miles (89 km) and visited 10 nominated tors.
The 56th event started on Saturday morning, with some 2,400 teenagers - many from school and youth groups from across the South West - taking part.
The first team to cross the finish line was Torbay Scouts who took part in the 35-mile (56 km) route.

The event is organised by the Army and assisted by the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the Dartmoor Rescue Group.
Each team has a GPS tracker, so safety teams can find out where each group of teenagers is. The tracker also has an emergency button if help is needed.
