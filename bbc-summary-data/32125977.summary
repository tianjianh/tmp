[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The English Football Association had hoped to field men's and women's teams at the Games but failed to gain support from the other home nations.
The FA wrote to the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations on Monday to inform them of the decision.
GB fielded men's and women's teams at London 2012, with both sides knocked out at the quarter-final stage.
Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce previously stated he had been given "an absolute categorical reassurance" by Fifa that GB teams would only be allowed if there was agreement from all the home nations.

Scotland's FA feared a united British team could risk its independence within Fifa, world football's governing body, and agreed to co-operate for London 2012 on the basis it was a one-off.
It has said the English FA "underestimated the strength of feelings from the other home nations".
Football Association of Wales president Trefor Lloyd Hughes said he was "livid" with plans to reform GB teams when he heard about them.
Despite strong opposition from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations, five Welshmen were selected for the men's squad in 2012, with two Scots making the women's.
