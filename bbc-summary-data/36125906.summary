Celtic 1-1 Ross County: 'We must stick together' despite fans' stick - Deila

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Outgoing boss Ronny Deila urged Celtic's players to "stick together" as they prepare to secure a fifth straight title despite unrest among supporters.

Celtic only need one more win - given their vastly superior goal difference - after the 1-1 draw with Ross County.
But the mood inside Parkhead was one of frustration and anger with a flurry of boos at the final whistle.
"It is tough for the players but we did not perform very well so you can accept it. But it isn't helping," Deila said.
"The performances haven't been good enough lately and today again in the second half, there was not enough heart and energy in it. That is what they are reacting to.
"But you saw with Aberdeen on Friday that it isn't an easy job to go out and win.  They lost three points, we got one point, so it hasn't been that bad a weekend.
"We are going the right way, we are now nine points ahead with four games left so we have to celebrate the opportunity.

"I understand there are a lot of people who want to drag us down but we have only lost three games in 34. What has happened is we have lost important games.  That is killing us and taking the energy of the players.
"But now we need to stick together and get over the line. We are only three points away from a fifth championship in a row."
Celtic could effectively seal the title with victory at Hearts next Saturday lunchtime, but sections of the home support unveiled anti-board banners before kick-off and their mood was not improved by a frustrating second-half display.
Leigh Griffiths' 38th goal of the season put the champions ahead but County missed several good chances before Stewart Murdoch's strike gave them a deserved point, and it might have been more.

"The players worked extremely hard for each other and I thought a point was the least we deserved," said County boss Jim McIntyre.
"We had some golden opportunities that we should have taken.  From that side we are disappointed not to win it but I can't be disappointed with what the players gave me and the type of performance they put in.
"We will continue to try to get better and that is the challenge that lies ahead this summer.
"There will be some new signings but there won't be wholesale changes.  We will try to add the right ones to complement what we already have."
