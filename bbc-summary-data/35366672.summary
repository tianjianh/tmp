The five cousins, aged between three and seven, were discovered by their grandmother in Kakamas town, Northern Cape province, on Tuesday, police say.
Police do not suspect foul play.
In a separate incident on Tuesday, two children died from suffocation after getting locked in a car that was awaiting repairs outside Johannesburg.
Police have urged parents and guardians not to allow children to play unaccompanied in places where their safety could be at risk.
In a statement about the deaths in Kakamas, they said they believed the freezer, which was turned off, locked while the children were playing inside it.
