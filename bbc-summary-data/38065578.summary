The Michael Scudamore-trained gelding won the Welsh Grand National in 2013.
But the 10-year-old has not raced since suffering a leg injury when third in the Grand National 18 months ago.
Monbeg Dude will spend his retirement with Tindall and his wife Zara, the Queen's granddaughter and an Olympic silver medallist, at Gatcombe Park.
The Tindalls will provide a permanent home for the horse at the Gloucestershire estate, which is the country residence of the Princess Royal.
Trainer Scudamore admits to some sadness at the retirement.
"There are some mixed feelings," he said.
"In one way, it's sad to retire him but after the good days we had with him and all the great memories he gave us, it's nice to see him go out in one piece and hopefully have a very long and happy retirement.
"He's just got a niggle from the injury he sustained in the Grand National last year and if you gave him more time, he would be fine.
"He's 11, rising 12, now, though, so by the time you got him back, he would be going on 13, which just would not be fair to the horse.
"It's great to see him going to a happy retirement but he will certainly leave a big hole in the yard."
"We've had some great days with him and the thing about him was that he wasn't bred to be a superstar.
"He didn't cost a lot of money but he was a really tough performer."
