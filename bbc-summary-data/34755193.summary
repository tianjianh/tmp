Warner added 116 to his first-innings 163, while Burns scored 129 for his maiden Test century.
By the close of play, Australia had reached 264-4 in their second innings for a mammoth overall lead of 503.
Earlier, the Black Caps were dismissed for 317 in their first innings, Kane Williamson top-scoring with 140.
Williamson frustrated the hosts' attack until halfway through the second session of the day, posting his 11th Test hundred and his first against Australia.
Mitchell Starc eventually dismissed him to finish with 4-57, with fellow left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson taking 3-105.
Australia captain Steve Smith decided not to enforce the follow-on, despite leading by 239 on first innings.
New Zealand's attack toiled without quick bowler Tim Southee, who was forced off the field on day two with an irritated disc in his back.
Burns, playing on his home ground in his third Test, smashed two sixes in three balls to reach his century just before rain halted play for 50 minutes in the final session.
Warner reached three figures after the weather delay, the third time the 29-year-old has made hundreds in both innings of a Test.
The opening partnership was finally broken at 237 when Warner attempted a switch-hit slog sweep, and Burns soon followed him.
Smith and Mitchell Marsh were dismissed cheaply as Australia chased quick runs, having added 264 to their total in only 42 overs.
