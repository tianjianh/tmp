Wa-ays Dhaye, 18, from the town, died in hospital following an attack at the junction of Thurston Road and Waterbeach Road, Manor Park, on Monday.
On Friday, two men were arrested on suspicion of murder and a third on suspicion of assisting an offender.
A warrant for further detention was granted at Oxford Magistrates' Court.
Det Ch Insp Simon Steel previously described the attack as "senseless and violent".
A post-mortem examination on Tuesday confirmed the victim died from multiple stab wounds.
Mr Dhaye, who was Somalian, had travelled from London to Slough railway station at about 22:30 BST.
Thames Valley Police said he had been returning from Notting Hill Carnival.
He is thought to have walked home via the crossroads between Stoke Poges Lane, Oatlands Drive and Elliman Avenue, then into Mildenhall Road before reaching Thurston Road.
The force said the death was not linked to an assault in Salt Hill Park on 28 August.
