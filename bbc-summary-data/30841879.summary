In his native Kenya, he met the biggest band at the moment, Sauti Sol, hot from winning the MTV Best African Act award.
They are on a mission to reclaim the identity of East African music and dance after the dominance from West Africa, particularly Nigeria, in recent years.
DJ Edu and team would like to know the name of your favourite club and why you like it. Get in touch on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, using #ClubAfricaBBC. Make sure to include your location.
