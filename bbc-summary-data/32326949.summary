[SN]TITLE[SN]
Campaign launched to halt Welsh river pesticide rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign to tackle increasing levels of weed-killing pesticide in mid and west Wales rivers has been launched.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Growing levels of grassland herbicide MCPA have been detected in watercourses across the country.
Welsh Water and Natural Resources Wales have launched a scheme to reduce MCPA in the Teifi and Upper Wye rivers.
On Thursday, free hire of weed wipers - which reduce spray drift and the amount of chemicals used - was offered to farmers in Talsarn, Ceredigion.
Weed wipers use sponges to apply chemicals directly to target weeds as opposed to the more scattered approach of spraying.
