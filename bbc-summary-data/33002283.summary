The Staffordshire attraction's gates are shut for a second day while the Health and Safety Executive investigates Tuesday's crash.
Nick Varney, of Merlin Entertainments, which runs the park, said it could only reopen when they knew the problem was isolated to the rollercoaster.
However, he did not give a time frame.
Two carriages collided at the park's Â£18m ride The Smiler at about 14:00 BST on Tuesday.
The accident left people trapped 25ft (7.6m up) at an angle of 45 degrees for up to four-and-a-half hours.
Writing in the Sun, Merlin Entertainments chief executive Mr Varney said: "At this point I don't know if it was a technological or a human error.
"We want to know if this issue is isolated to The Smiler. We can't open again until we're sure."
A total of 16 people were hurt, including Joe Pugh, 18, and his girlfriend Leah Washington, 17, both from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and 27-year-old Daniel Thorpe from Buxton in Derbyshire.
They suffered serious injuries, along with a woman aged 19.
All four were airlifted to major trauma centres across the West Midlands.
Mr Thorpe's father has said his son is being treated at Coventry hospital. A spokesperson for Royal Stoke University Hospital said it continues to treat the other three, "following serious injuries sustained in the incident at Alton Towers on Tuesday."
Among those on board The Smiler was Vanisha Singh, who was in the second row of the carriage with her mother Chanda, 49, and her sister Meera, 26.
She told the Sun there had been "technical difficulties" moments before they embarked on the ride, as several test cars were sent ahead of them.
Paul Kelly, from the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions (BALPPA) said the industry was "shocked and devastated" by the news.
"It's very rare and a lot of people are very upset. This is something which happened outside normal parameters."
Mr Kelly said the investigation into what happened would cover everything, including the people working the ride, the manufacturer's instructions, and the climactic conditions.
He added: "I would like to reassure the public that theme parks are a very safe environment on a normal day out".
The rollercoaster, which has a world-record 14 loops, has been closed twice over safety concerns since opening two years ago.
An Alton Towers spokesman said: "The decision has been taken that Alton Towers theme park will remain closed on Thursday following the incident on The Smiler.
"Guests with pre-booked tickets and those arriving at the theme park will have the choice of a full refund or an alternative dated ticket.
"Guests with pre-booked tickets have the option to use their tickets tomorrow at an alternative attraction. See website for more info."
