Matt Flynn scored the only goal as Annan Athletic remained within a point of the promotion play-off places with victory over Berwick Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors had the better of the early possession but it was Annan who came closest to scoring, Peter Weatherson's free-kick tipped on to the post by Kevin Walker.
Berwick netted through Blair Henderson but he was flagged offside.
And Flynn's sweet strike in off the post sealed a late win for the hosts.
