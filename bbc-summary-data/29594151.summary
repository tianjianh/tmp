The Prepare For Hell tour will be headlined by Slipknot and will see the two bands performing nine dates, starting in Sheffield on 16 January.
They will then go on to play shows in Glasgow, London and Cardiff before finishing in Birmingham on 27 January.
"The UK has always been very special for us. In a lot of ways, it's where this insanity began," said Slipknot's frontman Corey Taylor.
"So, for this tour, we decided to try and hit as many places as we could.
"We're coming back for the people who started this for us: that would be you. Prepare yourselves... Hell is coming."
The announcement comes a week ahead of Slipknot's fifth album, 5; The Gray Chapter, going on pre-sale.
The album is their first new music for six years and the band have promised "all new masks" for the shows.
An opening band for the tour will be confirmed at a later date.
The Prepare For Hell dates are as follows:
Sheffield, Motorpoint Arena - 16
Glasgow, SSE Hydro - 18
Newcastle, Metro Radio Arena - 19
Manchester, Manchester Arena - 20
Liverpool, Echo Arena - 22
London, The SSE Arena, Wembley - 23
