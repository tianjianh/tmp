Benny Collins, 40, a physiotherapist at Morriston Hospital's A&E department, was pulled from the sea at Three Cliffs Bay on Tuesday afternoon.
He was flown to hospital where his colleagues tried to save him, but he died.
His nine-year-old son was rescued along with him and needed hospital treatment.
Mr Collins's wife Melanie is a nurse at the hospital.
In a statement, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board said: "Benny was a very popular, gifted and much-loved member of staff.
"His wife, Melanie, is also one of our senior nurses, so this tragedy has struck at the very heart of the health board. "
National Trust Wales, which owns approximately 75% of the beach, said: "Our advice to anyone using Three Cliffs beach is not to bathe there.
"We have safety signs making it clear that people are putting their lives at risk if they go in the water in strong surf conditions or when the water is cold."
It added that extra safety signs advising against swimming would be placed on the beach.
Swansea Council said although it does not own Three Cliffs Bay it would meet with the National Trust to discuss water safety.
Mr Collins has become the latest person to die at the beach.
In June, Jason North from Macclesfield, Cheshire, died trying to get his children out of the water.
In August 2013, Wendy Phillips of Landore, Swansea, drowned at Three Cliffs Bay and the assistant Swansea coroner questioned the lack of lifeguard cover, but could not say for certain whether it would have prevented her death.
The RNLI said in order to provide a lifeguard service it had to have an agreement with the landowner, in this case the National Trust and Pennard Golf Club.
A spokesman said: "The RNLI can provide a safety service and are giving advice and guidance in best practice to the landowner."
Several nearby beaches on Gower including Langland, Caswell and Port Eynon do have RNLI cover in the summer but Three Cliffs Bay does not.
James Jones, who works at PJ's Surf Shop in Llangennith, said rip currents can make the area dangerous.
He said: "You can get rips and currents at Three Cliffs. One stream goes out through the bay and that can cause a rip current.
"It will create a flow out into the sea, they call it a rip current you can get dragged out.
"I would say it's one of the more dangerous beaches to swim on the Gower, but saying that, at different times the rips would be different and the water calmer."
