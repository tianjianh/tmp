Police are appealing for witnesses after the Northern Ireland striker told them of the incident during the 1-0 defeat by Hearts on Saturday.
"It is in the hands of the police," said Clark. "It is a police matter.
"Josh is in a happy place as a person, as a lad. He has done what he had to do and that is the way it will remain."
Kilmarnock, who sit second bottom of the Scottish Premiership, host Ross County on Tuesday and Clark insisted that Magennis' preparations will not be hampered by the incident.
"He was in yesterday morning and he will train this evening," said the manager. "There's no issues."
Police have issued a description of a man, thought to be sitting in Lower Section E of Hearts' Wheatfield Stand, who is said to have directed racial abuse towards Magennis.
