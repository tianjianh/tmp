The 66-year-old was driving a white Toyota Yaris involved in a collision with a white Daf lorry and a grey BMW on Wednesday at 09:10.

The road at the scene was shut for six hours for crash investigations.

"We know that the road was busy at the time and anyone with any information which might help should call us at Dumfries on 101."
