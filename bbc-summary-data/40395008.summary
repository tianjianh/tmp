BBC Alba Man of the Match Dunky Kerr scored a vital double for the Tighnabruaich side who remain on course for a clean sweep of all of shinty's senior honours.
Meanwhile, Lovat, 3-0 away winners over Lochaber, and Newtonmore who edged visitors Fort William, fought their way through to the North semi-final of the Artemis MacAulay Cup.
Kinlochshiel ended a run of five games without a win when they came back in the second half for a 2-1 success at Kingussie to leapfrog their opponents into second place behind Kyles in the Marine Harvest Premiership.
And Kilmallie consigned local rivals Lochaber to the bottom of the table on goal difference with a 3-2 defeat of Glenurquhart at Drumnadrochit.
In an often uninspiring Celtic Society final, Kerr got an early breakthrough for Kyles on a sometimes rain-lashed Taynuilt pitch which challenged players' ability to keep their feet.
Camanachd squandered a number of chances in an otherwise goalless first half. They regretted their misses when Kerr got Kyles' second just 40 seconds after the restart when the ball broke to him out on the left and he found the net with a deft chip.
Midway through the second half, the game was over as a contest when Roddy MacDonald pounced on a defensive error to make it 3-0 to Kyles.
Camanachd pulled one back when Daniel Cameron evaded his marker to get on to a long free hit and slot the ball home but, despite valiant late efforts, they were unable to advance further.
Greg Matheson scored the only goal of the first half against Lochaber at Spean Bridge and rounded off the scoring the latter stages, after Lewis Tawse had scored Lovat's second.
Meanwhile, Lovat's semi-final opponents Newtonmore, despite home advantage, made heavy weather of their lower league cup opponents. Newtonmore started well with a Glen MacKintosh double in the opening quarter but Alexander MacMillan immediately tightened things up again.
There was no further scoring for the next hour of play before Steven MacDonald got Newtonmore's third. However, Fort William were still not finished and Lachie Shaw scored their second in the penultimate minute to produce a tight finish.
On The Dell, Lee Bain got a breakthrough for Kingussie in the first half. It was then well past the hour mark before Finlay MacRae equalised and the same player followed up with a late winner for Shiel, who recorded their first victory since they vanquished Newtonmore 4-1 on May 6th.
An early own goal from Glenurquhart keeper Gary MacKintosh sent Kilmallie on their way and a well spaced Daniel Stewart double made it 3-0. Within three minutes, Michael Fraser and Lachie Smith pulled it back to 3-2 and there it remained.
Towards the bottom of the National Division, Oban Celtic and Strathglass fought out a 2-2 draw when Daniel Madej twice put the Argyll side ahead, only for Scott Douglas to grab both equalisers for Strathglass, the second with just three minutes remaining.
Four different scorers sent Caberfeidh through to the Balliemore Cup final 4-3 at Beauly.
