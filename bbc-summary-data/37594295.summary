Greenock Morton stunned the league leaders Queen of the South with three confident strikes in the first half paving the way for a convincing win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Forbes has the visitors in front early before Jamie McDonagh and Gary Oliver added to the scoreline.
Jai Quitongo scored from a well worked corner kick to increase Queen's misery.
And then Morton captain Thomas O'Ware scored a penalty to wrap up an emphatic win ahead of next week's League Cup semi-final with Aberdeen.
Queen of the South had started strongly and forced a couple of early corners, with talisman Steven Dobbie lashing the ball high over the bar from the edge of the box when he should have done better.
But Morton soon took control and stunned the home fans with the opener.
Forbes cut inside Jordan Marshall effortlessly down the Morton right wing, before curling a delightful shot past the unsighted Lee Robinson in the home goal.
Midway through the first half, against the run of play, Dobbie dashed past the visiting defence and found the space to get a shot at goal, but he dragged the effort just wide of the post.
The visitors were by far the better side though and it was no surprise to see the lead doubled by McDonagh shortly after the half hour. Again, the goal came from an attack down the right-wing where Queens had looked vulnerable all afternoon.
Shock amongst the home fans turned to despair when Morton's third again came from the same area of the pitch.
This time Oliver was the man to supply a fine finish to the delight of the 150 or so travelling supporters.
Queen of the South came back into the game after the break for a spell, but couldn't convert pressure into clear cut chances.
At the other end, Quitongo showed some brilliant footwork before beating Robinson with a fine shot, only to be denied by the inside of the post.
It proved only a stay of execution, as the little striker drilled in a fine finish after a tremendous training ground corner.
O'Ware added to the hurt for Queens fans as he fired in a spot kick.
Match ends, Queen of the South 0, Morton 5.
