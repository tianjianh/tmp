A 17-year-old boy has been arrested. A 14-year-old arrested earlier was released without charge.
A spokesperson for the fire service said it was alerted to the blaze at Dawn Paper's premises on Donore Road at around 22:00 local time on Saturday.
The fire service said it expected to have crews at the site for the rest of the day.
The roof of the building has collapsed and what remains of it is expected to smoulder for a number of days.
At one point during the night 12 units of the fire brigade tackled the blaze.
There are no reports of any casualties.
Dawn Paper was established in 1988 and the company manufactures industrial cleaning paper and domestic tissue paper products for the Irish market.
