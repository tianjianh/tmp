Mick Lowes: Newcastle United commentator on 25 years as 'Voice of the Toon'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Much has changed around Newcastle United over the past 25 years but there has been one constant - the presence of commentator Mick Lowes.

Lowes calls his final Magpies game on Saturday when Blackburn Rovers visit St James' Park in the Championship.
BBC Sport looks back on a quarter of a century of highlights covering the Black and Whites.
Before arriving at the BBC in Newcastle, Lowes had commentated extensively for London station Capital on a World Cup and hundreds of games across the Football League. Swapping the metropolis for the provinces proved no less high profile thanks to one man in particular - Kevin Keegan.
If Keegan started it all and laid foundations, the man who helped lift Newcastle to new levels was Alan Shearer. The fans' favourite fitted the bill perfectly - the hometown hero back to fire in the goals. Lowes was able to catalogue them all from his commentary position.
Having started his Newcastle commentary career at The Valley, home of Charlton Athletic, for a 2-1 Second Division victory in August 1991, within three years the Magpies were strolling through Europe. It became a regular jaunt for Lowes, the club and especially the fans - enjoying the delights of Antwerp, Milan, Barcelona and others.
There are huge similarities between the club that Lowes began commentating on with Keegan turning up on Tyneside, and the revitalised model of 2016-17 under Rafael Benitez. Can Benitez follow in Keegan's footsteps and once again restore Newcastle to England's elite? He has already made strides towards that goal, and can make it 10 straight wins - a club record - with victory against Rovers in Lowes' final game.
