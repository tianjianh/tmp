The Welsh Retail Consortium said footfall grew by 4.5% in April compared to the same month last year.
But there was also an increase in empty stores - rising to 12.9%, up from 12.5% in January. The UK average was 9.3%.
The consortium said the results were "a mixed bag for Welsh retailers".
Numbers visiting the High Street in April were above the three-month average of 3.3% and the 12-month average of 1.3%.
Sara Jones, the consortium's head of policy and external affairs, said: "With shopper numbers rising across all destinations - high street, retail park and shopping centre - confidence will be growing amongst retailers.
"The Easter period will no doubt have had a positive impact, with shoppers making the most of the holiday period to visit Welsh stores."
She added that the "challenge" was ensuring footfall growth was "sustained and improved upon".
