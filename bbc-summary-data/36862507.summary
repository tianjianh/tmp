York City Knights: League One rugby league side announce closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rugby league club York City Knights have closed down with immediate effect as a result of financial difficulties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The League One club blamed declining revenues caused by playing at York City FC's Bootham Crescent ground following their eviction from Huntington Stadium.
York moved ground in 2014 to allow York City Council to construct a new stadium to be used by both teams.
"The financial situation shows no promise of improving with a move to the new stadium," a club statement said.
"We know the vast majority of our supporters and the people of York and beyond will be saddened by this news.
"We hope that rugby league can stay alive in York and someone will come along and succeed where we could not."
