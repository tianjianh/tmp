The England Boxing Junior Championships in Portsmouth have been cancelled this weekend because of police warnings of a "threat to life".

England Boxing said in a statement it is trying to find a solution and could move it to Wakefield in Yorkshire.
But it added: "Our top priority must be the safety of our members."
Superintendent Will Schofield said police had shared "intelligence relating to ongoing investigations that may have an impact on this event".
"It was agreed by all parties that the event should be cancelled," added Supt Schofield, of Hampshire Police.
England Boxing said police had told it "virtually nothing beyond the fact that the threat is serious and includes a threat to life".
It added that police had warned them that releasing further details "might also put people at risk".
The statement described the cancellation of the event, due to be held at the Mountbatten Centre on Saturday and Sunday, as a "tragedy" for the young boxers scheduled to fight and the financial loss to clubs.
"The fact that anyone might want to endanger life at a boxing event is beyond our understanding and if it's true it is disgraceful," added the statement.
