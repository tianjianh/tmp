Hemsby chip shop fire 'disaster' for resort

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A seaside resort's fish and chip shop that was razed to the ground by fire is another "disaster", two years after the village was badly hit by flooding, a parish councillor has said.

The shop on Beach Road in Hemsby erupted into flames on Friday.
The building was completely gutted and  other nearby premises were damaged.
Mike Peake, vice chairman of the parish council, said: "It's devastating for all the people here. I think it's an absolute disaster for Hemsby."
He added: "It's a blot on the landscape after the disaster in 2013 when the sea took the chalets all away. What more can happen in Hemsby?
"It'll be weeks before the smoke smell and everything else goes away from here."
At its height 45 firefighters tackled the chip shop blaze after it started in a deep fat fryer.
It was eventually damped down on Friday evening, leaving the shop as just a shell.
Hemsby felt the full brunt of the winter tidal surge two years ago when a number of homes and its lifeboat station were swept into the sea.
Since then the community has been raising funds to improve coastal defences.
Mr Peake said he was pleased holidaymakers were in the village, but did not think there were as many at this time of year as there should be.
Local business owners told the BBC the chip shop and its adjoining restaurant had just undergone an 18-month refurbishment.
Barry Cunniffe, who owns a nearby shop, said: "We're fortunate, we're saved, we'll have damage in the sense of smoke but that's all recoverable. It's a devastating loss to the [chip shop] owner.
"Every trader along here has lost a day's trading and I'm sure it will be affected in the days to come."
