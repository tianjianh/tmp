[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of people are travelling from Leeds to London to retrace the steps of three bombers who carried out the 7th of July bombings almost 10 years ago.

On that day in 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, and Hasib Hussain, 18, left Leeds to carry out their deadly mission in London.
People from different religions are joining the "peace journey" to mark the 10th anniversary of 7/7 on Tuesday.
Imam Qari Asim said it was aimed at breaking down barriers between faiths.
Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs and atheists aged 18 to 25 will travel 200 miles on the train from Leeds to London.
They will lay flowers at King's Cross and visit the Hyde Park memorial to the 52 victims of the attacks.
This is a lively group of 15 young people travelling from Leeds to London.
A few tell me they have decided to make this journey to learn more about communities and to gain insight into how people dealt with the aftermath of 7/7.
When we arrived at the memorial I noticed a change in the mood within the group, sombre and reflective.
Usman, a young Muslim man from Wakefield, came over and told me he felt sad, sad that local lads carried out the attacks. Sad that lives were lost. He said: "There are Muslim names also on these pillars, terrorists attack all communities."
The group walked away from the memorial in silence, heading to a synagogue where Muslims and Jews will gather to deliver messages of tolerance and interfaith.
The group will also visit an Alyth synagogue in north London that lost one of its members in the bombings.
Mr Asim, from the Makkah Masjid mosque, said: "This is a very sensitive and symbolic journey.
"We have young people from the city which was home to three of the perpetrators going to meet members of a synagogue who suffered so terribly from the 7/7 attacks.
"We're going down with a completely different mindset to the bombers.
"Their aim was destruction and causing mayhem, our journey is all about building castles of peace."
The event, organised by Leeds Citizens, is part of a project to bring together young people from different backgrounds who would not ordinarily share their experiences with one another.
Mr Asim said: "It has been an eye-opener for them and us.
"They have been able to air their views and learn from each other rather than being lectured at."
