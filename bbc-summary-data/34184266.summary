[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tory minister Ros Altmann expelled from Labour Party

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative minister Baroness Altmann has been expelled from the Labour Party after it was found she had been a member for 18 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prime Minister David Cameron made the former Saga director a Tory peer so she could become a pensions minister.
But The Huffington Post website revealed Baroness Altmann had been a Labour member for the first four months in her new role and had been offered a vote in the party's leadership contest.
The peer was not available for comment.
She is understood to have renewed her Labour membership in March, weeks before the general election, despite working as a "business champion" for older people for the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition.
A spokeswoman for the minister said she "has taken an interest in all three parties" because of her previous role as director of over-50s group Saga and had previously acted as an adviser to former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair.
"She is now only a member of the Conservatives," added the spokeswoman.
The Labour Party, which has been under fire recently over the verification process for people wanting to take part in its leadership election, expelled the Tory minister as soon as the anomaly was discovered.
A Labour source claimed the Conservatives did not carry out "even basic checks" on their ministerial appointments.
But a Conservative representative suggested it was Labour that should be embarrassed for offering a well-known Tory minister a vote in its leadership election.
