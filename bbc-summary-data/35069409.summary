A Londonderry-born scientist has been presented with this year's Nobel Prize for Medicine at a ceremony in Stockholm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Professor William C Campbell, 85, was jointly awarded the accolade along with Japanese scientist Satoshi Omura.
They have found a new way of tackling infections caused by roundworm parasites by using the drug known as ivermectin.
It treats river blindness and lymphatic filariasis.
River blindness is an eye and skin disease that can ultimately lead to blindness. Lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, can cause painful swelling of the limbs.
Both affect people living in some of the poorest countries in the world.
Mr Campbell, who was born in Derry but grew up in Donegal, said it was a "once in a lifetime experience receiving the prize".
"It was an amazing setting and we got a police escort to the ceremony," he said.
"I got a box with a medal inside. I also got a certificate.
"Some of my family from Donegal came to Stockholm with me to celebrate. It was a delightful experience.
"Getting the prize was very much because of team effort.
"I would love to come home and show everyone the medal."
Mr Campbell studied at Trinity College Dublin. He then moved to the US where he worked as a parasite biology researcher.
He is the second Irish person to win a Nobel Prize for Science.
Earnest Walton collected the physics award in 1951.
