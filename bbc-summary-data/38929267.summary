Alastair Cook, England's highest Test run scorer, stepped down on Monday after a record 59 Tests in charge.
Root, vice-captain to Cook, is the favourite to take over but director of cricket Strauss previously refused to "rule anyone in or out" of the role.
A new captain will be appointed before England's limited-overs tour of the Caribbean in March.
The trio met Strauss and his team on Thursday, although it is understood that the discussions were not considered as interviews for the position.
Strauss previously stated that he would be speaking to senior squad members in leadership roles about who should succeed Cook.
Bowler Broad previously captained the Twenty20 side between 2011 and 2014 and all-rounder Stokes was vice-captain on the recent limited-overs tour of Bangladesh.
Batsman Root was described as the "obvious candidate" for the captaincy by England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson on Tuesday.
Wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who is the limited-overs vice-captain but not a Test regular, was also spoken to over the phone by Strauss and his team.
