Home side Cardiff looked in control as goals from Matthew Myers and Patrick Asselin left them 2-0 ahead.
However, Blair Riley replied for Belfast and Jonathan Boxill then diverted a Mike Quesnele shot to the Cardiff net early in the final period.
Chris Higgins hit Belfast's over-time winner to boost their title hopes.
The home side opened the scoring at 11:11 when Myers' shot found it's way into the Giants goal with Jackson Whistle unsighted.
Cardiff doubled their lead five minutes into the second period as an attempted Joey Martin pass found its way to Asselin who shot into the empty net.
However, Riley replied within two minutes after being set up by Higgins and Michael Forney before Boxill levelled on 43:01 as he directed Quesnele's fierce slapshot to the Cardiff net.
After Belfast keeper Whistle made some great saved during the remainder of the third period, Higgins pounced on a Cardiff defensive mistake to fire in the winner two minutes and 34 seconds into the scheduled five minutes of over-time.
Belfast are back in action on Sunday away to Dundee Stars (18:30 GMT) before their home games against Nottingham and Dundee next Friday and Saturday.
