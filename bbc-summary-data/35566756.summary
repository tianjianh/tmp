[SN]TITLE[SN]
Championship: Burnley 2-0 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Sam Vokes and Scott Arfield sealed a Championship victory for Burnley to extend Neil Warnock's wait for a first win as Rotherham boss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The success put the Clarets second, with Middlesbrough not in action and Brighton thrashed 4-1 by Cardiff City.
Vokes gave them the lead from the spot in the first half after debutant Lloyd Doyley brought down George Boyd.
Rotherham frustrated the hosts for much of the game but Arfield ended lingering fightback hopes with a late second.
Joe Newell had the Millers' best chance in a rare raid forward, but failed to beat goalkeeper Tom Heaton from close range.
Sean Dyche's side dominated but did not fully capitalise on the chances that came their way, with Andre Gray's header brushing the crossbar and goalkeeper Lee Camp making good saves from Boyd and Stephen Ward to keep the score down.
Burnley are now unbeaten in nine Championship games, but the size of Warnock's task in dragging Rotherham out of danger was evident as they mustered just one shot on target at Turf Moor.
The defeat left the visitors third from bottom and five points adrift of MK Dons, the team immediately above them.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"It was hard work. Neil (Warnock) being Neil has got a new group and has got a bit of fervour to them. They came here, I imagine, with no expectation and tried to play on that.
"They broke the game up and it was a disjointed game. But as ever, I like the fact we can win games in different ways.
"We have won it outrightly with the chances with have made, we have deserved victory."
Rotherham manager Neil Warnock:
"I am really happy, they can't be too down.
"You don't play Burnley every week. We have got some tough games but teams that we will play against will have some tough games.
"We are looking forward to the challenge."
