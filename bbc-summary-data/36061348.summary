[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dumbarton secured their Championship status for another season after coming back from behind to beat St Mirren.

Garry Fleming's wonderful half-volley was a worthy and valuable winner for the Sons, who are eight points ahead of Livingston with two games remaining.
The Buddies had gone in front through a tidy strike by Calum Gallagher.
But Keith Watson's own goal from Mark Docherty's cross brought Dumbarton level before Fleming's masterful finish.
On the 400 year anniversary of William Shakespeare's passing, the quote of his that came to mind was "the course of true love never did run smooth".
A group of six Swiss Sons fans had made the journey of over 1,000 miles to come and watch Dumbarton try to wrap up their place in the second tier for the fifth successive campaign. That's true love, but the afternoon was not going to run completely smoothly.
Victory for the hosts coupled with Livingston dropping points away to Queen of the South was what was needed to do the trick
That formula began looking ambitious after just 10 minutes when St Mirren's long throw was only half-cleared by the Dumbarton defence, allowing Gallagher to send a well controlled, low volley beyond Jamie Ewings and into the corner of the net for his seventh goal of the campaign.
Sons defender Steven Saunders almost levelled immediately but his header was deflected past the same post Garry Fleming would shoot wide of minutes later.
St Mirren looked like they might extend their lead on two occasions before the break, with David Clarkson's effort blocked by Sons defender Gregor Buchanan and Lawrence Shankland missing the target from outside the box.
But it was Dumbarton who netted with first-half minutes ebbing away. Docherty, whose young son was the Sons' mascot for this game, collected the ball on the left hand-side and his centre was turned into his own net by the unfortunate Watson.
Heffernan's low drive off the inside of the post for Dumbarton and Shankland's shot that cracked the crossbar meant the second half got off to a blistering start.
Sons' forward Fleming went one better than that pair, though, sending a lovely right-footed half-volley into the top left corner of Jamie Langfield's net to put the home side ahead.
Fleming's 11th goal of the season looked like it could be the one that preserved their spell in the second tier of Scottish football.
Buchanan needed to be on his toes to clear a trundling Gallagher shot off the line as Dumbarton's nervousness increased, but the Sons coped to ensure Fleming's beauty would steal the show.
