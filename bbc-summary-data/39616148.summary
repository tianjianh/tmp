Antrim made it 16 Ulster SHC titles in a row by hammering Armagh 5-22 to 1-12 in Sunday's decider at Owenbeg.

It was one-sided from the start with Paul Shiels, Neil McManus and Conor Johnston netting for the holders.
Fiarcha Bradley's goal saw Armagh trail 3-16 to 1-2 at the break before Johnston added two more Antrim goals in a 22-point victory.
Antrim's Paddy Burke and Orchard defender John Corvan were sent-off in the second half for two yellow cards.
This proved to be little more than a training session for Antrim ahead of next weekend's Christy Ring Cup encounter against Carlow.

Antrim capitalised on a strong breeze on their backs in the first half and the outcome was settled by the interval.
Shiels hit the top corner and within a minute Ciaran Clarke set up McManus for an easy goal.
Armagh needed a bit of fortune and they got it when Connor Corvan's free struck the upright and Bradley reacted quickest to net.
The impressive Johnston burst clear and fired home Antrim's third goal to give them a 20-point advantage at the break.
Armagh did improve on the restart with the wind advantage and David Carvill rattled over six points in the second half.
Antrim's eased up with the game won but Johnston was hungry for more goals and the forward completed a hat-trick.
It was far from being a physical game but Burke and John Corvan were dismissed as the Saffrons were crowned provincial champions once again.
Derry claimed the Ulster Hurling Shield title by beating Tyrone 1-17 to 1-12, but they survived a major scare in the final at Pairc Eire Og in Carrickmore.
The Oak Leafers went into the decider as hot favourites to triumph and reclaim their place in the senior championship next season.
Ruairi Convery's dead ball striking was the difference in the end, a 12 points tally helping his side to a five-point win.
Convery and Tyrone's Damien Casey were the main marksmen in the first half, which ended with wind-assisted Derry ahead by 0-9 to 0-6.
Casey brought Tyrone level three minutes into the second half, but a Gerald Bradley goal settled Oak Leaf nerves.
Convery continued to hit the target as Derry went seven clear, but Tyrone hit back with a Justin Kelly goal to make it a three-point game going into the final five minutes.
But Derry's experience told in the end, with Convery landing another couple of frees. He also had a penalty saved by Conor McElhatton in stoppage time.
