The Social Democratic and Labour Party's Alasdair McDonnell looks likely to face a challenge to his leadership.

The BBC understands at least five branches of the party have nominated Colum Eastwood to stand against him at the party conference in November.
Sources said Mr Eastwood, 32, will spend the weekend deciding what to do but supporters expect him to run for the leadership.
Mr Eastwood is the SDLP's youngest MLA and a former Mayor of Derry.
In 2012, the Foyle MLA faced controversy after carrying the coffin of a friend who was a former member of the Official IRA and the INLA.
Dr McDonnell, 65,  was elected SDLP leader in November 2011.
On Thursday, Dr McDonnell accused the Democratic Unionist Party of not wanting to work with Catholics and said Sinn FÃ©in "can't tell the truth" about the IRA.

The deadline for a potential challenge expired at 17:00 BST on Friday.
Normally the party leader is returned unopposed at each party conference. But not this year.
At least five branches of the SDLP have nominated Foyle MLA Colum Eastwood.
Dr McDonnell has faced calls to step down before, notably from the man who held the post before him, Mark Durkan.
Now it looks like all of Dr McDonnell's famous fighting qualities are to be tested like never before.
He defended his comments in an interview with the BBC on Friday.
He also said he did not expect to be challenged.
"I don't expect to face a challenge, but if there's a challenge, I'll face it," he said.
"I have a very robust programme flowing at the moment, of renewal in the party and it's working and people are up for it and we're bringing in a lot of new members and a lot of new people.
"We've a whole spate of new people proposing to go forward for the assembly. We brought in a fantastic spate of people for the council elections last year so I will stand on my record and it's democracy if somebody wants to come forward.
"I will win, yes. I will stand on my record. I have a job to complete and I will complete it."
Dr McDonnell has been the South Belfast MP since May 2005 and an MLA since 1998.
Meanwhile, the South Belfast MLA Fearghal McKinney is expected to make a bid for the deputy leader's post. It is currently held by Dolores Kelly.
The former reporter replaced Connall McDevitt who stood down in 2013 and sits on a number of Stormont scrutiny committees, including health and justice.
Mr McKinney is a close ally of Dr McDonnell.
Like the leadership contender, he has to secure nominations from at least five local branches.
