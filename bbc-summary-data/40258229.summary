[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of a major route in Stoke-on-Trent has reopened after a lorry spilled its load of nails across a carriageway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A500 northbound at Etruria was closed while the nails were cleared and assistance given to other vehicles that had punctured tyres.
The road was shut between the A53 Etruria Road and Basford roundabout and Porthill Bank from 05:00 BST to 16:00, Highways England said.
It said a magnet had been used to remove "tens of thousands" of nails.
A local tyre garage tweeted that one customer had "20-plus screws per tyre".

It was thought the road would reopen some time on Tuesday morning, but Highways England said due to the size and nature of the spillage, it would remain closed into the afternoon.
Motorists were advised to avoid the area and follow diversions.
The Potteries buses, run by First Group, said all of its services were delayed due to the closure.
