Mark Cullen scored inside two minutes, turning in the rebound after Ben Alnwick pushed his penalty onto the post following a foul on Elliot Lee.
Brad Potts rounded Alnwick to double the lead after 30 minutes.
Michael Bostwick twice shot wide for Posh after half-time as Blackpool kept a third clean sheet in a row.
Peterborough manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:
"We didn't start the best, that's for sure, and you don't want to come to anywhere and give them the boost and yourselves the uphill battle.
"Their two centre-halves were inspired, they defended their goal with real aggression, real determination.
"Despite our best efforts, and there were a lot of forward efforts in that second half, they just showed that little bit more desire to keep a clean sheet than we did to put the ball in the net."
