The 68-year-old Wiltshire rider was awarded an OBE in the 2017 New Year Honours list for services to Para-sport, having received an MBE in 2009.
She won five team gold medals at Paralympic Games since 1996, plus an individual gold in Beijing in 2008.
"This has been a hard decision, but I know it is right. It's time to give others a chance," Dunham said.
"I don't want to start with a new horse and then have to part with him. I've loved it all - it's been exciting, I've met some wonderful people and have travelled the world."
Starting with her first Para-equestrian dressage World Championships in 1994, Dunham won 32 major medals, including 19 golds.
"Anne's immense contribution to Para-equestrian dressage over the past two decades cannot be underestimated," said British Dressage chief executive Jason Brautigam.
"She has been the flag-bearer for our sport ever since dressage was first introduced at the Paralympics in 1996."
Para-equestrian dressage performance manager Sarah Armstrong added: "For Anne to close her career on such a high note must be an immensely proud moment for her, her family and her home coach. We wish her well in her next adventure."
