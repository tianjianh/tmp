The 28-year-old was among a group of players involved in a drug-trafficking case earlier this year, but the charges against him were later dropped.

"Being a hooker, Leeds have got a great forward pack who like to go forward and that excites me."

"We are pleased to have signed a player with the experience that Beau has," Leeds head coach Brian McDermott said.
"He has been playing in the NRL for eight seasons and, having spoken to him, I know he is very excited about the challenge of coming to England and playing with the Rhinos."
