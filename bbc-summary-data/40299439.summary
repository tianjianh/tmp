[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Denis McCauley was speaking at a public hearing in advance of an inquest into the tragedy at a pier in County Donegal on 20 March 2016.
Five family members on a day trip died when their car slipped off Buncrana Pier into Lough Swilly.
Dr McCauley said it was one of the worst family tragedies along the Irish coastline in living memory.
Sean McGrotty, who was 49, died with his two sons Mark, 12, and Evan, eight.
Ruth Daniels, who was 57, died alongside her daughter Jodie Lee, who was 14.
A baby was saved - handed from the sinking car to a man who ran into the water to help.
The Coroner said the inquest, which will be held in November, will try to find out what happened on the night as well as what lessons can be learned from the tragedy.
A number of McGrotty family members were present at the hearing.
