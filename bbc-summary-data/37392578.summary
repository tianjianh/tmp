[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 0-0 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Phil Parkinson's current and former clubs slugged out a 0-0 draw at the Macron Stadium to keep Bolton and Bradford among the League One pacesetters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the first meeting between the teams since 1998, Parkinson's Bolton created the best of a shortage of goalscoring opportunities.
But the visitors, roared on by 4,388 fans in a bumper 17,486 attendance, ground out a fifth successive league draw.
Bolton's clearest chance of breaking the deadlock arguably came in the opening 20 seconds as Colin Doyle beat away a shot from Sammy Ameobi.
REACTION: Bradford City boss Stuart McCall speaks to BBC Radio Leeds
Former Bradford favourite Jamie Proctor headed over and Doyle saved from Ameobi again before Mark Marshall forced Mark Howard into a rare save 11 minutes before half-time.
The second half was similarly cagey, with James Henry and substitute Zach Clough going close as Bolton again shaded the contest in terms of possession and territory.
Bradford finished strongly but weak efforts from Marshall and substitute Jordy Hiwula were comfortably dealt with by Howard.
