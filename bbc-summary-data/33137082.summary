[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Soviet army officer Dmitri Kovtun will appear by video-link after he was granted "core participant status" by inquiry chairman, Sir Robert Owen.
Mr Litvinenko died of radioactive poisoning on 23 November 2006.
Mr Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi are suspected of murdering him but both deny involvement and remain in Russia.
It was during a meeting with the pair at a London hotel in November 2006 that Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of the radioactive substance polonium-210.
The 43-year-old had been an officer with the Federal Security Service - the successor to the KGB - but fled to Britain where he became a UK citizen and a fierce critic of the Kremlin.
Mr Kovtun and his colleague Mr Lugovoi initially refused to take part in the inquiry, which opened in January and is sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.
However, in March Mr Kovtun changed his mind and offered to give evidence.
A statement issued by the inquiry on Monday said: "Sir Robert Owen, chairman of the Litvinenko Inquiry, has designated Mr Dmitri Kovtun as a core participant to the Inquiry, pursuant to rules 5(2)(a) and (c) of the Inquiry Rules 2006.
"Sir Robert is satisfied that Mr Kovtun has complied in full with his directions dated 2 April 2015."
The statement also said that Mr Kovtun "does intend to assert the privilege against self-incrimination".
