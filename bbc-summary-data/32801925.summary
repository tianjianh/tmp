In 2006, Bobby and Christi Shepherd were poisoned by a faulty gas boiler during a Thomas Cook holiday.
Speaking to BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed, Peter Fankhauser said that he regretted saying that Thomas Cook had done "nothing wrong" when giving evidence at the Coroner's Court.
"My words were poorly chosen and I regret that," said Mr Fankhauser.
"We did not handle our relationship with the family well. During the past nine years, we failed to show the compassion that we should have shown to the family," he said.
"I don't want to blame the lawyers. It's ultimately my responsibility how we communicate," said Mr Fankhauser. "Obviously we could have done better."
Speaking at a presentation of the company's financial results, Mr Fankhauser said that Thomas Cook intended to communicate with the family directly, as opposed to through the media.
His comments came as the travel company reported its results for the six months to the end of March.
Thomas Cook said it had narrowed its losses and expected to hit its profit target for 2015, in spite of threats to boycott the company over the Corfu incident.
The company reported a pre-tax loss of Â£303m in the six months to the end of March, compared with a Â£366m loss a year earlier.
"We expect that these continuing improvements will lead to further growth in [2015], consistent with our expectations at the full year results last November," said Mr Fankhauser in a statement.
Thomas Cook said that its UK business had performed well, while its German tour operating business "continues to experience tough trading conditions".
"Our summer 2015 holiday bookings across the group are encouraging, especially for our important fourth quarter, which is offsetting some weakness in the third quarter," said the company.
The company may resume paying dividends in 2016, it said.
