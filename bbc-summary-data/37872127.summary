Olympic ice hockey: Great Britain's women beaten by Poland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain's women's lost 4-3 to Poland in their second Olympic qualifying match in Kazakhstan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They must now beat hosts Kazakhstan on Sunday (10:00 GMT) to stand any chance of reaching the next stage.
Poland went 2-0 ahead before Kimberley Lane and Shannon Douglas helped GB draw level.
GB conceded twice more before a late powerplay saw captain Katie Henry convert Angela Taylor's pass.
Only the winners of the four-team group will go through to the next stage, but GB coach Cheryl Smith said: "We are still alive in this tournament.
"We just have to focus and go out and play to the best of our ability to stand a chance."
