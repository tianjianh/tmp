The Republic of Ireland star ploughed into three cyclists who had stopped on a pavement to fix a chain on 16 August.
Gibson, 27, then struck a pump at a petrol station in Greater Manchester, Trafford Magistrates' Court heard.
The ex-Manchester United player pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol, driving without due care and failing to stop after an accident.
The court heard Gibson had injury problems at the time, which made him feel "very low" at not being able to play and he had taken "various painkillers" following an operation.
Gibson told police that the evening before the crash he had gone out with his Everton team-mates and had drunk "copious amounts of alcohol".
He later arrived home and had an argument with his wife, which led to him leaving in his black Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo, he said.
Witnesses told the court how the Londonderry-born midfielder had been driving "too fast", before he mounted the pavement and collided with the men, leaving one with cuts to his legs, elbow and hand.
In a statement cyclist Philip Quinn, who sustained the worst injuries, said he recalled hearing "the roar of an engine and the skidding of tyres" before he was thrown into the air off his bike.
Another cyclist, Simon Howe, suffered soreness to his hips and back but no details of the injuries sustained by the third cyclist Andrew Moran were provided to the court.
Gibson was said to have then driven off at speed before the crash with a petrol pump in his hometown of Bowdon some minutes later.
The court heard a concerned petrol attendant called police after the midfielder got out of his car with no shoes on and filled his vehicle with fuel.
Arresting officers said they noticed an "obvious strong smell of alcohol" on Gibson's breath.
Gibson was then taken to a police station where he gave a positive reading of 57 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35.
The father-of-two told the court: "I am extremely apologetic and it was completely out of character."
As he passed a letter to the bench from Everton's club secretary, Oliver Jarvis, defending, told the court Gibson had never had any disciplinary issues at the club.
The player was banned from driving for 20 months but he was told his ban could be reduced by five months if he completed a drink-driving awareness course.
He was also ordered to pay compensation of Â£4,500 for the damaged bicycle and Â£1,000 to Mr Quinn - plus Â£100 each to the other two cyclists.
Gibson was also sentenced to a 12-month community order, with an unpaid work requirement of 200 hours.
