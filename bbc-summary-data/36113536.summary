Doctor admits falsifying drug trials on patients with sleeping disorders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Down doctor has  pleaded guilty to falsifying clinical trials on patients with sleeping disorders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Hugh McGoldrick of Crossgar Road East, Crossgar, was due to go on trial next week on a total of eight charges.
Along with two counts of falsifying clinical trials, he faced a further four charges of fraud by false representation along with two counts of perverting the course of justice.
The offences took place at his Pound Lane GP practice in Downpatrick.
A jury was sworn in at Belfast Crown Court but McGoldrick's lawyer requested that his client be "re-arraigned on counts one and two".
Standing in the dock, McGoldrick,59, pleaded guilty to two charges that on dates between 27  November 2007 and 30 June 2008 he conducted a clinical trial in breach of the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004.
'Left on the books'
A prosecution lawyer said that McGoldrick accepted that patients enrolled in the trial were probably not eligible to participate, that he breached the conditions and principles of Good Clinical Practice, believed the medication would be beneficial, and agreed to repay all the money he had received for taking part in the trial.
The prosecution requested that the remaining six counts be "left on the books".
Releasing him on continuing bail, the judge told McGoldrick:
"I should make it absolutely clear to you that by releasing you should not be taken as any of indication of what sentence will be passed other than a custodial sentence.''
