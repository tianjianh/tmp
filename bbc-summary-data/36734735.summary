Builders were working in the car park area when they discovered five items including a Roman nail and a piece of pre-glaze Roman pottery.
Archaeologists believe the artefacts may date back to 160AD or earlier.
The newly renovated town hall is due to open next summer and will include a heritage display and event space.
Support has been secured from the Heritage Lottery Fund and other external funders.
So far, work has taken place to excavate the car park site, and to create retaining walls in the basement and new parking.
Council Leader Rhondda Geekie said: "I was fascinated to hear about the Roman nail, pottery and other items discovered below the foundations of the car park. It's a timely reminder of just how much history surrounds and enriches East Dunbartonshire."
