All know their stuff but when it comes to predicting results at Euro 2016, Shearer is top of the pile after the first completed round of group games.
The former England striker has 230 points after 12 games, with Radio 5 live's senior football reporter Ian Dennis 10 points behind.
Mark Lawrenson is third, Kevin Kilbane fourth and the website's chief football writer Phil McNulty fifth.
The BBC Sport league comprises some of the finest footballing minds working at the tournament.
But league leader Shearer, who scored 30 goals in 63 games for England, is still some way behind the 330 points accrued by Gav M, J Felsenberg and Nigel Bat, who are top of the overall predictor league table. The maximum on offer were 480 points.
So far there are 260,000 playing the game with 32,000 private leagues being set up.
Ten points are awarded for a correct result (correctly guessing the winner or that the match will end as a draw). Forty points are awarded for predicting the exact scoreline.
You can create private leagues to play against friends, family or colleagues - and see how you compare to BBC pundits, as well as all the other fans who have signed up worldwide.
It is free to play and you can sign up in two easy steps - all you need to do is enter an email address and password, or use your BBC log-in if you have one.
