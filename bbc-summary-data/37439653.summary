Richard Schiff, Allison Janney, Bradley Whitford, Dule Hill, Joshua Malina, and Mary McCormack will reunite to help organise events across the state.
The stars of the former hit US political TV drama will appear in towns including Cleveland, Sandusky and Toledo.
The West Wing, also starring Martin Sheen, ran on NBC from 1999 to 2006.
Sheen played Democratic President Josiah Bartlet in the Golden Globe-winning drama, played out within the enclaves of the White House.
His former co-stars will go on the Clinton campaign trail to rally the public to vote, according to a campaign statement.
"The actors will discuss why they are supporting Clinton and urge Ohioans to register to vote ahead of the 11 October deadline and to get involved in organising their communities ahead of November's election," the statement said.
Sheen however won't be joining his former West Wing colleagues, neither will Rob Lowe, one of the drama's other main stars.
Sheen has nonetheless previously stated his support for Clinton - and been damning of her Republican rival, Donald Trump.
Sheen also appears in a new anti-Trump video called Save the Day made by the Avengers director Joss Whedon.
Over the course of its long run, The West Wing and its cast were honoured several times by the Golden Globes and the Emmys.
