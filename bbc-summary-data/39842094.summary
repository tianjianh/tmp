Mr Macron won by 66.06% to 33.94% to become, at 39-years-old, the country's youngest president.
He said that a new page was being turned in French history.
"I want it to be a page of hope and renewed trust," he said.
Mr Macron's supporters gathered in their thousands to celebrate outside the Louvre museum in central Paris and their new president later joined them.
In his speech to the crowd, he said: "Tonight you won, France won. Everyone told us it was impossible, but they don't know France."
But not everyone was happy with the result. Almost 150 protestors were arrested in Paris after they were accused of throwing missiles at police and damaging property.
Demonstrators were protesting both against Macron and against his defeated rival, Marine Le Pen.
Macron has promised to unite the country and "do everything I can over the next five years to ensure that people no longer have any reason to vote for extremes."

Emmanuel Macron has never tried to be president before.
He used to be a banker, before becoming an economic advisor for the current president Francois Hollande.
He then got the job of economic minister, which is more senior government role, in 2014.
Despite being a minister for the Socialist party, in April 2016, he set up his own political movement called En Marche!. This means 'On the move!' in French.
Many people did not agree with what he was doing and became cross with him.
He ended up resigning from the government in August. He said it was "a new step in [his] battle and to build a project... that isn't compatible with being in government".
During the election campaign, there were certain things Emmanuel Macron promised to achieve if he became president, including:
Losing candidate Marine Le Pen thanked the estimated 11 million people who had voted for her in her speech to supporters.
She also said she had wished Mr Macron success in tackling the "huge challenges" facing him.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations to Mr Macron for the "big win" and said he looked forward to working with him.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May said: "France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president."
