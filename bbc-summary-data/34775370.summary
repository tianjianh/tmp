Cheryl Blythe, from Basildon, Essex was given the warning when she was 31 years old and 24 stone (152.4kg).
She said a day trip with two friends was the turning point when she realised they had become her carers.
Ms Blythe turned down a gastric band operation and instead chose to learn about "healthy eating".

Before she began to lose weight, she had breathing problems, back pains and found walking difficult.
"I knew my health wasn't good and the things I heard from my doctor scared me."
But she said she "couldn't pretend I was OK anymore" after a day out in Southend with friends.
She was in pain, they had to stop so she could catch her breath and she could not fit into some chairs.
"I realised that at 31 my friends had become my carers," she said.
Ms Blythe who also took up exercise said she rejected a gastric band operation because she wanted to help her children "have a good understanding of healthy eating".
Now 33, she joined Slimming World two days after returning from the Southend trip and has been crowned the organisation's Woman of the Year.
"My health problems have disappeared, I no longer sit on the sidelines while my family have fun without me, my friends aren't my carers any more, I can wear whatever I want - the list is endless," she said.
