Election 2015: Birmingham candidates rise to the Brumvotes challenge

Some photographs are inevitable in the run-up to a general election, with babies, animals and high vis vests all almost guaranteed to make an appearance. This year, the candidates have taken the campaigning to another level.

The BBC's Brumvotes project asked Birmingham candidates to take part in a series of lighthearted stunts, from showing off their ball skills to playing hide and seek in the city centre.
Andrew Mitchell, Conservative candidate for Sutton Coldfield, was among the participants in a kick-up challenge - initially inspired by Aston Villa reaching the FA Cup final.
Labour's Gisela Stuart, Liberal Democrat John Hemming and the Green Party candidate Phil Simpson also took part.
Then there was an X-Factor-style sing-off, which saw Clair Braund, UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Birmingham Ladywood, attempt 90s classic Rhythm Of The Night.
Teval Stephens, standing for the Respect Party in Yardley, was pictured hiding in bushes for a Where's Wally-style picture challenge.
Other candidates were asked to show they had a sense of humour by telling jokes.
The city's parliamentary hopefuls have been quizzed on a bus, having a hair cut and slugging it out in a boxing ring.
But not everyone has embraced the Brumvotes challenges.
Ed Miliband turned the invitation to take part in the kick-up challenge, while Nick Clegg dismissed the request during a visit to Solihull.
