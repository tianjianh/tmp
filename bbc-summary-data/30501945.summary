[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Katherine Latham, 63, of Downham Market, Norfolk had been told there was a significant threat of choking.
The 93-year-old resident at Amberley Hall Care Home in King's Lynn later died, Norwich Crown Court heard.
Latham, from Railway Road, was jailed for 10 months for the ill-treatment and neglect of the woman, in October, having earlier denied the charges.
As result of her treatment at the home the elderly woman, who was not named in court, had problems breathing and was admitted to hospital where she died.
Although the patient should have been fed with a spoon the cause of death was not due to Latham's actions, the court heard.
Latham was reported and convicted for the offences of ill-treatment and neglect under mental health laws.
A spokesperson for Amberley Hall said: "As a conscientious care provider, we took immediate and appropriate action once alerted to the situation which occurred, and fully cooperated with all investigations by the police and other parties."
