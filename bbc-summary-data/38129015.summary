The body of Anita Stevenson, 39, was found in Bromborough, Wirral on Saturday, said Merseyside Police, who are treating her death as unexplained.
Jake Stevenson wrote on Facebook that it was "soul destroying" that he cannot give her "one last hug".
He added: "She loved all of our family and friends with all her heart and always thought the best of everybody."
"An amazing sister, daughter and more than anything, the best mother anyone could have wished for," Mr Stevenson wrote.
"Rest in peace for all the positivity and joy you've brought into everyone else's lives.
"I love you more than words can even describe."
Ms Stevenson, originally from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was last seen at her home in Tranmere on 18 October but was discovered on land bordering Poole Lane and Old Court House Lane in Bromborough.
Police released CCTV images captured on the day she was last seen and friends joined in the effort to find her.
A 41-year-old man from Birkenhead was previously arrested on suspicion of murder and later released.
Police have not yet released details of the post-mortem examination.
