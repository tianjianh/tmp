Two explosions that hit an election rally in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir on Friday were caused by homemade bombs, officials have said.

Four people died and over 400 were injured in the attack, which targeted the pro-Kurdish HDP party's final rally ahead of Sunday's election.
HDP officials told the BBC police believed two gas canisters packed with marbles caused the blasts.
There has been no official statement from Turkey's government.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking to gain a large majority for his Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Sunday's parliamentary vote. This would enable the party to change the constitution and extend the president's powers.
The BBC's correspondent in Istanbul, Mark Lowen, says that if the HDP reaches the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament for the first time, this would cut the AKP's majority and potentially mark a significant political change for Turkey.
There is a widespread feeling the incident will only embolden the party's supporters in this crucial election, our correspondent says.
