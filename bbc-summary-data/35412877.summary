Drivers were also checked for drugs during the festive campaign after a change to the law last spring - leading to almost 100 more arrests.
Nearly 23,000 motorists were breathalysed during December.
North Wales Police also revealed it randomly tested its own officers for drink and drugs, with all tests coming back negative.
North Wales Police revealed its youngest drink-driver was a 16-year-old who crashed a moped in Mochdre, Conwy.
The force also recorded one of the highest over-the-limit readings - a 44-year-old man from Bala, Gwynedd, who was close to four times over the legal limit of 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.
Senior officers also defended the decision to test its own staff.
"We wanted to demonstrate to the public that we were also looking inward in our preventative approach and it was pleasing to see that all tests came back negative," said Ch Insp Darren Wareing.
