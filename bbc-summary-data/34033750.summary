The crew of the LÉ Niamh brought 107 migrants aboard on Saturday evening about 110km north-east of Tripoli.
They then saved another 118 migrants on a separate boat in the same area in the early hours of Sunday morning.
The migrants, including 12 children, were trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea on two inflatable vessels.
Italy's coastguard said more than 2,000 migrants and refugees were rescued on Saturday in what was one of the biggest single-day operations it had mounted.
The LÉ Niamh has now rescued almost 2,000 migrants since it was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in mid-July.
Its sister ship, the LÉ Eithne, brought more than 3,376 migrants to safety during its seven-week deployment in the area earlier this year.
