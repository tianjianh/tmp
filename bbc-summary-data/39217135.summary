A black Vauxhall Corsa and a blue Toyota truck were involved in the collision on the A947 just north of Fyvie at about 07:20.
The 17-year-old driver of the Corsa was airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary while the 27-year-old Toyota driver was taken to the same hospital by road.
Police Scotland want to trace witnesses including the driver of a blue BMW who was travelling southwards.
Sgt Rob Warnock, from the Inverurie Road Policing Unit, said: "Enquiries into the circumstances of the incident are at an early stage and I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident or saw either the black Vauxhall Corsa or blue Toyota Hilux crew cab prior to the incident to contact police.
"In particular we would like to speak to the driver of a blue BMW vehicle which had been travelling southwards at the time of the collision. This vehicle was seen overtaking just prior to Fyvie.
"The occupant may have information which could help the investigation and I would appeal for them or anyone who saw this vehicle to contact us."
