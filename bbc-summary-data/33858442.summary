[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thai King Bhumibol recovering from 'water on brain'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thailand's revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been treated for hydrocephalus, or an excessive build-up of fluid on the brain, and is now recovering, say authorities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 87-year-old, who has been in hospital since 31 May, also had a lung inflammation which has since subsided.
The monarch has had frequent bouts of ill health in recent years.
He is seen as a pillar of stability in Thailand which saw political strife culminating in last year's coup.
Though the king has no formal political role, he is seen by Thais as a symbol of unity, having ruled since 1946, and his health is closely watched.
Last October he had his gallbladder removed. He was in Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital for seven months, and was discharged in May this year, only to return to the hospital a few weeks later for medical tests.
