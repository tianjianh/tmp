Forensic tests are continuing on a burnt-out Audi Q5 found in the north of Glasgow following the murder of Euan Johnston.
It was taken from Parklands Country Club, Newton Mearns, in May and had fake registration plates fitted.
Police revealed the details as they revisited the murder scene one week on, in a bid to generate fresh leads.
Mr Johnston, 26, was at the wheel of a black Audi RS4 estate when he was hit by shots fired from the Audi Q5 at 23:45 last Tuesday.
He and a friend had earlier been eating in the Red Pepper Indian restaurant and were returning home when the attack happened. The other man, who is aged 29, was not injured.
Police returned to Shields Road, near Scotland Street, on Tuesday night to question drivers and pedestrians.
Det Supt Jim Kerr, who is the senior investigating officer, said no weapons have yet been recovered in connection with the murder.
He said: "We know that the dark blue Audi Q5 was involved and we know that car was stolen on May 16 from Parklands Country Club and was using false plates.
"The car was going at a fairly erratic speed and we are keen to speak to anyone who maybe has dashcam footage of it.
"We are also keen to speak to anybody that has seen the car parked in streets or industrial estates nearby."
Detectives also want to establish the identity of three men seen in Bracken Street, close to where the burnt-out car was found in the Possil area of the city.
"We are now one week into this inquiry and this operation is about speaking to motorists who perhaps use these routes on a regular basis." Mr Kerr said.
"This was a targeted attack, however it was undoubtedly a very shocking incident and we are continuing significant inquiries to trace who is responsible."
The detective said extra uniform patrols would be in the area "to provide public reassurance" and urged "anyone with concerns to speak to officers".
Last week, he revealed that Mr Johnston, who was from the Maryhill area of Glasgow, was "known to police" but he did not give details.
