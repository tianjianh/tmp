World number eight Tomas Berdych has pulled out of next month's Olympic Games in Rio because of concerns about the Zika virus.

Berdych, 30, lost in the Wimbledon semi-final to eventual winner Andy Murray earlier this month.
"It was a hard decision for me to take after a long and painstaking discussion with my dearest," said Berdych.
The Czech is the third tennis player after Simona Halep and Milos Raonic to withdraw from the Olympics.
More than 20 male players have withdrawn from the golf competition at Rio 2016, with many concerned about the mosquito-borne virus Zika, which is linked to brain deformities in newborn babies.
Berdych said on Twitter: "It is purely my personal decision but I still feel a need to give at least one of the serious reasons leading to this step to my supporters and fans.
"It is because of the Zika virus spread in the country of the Olympics. As I have founded a family recently, to limit health risks towards my nearest is the utmost priority.
"I apologise to all of you who are disappointed by my decision. I do believe that if you take a deeper account of my reasons you will understand that I have done it out of the responsibility for my family."
The United States' John Isner has pulled out to focus on his preparations for tour events, while Nick Kyrgios will not be involved because of a dispute with the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC).
