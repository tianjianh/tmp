Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal expects defender Luke Shaw to be out of action for at least six months after breaking his leg.

Shaw, 20, broke his right leg in two places in the Champions League defeat by PSV Eindhoven on 15 September and returned home four days later.
"He will be out at least six months. You can't predict the development of the rehabilitation," Van Gaal said.
"There is always more - and then he has to get fit."
If Shaw were available again in March, it would give him time to get fit for England's Euro 2016 campaign, which starts in June.
The full-back will use electro muscle stimulation to retain strength in his leg as it recovers.
"It is not easy and Luke knows he has a long way to go but the most important thing is he is mentally very strong," added Van Gaal.
