The blaze at the single-storey house in Cumbernauld's Craigelvan Gardens was reported in a 999 call at 11:20.
Fire crews arrived and were met with "a well-developed fire" and the house suffered "a partial collapse".
Police said the 63-year-old man was treated at the scene by paramedics. An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: "Police can confirm that an 88-year-old woman has died in a fire at Craigelvan Gardens in Cumbernauld and a 63-year-old man was also treated at the scene by paramedics.
"An investigation is under way to establish the exact cause of the fire."
A spokesman for the fire service said: "Teams in breathing apparatus entered the property to search for anyone inside and sadly they located a woman who had died.
"Firefighting operations were conducted both inside and outside the house and the fire was brought under control, however due to a partial structural collapse it is likely to be some time before crews can confirm it has been fully extinguished."
