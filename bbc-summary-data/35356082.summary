[SN]TITLE[SN]
US Supreme Court to consider Obama's migrant deportation plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US Supreme Court has said it will consider a challenge to one of President Barack Obama's key immigration reform plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plan would lift the threat of deportation from five million migrants living illegally in the US.
A coalition of 26 mostly conservative states, led by Texas, has been successful in lower court challenges.
A decision from the highest US court is expected in the early summer, just as the US election gets into full swing.
President Obama announced the plan, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), in November 2014.
He justified using his presidential powers, without Congress, by saying it was in response to inaction over the issue of immigration from Congress.
If allowed to go forward, it would allow people who have lived in the US for more than five years and who have children who are living in the country legally to apply for work authorisation.
Challenges to the plan began shortly after Mr Obama's announcement, with a federal court in Texas effectively putting a pause on it in February.
The Obama administration lost an appeal in November, keeping the injunction in place.
The White House has vowed to kickstart the programme if the Supreme Court was to rule in its favour, so that migrants could began enrolling before a new president takes office in January 2017.
