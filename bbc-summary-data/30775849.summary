Wiltshire Council's plans for Melksham are part of an Â£80m regeneration of 18 market towns across the county.
Councillor Jonathan Seed said: "We're looking at spending Â£800,000 [in Melksham] on revamping the road access and the roundabout to the campus."
An exhibition and public consultation has opened in the town.
The new campus would also have a bowling green, gym, tennis courts and is expected to be in use by 2017.
Melksham was granted a charter in 1219 to hold a market every Friday and on Michaelmas Day.
There has been a market held in the town on and off for 800 years. At the moment there is a weekly Tuesday market.
Enough space will be left for the market to continue, the council has said.
Council buildings across the county will be sold off to finance the plans. Nine buildings in Melksham will be disposed of.
The new campus will be based at the Melksham House and Blue Pool site in the town centre.
