[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Poet Simon Armitage has spoken of his pride at being awarded an honorary degree by the University of Leeds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Armitage, who previously lectured in creative writing at the university, was made an honorary doctor of letters.
He said: "This is a special day and it is an honour to join all the students graduating. I'm proud to be awarded this honorary degree."
He is one of 10 people to be honoured including boxer Nicola Adams and Leeds carnival organiser Arthur France.
In June Armitage was appointed Professor of Poetry at Oxford University.
Sir Alan Langlands, Vice-Chancellor of the University, described the 10 recipients of honorary degrees as "truly inspirational people", saying: "They are excellent role models for the 5,700 students who are graduating from the university this year, all ready to take their place in the world and to make a difference."
Adams, from Leeds, claimed the first ever women's Olympic boxing gold medal at the London Olympic games in 2012 and last month won flyweight gold at the European Games in Baku.
Mr France founded the Leeds West Indian Carnival, now in its 48th year, in 1967 as a cure for homesickness after leaving St Kitts and Nevis, in the Caribbean.
