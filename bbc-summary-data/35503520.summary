An album made by a Scottish Christian rock band is being re-released more than 40 years after it was recorded in a garage in Paisley.

It comes after copies of the original recording of White Light's Parable started changing hands for up to Â£650.
After their 1970s heyday, the band's members became a Church of Scotland minister, a computer programmer, a property valuer and a mortgage advisor.
Now all of pensionable age, the group are enjoying their new-found fame.
The Reverend Doug McRoberts, who played lead guitar on the 1974 record, said he was approached about re-releasing the album after retiring as a minister in Malta.
"It was a huge surprise. We never thought this would happen," he said.
"Who would think that one of the first things to happen after we retire is for our music to be re-issued?"
Mr McRoberts formed the band in the 1970s with his brother, Dave, a bass player, drummer Alex Smith and keyboardist David Murdoch.
They toured venues across Scotland and released just 2,000 copies of the Parable LP on the Scotia Records label.
Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, Mr McRoberts admitted: "A limited number were made; even less were sold."
He believes there are "just a few hundred" original copies in circulation.
The retired minister discovered the album had become a collectors item when he was contacted by a friend who had found it selling for "silly money" online.
Now it has been reissued by Guerssen record label - and it could lead to a reunion of the band in the future
They briefly reformed to perform at KeithChaosLive, a charity rock festival headlined by The Bluetones, in 2005.
Mr McRoberts, who now lives in Inverness, said: "It wasn't exactly the Scottish equivalent of Status Quo launching Live Aid and it was weird to be rocking onstage with a couple of our children who are now in their own bands in the audience - but it was great to play with the guys again."
"We all enjoyed coming together for that gig in Keith," he added. "If the occasion was right, we'd probably be up for it."
