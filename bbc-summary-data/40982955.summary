Fast-food company McDonald's could face its first staff strike in the UK, after workers at two stores backed a call for industrial action.

Employees at McDonald's restaurants in Cambridge and Crayford, near London, voted overwhelmingly for a strike.
The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) said staff wanted secure working hours and a Â£10 per hour wage.
A spokesman for McDonald's said the fast-food company "works hard to ensure teams are treated fairly".
"We can confirm that, following a ballot process, the BFAWU have indicated that a small number of our employees representing less than 0.01% of our workforce are intending to strike in two of our restaurants.
"As per the terms of the ballot, the dispute is solely related to our internal grievance procedures."
Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow secretary for business, environment and industrial strategy, said: "The strike at McDonald's is motivated by working people coming together to fight for decent pay and working conditions."
The company announced in April that staff would be offered a choice of flexible or fixed contracts with minimum guaranteed hours.
McDonald's employs around 85,000 staff in the UK and one million worldwide.
