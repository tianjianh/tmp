The search for three people feared dead at Didcot Power Station is continuing amid fears of further collapses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Part of the power station collapsed at 16:00 GMT on Tuesday as it was being prepared for demolition.
The body of Michael Collings, 53, has been found while three people still unaccounted for are "unlikely to be alive", rescuers said.
The partially collapsed building remains unstable and further collapses are possible, the fire service said.
Residents have been urged to keep windows and doors shut in case of dust.
The fire service said its priority was "to return the missing people to their families".
It also said one option being discussed was the demolition of the rest of the building so search teams can safely access the rubble.
Deputy chief fire officer Nathan Travis said: "The site remains extremely unstable and so the safety of the teams working on site has to be our first consideration."
A post-mortem examination showed Mr Collings died from multiple injuries.
