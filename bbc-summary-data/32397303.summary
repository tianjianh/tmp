[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The away side were 43-4 when the impressive Tom Taylor (6-61) trapped Alviro Petersen lbw, but Ashwell Prince (97) and Steven Croft (70) put on 160.
Lancashire were 264 ahead when their ninth wicket fell, but Davies (89) and Jarvis (17 not out) added valuable runs to leave a far tougher target of 365.
Derbyshire then lost both openers cheaply to end the day on 27-2.
Wicketkeeper Davies struck nine fours and five sixes to reach his highest first-class score as he dominated the partnership with Jarvis.
Peter Siddle and Tom Bailey then took the wickets of openers Ben Slater and Billy Godleman with Derbyshire needing to make the highest score of the match to win.
Lancashire's Alex Davies: "A lead of 250, 260 is quite slender going into a full day tomorrow so we knew we had to hang around and help the team get into a good position.
"Those extra runs will give us a bit more scoreboard pressure. The pitch is still doing a bit laterally and will start to go up and down as well which will help us.
"I think the weather is set fair and if we bowl anything like (we can), we should be able to knock them over."
Derbyshire's Tom Taylor: "I think it's definitely possible (for Derbyshire to win), it's just how many big partnerships we can get and we've got to chip in.
"The ball has swung and it will swing again in the morning so it would be a great win but we fancy ourselves to try and get them tomorrow."
