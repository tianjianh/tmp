Ollie Norburn's controversial equaliser saw Guiseley come from a goal down to draw with play-off chasing Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder netted with a 30-yard strike, but Danny Cowley's visitors felt the hosts should have returned possession after an injury.
A five-minute dispute followed, with security staff needed to separate the players and management of both sides, but the goal was allowed to stand.
Earlier, Michael Cheek put the Iron in front, slotting in a Kenny Davis pass.
