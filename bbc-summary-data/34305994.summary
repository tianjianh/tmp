Lib Dem leader Tim Farron makes 'land grab' for Labour voters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Lib Dems will make what they call an "unashamed land grab" for Labour voters at their conference later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party wants to frame itself as a "credible" opposition to the Tories, targeting Labour voters after Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader.
Leader Tim Farron will stress the party's pro-business credentials, proposing an allowance for new firms.
But Baroness Williams said her party should instead formally co-operate with Labour on some issues, such as the NHS.
The Lib Dems are aiming to stress the party's pro-business credentials at its annual conference, which is being held in Bournemouth.
Mr Farron will announce the party's new policy of a Start Up Allowance for new business owners of Â£100 per week for the first 26 weeks - to be paid for by reversing cuts to corporation tax announced by George Osborne in the Budget.
Those who create businesses should be "celebrated and supported", Mr Farron said.
"Liberal Democrats believe that if you have a dream you should be supported to fulfil it," he added.
Mr Farron, who was elected Lib Dem leader in July, is going all out to attract disaffected Labour voters and claims his party is now "more relevant than anyone would have predicted."
Speaking on the Andrew Marr show , he said the Lib Dems, which was reduced to eight MPs at the last general election, now provided the only "credible opposition" to the Conservatives.
"You can't defend the NHS and have decent schools and police services if your economy isn't growing properly. That's a position which Jeremy Corbyn and co have chosen to vacate," said Mr Farron.
In response to reports that the former Liberal Democrat MP, Baroness Tonge, had indicated she might join Labour, Mr Farron pointed out that she sat as an independent in the House of Lords.
"She's not ours to start off with," he said.
Baroness Tonge, a former Lib Dem MP who sits as an independent in the Lords, told The Sunday Times that Mr Corbyn offered an "honest" brand of politics and she agreed with his stance on nuclear disarmament and the Middle East.
Mr Farron refused to confirm how many Labour MPs he had spoken to about possible defections, but said it was "more than two".
He has not ruled out working with Mr Corbyn after the 2020 general election to keep the Conservatives out of power.
Baroness Williams told Radio 4's World this Weekend there was now a large space in the middle of British politics for the Lib Dems to work with Mr Corbyn's Labour party.
Tribalism was "the rotting corruption of British politics", she said, suggesting the two parties could find agreement on issues such as housing, the NHS, prisons, and the Human Rights Act.
The party should "sit down and talk to Labour spokesmen or women about certain issues and consider with them how we could co-operate".
"For example putting down amendments in the name of both parties, having speakers from both parties, above all campaigning to change certain things that need changing," she added.
But Sir Vince Cable said working with Labour would be "inconceivable" because Mr Corbyn's economic policies made "absolutely no sense and have no credibility at all".
The former business secretary, who lost his seat in May, told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics the Lib Dems "could get Labour people joining us".
But he said it would not happen straight away and it was more likely that his party would collaborate with "moderate" Labour MPs.
He did not rule out the eventual formation of a new party in the centre ground, saying it was "conceivable... that that is where you could end up".
On Saturday evening, Mr Farron told a packed hall of supporters at the start of the party' conference: "This is our moment."
He said Labour had "left the playing field" and it was up to the Lib Dems to fill the gap and take on the Tories.
The theme of the conference, summed up in a Twitter hashtag, is #LibDemFightback.
The party claims it has attracted record numbers of activists to its annual conference, including many of the 20,000 people who have joined since the election.
