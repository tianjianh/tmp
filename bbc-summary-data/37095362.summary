Rail services in South Lanarkshire have been delayed after a bus broke down at a level crossing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
British Transport Police (BTP) said they were alerted to the incident, at Cleghorn crossing, on Stanmore Road, north west of Lanark, at about 14:53.
ScotRail later said the bus had since been removed and services were returning to normal.
There are no further details at present on the bus or whether it was carrying passengers at the time.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said: "We apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused by this disruption, which was a result of a bus breaking down on a level crossing near Carluke."
