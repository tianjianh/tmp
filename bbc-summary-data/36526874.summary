The Neolithic whalebone figurine - which can be viewed online in 3D - was originally found at Skara Brae.
Dr David Clarke rediscovered it in the collections of Stromness Museum while undertaking research.
He said: "Amazingly, we found it in the last box of the day. I've always thought this figurine to be lost forever."
Dr Clarke added: "Seeing it staring back at me from its bed of tissue paper was completely unexpected and very exciting."
'Jewel in collection'
Kathleen Ireland, chair of Stromness Museum said: "Stromness Museum has a superb collection of artefacts from Skara Brae, but this figurine has instantly become the new jewel in our collections.
"We are always pleased to welcome researchers and this rediscovery highlights what can found through painstaking research in museum stores."
The figurine measures 9.5cm high by 7.5cm wide.
It is nicknamed Skara Brae Buddo.
Skara Brae is a stone-built late Neolithic settlement on the Bay of Skaill.
