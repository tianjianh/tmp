A road in Londonderry is still partially blocked due to a bonfire being set up overnight.

The bonfire, which is about 20ft (6m) high, has been built near the bottom of the Lecky Road flyover in the city.
Both Sinn FeÃ­n and DUP election posters were placed on it on Monday evening.
Police have advised motorists to consider alternative routes to the Bogside, other than the Lecky or Brandywell Roads.
Bonfires are traditionally set alight on 15 August in some nationalist areas of Derry to mark the Assumption.
The Catholic feast commemorates the Virgin Mary's death and assumption into heaven.
In recent years, efforts have been made to replace the bonfire tradition with family fun days and live music.
On Friday, police supervised the removal of bonfire material from Meenan Square.
Sinn FeÃ­n councillor Patricia Logue said the majority of Bogside residents were not in favour of the bonfire.
"This will cause a lot of disruption for local people and motorists, it's not the best place for this bonfire," she said.
"Someone could get hurt. Obviously, parents have a role to play in any young person's life, so they do have a judgement call to make.
"There's more work to be done, but there is excellent work ongoing by the community leaders in the Bogside and Brandywell area."
