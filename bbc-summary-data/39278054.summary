The 25-year-old will join up with the county for the duration of the T20 Blast in July and August.
Henry has played six T20 and 30 one-day internationals for the Black Caps and also played for Worcestershire in 2016.
"He came highly recommended as a fast bowler and also someone with a high strike-rate with the bat," said director of cricket Kim Barnett.
"Matt has plenty of experience around the world, internationally and here in England with Worcestershire last season. He knows our conditions well and we look forward to him joining us."
