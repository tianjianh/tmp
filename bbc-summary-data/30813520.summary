Four housing developers have expressed an interest in buying one of Swansea's main council buildings.

Swansea Council put its 14-acre Penllergaer offices on the market last November to help tackle its Â£26m budget deficit.
Council leaders said the level of interest has been "very encouraging".
The council is also expected to put its landmark seafront civic centre building up for sale soon.
A final decision on the future of this and a number of other council properties is due to be taken by councillors next week.
Staff have gradually been moved out of the Penllergaer offices, which used to be the headquarters for the old Lliw Valley Borough Council.
Around 100 housing and transport staff still remain but they are set to be relocated during the year.
Councillor Robert Francis-Davies, cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration, said: "This shows we're determined to do our bit to help make inroads into our considerable savings target and protect as many services as possible for residents across the city."
The agents say there has been "promising" interest and there is demand for homes in the Penllergaer area.
