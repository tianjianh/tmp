The police community support officer (PCSO) was driving with his wife when he saw the two-year-old in Shobnall Road, Burton-upon-Trent, police said.
The girl told him she could not wake her mother, Nicolla Rushton, and led him to her inside their home.
The 30-year-old's death is not being treated as suspicious.
The officer, who is not being named, stayed with the girl until the emergency services arrived.
Ch Insp Steve Maskrey, from Staffordshire Police, praised the officer and the community for helping police following the discovery on 6 January.
"This is a brilliant piece of work by him that shows that we are never off-duty," he said.
"The officer and his wife took the time to look after the little girl and stay with her until emergency services arrived. Sadly, nothing could be done to help the woman.
"My thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased at this difficult time."
The girl is now being cared for by family.
An inquest into Ms Rushton's death is expected to take place in due course.
