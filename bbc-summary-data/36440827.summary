The 31-year-old cancelled out Eva de Goede's penalty with three minutes left to clinch the two-match series 1-0.
Great Britain had beaten the Dutch 2-1 in Tuesday's opener.
"We can come away feeling very positive and know that we still have good growth to come," said head coach Danny Kerr.
"I'm very proud of how the girls have been on the front foot in both matches despite it being an anxious time around selection for the Champions Trophy and the Olympics."
Great Britain, the Netherlands, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and United States will compete for the Champions Trophy, which gets under way in London on 18 June.
The Olympics in Rio, Brazil, begin on 5 August.
