The wife of a passenger on flight MH370 has called on the Malaysian authorities to "put more effort" into finding out why the plane disappeared.

Mingfei Ma married Yuchen Li a few weeks before he boarded the airliner.
He had just received his engineering doctorate from Cambridge University, where she is still a student.
His widow said the discovery of debris believed to be from the Malaysian Airways plane had not brought families any closer to knowing what happened.
She told BBC Look East: "I strongly disagree with the Malaysian authorities who said the discovery of debris is 'closure' for the families.
"It's not even the beginning of closure - it is just the beginning."
The aircraft, which had 239 people onboard, was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 when air traffic control staff lost contact.
For more than a year Dr Li's widow continued to hope the man she married in February 2014 was still alive, but on 29 July airliner debris was found washed up on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion.
The Malaysian authorities believe it is from the missing aeroplane, but French experts examining the finds have stopped short of confirming the link.
Dr Li's wife, who returned to Churchill College in Cambridge in October to continue her doctorate in architecture, said: "It's not only about finding the plane, it's about why it was there.
"I do want to find a reason for the crash and the authorities need to put more effort into the investigation."
She paid tribute to her "amazing" husband, who received his engineering doctorate from Churchill College in January 2014.
Dr Li was flying to Beijing to begin a new job and to support his wife's family, with the intention that she would join him in China following her graduation.
She said she was "so grateful" but she would "always regret" the decision.
