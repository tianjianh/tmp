BBC Sport has learned that the Magpies are the favourites to sign the 18-year-old, who has 12 goals this season.
But Robinson expects the England Under-19 international to return to Stadium MK on loan if a deal is completed.
"I can't see him not wearing our shirt for the rest of the season," Robinson told BBC Three Counties Radio.
"Part of the deal would be him staying with us for the rest of the season and joining whoever it is in the summer.
"There's no deal completely confirmed yet."
Newcastle arranged similar deals for Nottingham Forest pair Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles last summer, by loaning them back to the Championship club for the season.
Alli, who has also been watched by Liverpool and Bayern Munich, made his MK debut as a 16-year-old in November 2012, and marked his second appearance by scoring against Cambridge City in an FA Cup tie.
He has gone on to play 75 times for the League One side, scoring 20 goals, and signed a contract until 2017 in September.
"If we were talking about an 18-year-old striker with 12 goals, you'd be talking about millions, and this is a midfielder," said Robinson, who shares the same agent as Alli.
"We know there has been communications with clubs. We hope we can do right by Dele and the club as well."
