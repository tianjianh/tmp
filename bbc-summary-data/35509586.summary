"I thought we started the game really well - all parts of our game came together today.
"I thought we defended brilliantly, we moved the ball really well, and we did exactly what we worked on in training during the week.
"The two outstanding saves that Dan Bentley pulled off in the first half just indicated why clubs want to pay whatever they want to pay for him."
