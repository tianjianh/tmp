He said he was "uncomfortable" with Leave supporters conjuring up "millions of Turks coming here" and with the Remain side inventing "a nightmare of things being cut".
He was speaking during an EU debate, filmed in Bradford and aired on Sunday.
The panel included Labour MP Caroline Flint for Remain and Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns for Leave.
Following the prime minister warning Brexit could cause a "black hole" in the public finances, Mr Parris said: "All David Cameron can say is that if our economy takes a big knock, then nothing is secure."
The debate tackled topics including agriculture, immigration and the economy.
Ms Flint, Don Valley MP, said: "If we get the economic shock of coming out of the EU, then governments are going to have to make some tough choices about how they pay for pensions in the future as well as other parts of the economy if we go back into recession."
Ms Jenkyns, MP for Morley and Outwood, argued: "We wouldn't have had to have such strong austerity measures if we weren't sending so much money over to the EU, so we can invest the money ourselves into our own country."
