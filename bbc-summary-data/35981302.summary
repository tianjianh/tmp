It has emerged Infantino co-signed a television rights contract in 2006 with two businessmen who have since been accused of bribery.
Infantino has denied any wrongdoing.
Uefa says it is providing police with all relevant documents in its possession and "will co-operate fully".
Cross Trading, owned by Hugo Jinkis and his son, Mariano, bought TV rights for Uefa Champions League football in 2006 and immediately sold them on to Ecuadorian TV broadcaster Teleamazonas for almost three times the price.
News of the contract came to light after 11 million documents were leaked from Mossack Fonseca.
Uefa initially denied doing business with any of the 14 people who have been indicted by the FBI in its investigation into corruption in world football.
It has now told the BBC the TV rights were sold to the highest bidder in an open and competitive tender process.
A senior Fifa source has told the BBC the deal should be examined by the governing body's ethics committee in the interests of transparency.
