The Australian newspaper reported fresh rumours that US private equity giant KKR had a bid that could be "almost ready" for consideration.
It would be one of the biggest deal in Australia's corporate history, the newspaper said.
The news comes amid turbulent times for the supermarket chain.
Woolworths' media team made no comment in relation to the takeover rumours, while KKR's media team in Australia was unavailable for comment.
Earlier this month, Woolworths announced that its chief executive, Grant O'Brien, was stepping down after nearly four years.
The firm also said it had plans to cut about 1,200 jobs. The changes are aimed at cutting millions of dollars in costs and improving sales after Woolworths' first-half profits fell.
The retail giant has been up against rivals such as Coles and Aldi and it has been trying to win more customers with improved stores and competitive pricing.
Woolworths recently cut its profit guidance for the year to June 2015.
