The Portadown driver retired from race one in his BMW after clashing with Matt Neal as the cars left the grid.
In race two, Turkington carved his way through the field to climb from 32nd to 10th by the chequered flag.
Turkington continued to make progress in race three, starting ninth and moving up the order to finish second.
He barely made it off the line in race one, being eliminated when Neal's Honda clattered into Turkington before reaching turn one.
In race two, Turkington moved his way up the order to 10th, before being promoted to ninth after Rob Austin was excluded for overtaking under yellow flags.
Turkington just lost out to team-mate Andrew Jordan on the final lap in race three after another charging drive.
Carrickfergus man Chris Smiley had a luckless weekend on his return to the championship.
Smiley, 24, missed out on setting a quick time in qualifying as rain spoiled his fastest lap, before a technical issue dropped Smiley out of race two when he was running in the points.
Turkington lies seventh in the championship after the opening round, 22 points behind early leader Gordon Shedden.
Belfast driver Charlie Eastwood picked up two podiums in the BTCC supporting Porsche Carrera Cup, while Daniel Harper grabbed a podium in race two of the Ginetta Junior series.
In Formula E, Portadown's Adam Carroll picked up his first Formula E points as he brought his Jaguar home eighth with an impressive drive in the Mexico City ePrix.
