The 31-year-old Olympian says he "can't believe" his progress, having taken his first steps on Wednesday.
In an Instagram post, Ellington said he was expected to be "in a wheelchair for at least six weeks" before he attempted walking.
Fellow sprinter Nigel Levine, 27, was also involved in the head-on collision.
Any pelvic injuries to sprinters are potentially career-threatening and both athletes will need significant rehabilitation.
