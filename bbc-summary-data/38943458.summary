Mr Nuttall, who is standing in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election, registered the house in the city as his address on nomination papers.
The Labour Party previously claimed Mr Nuttall was deceiving voters by not living there but he was then pictured sleeping at the terrace house.
Police said they were aware of isolated incidents during the "last week or so".
UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said a series of incidents since the address was published on social media had led to the decision and the returning officer had been informed.
Mr Oakden said the most serious of the offences were two unknown men trying to get into the back of the house.
"There has also been hate mail posted through the letterbox and other intrusive behaviours including trespassing in the private garden of the premises and attempts to take pictures through windows and the letterbox," he said.
A Staffordshire Police spokesman said he had no specifics about the incidents but added they were mainly based around "alternative views" being exchanged between groups of people.
He said police were satisfied there was no cause for concern in terms of anyone's health, wellbeing or safeguarding.
However, UKIP disputed this saying police had taken it seriously enough to put on extra patrols around the house.
Last week, Labour claimed Mr Nuttall's use of an apparently empty house as his address raised serious questions about his fitness for public office and police were investigating whether he had broken election law.
UKIP says all electoral laws have been complied with .
The Parliamentary by-election was triggered by the resignation of Labour MP Tristram Hunt. It will be held on 23 February.
