Allotments tended by generations of Gloucestershire gardeners have closed despite a year-long campaign.

"Save Coombe Allotments" campaigners say the site, near Wotton-under-Edge, was there in 1847 with some evidence suggesting it dates back to 1763.
But the half-acre plot is privately owned and the landowner says she is within her rights to seek possession.
Campaigners say there is still hope they might be able to buy it to preserve it for the community.
There have been reports that the landowner has been approached by a developer.
Susan Ballinger, who has not responded to requests for a comment from the BBC, has previously said she requires the land back for grazing her horses.
She served allotments holders with a "notice to quit" by 25 March 2016, 12 months ago - prompting a social media campaign to save the allotments.
Villagers in Coombe have had the site registered as a "community asset", which gives them a shot at buying it, if it goes up for sale.
"The site has such a history, we want to keep it as a community area," said campaign manager Martin Clarke.
But he told BBC Radio Gloucestershire that while it was a day of "optimism and hope", whether they would be able to buy it would depend on whether there was a "realistic valuation".
Allotment owners held a party on Friday to "go out with our heads held high".
Ms Ballinger previously told BBC Inside Out West she was within her rights to seek possession of her own land and had given plenty of notice.
