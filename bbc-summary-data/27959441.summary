Kent PCC Ann Barnes 'fails to impress' says Prime Minister

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ann Barnes has failed to impress in her role as Kent's Police and Crime Commissioner, David Cameron has said.

The Prime Minister told BBC Radio Kent that he "wasn't particularly happy" about what he had heard about her.
"I don't think she's making a very good fist of her job... the people of Kent elected her, they can un-elect her at the next available opportunity."
The BBC has been unable to contact Mrs Barnes for her reaction to his comments, as she is away on holiday.
Mr Cameron's remarks follow a Channel 4 documentary last month, in which Mrs Barnes admitted she should not have taken part.
The "fly-on-the-wall" TV programme Meet the Police Commissioner, saw Mrs Barnes talk about her Â£85,000-a-year role.
At points in the broadcast, she struggled to explain an approach to policing priorities called "the onion", brought her dogs into the office and failed to write her title correctly on a whiteboard.
Mrs Barnes was also criticised last year after she appointed teenager Paris Brown as Kent's first youth commissioner.
Ms Brown later resigned over comments she had posted on Twitter.
However, earlier this month, within days of the Channel 4 programme, it was claimed Ms Brown's replacement had been involved in a relationship with 50-year-old former county councillor and youth leader Robert Burgess.
Kerry Boyd, 20, has since not undertaken any public engagements.
The BBC has also learned that Mrs Barnes will still be on holiday when a new policing model for Kent is introduced on Tuesday.
When asked about this, the Prime Minister said that while she was responsible for her own movements, "that doesn't sound particularly impressive".
"As I've said, I don't think she has impressed in this role," Mr Cameron added.
