[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ruabon 'eyesore' houses demolished after legal battle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derelict houses that were built in a Wrexham town but never used will be demolished after a long legal battle over their ownership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The three properties, off High Street in Ruabon, were left as empty "eyesores" with the developer now in liquidation.
They became magnets for anti-social behaviour but the Crown took ownership and will hand them to Wrexham council.
Wales and West Housing Association will demolish them and build social housing.
The Welsh Government provided financial support to help community councillors and campaigners resolve the situation over the properties, built in 2000.
Clwyd South AM Ken Skates said: "Irresponsible developers left this community with an eyesore which many thought they'd be stuck with forever."
