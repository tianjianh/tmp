The visitors took the lead through Cody McDonald's clever dinked finish following a great ball from Doug Loft.
Bradley Dack then doubled the Gills' lead from the penalty spot before Kieron Morris's 25-yard drive and Milan Lalkovic's tap-in levelled proceedings.
Jason Demetriou's smashed effort in injury time completed the comeback win for the Saddlers.
The result means Gillingham's six-game unbeaten run in the league is over and they drop to third in the table whilst Walsall move up to first having won for the ninth time this season.
Walsall manager Dean Smith told BBC WM:

"Yes, it was a lot of fun, it wasn't fun after 25 minutes when they went 2-0 up!
"I thought it was a really entertaining game, a great game of football for League One, two good teams trying to get the win.
"I was disappointed with the goals we conceded, because we made a couple of mistakes there which we don't normally do.
"But the character the players have shown to come back from that and get the result is fantastic for them."
