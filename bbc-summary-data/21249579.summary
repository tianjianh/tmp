Up Helly Aa fire festival is the biggest event in Shetland's long dark winter.
The highlight will see members of the Jarl Squad, dressed as Vikings, parade through the streets of Lerwick before burning their replica Viking longship.
The annual festival celebrates the Shetland Islands' Viking heritage.
