Mobile phone footage shows a man in a wig and tights being verbally abused by a male passenger.
A BTP spokesman said they were making enquiries to establish what happened.
"This is completely unacceptable behaviour and we are asking anyone who recognises the man involved to contact British Transport Police," he added.
The man whose footage has been passed to police said on Facebook he had been out celebrating new year but "on the way home I witnessed [someone] shouting abuse at a drag queen on the Tube.
"I then made the heinous crime of sticking up for her and this video shows what happened."
