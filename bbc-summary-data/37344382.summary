Edinburgh University's wrought iron gate entranceway to McEwan Hall will be returned to the campus after a "show of affection" by former students.

Principal Sir Timothy O'Shea has pledged to bring back the 19th Century gates, which stood next to the university's graduation venue.
The entrance was removed as part of a Â£33m redevelopment and were due to be sold off at auction.
But the university said a deal had now been struck with Summer Place Auctions.
The gates were a traditional backdrop for graduation photos.
Proposals to refurbish McEwan Hall and transform neighbouring Bristo Square had an "open plan approach" which encouraged movement around the site.
The gates did not feature in the design and an agreement was reached with the university's contractor to have them removed.
Professor O'Shea said: "On hearing news of the proposed auction, Edinburgh graduates far and wide contacted the university to express their fondness for the gates.
"The views of our alumni are very important to us so we are happy to bring the gates back."
Summers Place Auctions director James Rylands said: "We are delighted to be able to work with the university to facilitate the return of the McEwan Hall entranceway to Edinburgh where we hope it will be admired by residents and visitors for many generations to come."
