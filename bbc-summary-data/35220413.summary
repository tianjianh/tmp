Jeremy Corbyn 'starts Labour reshuffle talks'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn is starting talks with shadow cabinet members as part of a reshuffle, a Labour source has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The intention is for the new line-up to be announced on Tuesday, although the process could take several days.
Mr Corbyn is reportedly considering replacing some shadow ministers who disagree with his policies.
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she did not expect a "very dramatic purge" of Mr Corbyn's top team in the next 24 hours.
It would be "more a shuffle than lots of moderates being shoved out", she said, although new shadow foreign and defence secretaries are expected to be appointed.
The current shadow cabinet is divided on issues including Trident renewal and military intervention in Syria.
Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn backed air strikes in last month's Commons vote, but Mr Corbyn opposed them.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who is co-chairing the party's defence review, said it "might very well be the case" that Mr Benn could be moved to a portfolio where he agrees with Mr Corbyn - although he said he had no knowledge of the leader's intentions.
He said it was a problem if, as happened in the Syria debate, Labour's frontbench spokesman stood up and made a speech opposing the stance of the party leader.
Don't forget, Jeremy Corbyn built his own career by being a serial rebel, voting against his party leader again and again and again.
For him to call for message discipline from the outset might have seemed ludicrous. And given the lack of support he had among Labour MPs, he was determined to try to build a team from all parts of the party to give him credibility in Westminster.
So now, just four months on, if he embarks on dramatic changes, sacks those who have publicly disagreed with him, like the shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, there's a danger it looks like when his own authority is challenged he just can't take it.

Shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour Mr Corbyn's "whole  career" was based on disagreeing with party leaders, and warned him against carrying out a reshuffle "as a punishment for shadow minister who disagree with him".
"He has talked of an open, pluralist kind of politics but a reshuffle for that reason could end looking more petty and divisive than open and pluralist politics," he added.
But speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Labour MP and Corbyn ally Clive Lewis said reshuffles were a "perk" of being leader.
He added: "It's his prerogative as leader to be able to manage and shape the shadow cabinet - it's one of the benefits and perks of being a leader to be able to shape the shadow cabinet without it being seen as revenge."
Mr Lewis said it was "speculation" to say he could replace Maria Eagle - who does not share Mr Corbyn's opposition to renewing the UK's nuclear weapons - as shadow defence secretary.
He said he would only do the job if Mr Corbyn said it was "essential" he take it, but said he thought this unlikely.
Another of Mr Corbyn's allies at Westminster, shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott, told BBC Radio London's Vanessa Feltz rumours she could replace Mr Benn as shadow foreign secretary were "poppycock and piffle".
Ms Abbott said she did not know whether there would be a reshuffle, but added that if Mr Corbyn were to change his top team it would continue to be inclusive and "would reflect his considered thoughts about the importance of having a team at the top which reflects the views of the party".
Another shadow minister, housing spokesman John Healey, said it was important to have a range of views at the top of the party, adding: "I would be very surprised if we see the sort of scale of reshuffle that some have speculated on so far."
