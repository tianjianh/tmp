[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gail Purcell crowdfunded cycle death case: Not guilty plea entered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has denied causing the death of a cyclist after appearing in court following a crowdfunded campaign for a private prosecution.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gail Purcell is charged with causing death by careless driving following a collision with Michael Mason, 70, on Regents Street, London, in 2014.
The 58-year-old from St Albans, Herts, pleaded not guilty at the Old Bailey.
The Cyclists' Defence Fund raised Â£60,000 from 1,500 donations to pursue the action.
Mr Mason died 19 days after the collision having never regained consciousness from his injuries.
Police had declined to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
Private prosecutions can be brought by any individual or organisation and proceed in exactly the same way as those brought by the CPS.
Before proceeding with a prosecution, the CPS will consider if the case is in the public interest and if there is sufficient evidence to secure a conviction.
Ms Purcell will face a six-day trial on 3 April and was granted unconditional bail.
