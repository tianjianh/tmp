The death toll from a stampede at a Hindu festival in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh has risen to 115, local officials have said.

Many were crushed after panic broke out on a bridge near the Ratangarh temple. Others drowned when they jumped from the bridge into river waters below.
Officials said the stampede may have been sparked by a rumour that the bridge had been about to collapse.
Hundreds of thousands had gathered for the festival of Navratra (nine nights).

A day after the tragedy, it was business as usual at the temple.
Pilgrims in colourful attire were pouring into the temple - singing, chanting and beating drums to mark the end of one of the holiest festivals in the Hindu calendar.
Makeshift shops were busy selling snacks. The atmosphere was electric and everyone seemed determined to forget Sunday's tragic incident.
The bridge, where the stampede took place, was crowded with devotees. Many said they felt sad but they had to complete their pilgrimage regardless of the tragedy.
Funeral pyres burned throughout the night, with many of the victims already cremated by Monday morning.
"The death toll has now gone up to 115 and more than 110 injured," news agency AFP quoted senior police official DK Arya in Datia district as saying on Monday.
"Ten of those [injured] are in a very critical state," he added.
Earlier, officials said they had recovered bodies of people who had been crushed to death from the river.
Meanwhile, relatives gathered outside hospitals to take away the bodies of the dead after post mortems had been carried out.
Many were still searching for loved ones among the dead and the injured.
The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Datia said thousands of devotees were still thronging the temple on Monday.
Many took a bath in the Sindh river before going into the temple to offer prayers.
The accident happened at about 09:00 (03:30 GMT) on Sunday. The victims were mostly women and children, officials said.
The narrow bridge is about 500m long and had only recently been rebuilt following another stampede in 2006 in which more than 50 people had died.
Local official Sanket Bhondve said the immediate priority was to provide relief to the injured.
Stampedes occur relatively frequently at religious festivals in India, which attract large crowds.
In the past year, dozens have died in similar tragedies.
In 2011 more than 100 died at a festival in the southern state of Kerala.
Inside Jodhpur's Mehrangarh Fort, more than 220 people were killed in 2008 in a stampede at the Chamunda Devi Hindu temple.
