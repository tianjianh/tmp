Scottish Rugby targets women and girls with taster sessions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Rugby has launched a campaign to attract more women and girls to the sport, entitled 'Be The Best You'.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Free taster sessions are available at rugby clubs across Scotland to introduce new players to the game.
Coaches will teach basic skills of passing, kicking and fitness work, as well as focusing on the enjoyment and social side of rugby union.
An online search tool enables new players to find out about a club near them and how to get involved.
In the past three years, the number of women's teams in Scotland has grown from 112 to 192 and the objective is to raise the profile of the sport still further.

Sheila Begbie, head of women's and girls' rugby at Scottish Rugby, said: "There are many reasons why people take up a particular sport - to keep fit and test themselves physically.
"However, with this campaign we wanted to show there is a lot more to women's rugby than simply the physical benefits of being active. We want to really help raise its profile and get people talking about the game and how enjoyable it is on many different levels."
A campaign launch day will be held at the St Enoch Centre in Glasgow city centre on Saturday, 8 April, which will feature Scotland Women players and encourage the public to sign up to local events with prizes, incentives and fun activities between 12:00 and 14:00 BST.
Upcoming taster sessions are being held at:
Further dates in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth and Thurso are still to be confirmed.
