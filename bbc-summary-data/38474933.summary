[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe climbed back into the automatic promotion places in League One with victory over struggling Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The catalyst for the win was their impressive first-half display against a Shakers side which have now gone 16 league games without a victory.
Full-back Harry Toffolo, re-signed from Norwich on loan for the rest of the season, set the ball rolling in the eighth minute, finding the back of the net with a deflected shot from 25 yards.
After 19 minutes they doubled their lead when former Bury player Stephen Dawson raced clear from the halfway line and fired into the bottom corner.
Against the run of play the Shakers pulled a goal back four minutes before half-time via George Miller's deflected shot.
Crucially there was still time for Josh Morris to crack the ball home direct from a free-kick and restore the hosts' two-goal advantage.
Bury took the game to the Iron after the break and were rewarded when substitute Kelvin Etuhu squeezed a 67th-minute shot inside the post but they could not find an equaliser despite some decent periods of pressure.
