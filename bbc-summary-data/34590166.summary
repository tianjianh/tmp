The M56 has reopened in Cheshire after an overturned lorry closed it for more than 12 hours following a crash on Tuesday afternoon.

The motorway was closed in both directions between junction 11, Daresbury and junction 14, Hapsford.
Emergency services worked through the night to deal with a non-explosive substance which leaked onto the eastbound carriageway.
At one stage the central reservation was removed to relieve the tailbacks.
The driver of the tanker, which crashed at about 15:45 BST on Monday, suffered minor injuries.
A Cheshire Police spokesman said: "There were eight casualties as a result of the incident. Five were treated by North West Ambulance Service at Hapsford Services and three were taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital, they have all since been released.
"Specialist equipment was required at the site both to enabled the removal of the central reservation barriers and facilitate the movement of the traffic from the tailbacks, and to get the required agencies to the site to deal with the spillage and the damage on the road surface.
"All of this was challenging due to the congestion on the road network."
