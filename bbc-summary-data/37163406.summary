Dougray Scott and Gossip Girl's Ed Westwick will also star in the series, which will air on Sony's streaming network Crackle next year.
Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the film franchise based on JK Rowling's best-selling book series, will also be an executive producer on the TV show.
He will play a "frustratingly chaotic" character called Charlie Cavendish.
In a statement, Crackle said the 10-episode series would "carry the spirit of the setting in the original feature film, while creating a new world born from the original movie".
Snatch is based on Ritchie's 2000 big-screen crime caper starring Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Vinnie Jones.
Scott will play Vic Hill while Westwick will guest star as Sonny Castillo.
The story was based on a real-life heist in London where a group of men happened upon a truckload of stolen gold bullion and found themselves embroiled in the murky world of the city's underground crime scene.
The series begins filming in Manchester next week.
Grint recently appeared on Broadway in It's Only A Play opposite Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane.
He won a newcomer of the year award for his West End debut in the revival of Jez Butterworth's Mojo in 2014.
