[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tinkers' Heart in Argyll reconsidered for monument status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Historic Scotland is to revisit its decision not to give protected status to a traditional gypsy wedding place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tinkers' Heart, overlooking Loch Fyne in Argyll, is a pattern of quartz stones that has been used by travellers as a wedding place, or a spot to bless children or remember the dead.
Previously, Historic Scotland said the site did not meet the criteria to be designated as a national monument.
It will now reconsider and factor in equalities issues to a new decision.
The Scottish Parliament's petitions committee has been considering a campaign for the Tinkers' Heart to be given official status.
The disused crossroads where it has lain since the 1700s, is now on private land.
Campaigners want it awarded legal status as a national monument so it can be restored and preserved for future generations.
In its latest evidence to Holyrood's petitions committee, Historic Scotland acknowledged that equalities issues should have been a factor in the previous decision to decline legal status.
The heritage body will now reassess whether or not the Tinkers' Heart should become a scheduled monument.
