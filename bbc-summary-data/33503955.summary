He said that a bailout programme was "all ready to go" for Greece, "with serious reforms and financial support".
"There will not be a 'Grexit'," said European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker, referring to the fear that Greece would have to leave the euro.
Greece is expected to pass reforms demanded by the eurozone by Wednesday.
Parliaments in several eurozone states also have to approve any new bailout.
Eurozone leaders had been meeting in Brussels for about 17 hours, with talks continuing through the night.
