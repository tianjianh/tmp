This intense and effective isolation exercise will help to develop powerful and defined triceps.
Follow Chris as he and Martin talk you through the moves, or read through the steps on Make Your Move.
From Monday to Friday this week (18-22 July), Chris is asking listeners to take on the Breakfast Time Toning challenge during the WorkOUT song at 05:40 BST each day.
This posture-fixing, bingo-wing-busting routine uses baked bean tins from the kitchen cupboard to get your upper body warmed up and ready for the day ahead.
Chris will have demonstrations of each day's routine for you right here  - just take a look below for your instructions.
You can play along by using the routine or you can do whatever exercise you want for the duration of the WorkOUT song just as long as you are moving!
Is it time to Make Your Move? Find out about our new campaign promoting accessible, physical challenges for everyone here.
Use #MakeYourMove on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram to show us your efforts. Videos or photos are welcome, we just want to see you make your move.
But there is no rest for the wicked (or for folk with good taste in radio).
Over the weekend, Mary Anne is encouraging her listeners to take a hike.
Wherever you are around the UK, Mary Anne wants to see where you are reaping the benefits of a good walk and will be asking for your most scenic pictures and videos from your morning walk.
Happy dog walking is always encouraged.
There will be a short film with everyone's contributions to the Make Your Move campaign, so you might just see yourself on iPlayer if you play along and use #MakeYourMove.
So, get up and get moving with BBC 6 Music this week!
