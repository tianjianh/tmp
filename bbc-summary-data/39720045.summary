[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones has been chosen as the party's general election candidate in its top target seat of Ynys Mon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Jones, who left frontline politics four years ago, beat three other candidates to the nomination.
Ynys Mon is seen as a three way fight between Plaid, Labour, who hold the seat, and the Conservatives.
Mr Jones was the constituency's MP from 1987 to 2001 and its assembly member between 1999 and 2013.
He was also Wales' deputy first minister for four years, in a Labour-Plaid coalition Welsh Government formed in 2007.
Mr Jones stood down from the assembly in 2013 to lead the Menai Business Park.
Ynys Mon has been held by Labour's Albert Owen since 2001, and he now has a majority of 229.
Mr Owen, who is standing again, told BBC Wales: "It's a matter for them who they choose.
"Plaid Cymru say they want to take the island back, I say I want to take Ynys Mon forward".
The Conservatives, who represented the seat from 1979 to 1987, are yet to choose a candidate.
A Tory spokesman said: "The choice facing voters in Wales is clear. It is between Theresa May and the Conservative Team providing strong and stable leadership for the UK, or a coalition of chaos led by Jeremy Corbyn that will put the future of our nation at risk."
The Liberal Democrats said the party was in the process of selecting its candidate for the seat and hoped to make an announcement next week.
UKIP will announce its candidate on Thursday.
A party spokesman said: "Anglesey voted to leave the European Union.
"By Ynys Mon electing a UKIP MP, they would have a representative that would fight on their behalf and look after their interests specifically."
A full list of candidates will be available after nominations close on 11 May.
