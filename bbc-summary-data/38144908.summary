Speaking to Maclean's magazine, she said that having a female prime minister is "the best thing that's happened" to the UK for a long time.
"I actually really like her," the British singer-songwriter said.
"I will say it is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She's very sensible and I think that's a good thing at this point in time."
The singer was responding to a question from the interviewer about her 1985 song Waking the Witch, which she once said was about "the fear of women's power".
Bush said May was "a very intelligent woman but I don't see much to fear".
The singer performed a version of Waking The Witch on her newly released live album of tracks from her 2014 Hammersmith Apollo residency, which could be heading to the top of the UK album chart this weekend.
Bush previously wrote a song for a sketch on a 1990 episode of TV series The Comic Strip, about the former Labour Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone.
The lyrics included: "Look to the left and to the right. We need help and there's nobody in sight. Where is the man that we all need? Well tell him he's to come and rescue me. Ken is the man that we all need. Ken is the leader of the GLC."
The track also describes Livingstone as "a sex machine".
In an 2010 interview with Kate Bush fanzine KateBushNews.com, Livingstone said: "Of course I was a fan of the song... If only Kate Bush had seen me as a real sex machine!"
