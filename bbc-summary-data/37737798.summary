[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Ferriby United 1-2 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The agony continued for Steve Housham's North Ferriby in a 2-1 loss at home to Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blair Turgott got on the end of a good passing move to secure victory in the dying minutes at Grange Lane.
The Villagers' problem this season has not been creating chances but taking them, as when Steve Brogan curled in a shot from long range that clipped the bar.
After the break, Reece Thompson eventually put the home side ahead with a great finish from Kyle Wootton's cross.
However, Bromley substitute George Porter equalised swiftly from close range with his first touch of the match.
Turgott's late winner left the bottom club quizzical about when their wretched luck will turn.
