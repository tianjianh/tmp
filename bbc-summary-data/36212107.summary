Five uniformed officers interrupt a lone piper on the castle esplanade - before breaking out their moves.
The original Running Man dance video was created by police in New Zealand as part of a publicity campaign to attract new recruits.
The New Zealand officers challenged The New York City Police Department to follow suit. They made their own video in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and passed the challenge on to Police Scotland.
Police Scotland have tagged the Metropolitan Police, officers in Toronto and their own police college recruits.
