England v Wales: Ross Moriarty relishing battle with Teimana Harrison

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' Ross Moriarty is relishing his battle with rival blind-side flanker and England debutant Teimana Harrison at Twickenham on Sunday.

Northampton back-rower Harrison, 23, was born in New Zealand and qualifies for England through his father.
Both players are hoping to impress ahead of summer tours, with Wales visiting world champions New Zealand and England in Australia.
"He is a very powerful ball-carrier, and he will test me," Moriarty said.
"I played against him in my first game for Gloucester Academy against Northampton.
"I came off the bench in the last 20 minutes of that game. It was my first experience of English rugby, and it was tough.
"He was one of their main players - a very powerful ball-carrier and tackler. He was here, there and everywhere, and he is still the same sort of player.
"I think I ran over him on a one-on-one. He may have been a bit more tired, while I was fresh off the bench, but it was a good night for me."
St Helens-born Moriarty, whose father Paul and uncle Richard both played for Wales, underlined his potential when he featured off the bench and scored two tries during Wales' Six Nations win against Italy in March.
In the absence of captain Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric this weekend, Moriarty will link up with Dan Lydiate and Taulupe Faletau in the Welsh back row.
"This is going to be a good test for us on Sunday, going into the first Test with the All Blacks on 11 June," Moriarty added.
"We are going to try to play at the intensity that we will need against New Zealand, so it's a good opportunity to test ourselves.
"It is really competitive in the back-row. Even without Justin Tipuric here, we have three British and Irish Lions Test back-rowers [including Warburton].
"It is hard to break a mould that has been there for a few years, but it's great for me to learn off them, watch how they train and pick up little things off each of them to make me a better player.
"Toby [Faletau] is one of the best, if not the best, number eights in the world, and he is only 25 years old.
"It's nice to be able to train with him, watch what he does and try to replicate some of the things he does and add to my game."
