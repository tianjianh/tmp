The facility, inside the old Granada studios building, is being used by a new generation of musicians to make music videos for the internet.
The studio was formerly used by bands to record tracks they could mime to on television, with the theme tune for the Brideshead Revisited series among the pieces recorded there.
Clare Fallon reports for BBC North West Tonight.
