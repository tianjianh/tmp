The 25-year-old Welsh keeper was out of contract with the League One club and will join North End on 1 July on a three-year deal.
Maxwell started his career at Wrexham and had four seasons at Fleetwood.
The Lilywhites were without a first-choice keeper after Anders Lindegaard's loan spell ended and they chose to let Chris Kirkland leave.
"Preston is a massive club and getting the deal done early going into the summer is good from a personal note," he told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"There was a bit of interest from other parties but once I knew Preston were interested in me, and speaking to the staff, it was almost a no brainer."
