[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal, Leicester City and Manchester City will represent England in the knockout stage of the Champions League - but who could each side face?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The draw takes place on Monday in Nyon, Switzerland, from 11:00 GMT, followed by the draw for the last 32 of the Europa League.
BBC Sport takes a look at which teams have progressed, who they could face and all the important dates for your diary.
You can follow the draw live on the BBC Sport website and app via Sportsday.
The winner of each group will be drawn against a runner-up, but teams cannot face a side from their own nation in the last 16, or a club they met in the group stage.
Group winners will play the first leg away and the second leg at home.
What are the key dates?
Arsenal will be paired with one of: Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Real Madrid, Porto, Sevilla.
Manchester City's opponents will be one of: Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Monaco, Napoli.
Leicester City will face one of: Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid, Sevilla.
Tottenham were the one English casualty, finishing third to secure a place in the Europa League.
Celtic, in the same group as Barcelona and Man City, finished bottom without a win and are out of European football for this season.
Besiktas and Dynamo Kiev may have been disappointed not to make it through a group that saw Napoli and Benfica progress.
And spare a thought for Club Brugge and Dinamo Zagreb, who finished on zero points, with the latter not managing a single goal.
Tottenham finished as one of the four best third-placed teams in the Champions League groups, meaning they will be seeded with the 12 Europa League group-stage winners for the last 32 of the Europa League when the draw is made on Monday, from 12:00 GMT.
Because Manchester United finished second in Group A behind Fenerbahce, they are unseeded - joining the 11 other group runners-up and the four remaining Champions League third-placed teams
These are the 32 teams confirmed for the knockout stage.
