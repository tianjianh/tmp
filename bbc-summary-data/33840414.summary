Police and ambulance were called to Flaxman Road, in Lambeth at 20:50 BST on Saturday.
The victim, who is yet to be formally identified, was found with head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police said post-mortem tests were due to be carried out in Greenwich and a murder investigation had been launched.
One resident in the street reported hearing "loud bangs" which she thought were gunshots but police said they were not aware of any shots being fired during the incident.
A section of the road has been cordoned off while a forensic examination takes place.
