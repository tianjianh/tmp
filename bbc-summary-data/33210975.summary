Michaela Walsh bowed out of the European Games after losing a unanimous decision to Russia's former world and European gold medallist Elena Saveleva.

Walsh landed some strong blows in the contest but the Russian was given all four rounds on the judges's cards.
The Belfast woman was furious after not getting the verdict against Nicola Adams in last year's Commonwealth Games final in Glasgow.
Another Belfast fighter Sean McComb did win on Saturday morning.
Lightweight McComb became the first Irish boxer to win two bouts at the games as he convincingly beat Italy's Donato Cosenza.
McComb took a 30-27 verdict on all the cards and he will be guaranteed a medal if he wins his next fight against Yasin Yilmaz of Turkey.
Adam Nolan and Dean Gardiner also progressed to the quarter-finals of their divisions after wins over Italian opponents on Saturday.
Welterweight Nolan defeated Dario Morello on a unanimous decision while Gardiner outpointed Guido Vianello despite being knocked down during his contest.
Irish flyweight Myles Casey put up a brave performance against Azeri favourite Elvin Mamishzada before losing a majority decision.
Olympic champion Katie Taylor will be among the Irish boxers taking to the ring on Sunday.
Taylor takes on the last woman to defeat her - Bulgaria's Denista Eliseeva.
Eliseeva defeated Taylor on points at a Multi-Nations event in Bulgaria in February 2011 although it was regarded as a hugely contentious decision.
Since that fight, Taylor, 29, has beaten the Bulgarian on two occasions.
