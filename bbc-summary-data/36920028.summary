Revenue in the April-to-June period rose 21.3% to $21.5bn (Â£16.3bn), from $17.7bn a year earlier.
Net income for the quarter was $4.9bn, up from $3.9bn a year ago. Alphabet's share price rose 6% in after-hours trading,
The rise follows a 17% increase in first-quarter revenues.
Google also made progress in the video market, which has put it in fierce competition with Facebook and Twitter.
The firm's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said it had used artificial intelligence to make better video recommendations to users on YouTube, which it owns.
Google embarked on a restructuring drive late last year and created a new parent company - Alphabet.
