Hitachi Rail Europe's Newton Aycliffe plant opened in 2015 after the company won a Â£5.7bn contract to supply express trains for the East Coast and Great Western main lines.
It will fit out 110 high-speed trains, which are manufactured in Japan.
Transport secretary Chris Grayling and the Japanese ambassador to the UK were among those present at the launch.
The trains are capable of running at 140mph, but will be limited to 125mph unless rail tracks are upgraded.
Karen Boswell, managing director of Hitachi Rail Europe, said: "Today is a celebration of the return of train manufacturing to the north east, supporting thousands of jobs and developing a strong engineering skills base in the region.
"Trains running across the country's rail network will be built by a proud workforce harnessing the best of Hitachi's long-standing rail expertise."
