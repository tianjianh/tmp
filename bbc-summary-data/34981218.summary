Nick Gargan: Ex-chief constable joins security firm G4S

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former chief constable who was effectively forced out following a misconduct finding, has taken up a four-month job with a private firm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nick Gargan will join G4S as a "programme director", seven weeks after resigning as Avon and Somerset chief.
He quit under pressure from the police and crime commissioner over data protection breaches.
Mr Gargan, 48, said after 27 years in policing he wanted to "continue to make use of my experience and skills".
"Like many people who leave the police service, I have some years left before reaching retirement," he said.

He said with "complex challenges" facing public services, he was "pleased to be able to continue to play a part".
The short-term posting is in G4S's justice health business, which provides medical services in prisons and police custody suites.
Victoria Woodison, human resources director for G4S, said: "We are focused on providing the most technically advanced, flexible and efficient services in criminal justice settings and Nick Gargan's insight and experience will help us support police forces to meet the complex and dynamic challenges they face."
Mr Gargan quit as chief constable in October - two months after PCC Sue Mountstevens said she was preparing to use new powers to call on him to resign.
She appointed him to the role in January 2013, but he was suspended in May 2014 amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff.
The ensuing IPCC investigation found those allegations "unproven" but separate data protection allegations emerged.
Last July, an independent QC-led panel found him guilty of eight charges of misconduct - largely relating to "inappropriate disclosure of information" by forwarding emails and "inappropriate use of police-issued iPhone" by storing "intimate" images and text messages.
Following his exit, a number of Conservative MPs questioned the process by which the ex-officer had been ousted, with one suggesting "flawed process, a weak PCC and the power of gossip" had forced him out.
