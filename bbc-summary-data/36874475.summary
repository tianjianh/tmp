Nicola Hazell contacted Bristol Harbour Authority on Twitter after losing her silver solitaire ring while out rowing in Bristol docks on 9 July.
The harbourmaster spotted Avon and Somerset Police's dive team on a training exercise there on Friday and challenged them to find the ring.
Miss Hazell was delighted when the divers found the ring just hours later.
She tweeted: "Thank you SO much @ASPolice I can't believe you've reunited me with my engagement ring!! #herosindrysuits #SOhappy."
Avon and Somerset Police's Nick Evans, who led the dive team, said: "We are delighted to have found it for Nicola.
"We can't do this for everyone obviously, but we were here training anyway and we spend a lot of time looking for stolen property and other items, so it was a good challenge for the team."
