Kyle Lafferty: Norwich City striker charged by FA with misconduct in relation to betting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City striker Kyle Lafferty has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association after allegedly breaching betting rules.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Northern Ireland international, 28, is accused of breaking FA rule E8, which bars professional players from betting on football-related matters.
In a statement, the FA said that Lafferty is alleged to have committed the offence on 20 February.
The former Burnley, Rangers and Palermo forward has until 5 August to respond.
The FA statement read: "It is alleged that on 20 February 2016, the Norwich City forward placed a bet on the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition in breach of FA rule E8."
Rule E8 prevents professional players not only from betting on matches in which they are involved or have an influence, but also on any other football-related matter anywhere in the world - including matches, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.
Neither Norwich nor Northern Ireland played on the date that Lafferty is alleged to have breached the rules.
The forward spent the end of last season on loan at Birmingham City, having joined them on 24 March, and scored once in six appearances.
He also appeared three times for Northern Ireland at Euro 2016 as they reached the last 16.
