The site of the Chicago Rock club, on New Street, Barnsley, was badly damaged when a fire broke out last week.
At its height, South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service used eight fire engines to tackle the blaze at the disused building.
David Shepherd, Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council's director for economic regeneration, said the demolition would take place over the weekend.
He said: "We've worked with Historic England to see if anything on the site can be preserved, but unfortunately we've come to the decision the building cannot be saved."
Mr Shepherd added the demolition would take place in order to "ensure people are safe and are not at risk from the building collapsing without any warning".
