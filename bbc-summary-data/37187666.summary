McDonald's is recalling millions of fitness wristbands that it bundled with Happy Meals after customers complained of skin irritation and burns.

The fast-food chain sold more than 32 million meal boxes containing the plastic "Step-It" bands across North America.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has urged customers to "immediately take the recalled wristbands from children".
McDonald's has issued an apology.
The devices were promoted as devices that would encourage and measure active lifestyles. One counts how many steps the wearer has made, while the other blinks lights when detecting that its user is walking.
The CPSC said McDonald's had distributed the wristbands across the US and Canada between 9 and 17 August. It received more than 70 complaints of skin irritation from customers, including seven reports of skin blistering.
Both devices came with translucent plastic wristband straps, each in a range of three colours.
Those who return the item to McDonald's will be offered a replacement toy and either a yogurt tube or bag of apple slices.
Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald's, said: "Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our customers, which is why upon learning about concerns with these bands we acted swiftly to stop distribution of these toys."
She added: "We apologise to our customers who were impacted and for the inconvenience this recall has caused."
McDonald's restaurants in the UK did not distribute the bands.
