One woman who lives in the area said her family was too frightened to leave their home due to the weekend disturbances involving teenagers.
Martin Connolly from Community Restorative Justice said a meeting with other agencies would be held on Monday.
He said the community was "being held to ransom".
"This situation has been happening for quite a number of weekends - what we are talking about here is a group of five or six individuals who are continually creating problems for the local residents," Mr Connolly said.
"We have directly approached these young people on a number of occasions, we have recruited them to local groups.
"We will be meeting today again with a number of local agencies and community groups.
"The local community know who they are, the police are well aware of these individuals and what we are saying is other agencies need to step up to the mark here. It has now gone past the stage where the community has suffered too long with these individuals.
"These guys are only 14, 15, 16 and they have been trying to hold this community to ransom by threat and by other means."
One woman told BBC Radio Foyle the incidents were "terrifying".
I was watching my wee grandson and he said there are bad boys out there on the street," she said.
"I looked out and I saw there were about 10 of them, they made their way out to the back of the flats facing me and pulled the settee out and they came with two chairs and cushions and I said to myself they are going to burn that.
"Ten minutes later my grandson said 'look out granny, the fire is lit'.
"They must have burnt the wires on the light with the fire, this main one was out and the one behind me was out.
"It is terrifying seeing fires getting lit round you, I would be afraid to go out to them in case they do something to my house."
Mr Connolly said if the group of teenagers did not desist from their activities they would "find themselves going through the criminal justice system".
"It is something we don't want to see but let's be real here, let's look at what has been happening," he added.
"Something has to be done and it has to be done now."
