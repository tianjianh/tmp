The company announced a net loss of 13.1bn yen ($120.5m, Â£83m) for its financial year ending in March.
It has been hit by a huge recall of faulty, potentially deadly, airbags used by car makers worldwide, which may affect more than 100 million vehicles.
The fault has been linked to the loss of 11 lives and more than 100 injuries.
Takata has acknowledged some airbag inflators explode with too much force and spray metal shrapnel into the car.
Takata has paid out $70m (Â£48m) in fines so far and the company's market value has dropped more than 80% since 2014.
Some 50 million vehicles have been recalled globally and last week, US authorities added up to 40 million more.
US regulators believe the volatile chemical used in the inflators, ammonium nitrate, can cause airbags to explode with excessive force.
Globally, 12 car makers are affected with Japan's Honda being the worst hit.

Several automakers, including Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Ford have said they will stop using Takata airbags containing ammonium nitrate for their future models.
The firm also produces seatbelts, child seats, and other safety-related car parts.
For the current year, Takata forecast a net profit of 13bn yen.
The Japanese company's shares ended Wednesday 2.5% higher, after losing 11% this week and more than 80% over the year.
