Terry, 35, is out of contract at the end of this season and in January said he would not be extending his stay.
The club is yet to comment on the exact nature of the role offered to Terry.
But earlier on Friday a Chelsea spokesman said: "With it coming so late in the season, this is a big decision for John and his family."
Writing on Instagram, Terry said: "The contract extension the club has offered me is a different role and I hope everyone will understand I want to take the time to consider it carefully before making a decision."

Chelsea will be managed next season by Italy boss Antonio Conte, who takes over from Guus Hiddink after previous manager Jose Mourinho was sacked in December.
"It's good to have big players in a club who are big personalities," said Hiddink, when asked about Terry at a news conference on Friday.
Chelsea play champions Leicester on Sunday at Stamford Bridge, but Terry is suspended after being sent off at Sunderland.
The defender has made 703 appearances since making his debut in October 1998.
