[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Bring back 24-hour children's care' at Withybush Hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners who want overnight children's care returned to a Pembrokeshire hospital have delivered a 20,000-signature petition to ministers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group, who travelled to the Senedd in Cardiff, are calling for Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest to have 24-hour paediatric care reinstated.
The unit was downgraded two years ago to a 12-hour, daytime only service.
Children needing to be admitted are now sent to Glangwili Hospital, Carmarthen.
Hywel Dda health board said it acknowledged the petition and had a "significant challenge" in demonstrating the safety of its children's services at Withybush and Glangwili hospitals.
