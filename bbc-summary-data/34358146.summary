The future of the Teesside steel plant, which paused production on 18 September due to a global drop in the price of steel, remains unclear.
The plant employs about 2,000 people and unions and MPs had called on the company to make sure they were paid.
SSI said this month's pay roll is being processed.
The payment was made possible through a tax relief given to SSI by the government.
Business Minister Anna Soubry said: "I am very pleased that action we have taken has allowed the company to ensure workers got paid today.
"I made it clear that workers getting paid was a priority and government officials have worked very hard to help the company so they could achieve this.
"It will be some relief for workers and their families at this difficult and uncertain time."
A task force has been set up to support the workforce and liaise with SSI.
Amanda Skelton, chief executive of Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council and chairman of the task force said: "The aim of the group is to ensure that following any announcements about the future of SSI, the impact on the workers, local businesses and the wider community is reduced as far as possible by delivering a programme of tailored support."
