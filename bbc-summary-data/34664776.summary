Revenue rose to €11.3bn from €10.96bn.
The lender said it faced "more favourable economic environment in the developed economies where it operates, while emerging economies faced important challenges".
The bank said it took a hit from depreciating currencies in Latin America.
Profit for its businesses in the Latin America region were €783m, 11% lower than the second quarter because of worse exchange rates, it said.
The bank's net interest income, or earnings on loans minus interest paid for deposits, was €8bn for the July-to-September period, up 7% from a year earlier.
