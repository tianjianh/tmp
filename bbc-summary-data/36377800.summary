"Rob is back in training, he's out running around, so he's back in contention," confirmed Leinster backs coach Girvan Dempsey.
Johnny Sexton, Isa Nacewa and Ben Te'o will be available despite picking up knocks in the win over Ulster.
Connacht coach Pat Lam has no new injury worries heading into the game.
Nacewa underwent an X-ray on an arm injury after the semi-final win over Ulster but received the all-clear.
"Ben went off with a slightly tight calf, but he's fine. Johnny just had a little bang on his glute, he seems to be fine," added Dempsey.
Leo Cullen's side saw off the challenge of Ulster 30-18 in their semi-final at the RDS, while Connacht defeated Glasgow 16-11 at the Sportsground.
Leinster are attempting to win the Pro12 title for the fifth time, their last success coming in 2014.
Connacht, who finished second behind their Irish interprovincial rivals in the Pro12 standings, are playing in a major tournament final for the first time in their history.
Experienced referee Nigel Owens has been selected to referee the final, leading an all-Welsh team of officials.
