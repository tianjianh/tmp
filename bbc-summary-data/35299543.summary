An Italian marine accused of killing two Indian fishermen in 2012 will not return to India to face trial after being allowed home for medical treatment, an Italian senator has said.

Last year an Indian court granted Massimiliano Latorre a period of leave in Italy after he had heart surgery.
He was supposed to return to India by Friday, reports said.
Latorre and fellow marine Salvatore Girone are facing murder charges - the two are on bail pending trial.
"Massimiliano Latorre will not return to India, and furthermore, the possibility of asking for Salvatore Girone's return is being explored," said Nicola Latorre, president of the Senate Defence Committee, according to Italian media.
The Italian prime minister's office and the foreign ministry did not confirm or deny the senator's comments when contacted by Reuters.
The marines were guarding an Italian oil tanker when they opened fire, killing two men off the Kerala coast. The marines said they mistook the fishermen for pirates.
India has ruled out the possibility of a death penalty and of invoking the anti-piracy law to try the marines.
Italy has always insisted that as the shooting took place in international waters, the men should be tried in Italy.
In 2014, Delhi and Rome were involved in a bitter diplomatic row after Italy refused to send the marines back when they were allowed to go home to vote in the February 2013 elections.
The marines eventually returned to Delhi a month later.
