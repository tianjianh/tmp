Pardew was appointed on a three-and-a-half-year deal in January 2015 but the 55-year-old has been dismissed after a run of one victory in 11 games.
Palace have taken just 26 points from the 36 Premier League matches they have played in 2016 and are only one point above the relegation zone.
Former England boss Sam Allardyce is the bookmakers' favourite to take over.
The ex-Sunderland, Newcastle and West Ham boss is among those expected to be considered.
Chairman Steve Parish told BBC Sport: "We all bought into the decision to play a more expansive style of football. We all believed in it. That hasn't worked. It's no-one's fault. The players have been running their socks off for Alan, the spirit is good.

"But now we're going to wind the dial back the other way.
"We're talking to a number of people to make sure we get this right. Nothing has been agreed."
In a statement, Pardew said: "Personally I have a lot of good feelings for this football club and am sad that my time there has ended.
"I feel that I have a special bond with the club and hope that hasn't been affected," added the manager, who made more than 100 appearances for Palace as a player between 1987 and 1991 and led them to the FA Cup final last season.
Parish, who co-owns the club with American investors Josh Harris and David Blitzer, added: "I'm not going to blame other people [the American co-owners]. Relegation is so costly and I feel with no blame attached we got ourselves in a rut and need a change."
Palace have yet to confirm who will take charge of the team for their league fixture at Watford on Boxing Day.
As recently as 3 December, after the club's 3-0 win over Southampton, Pardew thanked Palace chairman Parish for his support.
After the third goal, Pardew gave a thumbs-up gesture to Parish, who responded in a similar fashion.
Following the game, Pardew said: "We have a lot of serious investors at the club who perhaps don't know a lot about football so the chairman has been defending me this week, so I just wanted to say thanks."
Pardew left Newcastle to take over at Selhurst Park after Neil Warnock was sacked with Palace in the relegation zone.
His appointment was a popular one with supporters and results improved as Palace went on to avoid the drop comfortably by finishing 10th, their best final position in the Premier League era.
It meant he became the first manager of a Premier League club to secure a top-half finish after being in the relegation places at Christmas.
Palace started the 2015-16 season with impressive victories over Liverpool and Chelsea which prompted talk of qualifying for Europe.
However, Palace then endured a 14-game winless run in the Premier League between 19 December and 9 April and they finished 15th.
Those struggles were offset as Palace reached the FA Cup final for only the second time in their history, facing Manchester United at Wembley.
Palace took the lead through Jason Puncheon in the 78th minute, but goals from Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard saw United win 2-1.

Alan Pardew's managerial career has always had an element of "boom and bust" - and his last 12 months at Crystal Palace have fallen into the latter category.
While club chairman Steve Parish was recently able to persuade Palace's American owners to give Pardew time, home defeats by Manchester United and Chelsea, albeit by narrow margins, meant they could keep faith no longer.
Pardew guided Palace to the FA Cup final in May, and even though he lost talisman Yannick Bolasie to Everton in a £25m deal last summer, he had to deliver once he was allowed to re-invest expensively on players such as Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend.
He has failed to do so, and with Palace lying only one point above the relegation places, the increasingly likelihood of Palace being dragged further into a fight to stay up means he has paid the price for his failings.

After 18 years in management, which has included stints at Reading, West Ham, Charlton, Southampton and Newcastle as well as Palace, Pardew finds himself out of work.
His career has not been without controversy. As long ago as 2006, while in charge of West Ham, he was involved in a confrontation with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.
In January 2014, he was involved in a heated incident with Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini. Two months later, he was fined £100,000 and given a formal warning for headbutting Hull City midfielder David Meyler.
As recently as September, Pardew was talked of as a potential England manager and despite his recent struggles with Palace, he is likely to be linked with vacancies in the Premier League or Championship.
In a statement, Parish said: "With games now coming thick and fast over the holiday period the club are hoping to put someone in place as quickly as possible but have nothing to say about a replacement at this time."
Some of the possible contenders are:
Former Palace striker Clinton Morrison told BBC Radio 5 live: "I think the Americans wanted their own man. Maybe Pardew knew he was coming to his end because you don't criticise the owners. Really, with the signings they've had, Palace should be doing better. Pardew was given ridiculous money."
Ex-Palace chairman Simon Jordan said: "This isn't panic, it's a reaction to results that people could have seen six weeks ago. If you look at the performance of the team from January, they tanked. The FA Cup final muddied it.
"Sam Allardyce is as good as it gets at guaranteeing a team doesn't get relegated. There's not exactly a plethora of top-quality managers around there, and Sam is a top, top manager."
