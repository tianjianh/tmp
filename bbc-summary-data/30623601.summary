[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with an incident in which a married couple were found dead in their home in County Cork in the Republic of Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The couple have been named locally as Michael Greaney, 53, and his wife, Valerie, 49.
They were discovered at a house at O'Neill's Place, Cobh, at about 15:30 local time on Sunday.
Their eldest daughter is in hospital, the other is said to be traumatised.
Police were alerted by neighbours who contacted them after the couple's 16-year-old daughter was told by her mother to raise the alarm.
They found the other daughter, 21-year-old Michelle, lying on the road outside after a knife attack.
She was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital where she remains in a serious but stable condition.
The couple's youngest daughter was not hurt, but is said to be severely traumatised.
