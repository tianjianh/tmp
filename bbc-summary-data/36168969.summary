David Lee Stewart, 31, of Gray's Park Avenue, Belfast, was jailed on Wednesday.
He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison and another three and a half years on licence.
The PPS has now confirmed it received a complaint about the ruling.
A PPS spokesperson said: "We have received correspondence outlining concerns over the sentences passed in this case.
"The matters raised will be examined carefully in line with our protocols around unduly lenient sentences in the Crown Court."
Enda, from County Tyrone, was walking to his student accommodation when a van mounted a footpath and hit him in October 2014.
He sustained a broken neck and head injuries.
During his trial, the court heard that Stewart took 13 drinks, including six pints of beer and four Jagerbombs, a mix of a spirit and an energy drink, before driving his van.
Traces of drugs, including cocaine, were also found in his system.
Speaking outside Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday, Enda's father Peter Dolan said the family was "disappointed and disgusted" at the length of sentence handed down.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the attorney general John Larkin said he had stated previously that he "should be able to refer unduly lenient sentences to the Court of Appeal".
"At present he [Mr Larkin] does not have these responsibilities and he can only, as a member of the public, lament the death of Enda Dolan, a young man of so much talent and promise," the spokesperson added.
