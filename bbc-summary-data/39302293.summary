[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leicester draw Atletico Madrid in the Champions League

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City have draw Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Atletico who are managed by Diego Simeone made it all the way to last years final and won't be easy opponents for Leicester.
They've played each other before in the  1997-98 UEFA Cup, that time they lost 4-1 to Atletico on aggregate.
This could be the perfect opportunity for Leicester to get their revenge. The first legs of the quarter finals will be played on the 11 & 12 April and the second legs will be the 18 & 19 April.
