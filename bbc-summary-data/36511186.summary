Murray, 29, has been without a coach since splitting with Amelie Mauresmo shortly before the French Open last month.
The Scot won Wimbledon, the US Open and Olympic gold during two years with Lendl from 2012 to 2014.

"Ivan's single-minded and knows what it takes to win the big events," Murray said in a statement.
"I had two very successful years working with him. I'm looking forward to Ivan joining the team again and helping me try and reach my goals."
Lendl, a former world number one and eight-time Grand Slam champion, has spent the last two years working for the United States Tennis Association.
He will work alongside Jamie Delgado, the British former player who joined Murray's team earlier this year.
Lendl helped guide Murray to victory at the London 2012 Olympics before the Briton won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open later that year.
The Czech-born American then helped Murray end Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion at Wimbledon in 2013.
"I enjoyed working with Andy in the past," Lendl, 56, added.
"Andy and I have always stayed in contact so it should be fun to be part of his team again."
Murray is ranked second in the world and has reached both Grand Slam finals in 2016, losing to Serbian world number one Novak Djokovic at the Australian and French Opens.
A four-time champion at Queen's Club, Murray will begin his campaign against Frenchman Nicolas Mahut in round one, with the championships starting on Monday.

Contact was made during the French Open, and the reunion sealed in the past few days - with Lendl due at the Queen's Club for Murray's opening match on Tuesday.
Lendl is no fan of living out of a suitcase, but it sounds as if the chance to work with the world's second best player - who can expect to be in his prime for at least another couple of years - was just too hard to resist.
They are planning to spend up to 20 weeks a year together, with Lendl present at all the Grand Slams, key training weeks and probably the odd Masters Series event too.
Jamie Delgado remains Murray's full-time coach, but it always made sense to add a Grand Slam champion to the fold. Lendl was the obvious place to start, and after a two-year break from travelling, it sounds as if Murray's call came at just the right time.
