Thousands of handmade poppies have gone on display in Cardiff Bay to mark the centenary of the Battle of Mametz Wood.

The Lads of Wales To War exhibition at the Pierhead also features a replica of the Mametz dragon.
Community centre Craft of Hearts, based in Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taff, made the display and said the poppies were "a symbol of remembrance" and "hope".
Another 350 poppies are being sent to Mametz to be laid on the graves of soldiers from the Rhondda who died.
The 38th Welsh Division launched an assault on Mametz Wood in northern France from 7 July 1916.
They suffered more than 400 casualties on the first day alone, but finally forced the Germans to retreat after four days.
The exhibition in Cardiff runs until Saturday.
