The Lego Movie creators Chris Miller and Phil Lord and Fox 21 TV Studios have optioned the rights to the podcast, reports Deadline.
They are developing a series which will chronicle the making of the podcast as it follows a new case.
The first series, a spin-off of NPR's This American Life, followed the murder of Hae Min Lee and the ex-boyfriend jailed for her death.
It became a cultural phenomenon, topping the iTunes chart for several weeks and picking up a Peabody Award.
Co-created and co-produced by Sarah Koenig and Julie Snyder, and hosted by Koenig, they will both act as executive producers on the forthcoming TV show.
"Chris (Miller) and Phil (Lord) take an unexpected approach to telling stories and that is so appealing to us at Serial," Snyder said.
"They experiment. They don't mimic formulas. Developing a show with them is exciting because we feel like we speak the same language, only they're smarter than us."
"From the very first week of Serial's release last fall, everyone at Fox 21 TVS was obsessed with the podcast," explained Fox 21 TV Studios president Bert Salke.
"One year later, thanks to the incredible passion of Chris and Phil, who flew to New York and shared their vision with Sarah, Julie (Snyder), Alissa (Shipp) and Ira (Glass) for what the series could be, we're moving forward on this exciting project...we are confident we'll attract a spectacular writer and look forward to pitching it to outlets very soon."
The Serial podcast has been commissioned for two more seasons.
Series two will concentrate on the story of captured US Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl, and will air in the autumn.
Lord and Miller have also signed on to direct the Han Solo Star Wars movie, which is set for release in May 2018.
