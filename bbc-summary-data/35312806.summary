[SN]TITLE[SN]
Three Angle Peninsula schools to close because of costs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three schools are to close on Pembrokeshire's Angle Peninsula because of declining pupil numbers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors supported a recommendation to shut Angle, Stackpole and Orielton primary schools at an extraordinary meeting on Thursday.
Figures show the cost of running these are between 24% and 65% greater than the county average.
A new replacement school is likely to be built at Hundleton. A Welsh medium school is also set for Haverfordwest.
At the same meeting, councillors voted unanimously to establish a new school in Haverfordwest for children from 3 to 16.
While the exact location has yet to be decided, it will be Pembrokeshire's second Welsh medium secondary school.
St Davids councillor David Lloyd called it "a very important day for the Welsh language in Little England beyond Wales" - referring to the traditional nickname for parts of the county.
