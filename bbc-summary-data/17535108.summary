Liechtenstein country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Principality of Liechtenstein is a tiny, doubly-landlocked country tucked away between Switzerland and Austria and with mountain slopes rising above the Rhine valley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It owes much of its wealth to its traditional status as a tax haven, though it has in recent years taken steps to shake off its image as a tax haven and to reposition itself as a legitimate financial centre.
The country has come through a lengthy political wrangle over the role and power of the hereditary monarchy.
After an often bitter campaign, the people voted in March 2003 in a constitutional referendum to give Prince Hans-Adam sweeping new political powers. The following year he handed over practical power to his son, Crown Prince Alois.
Head of state: Prince Hans-Adam II
Regent and crown prince: Alois
Prince Hans-Adam, a successful banker, became head of state following the death of his father, Prince Franz Josef, in 1989. In August 2004 he handed over the day-to-day running of the principality to his son, Crown Prince Alois, while remaining titular head of state.
In 2003 the royals won sweeping new powers in a constitutional referendum, which gave them the power to veto parliamentary decisions and to sack the government.
Prime minister: Adrian Hasler
Adrian Hasler of the centre-right Progressive Citizens Party (PCP) took office in March 2013, after his party came first in the February general election, winning 10 seats in the 25-seat parliament.
He has vowed to reduce the country's budget deficit by cutting back on public spending.
Liechtenstein has a very sparse media scene, with the circulation figures of its newspapers at around 10,000 or less.
Its citizens rely on foreign and satellite broadcasters for most TV and radio services.
