Arla Foods Buckinghamshire dairy plan approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan to build one of the world's largest dairies has been approved in Buckinghamshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arla Foods have been granted planning permission by Aylesbury Vale District Council for a Â£150m complex on 70 acres (24 hectares) on land at Aston Clinton.
The site could process about 10% of the milk needed in England.
Arla Foods said 700 new jobs would be created but local residents fear existing roads would not be able to cope with the extra traffic.
The dairy could be in operation by the end of next year.
