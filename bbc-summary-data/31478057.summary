[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A health board has become the first in Wales to issue body-worn cameras in a bid to cut down on violent attacks and abuse of staff.

The Cardiff and Vale University board says a quarter of all attacks and incidents in Wales happen to staff on its sites.
Security staff at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff have been given five personal CCTV devices.
A further six cameras have been ordered for the health board's other sites.
"If someone is being abusive or violent, we notify them about the camera and once they know it's filming them, they back down," said security team leader David James.
"It's an excellent deterrent to protect our staff."
