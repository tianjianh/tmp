The 29-year-old Briton, who lost to Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in May, said he had enough time left in his career to train in mixed martial arts.
McGregor was unbeaten in six years before losing to Nate Diaz at UFC 196.
"McGregor is a massive name in MMA and I'm a big name in boxing, so, globally, I think it would be a massive fight," Khan told Flocombat.com
Khan, a financial stakeholder in Indian MMA promotion Super Fight League, later told his Twitter followers that he had "never backed away from any fight".
Retired boxer Floyd Mayweather was rumoured to be facing an MMA fighter, possibly McGregor, but Khan reckoned that was a "publicity stunt".
"I don't think Mayweather would want to fight under MMA rules," said Khan.
However, he insisted he would be happy to switch sports.
"I've been fighting all my life, so, for me, I don't think it'd be a problem for me to learn and switch over to the sport," he added.
