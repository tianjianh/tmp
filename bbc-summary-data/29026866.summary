Turns out the Queen is not a fan of the royal selfie

If you're a fan of a selfie, one with the royal family is surely the holy grail?

But the Queen apparently finds it strange when people try to sneakily take a picture with her.
The monarch is said to have made the comments during a "nice chat" to US ambassador Matthew Barzun at Buckingham Palace after his appointment.
Mr Barzun told Tatler magazine: "She was essentially saying, 'I miss eye contact'."
However, despite her apparent dislike of them, the Queen appeared in a fair few pictures at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow which became a hot bed for royal selfies.
Australian hockey players Jayde Taylor and Brooke Peris took it a step further during the games, claiming Her Majesty photobombed her picture and appeared to smile at the camera.
Although the Queen isn't that fond of the selfie, other members of the Royal Family don't seem too bothered.
Olympic champion Chris Hoy tweeted a picture that seems to show Prince William jumping into a shot at the games.
Meanwhile, Harry was keen to make the most of being in the background of Trevor Shailer's picture.
The Sport Manawatu chief executive didn't seem to mind as he made the photo his Facebook profile picture.
