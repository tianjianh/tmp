She is a cancer nurse in Gaza's main hospital, Al-Shifa. Every day she deals with fall-out of the on-going conflict between Israel and Gaza's ruling party, Hamas.
Living in a place with a failing economy means she faces daily electricity and supply shortages at work.
"Sometime we go for two or three months without pay," she says. "But this doesn't make me want to do my job any less, because it's not the patient's fault."
