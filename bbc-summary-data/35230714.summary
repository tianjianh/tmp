The boy's father, Simon Lewis, 33, from Trowbridge, died in the crash on Lamby Way, Cardiff, on News Year's Eve.
His wife, Amanda, and their three-year-old daughter, Summer, were passengers in the Daihatsu Sirion car.
A 29-year-old driver of a blue Peugeot involved in the collision has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.
He has also been arrested on suspicion of taking a vehicle without consent, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance.
He remains at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, where he is being treated for non life-threatening injuries.
The Lewis' baby was born three months premature at the same hospital on Sunday amid concern he was in distress.
He died later the same day, said South Wales Police.
In a statement, the force said the family had requested privacy while they deal with the further "devastating loss".
Officers are appealing for witnesses to the two-car collision to come forward.
It happened at approximately 17:30 GMT on Thursday, about a quarter of a mile east of the Rover Way roundabout.
