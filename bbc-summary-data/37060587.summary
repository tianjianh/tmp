The Dow Jones was down 37.05 points to 18576.47, while the wider S&P 500 was 1.74 points lower at 2184.05.
The tech-based Nasdaq climbed 4.5 points to 5232.89.
US retail sales in July came in at $457.7bn, an unexpectedly flat figure compared with June, when there had been strong consumer spending.
Producers prices took an unexpected drop, suggesting a continuingly weak inflation environment that may make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
The producer price index - the measure of the costs for services and energy products- dropped 0.4% in July. The first drop since March.
Elsewhere, economic data showing China's economy slowing down had no marked effect on trading, while data from the eurozone confirmed it grew at 0.3% in the second quarter.
Winners on the Dow were Exxon Mobil which climbed 1.3% and Coca-Cola up 0.6%.
Shares of Alibaba rose 7% one day after the e-commerce giant reported its largest revenue growth as a public company.
Banks saw their stock prices fall over concerns that the Fed will hold interest rates at ultra-low levels.
JP Morgan and Bank of America were down 0.2%. Goldman Sachs fell 0.4% and Wells Fargo slipped 0.7%.
