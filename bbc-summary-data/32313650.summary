China has threatened to punish a local human rights group, hours after releasing five activists said to be linked to the organisation.

The foreign affairs ministry said on Tuesday that Yirenping had "violated the law" but gave no further details.
China earlier this week freed the women after more than a month in detention, a move welcomed by rights groups.
The detention of the women, who planned protests against sexual harassment, had sparked an international outcry.
In a daily press briefing on Tuesday, the foreign affairs ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the activists were from Yirenping and that the organisation "will be punished for violating the law".
The details of the allegations and the punishment threatened were not given.
Yirenping's co-founder Lu Jun told reporters that the group would be hiring a lawyer to respond to both the allegations and a March raid on one of its offices.
"We have reason to believe that if Yirenping really engaged in 'illegal' behaviour, the police would have brought it up long ago, and not the foreign ministry today," Lu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
Also known as the Beijing Yirenping Centre, the group has offices in Beijing as well as Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
It was founded in 2006 to "promote public health, eliminate discrimination, and defend the right of disadvantaged groups through legal means", according to its website.
It focuses on helping those with HIV and hepatitis B, women and disabled people bring anti-discrimination lawsuits against the government, companies and schools.
It had lobbied for the release of the women, who were arrested shortly before International Women's Day on 8 March. Ms Lu had earlier said their detention was "a glaring injustice".
The women had planned activities including a march in a Beijing park where participants would wear stickers advocating safe sex, and gatherings in Beijing and Guangzhou calling for awareness of sexual harassment on buses.
The US, UK and European Union had all called for them to be freed.
The five have not been charged but their bail conditions mean charges could be brought at a later date. Their lawyer also said they would need to update the authorities on their whereabouts.
Rights groups said that their release showed that international pressure had worked, and called on China to drop all restrictions and threat of charges.
