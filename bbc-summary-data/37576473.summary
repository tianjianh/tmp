[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Consumers are not paying enough for their food and the cost will have to go up, according to a key industry figure in Northern Ireland.

Tony O'Neill, who chairs the Agri-Food Strategy Board, said that supermarkets were getting most out of the supply chain.
He said European subsidies for farmers allowed the production of cheap food.
Mr O'Neill said that instead of supporting farmers, much of the profit was being eaten up by retailers.
Speaking to the assembly's agriculture and environment committee, he said supermarkets which have been posting healthy profits will have to share them with farmers to keep the industry viable.
"There's no doubt that the supermarkets are now realising that they've gone too far, but they have to find a way back and I don't think they know the way back," he told the committee.
Mr O'Neill said there were "two agendas" in farming - those who supported competitive production and those who backed farming's environmental outcomes.
The committee also heard that Northern Ireland needed up to 6,000 farmers who could produce high volumes of food competitively in a global marketplace.
He added that Northern Ireland also needed 20,000 farmers who would look after the countryside.
