[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leicester City 0-0 Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bottom side Leicester City's predicament worsened as they were held to a goalless draw by 10-man Hull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Foxes - seven points off safety - barely troubled Hull, who were reduced to 10 men in the 72nd minute when Tom Huddlestone was shown a second yellow.
The best chances fell to Hull striker Nikica Jelavic, who headed over from six yards and scuffed a shot from a similar distance.
Abel Hernandez also had a fierce shot saved by Foxes keeper Mark Schwarzer.

That chance came in the closing minutes when the Tigers were down to 10 men after Huddlestone was dismissed by referee Jon Moss for a foul on Jamie Vardy.
It did not change the complexion of the match as Hull continued to look comfortable at the back thanks to the leadership and organisation of centre-back Michael Dawson.
His backline and the rest of the team look far more assured than they did back in December when they were in 19th place - two wins and only one defeat in their last six games suggest they have turned a corner.
They had only conceded four goals in the previous five, and against a Foxes side who had managed a mere four goals in their last six league outings, the likelihood was that Hull would improve upon that stat.
The only time they looked like conceding was when Leicester striker Andrej Kramaric failed by a fraction to get his boot on the end of a Riyad Mahrez cross in the first half.

They also created chances of their own, with top scorer Jelavic twice going close.
Hull's top scorer this season should have done better with his first opportunity, when he failed to get a good connection on a lay-off from Ahmed Elmohamady, and after the break when he headed over from close range.
The Croat did manage to put the ball in the net but Foxes keeper Schwarzer was judged to have been fouled by striker Dame N'Doye in the lead-up. Substitute Abel Hernandez also forced a good low save from Schwarzer with just a few minutes remaining.
Leicester manager Nigel Pearson said this was a must-win game for his side. That chance has now gone - they cannot afford many more slip-ups.
Hull manager Steve Bruce:
"I've got no problem with Huddlestone's two yellow cards, but is every challenge now a yellow if you mis-time it?
"It got a bit angry towards the end, but for me the referee booked my two centre-backs for (fair) challenges.
"There's a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek and if we're not careful...I saw everyone surround Alex for a red card for his challenge.
"There wasn't a nasty challenge in the game yet we've had five yellow cards and a sending off. I never saw that coming."
Leicester manager Nigel Pearson:
"We've got 10 games left, six at home and we probably need to win five. Today's game shows how tough it can be.
"We are in the same sort of position as before. We have six games at home so our home form has to be drastically improved to give us the best chance.
"Today I think the players expected to get three points, so it is disappointing to come away with one.
"To get the three we needed to be more committed to our attacking play."
