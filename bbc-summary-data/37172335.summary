[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Mayor Sadiq Khan is on the lookout for an aide who will focus on boosting the city's night-time culture.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The night tsar will work with Mr Khan, the Night Time Commission, businesses, councils, Met Police and Transport For London to make London a "24-hour city".
The one-year post comes less than a week after the launch of the Night Tube, which is expected to add Â£77m to the city's economy each year by 2029.
The successful candidate will work two-and-half days a week for Â£35,000.
An advert on the mayor's website states the night tsar needs to demonstrate "proven leadership ability, public profile and convening power, plus a thorough understanding of the night time economy and the ability to work in a political environment".
The deadline for applications is on the midnight of 12 September and interviews will take place the following week.
Night Tube services began on the Victoria and Central lines on Friday, with more than 100,000 people riding the Tube in the early hours on the first weekend.
The service will be rolled out to the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines this autumn.
