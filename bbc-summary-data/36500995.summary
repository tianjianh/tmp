Wales took on Slovakia in the Euro 2016 tournament in France and won 2-1.
A Cardiff fanzone with a giant screen has been set up in the city's Bute Park while matches are also being shown in Swansea's Castle Square.
About 24,000 Welsh fans had tickets for the game in Bordeaux and about 700 left from Cardiff Airport on Saturday morning with some reporting hold-ups.
First Minister Carwyn Jones earlier wished the Welsh team good luck "after 58 years and so many near misses".
"Wales will be represented in a tournament watched by billions of football fans across the world this summer. It's incredible, unprecedented and completely deserved," he said.
"Pob lwc [good luck] boys, we're with you all the way."
And Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: "Qualification for the tournament is a remarkable achievement and the people of Wales are right behind the team.
"I am thrilled to be in Bordeaux for tonight's game against Slovakia to see Wales compete on the big stage."
Some fans flying into France on Saturday morning encountered delays.
A 30 minute hold-up at Bergerac airport meant fans had to wait until 14:30 BST for a train to Bordeaux which arrived about an hour before kick-off.
Meanwhile, supporters were also warned about a transport strike in Bordeaux which has affected some trams, although one from the city centre to the stadium was still running.
Officers from South Wales Police, who are working in the city, have been tweeting travel advice.
A family from Deeside living in Bordeaux told BBC Wales they were "excited" for the influx - as a lot of their neighbours think their native land is in England.
Patricia Davey said: "Wales as a country isn't really well known, sadly. You mention Wales and people look at you quizzically and say, 'where's that? That's England, isn't it?'
"I might come down and watch it on the big screen [in the fanzone]. You've got to cheer on Wales."
