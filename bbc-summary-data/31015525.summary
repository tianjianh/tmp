In pictures: India river erosion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tens of thousands of people in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal have been reduced to penury due to the erosion of thousands of acres of land by the Ganges river.

Photographer Arindam Mukherjee travels to several villages in Murshidabad district to assess the situation.
Over the past two decades, the river has claimed vast tracts of agricultural land and made many homes dangerous to live in.
As one travels through the area, one can see empty homes dotted along the river bank, like this one on the way to Hossenpur village.
Seikh Iliyaas lost his home in Kholsi village to the river in September 2014. "I had my house by the river until it was swept away. My entire house went into the river overnight. Now I stay in the poultry shed of a neighbour, along with my wife and children," he says. "I work whenever there is work available. There is no provision for any fixed regular work here," he adds.
Villagers say the water rises and claims land suddenly and in a matter of a few minutes the river bank disappears into the river. That is why when the water began rising in Kulidihar village, Achinto Mondal, who lived close to the river, vacated his home quickly and sought shelter in the courtyard of one of his neighbours. His house though was spared and it still exists, but as there are still chances of erosion, Mr Mondal has not moved back into his own home.
In Kholsi village, erosion has eaten into the road, forcing people to carve an alternate path through the home of Kurshaid Ali. Most of Mr Ali's house has been damaged, although he continues to live in parts that remain standing.
In many places, villagers have fortified the river bank with bamboo cross-meshes to stop erosion. But experts say these structures are weak and of little use in preventing erosion.
The villagers say that as the river creeps in closer, they have to constantly keep moving a little further inland. Rita Mondol lost her home in Kulidihar village last September. Today, her only possessions are a few cattle and a rundown shop.
Living so close to the Ganges, many villagers make a living by catching fish from the river and selling it in the local market. With farmlands shrinking and growing poverty, many villagers are forced to migrate to Indian cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore to find work.
