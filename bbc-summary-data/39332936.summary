Jodie Moss died when Dariusz Tokarczyk's HGV smashed into her stationary car on the A34 at Chieveley, Berkshire, in March 2016.
Tokarczyk, 47, admitted causing death by dangerous driving.
He was sentenced to four-and-half years in prison and banned from driving for 51 months.
Reading Crown Court heard that Jodie, from Swindon, had turned her Vauxhall Corsa's hazard warning lights on after it had suffered engine failure.
Tokarczyk, from Harrogate in North Yorkshire, was selecting music on his mobile phone in the moments before impact, the court heard.
Judge Angela Morris told Tokarczyk that his actions were "irresponsible, reckless and thoughtless".
Jerry Moss, Jodie's father, said: "She was taken far too early by a selfish 10-second act. The driver had plenty of time to act."
He added that the "devastation caused is immeasurable".
