Uninsured Steven Mills, 29, knocked Jack Archer off his bike while trying to overtake him in Chapel Lane, Bingham, Nottinghamshire, on 25 July.
Instead of stopping to help, Mills fled the scene, leaving the fatally injured teenager to die at the roadside.
He was sentenced to three years and four months at Nottingham Crown Court.

Mills of Closes Side Lane, East Bridgford, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and failing to stop after the collision.
He was also found guilty of doing an act intending to pervert the course of justice and using a vehicle without insurance.
Officers said Mills set fire to his car three and a half hours before he handed himself into Carlton police station.
Jack's family, from Newton, Nottinghamshire, described him as "a handsome, vibrant and enthusiastic young man with an enviable passion for life".
"For his life to be cut short in such a brutal way is a huge injustice to him and no sentence will ever compensate for that. He had so much ahead of him which has now been lost because of a senseless act of carelessness and lack of compassion.
"Finally the last word must be for our dear son. We love you and will always love and keep your memory alive forever. You will never be forgotten, your smile will never fade and your light will continue to shine for eternity."
Det Sgt Adam Cooper, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Steven Mills allowed hardly any room for his manoeuvre and then left Jack fatally injured in the verge of the road.
"The fact that he didn't stop to check on him and then destroyed the evidence is absolutely unforgiveable and has left his family distraught."
He thanked Jack's family for their bravery and patience.
