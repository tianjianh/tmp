The 2 Sisters chicken processing factory in Llangefni ended its staff consultation last week on plans to cut a whole shift, affecting 300 jobs.
Unite union officials put forward alternative proposals to factory managers and will explain the outcome of those talks to workers.
Around 800 people work at the site, including a number of agency workers.
