The amnesty, at HM Maghaberry Prison, near Lisburn, was called amid fears that fake diazepam pills were circulating within the prison.
But the Prison Service has not confirmed what prompted the move.
It is understood that only a small number of inmates took advantage of the amnesty during the last weekend of September.
It is thought that the amnesty set out to tackle an influx of fake diazepam pills known as "the blue plague".
The pills have been responsible for many deaths in Scotland, and have been widely reported as having had a role in the death of Jonathan Adair, the son of former loyalist paramilitary leader Johnny Adair.
Maghaberry Prison faces an ongoing problem with illegal drugs.
Staff at the prison say the problem is getting worse and that the situation is approaching crisis point.
The number of prisoners who availed of the amnesty has not been released, but I understand it was as few as five - despite an assurance that handing over drugs would have absolutely no repercussions.
The amnesty was ordered by Maghaberry prison governor, Steve Davis.
In a statement, the Prison Service said the governor would use all the tools at his disposal to keep prisoners safe.
Since July, 11 visitors to Maghaberry Prison have been arrested on suspicion of trafficking drugs into the prison.
