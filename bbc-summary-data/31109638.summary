Morrissey has cancelled a concert in Iceland after the venue refused not to sell meat on the night of the gig.

The 55-year-old vegetarian had planned to perform at Reykjavik's Harpa concert hall but axed the date, saying it declined to observe his stipulation.
"I love Iceland and I have waited a long time to return," the former Smiths frontman told the True To You fan site.
"But I shall leave the Harpa Concert Hall to their cannibalistic flesh-eating bloodlust."
Morrissey is scheduled to play six UK dates next month, beginning at the Nottingham Capital FM Arena on 13 March.
The singer published his autobiography last year and is currently working on his debut novel.
