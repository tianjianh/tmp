Dowty Propellers resume production after factory blaze

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A propeller manufacturer has resumed production in Bristol after its factory in Gloucestershire was devastated by a major fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dowty site in Staverton had to be demolished after it was severely damaged by the blaze in February.
The firm said it is utilizing the National Composites Centre (NCC) on a temporary basis until "an interim facility is up and running".
Eight Dowty employees are now based at the NCC site making propeller parts.
Spokeswoman Jessica Ensan said the NCC "came to our rescue" by lending factory space and autoclave machines used in the manufacture of de-icer boots which decrease ice accumulation during flight.
Dowty's main production line makes propellers for the C130J Super Hercules and the Bombardier Dash 8 Q400.
The cause of the Staverton site fire is still being investigated.
