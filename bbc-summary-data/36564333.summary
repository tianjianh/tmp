Luke Harlow invited Kayleigh Haywood to his flat and engaged in sexual activity with the schoolgirl - before his friend Stephen Beadman raped and murdered her.
In one text, Harlow said of their planned meeting: "Let's just keep it secret."
Both of the men deny falsely imprisoning Kayleigh at Harlow's home in Ibstock, Leicestershire.
In another message to Kayleigh, Harlow wrote: "I really like you I just keep worrying about the age range because I could get into trouble.
"I am too old for you and I will get into trouble for seeing you."
Stephen Beadman, 29, of George Avenue, Ibstock, Leicestershire
Luke Harlow, 27, also of George Avenue, Ibstock, Leicestershire
Harlow first made contact with Kayleigh on 31 October, by Facebook.
In one text to Kayleigh, Harlow wrote: "I don't want you to think I'm a creep would you be my girlfriend if I was younger."
In another he wrote: "Don't go around telling people about this they will think it's weird."
He also asked Kayleigh: "What do you say if a lad chats you up at school?"
Kayleigh replied: "I'm taken."
In another message in the days before they met, Harlow wrote: "I will go to the shop on Friday to get some alcohol, it helps if you're a bit drunk when you meet someone for the first time."
The trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard how Beadman did a Google search for "lime pit" hours after dumping Kayleigh's body in a hedgerow.
He is also alleged to have accessed a betting website and watched a TV show on his computer shortly after raping and murdering Kayleigh.
The court has heard that Kayleigh went to Harlow's flat willingly on the evening of Friday 13 November, having told her family she was staying with a friend.
However, Beadman and Harlow are accused of keeping her prisoner between about 21:00 GMT on 14 November and 03:00 on 15 November.
Further analysis of Beadman's computer showed he used it to access Kayleigh's Facebook page and Harlow's Facebook page shortly before his arrest, the court heard.
The trial continues.
