Unmanned Warrior 2016 will involve drones, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machines that can operate underwater.
Companies that manufacture the weapons and Nato member countries have been invited by the Royal Navy to take part.
It will be held during the UK-led Exercise Joint Warrior in October.
Joint Warrior is one of Nato's largest training events and is held twice a year for thousands of army, navy and air force personnel.
Since 2014, the Royal Navy has been promoting Unmanned Warrior 2016 to drone technology businesses.
Various scenarios will be run to test the capability of the machines, including anti-submarine warfare, surveillance and reconnaissance.
The first of this year's Joint Warrior exercises will be held from 11-23 April.
Most of the training takes place in and around Scotland with warships operating out of Faslane on the Clyde and aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray.
Live firing is also done at Cape Wrath in Sutherland, while large-scale military manoeuvres have taken place in the past at West Freugh near Stranraer.
