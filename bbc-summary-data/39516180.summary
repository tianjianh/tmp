Scottish child abuse inquiry investigates Catholic care establishments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish child abuse inquiry will investigate care establishments run by Catholic organisations as part of the second phase of its hearings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The inquiry will begin its investigation in the autumn of five homes run by the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul.
In 2018, it will look into a further four children's homes run by the Sisters of Nazareth.
It has asked people with experience of the homes to contact them.
The inquiry is continuing to privately take statements from abuse survivors in Scotland, and will hold its first public sessions in May.
More than 60 institutions, including several top private schools, are being investigated by the inquiry, which is expected to last for four years.
Other institutions being investigated include those run by faith-based organisations and major care providers like Quarriers and Barnardo's.
