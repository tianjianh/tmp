Bristol Rovers 2-1 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers won promotion to League One in dramatic fashion on the final day of the season as they beat Dagenham & Redbridge, while closest rivals Accrington were held to a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Brown struck Rovers' winner in stoppage time as they came from behind to win against the relegated Daggers.
Billy Bodin had cancelled out Matthew Cash's opener and Rovers looked set to draw despite having 35 shots on goal.
But Brown clinched the Pirates' second consecutive promotion on 92 minutes.
Darrell Clarke's side, who were relegated to the National League on the final day of the season in 2014, began Saturday in fourth place, two points behind second-placed Accrington.
Wins for both Accrington and Oxford would have left Rovers in the play-offs, but Stanley failed to beat Stevenage, meaning Rovers finished third on goal difference.
Top scorer Matty Taylor spurned the best of the home side's many second-half chances before Brown's late twist.
Throwing players forward in search of the winner, Rovers almost conceded but Brown cleared off the line to deny Dagenham.
As full-time loomed, Taylor hit the post but the rebound fell to defender Brown, who netted to set off jubilant celebrations at the Memorial Stadium.
Clarke's side lost just one of their final 14 games of the season to return to the third tier for the first time since being relegated in 2011.
Bristol Rovers match-winner Lee Brown told BBC Radio Bristol: "It means the world to me. It means so much to so many people.
"It just happened to fall to me. I was the lucky one. I'm just so happy it hit the back of the net.
"What a group of players, I can't rate them highly enough. It's going to be a long night."
