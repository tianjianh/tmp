Christian Bagley, 30, was found with wounds to his arm and back near Hunderton Bridge in Hereford at 22:50 BST on 21 June. He died in hospital.
Police said the cyclist was seen riding along nearby Great Western Way at about the same time.
Footage is believed to show the same individual cycling in the direction of Hunderton Bridge earlier that day.
West Mercia Police have arrested two men, aged 27 and 33, on suspicion of murder.
Det Supt Adrian McGee, who is leading the investigation, said: "We are very keen to identify and speak to this individual.
"If you recognise yourself in this footage please get in touch with police immediately as you may hold vital information which could assist the investigation.
"Similarly if you were in the area near the Great Western Way ('the lines') or the pathway beneath the Hunderton Bridge and recognise the man in the footage or have any further information in relation to this incident please contact police as soon as possible."
