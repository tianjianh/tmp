Rangers will be without suspended Michael O'Halloran, who begins a two-game ban, but Danny Wilson and Lee Hodson return from injury.
New goalkeeper Jak Alnwick is available after signing from Port Vale on Monday.
But Joe Garner, Jordan Rossiter and Niko Kranjcar remain out for Mark Warburton's side.
For the hosts, Rory Currie is ill, while Andraz Struna and Krystian Nowak are doubts and Faycal Rherras and Arnaud Djoum are on Africa Cup of Nations duty.
Hearts head coach Ian Cathro: "I feel we're in a better position but we have a lot of work ahead of us.
"It's right to say we have had a difficult period but it will be us who resolves that."
Rangers manager Mark Warburton: "We go into the game on the back of a very good performance [at Motherwell], second half especially, and we have to take that belief into the game, recognise the challenge and deliver the performance.
"We are not sure what team we face but we know they will be well organised by Ian [Cathro] and Austin [McPhee, assistant] and we have to expect a very tough challenge."
