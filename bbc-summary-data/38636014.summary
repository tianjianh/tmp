Hawick's Wilton Lodge Park project affected by drainage delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A delay in part of a Â£3.65m park overhaul in the Borders has been blamed on "drainage and design issues".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The completion of a cafe as part of the upgrade of the Wilton Lodge facility in Hawick has been affected.
However, it should still be ready by May this year - along with most of the other major infrastructure on the site.
Gordon Edgar of Scottish Borders Council said that while the delay was "disappointing" the cafe would still open for the "busy summer season".
A new bridge is expected to be put in place next month which will represent a "significant milestone" for the project.
Most of the new facilities will be in place almost a year ahead of the overall project completion date of April 2018.
