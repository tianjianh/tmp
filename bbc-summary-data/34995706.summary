In Thursday's first semi-final Rwanda overcame Sudan 4-2  in their penalty shoot-out and Uganda completed the final line-up by winning their spotkicks duel with Ethiopa 5-3.
Rwanda were forced to come from behind against Sudan, who had Bakri Osman Idriss sent off after only 10 minutes of the match but kept their opponents out and then made the breakthrough in extra-time.
Atahir El Tahir then gave Sudan the lead after 100 minutes but Rwanda levelled through Jean Baptiste Mugiranza 10 minutes later.
And Rwanda clinched victory after Sudan's El Tahir and Mazin Elfalah Ahmed missed their spot-kicks.
Rwanda coach Johnny McKinstry said: "My young team has done the country proud by reaching the final."
The Northern Irishman is also using the tournament to prepare his team for the 2016 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) which will be hosted by Rwanda.
Uganda, the 13-time record winners of the regional tournament, were held to a 0-0 draw with hosts Ethiopia after extra-time.
The Cranes goalkeeper Ismail Watenga saved Gatoch Panom's first penalty in the shootout and his side never surrendered their advantage. Skipper Farouk Miya struck the winning kick.
The two finalists will also take part in the 2016 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) to be hosted by Rwanda.
While Uganda is chasing a record 14th title, Rwanda only won the trophy once in 1999.
