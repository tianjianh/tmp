The seven-time major winner joined Raonic's team in May before the 25-year-old reached his first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, where McEnroe also did punditry for ESPN and the BBC.
McEnroe was seen with Raonic's primary coaches Carlos Moya and Riccardo Piatti just days before news of the parting.
He said he would step down "for Milos' sake, for ESPN and my sake".
McEnroe added: "When the US Open starts on Monday, he's got his people. I'm pulling for him and want him to do well.
"I'd love to see all the guys play their best because I think it's better for tennis. But it's best to sort of separate at this stage. It will just make life easier for everyone."
McEnroe admitted his media commitments "ended up becoming an issue at Wimbledon", but added he was "open to the possibility" of a second coaching stint should Raonic seek it.
The Canadian faces Germany's Dustin Brown in the first round at Flushing Meadows.
