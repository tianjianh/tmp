Julie Pacey, 38, was found dead in the bathroom of her home in Longcliffe Road, Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 26 September 1994 by her teenage daughter.
She had been sexually assaulted and strangled.
Police said DNA evidence, recovered from the scene at the time, could now be used to identify her attacker.
Det Insp Helen Evans, senior investigating officer, said advancements in DNA technology has allowed scientists to come up with an almost complete profile of an individual.
"This means that if we can link that DNA to a person, it is entirely possible that we may have found Julie's murderer," she said.
"The one drawback is that the DNA does not match anyone presently in our databases. For that reason we are asking the public for help and urging them to give us a name."
Mrs Pacey's husband, Andrew, said: "It's 21 years ago now - a long time to be free when you've committed this crime."
"To find and bring to justice the person who murdered Julie after all of these years would, I hope, finally offer some closure to the people who loved and cared for her," Det Insp Evans said.
Detectives are also keen to trace a man who was seen in the area at the time of Mrs Pacey's death and find a BMW parked on the driveway of the family home, next to her Audi.
