Public asked if Dyfed-Powys Police officers should carry guns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A poll is asking the public whether police in mid and west Wales should carry guns while on "everyday duties".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Christopher Salmon is asking for views in an online questionnaire.
At present, 74 officers routinely carry pistols while on everyday tasks.
"I'd like to know if the public want this practice to continue or whether I need to give it further thought," Mr Salmon said.
