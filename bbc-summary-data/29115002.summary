[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man died of a suspected heart attack in Guernsey after a call to emergency services went unanswered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Hamilton, 65, originally from Northamptonshire, was at the KG5 sports ground on 9 July when he collapsed.
Phone records show he had dialled 999 and telecoms records suggest the call was put through, but no ambulance was sent. His body was found the next day.
St John Ambulance and Rescue, the island's only ambulance service, has launched an internal investigation.
It is understood Sure, the telecom company that currently handles calls to emergency services, put the call through to St John.
The ambulance service said it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage in the process.
Mr Hamilton was brought to the island by the Guernsey Cricket Association to work as a groundsman. He was heavily involved with cricket in the island.
Guernsey Police said no further investigations - or an inquest - had been carried out.
The internal investigation at St John is expected to conclude later this month.
