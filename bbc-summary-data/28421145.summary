[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Registers of Scotland (RoS) has announced the winners of its Click Your Croft photography competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Run in association with the Scottish Crofting Federation and the Crofting Commission, the contest set out to explore what this traditional way of life means to crofters in 2014.
Heather Gray, of Shetland, won first prize with her photograph called Hentin Totties, which shows a family of all ages working the land.
She said: "I suppose my main inspiration for the photo is family.
"Seeing the extended family from grannies to toddlers coming together and helping out with the yearly crop - it just makes you smile."
Second prize was awarded to Checking the Sheep with Grandad, submitted by Ria Macdonald.
Taken on the Isle of Lewis, it shows Cormac Sandison with dog Mac checking on pregnant ewes on his grandfather's croft.
In third place was Fiona MacKay's image of haymaking on Lewis, entitled Summer Bales.
John King, of RoS and one of the panel of judges, said: "We received a large number of fantastic photos taken by people of all ages from across Scotland's crofting regions.
"What really comes across in these images is how much crofters love what they do, and how central family still is to this traditional way of life.
"Hentin Totties stood out for its depiction of everyone mucking in and having a great time doing so."
