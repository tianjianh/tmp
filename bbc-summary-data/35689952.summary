[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dundee man jailed for 10 years for catalogue of sexual abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A high-risk sex offender who raped a school girl and tried to rape another victim has been jailed for ten years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A court was told Derek Gall preyed on children during an eight-year catalogue of abuse in Tayside.
A judge ordered Gall to be kept under supervision for a further period of five years upon his release.
Lord Bannatyne told the 36-year-old from Dundee that he would be placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely.
Gall had originally faced a total of 23 charges but was convicted of eight offences committed between 2006 and 2014 following an earlier trial.
He had denied the charges.
Gall indecently assaulted and tried to rape one girl at various addresses in Tayside.
The abuse began in 2006 when he restrained the child and held her down.
Gall raped a second girl after supplying her with alcohol.
Lord Bannatyne told Gall at the High Court in Edinburgh: "You were found guilty of a substantial number of serious offences over a lengthy period of time."
The judge said he believed that Gall's offending had been correctly characterised as "a pattern of sexually abusive behaviour over a substantial length of time".
Lord Bannatyne said Gall had also been assessed as posing a high risk of sexual offending.
Defence counsel Edward Targowski QC said: "As far as mitigation is concerned, there is very little I can say in relation to the charges, given his position at trial."
