Hampshire captain George Bailey is unsure if his side deserve to qualify for the knockout stages of the One-Day Cup after inconsistent results.

Hampshire can still qualify for the quarter-finals if results go their way in Wednesday's last group games.
Bailey struck an unbeaten 145 against Surrey on Sunday but in a losing cause.
"I don't think we've played a great game of one-day cricket yet, but we're breaking some records and the tide should turn at some stage," he said.
Bailey and Kyle Abbott (56) set a Hampshire List A record partnership for the eighth wicket of 152 against any county in the defeat by Surrey.
The game before, James Vince hit a county record 178 against Glamorgan, also in a losing cause.
If Hampshire beat Sussex at home and Surrey lose to Gloucestershire, they could finish in the top three of the South Group.
"I'm not sure we deserve to qualify," Bailey admitted to BBC Radio Solent. "But, that's the nature of the South Group where everyone seems to beat everyone.
"If we don't make it, we'll rue games like the one against Glamorgan (who chased 333 with a ball to spare).
"But if we play well against Sussex, you never know."
