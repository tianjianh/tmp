Extradition plea: Paul and Sandra Dunham in Supreme Court bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple from Northampton who face extradition to the United States have asked to have their case heard at the Supreme Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul and Sandra Dunham "vehemently reject" allegations of fraud and money-laundering while working at a US company.
Last month their bid to avoid extradition was rejected by the High Court.
Their lawyers have now asked permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Mr Dunham, 58, was chief executive and president of Pace, a US company manufacturing soldering irons for the electronics industry.
He was indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money-laundering by a grand jury in Maryland, in December 2011.
Mrs Dunham, 57, is accused of aiding and abetting him.
Mr Dunham said he wanted the Supreme Court to recognise the "improper way the US criminal system has been exploited to cause Sandra and me the greatest personal, emotional and financial hardship imaginable".
The High Court heard the couple were in the US for a decade from 1999 to 2009.
