Woking 2-4 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamar Loza's second-half hat-trick inspired Maidstone to a come-from-behind 4-2 win at Woking which lifted them above their opponents into 19th place in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Delano Sam-York and Jamie Lucas put the home side 2-0 in front in the first half before Loza and Yemi Odubade earned Maidstone victory - and left the Cards a point above the relegation zone.
Maidstone goalkeeper Lee Worgan pulled off a fine save to deny Kane Ferdinand after 12 minutes but a minute later he could do nothing to stop Sam-Yorke's effort putting the home side ahead.
Lucas doubled their lead before Maidstone pulled one back shortly afterwards through a fine strike by Loza.
Maidstone's Jamie Coyle hit the inside of a post before Loza slotted in a second from close range.
He completed his treble after the hosts failed to clear Reece Prestedge's free-kick and Odubade fired in a fourth with seven minutes to go.
