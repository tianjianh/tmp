Plans include a "duty of quality" for health boards and replacing community health councils with stronger bodies for patient voices.

A consultation will now run for the next three months.

Mr Gething said he believed the proposals would "make a real difference" by putting people at the centre of how health and care services are delivered.
"It will also enable health and social care organisations to work together and across boundaries to ensure they deliver the very best care for people across Wales," he added.
