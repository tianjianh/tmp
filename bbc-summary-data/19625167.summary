At least one protester was killed in violent protests in Pakistan and thousands attended an angry rally in the Philippines city of Marawi.
Weapons were fired and police cars torched in the Afghan capital, Kabul.
The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah has said the US faces "very dangerous" repercussions if it allows the full video to be released.

When Hassan Nasrallah suddenly appeared on the podium in person, there was almost a stampede as the crowd of tens of thousands of his supporters surged towards him.
They're used to seeing him at such occasions - but on a big screen via a video link from a secret location.
Nasruallah knows he is under constant threat, especially after the 2006 war. His predecessor, Abbas Musawi, was killed in a pinpoint Israeli air strike in 1992.
His appearance, and the delivery of a full, if brief, 12-minute speech, was a measure of the importance he attaches to what he says is the most serious insult to Islam in living memory.
He had told his supporters to let the world see their anger in their faces, their fists and their slogans.
But there was not a hint of violence or menace in the air, in contrast to disturbances by Sunni militants in Tripoli, north Lebanon, last Friday, when they clashed with police and set fire to American fast food outlets.
In a rare public appearance, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah told a rally in the capital Beirut that the world did not understand the "breadth of the humiliation" caused by the "worst attack ever on Islam".
More than a dozen people have died since last Tuesday in protests sparked by the appearance on Youtube of a trailer for the obscure, poorly made film, which is entitled Innocence of Muslims.
Youtube told the BBC it would not remove the trailer as it was within its guidelines but it had restricted access to the clip in countries where its content was illegal "such as India and Indonesia as well as in Libya and Egypt".
Thousands of people were on the streets of Beirut, waving flags and chanting, "America, hear us - don't insult our Prophet".
Sheikh Nasrallah, the influential leader of Lebanon's Shia Muslim militant group, earlier called for a week of protests - not only against American embassies, but also to press Muslim governments to express their own anger to the US.
At least one protester was killed in Pakistan on Monday as violent demonstrations were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the country's biggest city, Karachi.
Pakistan, as predicted, has blocked access to Youtube, accusing it of failing to remove blasphemous material.
This is clearly an attempt by the authorities to show people they have responded on an emotive issue, the BBC's Aleem Maqbool reports from Islamabad.

In a BBC interview, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the film was "wrong and offensive but also laughable as a piece of film-making".
"What is dangerous and wrong is the reaction to it," said Mr Blair, who now serves as a Middle East peace envoy.
The exact origins of the film are shrouded in mystery, although a man called Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a convicted fraudster living in California has been questioned over his involvement.

The eruption of anger has seen attacks on US consulates, embassies and business interests across the Middle East and north Africa. British, Swiss, German and Dutch properties have also been targeted.
The US ambassador to Libya was among four Americans killed on the day protests first broke out.
Libyan Interior Minister Fawzi Abdul Al has dismissed a claim on Sunday by the president of the national congress that 50 people were arrested in connection with the deaths.
He said only four people had been detained so far, although up to 50 could be under investigation.
