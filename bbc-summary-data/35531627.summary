[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new exhibition is examining the story of the historic Borders ba' games and their links with a similar handball game in France.

It comes ahead of ba' day in Jedburgh on Thursday when the Uppies and Doonies do battle in the town.
It is just one of a number of Borders towns where such contests are staged.
The exhibition, Fraternity: Fellowship of the Ba', is at Jedburgh Royal British Legion from Wednesday until Saturday.
The ba' games - which have taken place for centuries - see competitors fight for possession of a small ball which is hurled from one end of the town to the other.
The exhibition looks at links with the French game of soule and contains photographs by Peter Holme and Olivier Got along with archive material.
The Scots items will form the basis of a permanent collection for use with schools and other local groups in future.
Exhibition organiser Hugh Hornby said there was a reason many of the games were played at this time of year.
"The Shrove Tuesday tradition is very much that it is the one day of the year when ordinary people - particularly young men - have free rein to basically roam through the streets getting up to various kinds of mischief," he said.
"This tradition goes all the way back to at least the Norman conquests in Britain.
"The whole idea, I suppose, is that if there is one day in the year when people are allowed to misbehave then it is expected that for the rest of the year they will behave themselves and not cause too many problems."
