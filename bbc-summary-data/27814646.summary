The fire service was called at about 10:10 BST to the northbound carriageway between junction 8 (Stansted Airport) and junction 9 (Saffron Walden).
There were no passengers on board the Stagecoach bus and the driver was uninjured, the company confirmed.
The fire spread to the embankment but was put out by 11:15. The carriageway was completely closed but has since reopened, the Highways Agency said.
An Essex Fire Service spokesman said when the three crews arrived the double decker bus was "completely alight" and the fire had spread to about 200m (655ft) of the motorway embankment.
A spokeswoman for Stagecoach said: "At around 10am today smoke was detected from one of our vehicles on the M11 heading north near to Saffron Walden.
"The bus was out of service at the time and had no passengers on board. The driver was not injured as a result of the incident.
"The fire service attended, however there has been extensive damage caused to the vehicle. Safety is our absolute priority and we will investigate the cause of this incident as a matter of urgency."
