[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 11-2 in reply to 215, the tourists slipped to 12-5 before being dismissed in only 33.1 overs.
Ravichandran Ashwin took 5-32 and Ravindra Jadeja 4-33 for India, who lead 1-0 in the four-match series.
Although South Africa bowled India out for 173, they were 32-2 at the close in pursuit of 310 for victory.
All 10 wickets fell to spin in South Africa's first innings, and eight in India's second innings, on a pitch described by former England captain Michael Vaughan as "diabolical".
The Proteas, the world's top-ranked Test side, have not lost an away Test series since 2006.
