Officers saw the van plunge into the lake in west Sydney early on Tuesday.
When they stopped to check the van, the driver swam into the man-made reservoir and crouched among weeds with his hood pulled over his head.
The man allegedly threatened the officers, but gave himself up 30 minutes later.
A police boat was being brought to the scene at the time of his surrender.
The man was given a towel and taken to Penrith police station, where he was questioned over the van and the incident.
