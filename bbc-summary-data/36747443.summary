"It's just you against the other person on the other side of the net - except from in doubles [which Reid also won at Wimbledon]- and it's up to you to find a way to beat them," said the Scot.
Reid and fellow Britons Jordanne Whiley and Lucy Shuker have all benefited from the Tennis Foundation's performance programme.
"Since Beijing, when we've had UK Sport funding, we've been able to get a programme that concentrates on our performance to help our players, maximise their potential and compete against the world's best," said Geraint Richards, head of disability player performance.
