[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plan to reinstate 'Constable view' of Salisbury Cathedral

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salisbury Cathedral is planning to reinstate a "John Constable view" of the medieval building which has been "inaccessible for several generations".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a bid to recreate a view painted in 1825, the cathedral wants to open up the grounds of the Cathedral School and relocate its works yard.
The cathedral said the view at the moment was "somewhat blighted" by its yard, a school swimming pool and trees.
A draft report is currently at the consultation phase.
The south side of Salisbury Cathedral has been closed to the public for many years.
As a result, the view shown in Constable's Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds can only be enjoyed from within the grounds of the Cathedral School.
As part of the cathedral's report, the school's playing fields would be opened up to the public and the cathedral's works yard moved to a new workshop.
The report, which sets down projects the cathedral wants to develop over the next five to 10 years, also includes plans to reclaim the Bishop's Palace - currently used by the Cathedral School - to house Magna Carta, cathedral archives and the library.
In an attempt to tackle the "unseemly and confusing" access to the cathedral, the report has recommended closing the Close to "non-essential" traffic and the High Street Gate entrance to all traffic at certain times of day.
An initial consultation with Wiltshire Council, local residents and businesses is currently being carried out.
