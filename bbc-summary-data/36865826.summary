In a statement, James Richardson's family said: "Jim was a loving husband and father and will be hugely missed by all his family."
The 29-year-old was found dead at Forteviot, Perthshire, after going missing on his way home from the festival earlier this month.
His funeral is being held in his home town of Wishaw, North Lanarkshire.
Mr Richardson's family said: "Today, we lay our beloved son, husband, father, brother and uncle to rest.
"He will never be forgotten and will always have a special place in our hearts.
"We would like to say thanks for all the tremendous support we have received from friends, family and the local community, which has been of enormous comfort to all of us at such a difficult time.
"Today, we will pay tribute to the life of James and would ask for our privacy to be respected."
The father-of-three attended the music festival at Strathallan, Perthshire, earlier this month.
He went missing after getting off a bus on the way home and his body was found on 12 July - two days after the festival ended.
The Police Investigation and Review Commissioner is probing how officers responded to the first reports expressing concern about Mr Richardson's welfare.
