Slipknot say they had to deal with "guilt and anger" while making their first studio album since the death of Paul Gray.

The bassist died in 2010 after taking an overdose of prescription medication.
Talking to Zane Lowe on Radio 1, frontman Corey Taylor said they had to deal with the issues surrounding his death before writing new material.
"We started talking about stuff. We talked about that day and what was going through our heads," he said.
"[We talked about] the subsequent days afterwards.
"We started to figure out that we were all on the same page, emotionally, and dealing with guilt and dealing with anger. That led the discussion on the album."
Slipknot release 5; The Gray Chapter next week and Taylor says it was almost like their former bandmate was watching over them during the recording process.
"People can say whatever they want, it felt like Paul's spirit was there because it was a very enjoyable situation," he revealed.
"Whether it was because we were having fun jamming again, it just felt like were doing things right and it felt like we were making amazing music again.
"It just felt good to be making Slipknot music again. There was a positivity that permeated everything but it also felt like there was somebody watching over us.
"It was weird at first. Like I've said numerous times, Paul was the cheerleader.
"He was the guy that got you stoked about the entire process. And without him there, it wasn't daunting, but it was a little like, 'What do we do?'
"But once we started getting into it, it really started to come together."
The band announced a nine-date UK tour earlier this week with Korn for January.
Taylor says fans will definitely have something to look forward to and explained how they came up with the tour name, Prepare For Hell.
"This one was actually pretty quick because there's a track on the album called Be Prepared For Hell," he said.
"So this was a nice way of almost subliminal advertising.
"We've already started building the madness.
"We went to a undisclosed location in Las Vegas and watched all this stuff working. And I was like, 'Really? We're putting people on that? Fair enough'."
Last December the band announced that drummer Joey Jordison had left Slipknot, leaving the band with seven full-time members.
Although Taylor didn't reveal who would be joining the band to replace him, he said they had fun in the studio despite the absence of Paul Gray.
"There's no real set way where we start getting the ball rolling," he told Zane Lowe.
"In this case it was Jim [Root] and Clown who really started putting stuff together. It was pretty fantastic.
"Before we knew it we had 10 or 11 demoed songs. No lyrics or anything. But I'm listening to it going, 'Wow. This is really, really good'.
"The thing that's always kept this band together is the fact that we're always on the same page musically.
"Whether it's experimenting and taking things to the next level, or just descending into the sick depths of heaviness.
"We love making Slipknot music, whatever that music is. Sometimes we hit and miss and sometimes we hit the crap out of it."
