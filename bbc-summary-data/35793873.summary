The husband-and-wife duo, Britain's first semi-finalists since 2008, were beaten 21-13 22-20 in Birmingham.
The Danes, seeded fifth, raced through the first game but the Adcocks showed more attacking intent in the second.
However, they squandered five game points at 20-15, with Pedersen winning seven straight points on her serve.
The Adcocks, who went out in the quarter-finals in both 2014 and 2015, contributed to their own demise with a series of unforced errors.
"We got off to a slow start and didn't impose our style on them," said Chris Adcock.
"But we found our groove and dominated the whole second set. To let five game points go to take it to a decider is really, really hard to take."
Gabby Adcock added: "They are really experienced at the end of games and can reel off points. We're just gutted we didn't take that second set."
