Kidderminster: Colin Gordon says club will not progress with him as permanent coach

Kidderminster Harriers chief executive Colin Gordon says the National League's bottom club will not progress properly off the field if he becomes head coach on a more permanent basis next season.

The 53-year-old has been in temporary control of the first team since January but is not keen to carry on next term.
"I know what I want this club to look like and me as the main man is not what this club needs," Gordon said.
"It's not for me, but I'm not going to make a decision that'll wreck us."
Gordon, the club's major shareholder, is in interim charge for the second time, having first stepped up following Gary Whild's exit in September.
Despite a ringing endorsement from chairman Rod Brown, Gordon has his mind firmly on rebuilding the finances at Aggborough as the club heads towards relegation from the National League.
"I've no interest - me as head coach is not the way this club progresses," he told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"I need to be involved in every aspect of player development and football development.
"We might have to take a step back to move forward and if we're going to compete we need to generate more revenue off the pitch that we can invest into the first team.
"If we go down, it won't be because we're bankrupt or have had points deducted - we're in a great position to go forward."
Easter Monday's defeat by Tranmere Rovers left Harriers 12 points from safety with only six games left to play.
