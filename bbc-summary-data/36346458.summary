French Open: Andy Murray in no hurry to find new coach

World number two Andy Murray says his form means he does not need to appoint a new coach before the French Open.

Murray - who separated from coach Amelie Mauresmo this month - beat Novak Djokovic for the first time on clay last week to win the Italian Open.
Mauresmo has described the Briton as "complex" and suggested his behaviour on court was a factor behind the split.
But the presence of Jamie Delgado in his team means the 29-year-old is in "less of a rush" to replace Mauresmo.
"I'm playing very well so there's no need to make a change a few days before the French," said Murray.
British former player Delgado joined the Scot's set-up in February and his first tournament as sole coach ended with Murray beating world number one Djokovic in Rome.
Murray said he had not spoken to any prospective coaches but was open to the idea of bringing someone new into his team.
"We chatted about it a little bit after Rome, but nothing too in depth," added the Scot.
"Most of my focus - and I think my team's focus - is getting me ready here. I'll obviously chat more to them about it if there's something we think would be able to help. I'm all for that.
"Right now is a difficult time to make a change and, to be honest, why would I?
"There's less rush because Jamie's committed to doing 35 to 40 weeks a year with me and we're going to be working together every week through until Wimbledon, so I have that continuity and consistency, which I didn't have last year with Amelie and Jonas [Bjorkman]."
Murray and Mauresmo announced on 9 May that they had "mutually agreed" to end their partnership after almost two years working together.
In an interview with L'Equipe, Mauresmo, 36, has indicated that Murray's tendency to aim frustration at his support camp left the Frenchwoman with the feeling she "could no longer help him make progress".
"Andy is complex. On a court, he can be the opposite to the way he is in life. That can be disconcerting," she is quoted as saying.
"I had reduced my number of weeks on tour a bit since the last Australian Open and in reality we were spending little time together. It turns out that was a difficult period for him, and one in which I couldn't help him."
Mauresmo added: "I got the feeling we had gone as far as we could professionally."
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:
Even though a lack of time in each other's company was the fundamental reason behind the split, it is clear Mauresmo believes Murray's on-court demeanour was a barrier to future progress.
In an interview with sport360.com in Dubai last year, Murray said: "It's the one thing that I don't like about myself. When it happens, after the match, I'm quite down about it because I am not being good to myself."
He would not be well served by banishing emotion from the court, but at times his constant dialogue with those in the players' box can be detrimental to his chances - and the verbal abuse quite extreme.
Some are able to soak it up and not take it personally, but Mauresmo clearly did not enjoy the experience and admits she chose to sit away from the players' box in Miami because "she no longer wished to be there".
Asked whether he could stick with Delgado, Murray said: "That's possible, for sure.
"I'm always looking to improve, so if there is something that I feel could help me, then for sure I would look into that in terms of another person to help out, and also to give him [Delgado] a break as well from time to time.
"Travelling every single week during the year and every practice week is tough, and it's the beginning of our relationship just now. Normally over time, when you spend so much time with each other, having a little bit of separation can be good, too."
Delgado, whose highest ranking was world number 121, retired from playing in September 2014, aged 37, to focus on coaching Luxembourg's Gilles Muller, whom he guided into the top 40.
"He's pretty calm. He's a relaxed guy. On top of that, he's very, very experienced around the tour. He's played whatever it was, 23 Wimbledons in a row, so he's been around the game a long, long time," said Murray, who will aim to win his first French Open title over the next fortnight.
Murray will play 37-year-old Radek Stepanek in the first round of the French Open, which starts on Sunday, and the draw has been kind to the three-time semi-finalist.
Ivo Karlovic and John Isner - who have never beaten the British number one - are the seeds in his section, as is in-form fifth seed Kei Nishikori.
Nine-time champion Rafael Nadal and top seed Djokovic are on opposite sides of the draw, while his potential semi-final opponent could be defending champion Stan Wawrinka.
Murray's compatriots, Aljaz Bedene and Kyle Edmund, will also face qualifiers - Gerald Melzer of Austria and world number 105 Nikoloz Basilashvili respectively.
Britain's highest-ranked female is world number 22 Johanna Konta, who is competing in the main draw at Roland Garros for the first time.
The 25-year-old reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January and begins her tournament against Germany's Julia Goerges, thirty-eight places below her in the rankings.
"I've got to know her reasonably well. She's a really nice girl and a wonderful player," said the British number one. "It'll be an incredibly tough battle but I'm looking forward to it."
Fellow Britons Heather Watson, Laura Robson and Naomi Broady will face Nicole Gibbs, Andrea Petkovic and Coco Vandeweghe respectively.
Watson, 24, said: "I've played her once before a couple of years ago, so it'll be a very different match now.
"Every match in a Grand Slam is against a tough opponent, so I'm going to have to be ready for that one. I'm feeling great about how I'm playing."
