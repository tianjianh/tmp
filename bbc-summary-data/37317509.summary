Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger hopes midfielder Jack Wilshere will spend the rest of his career at the club.

England international Wilshere, 24, is currently on a season-long loan at fellow Premier League side Bournemouth.
Wilshere, a product of Arsenal's youth system, made his debut in 2008 aged 16, but played only three games for the club due to injuries last season.
"He is a world-class player, he doesn't have to show me his quality," said Wenger.
"I hope personally that he stays his whole career here."
Wenger said it was Wilshere who expressed concern that he would not feature for Arsenal on a regular basis this season after returning to fitness.
"We had a chat together," added the Frenchman. "He felt ready to play.
"I couldn't guarantee that and it looked logical to give him time - the challenge is to play the games."
Bournemouth are seeking their first Premier League win of the season as they host West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, with Wilshere expected to feature.
