Norwich head coach Daniel Farke says he sees similarities between the Canaries and former club Borussia Dortmund.

The 40-year-old German coached Dortmund's reserve team before moving to Carrow Road on Thursday.
"The atmosphere at [Dortmund] is one that always stays together, especially in difficult phases of the season," Farke told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"I get the same feeling for this club. All the guys are here with so much emotion and are there for the club."
Farke comes to a side that finished eighth in the Championship table this season, 10 points outside the play-off places.
He follows a path to England that Huddersfield manager David Wagner took, having replaced the Terriers boss at Dortmund's second team in 2015.
Norwich's sporting director Stuart Webber was part of the Terriers' backroom team when Wagner joined.
Farke has become Norwich's first foreign manager and, having been linked with the managerial vacancy at Bundesliga club Darmstadt, Webber said Farke has taken a risk joining the Canaries.
"People probably forget it's just a big a risk for Daniel as it is for us," said Webber.
"He's left one of the best clubs in the world who were desperate to keep him. He's turned down opportunities in Bundesliga and Bundesliga II in the last six months,
"For him it's also a big risk and that's why we need to give him the most support we can to make it work for all parties."
