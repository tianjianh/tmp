The Welshwoman, third in the standings ahead of the race, was penalised for not placing her wetsuit in the box.
But the 24-year-old then ran superbly, finishing in 2:01.33 to end the series on 4220 points.
Fellow Briton Jodie Stimpson was second in the overall standings after finishing fourth in Hyde Park.

Germany's Anne Haug, who was also in contention for the title before the race, had to settle for bronze in the series standings while the favourite, American Gwen Jorgensen, crashed on her bike.
"I'm speechless," said Swansea-born Stanford, who is the first woman to win the under-23 and senior world titles in successive seasons.
"I haven't slept for three weeks. Everyone was talking about it. I just wanted to put on a good show, and all my friends and family are here so I'm delighted I could do it for them.
"I went off really hard in the run, trying to make up that gap straight away and on the sidelines I was hearing '25 seconds' so I thought 'I've got to take it now'."
Stanford emulates compatriots Helen Jenkins and Leanda Cave, who won the title in 2011 and 2002 respectively, and her victory on the London 2012 course concludes a remarkable year.
She has enjoyed podium finishes on five occasions in 2013, recovering from a broken arm - sustained during a heavy fall in Hamburg in July - to finish second in Stockholm five weeks later.
Stanford also had to overcome difficulties in London when she had trouble putting on her helmet during the transition between swim and cycle and failed to place her wetsuit in the box in her haste to get away.
But she built a commanding lead during the 10km run and was able to emerge ahead of the chasing pack after taking her penalty early on the final lap.
Ireland's Aileen Reid outsprinted Australia's Emma Moffatt to cross the line in second place.
