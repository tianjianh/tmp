Glasgow Warriors: European game v Racing moved to Kilmarnock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors have switched their final European Champions Cup match against Racing 92 to Kilmarnock FC's Rugby Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Warriors' Scotstoun pitch was deemed unplayable for their Pro12 game against Edinburgh on 2 January, resulting in a switch to Murrayfield.
The club say there is a "high risk" of a similar waterlogged surface for the Racing fixture on 23 January.
Glasgow travel to Northampton for their penultimate pool game on Sunday.
Gregor Townsend's side need to win that match and the clash with a Racing side featuring World Cup winner Dan Carter to stand any chance of progressing to the quarter-finals. They lost the reverse fixture 34-10 in Paris.
Rugby Park, which has an all-seated 18,128 capacity, hosted Scotland's autumn Test win over Tonga in 2014.
Around 6,650 tickets have already been sold for the clash with the Top 14 leaders, and Glasgow will make an additional 7,500 match tickets available
The club insist that following "unprecedented rainfall and flooding over the past few weeks", the decision to move the match will give the Scotstoun pitch the best chance of recovering ahead of their next scheduled home game against Munster on 20 February.
