[SN]TITLE[SN]
Review of Suzanne Pilley murder conviction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Gilroy, the man convicted of killing Edinburgh office worker, Suzanne Pilley in 2012, is to have his murder conviction reviewed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission is expected to take up to eight months to investigate the case.
Gilroy failed to have his case looked at by The Supreme Court in London after losing an appeal in Edinburgh.
Suzanne Pilley vanished on her way to work in May 2010. Her body has never been found.
Gilroy was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of her murder but continues to protest his innocence.
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission was set up to investigate possible miscarriages of justice.
Only a small number are referred back to the High Court.
Ms Pilley, who had previously had an affair with married Gilroy, had set off on her usual journey to work in Edinburgh city centre but never arrived.
The jury in Gilroy's trial heard he was driven by jealousy, maintained a front of normality and embarked on a series of acts to cover up his crime.
He took 38-year-old Ms Pilley's body to a secret grave, believed to be in remote Argyll.
The case made legal history when Gilroy became the first convicted killer to have his sentencing filmed for British TV.
Judge Lord Bracadale told him when he was convicted that he hoped he would one day say where he abandoned the victim's body.
