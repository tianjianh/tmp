Traffic between Scotland and England faces "significant" disruption this weekend with the complete closure of a busy section of the M74 motorway.

North and southbound carriageways will be closed between J4 Maryville and J5 Raith from 20:00 on Friday 18 November to 06:00 on Monday 21 November.
It is for the safe demolition of Bothwellpark Road Bridge near Hamilton.
The work is part of an ongoing Â£500m works programme to improve Scotland's motorway network.
Graeme Reid, Transport Scotland project manager for the M8, M73, M74 Motorway Improvements Project, said the bridge's inclined pier supports added extra challenges but the team would be working around the clock to get the demolition completed on schedule.
He said: "This is the most significant road closure we have implemented as part of the works and we are anticipating major delays on all approaches, the surrounding roads and the main diversion route.
"We are advising road users to plan their journey, avoid the area and surrounding local roads and, if possible, to use alternative modes of transport for the weekend."
The weekend closure will result in no access from the M73 to the M74 southbound at J4 Maryville or to the M74 northbound at J5 Raith.
Signed diversion routes will be in place via the A725, A8 and the M73, although Transport Scotland is warning road users to expect major delays on all surrounding routes.
Motorists will continue to have access to the M74 southbound at J5 Raith and the M74 northbound at J4 Maryville and J3A Daldowie.
However, there will be no access to Bothwell Services from the M74 southbound.
The next available service area is the M74 southbound at J11 Happendon and J13 Abington.
Ch Insp David McKenzie, of Police Scotland,  said a lot of planning had gone into the diversionary route.
He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: "That's the main thing so that motorists who were going to be on the M74 are going to be diverted off onto well-signed and managed diversionary routes.
"The policing operation around that is to make sure that diversionary route has adequate patrols and police response so we can deal with any incidents that happen there."
In a bid to reduce congestion on alternative routes, South Lanarkshire Council will put in place parking restrictions on a short section of Main Street, Bothwell, for the duration of the weekend closure.
ScotRail will also provide extra capacity on trains on Lanarkshire railway services throughout the weekend.
