[SN]TITLE[SN]
Irish government to buy 1916 Rising site in Dublin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government in the Republic of Ireland is to acquire the site of the final headquarters of the 1916 Easter Rising leaders before their surrender.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Numbers 14 to 17 Moore Street in Dublin were declared a national monument by the Irish government in 2007.
One of the buildings - number 16 - was used by the leaders of the 1916 uprising in the Irish capital.
It saw republicans take over a number of buildings in Dublin as part of an insurrection against British rule.
British troops put down the uprising and many of the ringleaders were executed.
It is planned to develop the buildings as a commemorative centre.
The site was the location of the final council of war of the leaders of the 1916 uprising, and is where the decision to surrender was made.
The buildings were also used by 1916 rebels as they tried to break out through British lines.
The Irish minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht Heather Humphreys brought the proposal to cabinet this morning.
The site had been the subject of a proposed land swap deal, which was rejected by Dublin City Council last November.
Relatives of the 1916 leaders have said they want the site and surrounding area preserved as a battlefield site.
