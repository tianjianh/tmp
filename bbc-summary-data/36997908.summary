The unnamed man was left stranded on Townshend Island, off the coast of Queensland, for three days after the crocodile sank its teeth into his boat.
He told authorities he fended off the animal before paddling to the island, where he stayed for three days.
He was rescued by helicopter on 6 August after activating a locator beacon.
"He was very fortunate," a spokeswoman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority told AFP.
"It didn't pierce the kayak. He said he was running on adrenaline [to get to the island]."
The man was prevented from leaving the island by bad weather and a low tide. He activated his rescue beacon after running out of provisions.
Saltwater crocodiles are the world's largest living reptiles. They have become more common in Australia since becoming a protected species in 1971.
