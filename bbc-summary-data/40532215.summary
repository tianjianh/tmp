Mylo Johnstone was with friends at the site off Wyther Lane, Kirkstall, Leeds on Thursday at 20:30 BST when he fell onto the building's concrete floor.
Paramedics gave emergency treatment but he died at the scene.
Two boys were seriously hurt in similar incidents in the city in recent weeks, prompting police to warn children against entering abandoned buildings.
Det Insp Phil Jackson, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "I think they were exploring and being mischievous, there was a group of 14-year-old boys and unfortunately Mylo Johnstone fell to his death.
"While we are still carrying out inquiries into this incident, every indication is that this has been a tragedy with no suspicious circumstances."
Officers have carried out forensic examinations at the scene, with Leeds City Council and the Health and Safety Executive also involved in the investigation.
Tribute messages left at the gates outside the warehouse complex described Mylo as a "lovely lad" who would be "sorely missed".
On 20 June, a 12-year-old boy was injured at a disused factory in Modder Avenue, Armley. A 13-year-old boy was hurt at a derelict building in Ninelands Lane, Garforth, on 28 May.
"We are obviously coming up the school holidays and clearly there is potential for young people to be tempted to try to explore abandoned sites," Det Insp Jackson said.
"We would ask that they think very carefully about the dangers this involves, as has been starkly illustrated by these incidents, and that they consider the consequences that could have on their lives and the lives of their families."
He added: "I know they might be really interesting and intriguing to look through, but some of these buildings are death traps."
