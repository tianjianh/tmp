'Dozing' driver killed friends at Plymouth bus stop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A grandmother has been convicted of killing two women after she "dozed" off at the wheel of her car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Teresa Sant, 58, was found guilty of causing the deaths by dangerous driving of the friends in Plymouth last May.
The city's crown court heard she ploughed into Victoria Hodge, 42, and Marie-Helene Gieblen, 60, in a car she had bought just four days earlier.
The victims had got off a bus in Torr Lane and were saying their goodbyes when they were killed.

Plymouth Crown Court heard that Sant had told police she had dozed off at the wheel before, once on a trip while with her husband and at other times when waiting at traffic lights.
However, she had not told her GP or the DVLA about these episodes.
Jason Beal, prosecuting, said Sant crossed into the opposite lane and mounted the kerb and pavement.
He said she drove along the pavement for "some metres".
"As she did so she ran over two women who were standing on the pavement having got off the bus.
"Both of those women died from injuries sustained from being run over by Mrs Sant," he said.
Sant told police: "I think I dozed. I heard a bang. I think I just panicked.
"I tried to brake and slipped off the brake on to the accelerator. I only had the car since Sunday."
The 58-year-old was bailed for sentencing on Wednesday.
