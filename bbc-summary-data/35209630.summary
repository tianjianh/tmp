The Met Office has issued amber "be prepared" warnings of rain for much of north east and central Scotland on Saturday and Sunday.
The areas were among the worst affected by Storm Frank on Wednesday.
Two people have died in separate incidents in fast-flowing rivers in northern Scotland since the storm hit.
Police said the body of a kayaker missing during the storms had been recovered from the River Findhorn in Moray.
And a 36-year-old canoeist died after falling into the River Garry near Invergarry, south of Loch Ness, on Thursday afternoon.
The amber alert covers Grampian, Tayside, central Scotland and Fife from noon on Saturday until 15:00 on Monday.
Yellow "be aware" warnings have also been issued for Wales, Northern Ireland and south west England on Saturday and Sunday.
And several Environment Agency (EA) flood warnings remain in place for parts of the Midlands, North East, North West and Wales.
The Met Office said the rain over the weekend was "not expected to be as intense as recently", but warned that some areas of Scotland could see as much as 20cm (8in) over the weekend and into Monday.
It added: "Given the saturated nature of the ground there is a greater risk of surface water and river flooding that might normally be expected.
"Be prepared for the likelihood of both surface and river flooding, as well as some local disruption to transport."
The Met Office has also warned of gale or severe gale force south-easterly winds which are likely to result in stormy seas and coastal overtopping along the east coast and in the Northern Isles.
Wednesday's heavy rain and gale-force winds left many people stranded, in temporary accommodation and without electricity, and also prompted the most severe "danger to life" flood warnings to be issued.
Scottish Power Energy Networks said that electricity supplies had now been restored to customers affected in the Springholm, Dalbeattie and Castle Douglas areas.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said that New Year's Day would bring some respite, but heavy and persistent rain may lead to a flood risk in Angus, Tayside and southern Aberdeenshire on Saturday.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Environment Minister Aileen McLeod visited Newton Stewart in Dumfries and Galloway on Thursday to view the damage to shops and businesses affected by flooding.
Ms McLeod said the Scottish government was monitoring the latest weather warnings and working with other agencies to ensure people and businesses were as prepared as possible for the impact of the weather and any potential flooding.
She added: "I would encourage everyone to monitor Sepa's Floodline website for the latest flood information and to sign up to receive Floodline warnings direct to their phone."
