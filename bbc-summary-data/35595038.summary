[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire seamer Josh Shaw has joined County Championship Division Two club Gloucestershire on a season-long loan.

Shaw made his first two appearances for Yorkshire in last season's T20 Blast, but has yet to take a wicket.
The 20-year-old took 11 wickets at an average of 36.27 in the four-day format Second Eleven Championship last year.
"He's a bowler of great potential and will add competition to our squad," Gloucestershire head coach Richard Dawson told the club website.
"Yorkshire and [director of cricket] Martyn Moxon have been brilliant in allowing him to join up with us so early in the year giving him an opportunity to get settled with the squad before the season."
