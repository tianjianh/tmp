[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Henry de Jesus Lopez Londono, known as Mi Sangre (My Blood), is believed to be the head of the Urabenos gang, which operates in northern Colombia.
He was arrested in Argentina in 2012 and is wanted in the US on drug smuggling and conspiracy charges.
Police said he held passports from seven countries to evade capture.
Argentine officials said that Mr Lopez Londono, 45, was taken by helicopter from a prison near the Argentine capital Buenos Aires to a nearby airport where he was put on a plane to the US on Thursday.
Interpol agents, US marshals and Argentine police were all involved in the high security operation.
Lawyers for Mr Lopez Londono, a former member of a right-wing paramilitary group, have argued that his life would be in danger in the US.
Argentine police said he had entered the country with a false passport and had posed as a Venezuelan businessman, travelling for work.
