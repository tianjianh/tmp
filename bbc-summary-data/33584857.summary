Everton manager Roberto Martinez has criticised Chelsea for publicising their bid for defender John Stones.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho confirmed his interest in the 21-year-old England international, saying: "We made a bid because we like the player."
The Toffees are reported to have rejected the Â£20m offer from the Premier League champions.
"There is the disappointment of a club making a statement to the press and making it openly," said Martinez.
Speaking after his side's Asia Trophy final 3-1 defeat by Arsenal, Martinez added: "I don't think we'd do it and speak about a player. John Stones is an Everton player, full stop.
"We are not a selling club. We are not a club that needs to be worried about what other clubs put through the press."
Stones, who made 23 Premier League appearances last season, still has four years to run on his current Everton deal.
But Mourinho made no apologises for his approach for the player, telling Sky Sports: "When the transfer window is open, every club and player is open to bids.
"Bids come for our players and we make bids for other players. The process can be so simple.
"I would advise Roberto Martinez to do the same thing I do. If I don't want to accept any offer, I say 'I don't accept any offer'. He can make it very, very easy."
