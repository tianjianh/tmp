The firm will receive Â£7.3m from Scottish Enterprise as part of a research and development grant - the country's largest ever grant of this type.
The money will go to its low carbon vehicles programme, which is part of the plans to double turnover by 2020.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is visiting the firm on Monday.
ADL is the UK's biggest bus manufacturer, employing 2,500 globally including more than 1,000 staff at its base at Larbert, near Falkirk.
Its low carbon project aims to take advantage of the growing global demand for hybrid and electric buses
Ahead of her visit, Ms Sturgeon said the company was "a true Scottish success story".
She added: "This new grant funding, the highest ever research and development award by Scottish Enterprise, will create 101 new jobs and secure a further 126 jobs in ADL's low carbon vehicles project.
"The project is integral to ADL's growth and export strategy to capture more of the increasing global demand for environmentally friendly buses.
"We'll continue to work with manufacturers like ADL to innovate and expand and we'll set out further measures to grow the Scottish economy later this week."
