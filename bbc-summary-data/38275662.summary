Beckham in a Barca shirt, Eusebio, Bobby Moore and Gazza: When you met the stars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Who knew that a few years down the line this fresh-faced youngster in a Barcelona shirt would be winning La Liga with arch rivals Real Madrid?

When BBC Radio 5 live's Danny Baker Show asked for your tales of meeting footballers as a baby on Saturday morning, we were deluged with some great shots from days gone by.
Childhood memories flooded back. Nydianne sent in this one of future England captain David Beckham alongside then Manchester United team-mates Chris Casper, Ben Thornley and Gary Neville holidaying in Malta.
A picture with Beckham was flavour of the month for much of the 1990s - and beyond. And Sam Daniels' parents were so keen they took him down to what looks like United's old training ground in Salford to meet a pair of famous number sevens.
There's a theme developing with England captains.
Here's Alan Shearer dressed like a TV detective meeting reader @CreditfluxJon, alongside Ian Wright and Kevin Moran - the first player to be sent off in an FA Cup final.
But Andy Kotas wins hands down when it comes to England skippers - he had a training session with World Cup winners Bobby Moore and Alan Ball at Butlin's. There's a summer camp that would never happen now.
Meeting an England player during a major tournament is a good effort - and while reader ZodeQ was not a child at the time we'll let this one slide. He met Gazza during the 1990 World Cup. He says: "Sir Bobby gave them the day off and they came to our hotel for a beer and pizza!"
They should have been practising penalties...
It's unlikely, but you can imagine meeting an England captain somewhere down the line.
You don't picture many Brazilian World Cup winners at Cheadle Town for the day though...
Another youngster in a Barca shirt, here's Pearson with Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola in Sardinia during World Cup 1998, "a few days before the Italy v France quarter-final."
We'll excuse the quality of Jacob Lovelace's picture because of the quality of player - Real Madrid manager and star of that 1998 World Cup Zinedine Zidane shared their hotel.
Terry met Everton boss Ronald Koeman when Barcelona played a friendly with Wolves back in the early 1990s...
...and as this picture from Saturday morning shows, the Dutch legend has barely aged a day!
And we perhaps saved the best till last, as former Arsenal goalkeeper and BBC and ITV sport anchor Bob Wilson's son got in touch with this picture.
A family holiday while dad Bob recovered from injury, a year after winning the league and FA Cup double with the Gunners. Cruyff had just won the second of three consecutive European Cups with Ajax and Eusebio had just won one of his 11 league titles with Benfica. Quite the collection.
