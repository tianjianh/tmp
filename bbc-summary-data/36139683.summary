A 20-year-old man has been jailed for life after being found guilty of murdering a teenager he would not let in to his party.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jemal Williams, of Berkeley Gardens, Enfield, must serve a minimum of 24 years for stabbing Shaquan Sammy-Plummer, 17, in the chest.
Williams was having a party when Shaquan arrived. He had been invited by the boyfriend of Williams's sister.
The defendant refused him entry but demanded drinks be handed over.
The Old Bailey heard that when Shaquan refused, Williams chased and stabbed him.
The victim, who was from Islington, died at the Royal London Hospital a few hours later.
Williams fled the scene but handed himself in to police on 9 February 2015.
Det Ch Insp Jamie Piscopo, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command unit, said: "The death of Shaquan was a meaningless tragedy.
"Even when he was turned away from the party, he made no fuss and was in the process of leaving when Williams decided he needed to teach him a lesson."
He described the investigation as being complex due to the "wall of silence" by people too scared to come forward.
