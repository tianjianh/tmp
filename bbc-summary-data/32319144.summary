Lancashire left-arm spinner Simon Kerrigan is hoping to use the international experience of new cricket director Ashley Giles this season.

Kerrigan, 25, conceded 53 runs from eight overs in his only England Test appearance, against Australia in 2013.
Giles, a former left-arm spinner, took 143 wickets in his England Test career.
"It can't do any harm having someone like Ashley in charge for me and the other spinners, passing down his knowledge," said Kerrigan.
He told BBC Radio Lancashire: "So far he's been quite hands off and I'm sure during the season I'll be able to pick his brains."
Former England limited over coach Giles was appointed cricket director and head coach at Old Trafford last October, after the Red Rose were relegated to Division Two.
Lancashire are looking for an immediate promotion this season and have brought in South African batsman Alviro Petersen and Australian bowlers Peter Siddle and James Faulkner.
"I had the option to maybe go to Australia or South Africa in the winter," added Kerrigan. "But I thought it would be good to have a little bit of a break and then work with Ashley and the rest of the lads in the indoor school.
"He's (Giles) quite relaxed and lets the lads get on with it. He wants it to be player-led but obviously has his own input when something needs highlighting.
"If you look at his record at Warwickshire they were really successful under him, so I think he'll be great to have around."
