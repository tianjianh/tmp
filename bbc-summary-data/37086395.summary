Estate agent George Low, 22, from Kent, died from a stab wound to the neck during a week's holiday in Ayia Napa.
His friend, Ben Barker, also 22, suffered four knife wounds to his back during the street attack in the early hours of Sunday.
Mr Low's mother, Helen, 47, from Dartford, said the pair had been due to fly home later the same day.
"We're just heartbroken," said Mrs Low, a community carer.
"We cannot believe something like this could happen to our son. We're just struggling.
"He loved it over there and everybody loved him.
"Nobody could say anything bad about George."
Mrs Low said she and her postman husband Martyn, 55, and their children Wesley, Laura, Oliver and Millie were unclear about the circumstances that led to her son's death.
Her son had spent two previous seasons in the resort as a club rep and manager, and was last there in June celebrating his birthday.
"We're just so numb," she said.
"He wasn't an aggressive person. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time."
Relatives are now planning to fly out to Ayia Napa to bring Mr Low's body back to the UK.
"We hope they catch whoever was responsible," his mother said.
The Foreign Office has said it is supporting Mr Low's family, and is remaining in contact with the authorities in Cyprus.
Famagusta District Assistant Police Chief Georgios Economou has said witnesses described the two stabbing suspects as appearing to be foreign nationals.
He said investigators tracked some of the suspects' movements through CCTV cameras and that the authorities at all airports, ports and crossing points had been warned to lookout for the suspects.
