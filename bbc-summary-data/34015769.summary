The 23-year-old has featured in every league game since joining from the Premier League side on a one-month loan, along with Jonjoe Kenny.
The Portugal Under-21 international started his career at Benfica before moving to the Toffees in 2012.
"Cisco has been a revelation since he's arrived," Latics manager Gary Caldwell told his club's website.
