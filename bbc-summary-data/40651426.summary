Women's Euro 2017: England 6-0 Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jodie Taylor scored a hat-trick as England produced the most convincing performance of Euro 2017 so far to thrash arch-rivals Scotland.

The Arsenal Ladies forward, who was ignored by former boss Hope Powell and had an injury-hit 2015 World Cup, made her mark in her first European Championship with two first-half goals, and added a lobbed third before she was substituted before the hour.
The Merseysider, the first senior England women's player to score a hat-trick in a major tournament, latched on to Fran Kirby's flick to open the scoring, then tucked in from a tight angle following a goalmouth scramble.
Ellen White scored a seventh goal in nine games when she followed up Jill Scott's strike against the bar to make it 3-0 before half-time and, following Taylor's third, Jordan Nobbs' volley and Toni Duggan's injury-time header completed the rout.
After a bright start, Scotland - who are making their debut at a major tournament and have several part-time players - were limited to chances from set-pieces.
They were outclassed by a superior England side who, at fifth in the world rankings, are 16 places above Anna Signeul's team and lived up to their status as one of the favourites for the tournament following their third-place finish at the World Cup two years ago.
In Group D's earlier game, Spain beat Portugal 2-0. England face the Spaniards on Sunday at 19:45 BST, after Scotland play Portugal at 17:00 BST.
Taylor's path to the England team has been a meandering one.
She was not picked by Powell, then turned down a chance to play for her country in 2010 because she "needed a break" from the game.
Mark Sampson gave Taylor her debut at the age of 28 in 2014, and though she made the 2015 World Cup squad, she was still struggling with a knee injury and only scored in the quarter-final win over Canada.
After further injury problems since signing for Arsenal last year, the 31-year old has finally found her fitness, and looked sharp in an England team who have been through a gruelling fitness regime in preparation for the tournament.
Scotland looked uncharacteristically exposed for England's opener, when they were sliced open by Kirby's flick, but they were out-muscled and out-run by a team that kept possession well and were quicker to loose balls.
Sampson claimed before the tournament that England would be the "fittest team" at Euro 2017, with performance coaches saying the squad's overall conditioning had improved by 23% in less than a year. It looked a justified claim.
From the start, Nobbs was energetic on the right side, and worked well with Jade Moore and Scott as the midfield three took control. With full-backs Lucy Bronze and Demi Stokes aiming to get forward at every opportunity, the Scottish defence lacked protection.
For the second goal, Scott reacted quickest to a corner and when her shot was cleared off the line, Taylor expertly converted from a tight angle.
Likewise, when Scott hit the bar from 25 yards, White beat Ifeoma Dieke and Vaila Barsley to score. Taylor was then quickest to react to White's flick-on to lob in for her second England hat-trick.
Scotland skipper Gemma Fay, earning her 202nd cap, said this would be the game of her career, after such a long wait to play in a major tournament.
Signeul's team have twice lost in the play-offs, and they were hamstrung by injuries to key players Kim Little and Jennifer Beattie, who will not feature in this tournament.
Despite a determined start in front of their vocal supporters, with striker Jane Ross almost troubling Manchester City team-mate Karen Bardsley in the first minute, their chances were restricted, although substitute Lana Clelland did hit the side-netting with a good second-half opportunity.
In truth, the scoreline could have been worse, but after Nobbs got a deserved goal for all her hard work and Duggan nodded in late on, Scotland were well beaten by a team with better resources and more full-time professionals.
They will hope they can bounce back against Portugal.
Former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis on BBC Radio 5 live:
A convincing win for England and a dominant overall performance. They will be a force to be reckoned with. They would have expected it but doing it out there is a different thing. It will feel fabulous.
The girls have said how hard they have worked physically and we saw that. Boss Mark Sampson was clever with his substitutions and that breeds confidence. England looked another level. They came out on to the pitch and knew they were going to win. They had visualised this moment, having worked so hard in the build-up.
Jodie Taylor is hungry for success in this wonderful set-up. She spent so long in exile under Hope Powell for whatever reason but it spurred her on. It has shaped her as a person.
Scotland played some wonderful, one and two-touch football in the England half and opened them up at times. Sampson will be happy but there will be details he knows his team can improve, such as switching off by conceding yellow cards, those type of things he will want to work on.
Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 live:
England were the better side and they scored some quality goals. They have creativity, strength and power, miles ahead of Scotland. The Scots worked hard and probably did not deserve to lose 6-0. They have to get up again, fight and be brave. England can win this tournament.
There is no way any player in the tournament can stop England's Lucy Bronze, she was spectacular.
Scotland made chances, they should be proud of the effort they have put in and deserved a goal in the second half. Tonight though, they were too easily beaten in the middle of their defence. The downside is the goal difference. If it comes to the last game, that could count badly against them.
You need to have all your best players out on the park and Scotland cannot seem to cope when they have a couple of players out. I did not see any Scotland players who did not give it their all.
