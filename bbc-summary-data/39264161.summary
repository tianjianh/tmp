Abertawe Bro Morgannwg hospital staff pay rise after strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staff in the sterilisation and disinfection units at some south Wales hospitals are set for a pay rise following strike action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board has agreed to boost pay rates by up to Â£1,900 for workers at Morriston, Neath Port Talbot and Princess of Wales hospitals.
Unison said it showed what "people power can achieve".
The health board has been contacted for comment.
It follows a day of strike action in January, with staff calling for "pay parity with colleagues doing the same job in other hospitals in Wales".
Unison said staff were worse off by between Â£466 and Â£1,879 each year, depending on their length of service in the post.
A second strike planned for February was called off to allow "further discussion of the health board's latest offer".
Mark Turner, Unison organiser for the health board, said: "These healthcare workers just wanted to be paid what they deserve.
"We were able to show that they were paid far less than peers doing exactly the same job with the same responsibilities elsewhere in Wales."
