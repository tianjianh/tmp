[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman told a court of her desperate bid to protect her unborn baby as her ex-boyfriend stamped on her because she refused to have an abortion.

Malorie Bantala, 22, was eight months pregnant when, it is claimed, Kevin Wilson and a teenager ambushed her outside her Peckham home on June 15.
She suffered life-threatening internal bleeding and a fractured hand. The baby boy was delivered stillborn.
At the Old Bailey, Mr Wilson and the 17-year-old deny child destruction.
Mr Wilson of Longfield Estate, Bermondsey, and the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also deny causing grievous bodily harm.
Giving evidence in court, the Marks and Spencer shop assistant said how her then boyfriend and his alleged accomplice emerged from bushes outside her flat disguised in motobike helmets and scarves pulled up to their eyes.
But she said despite their disguises "something clicked in my mind" and she knew it was Kevin, from his posture, build, clothes and trainers.
Miss Bantala said: "Kevin proceeded to kick my stomach, probably three or four times, and then he stamped on my stomach twice.
"By then I had screamed 'Kevin' for him to stop but he continued to kick my stomach. They were harsh kicks.
"My instincts were to put my right hand on my stomach. I broke two fingers because I was trying to protect my son."
Miss Bantala told jurors the other male was behind her and he stepped over to deliver a stamp to her belly too.
Earlier, Miss Bantala said in the months prior to the attack Mr Wilson had repeatedly tried to persuade her to have an abortion.
She said a relationship between them in 2011 had fizzled out because he blew "hot and cold" but she had turned to him in November 2014 following the death of her young nephew.
She said she was  "shocked and scared" to learn she was pregnant following their meet-up.
"I had just watched my nephew's mum grieve for her son. To have an abortion would be the worst thing to do", she said.
She said after initial uncertainty she decided to keep the baby and told Mr Wilson, but he maintained he did not want to be involved and arranged an appointment at an abortion clinic.
She said: "He called me selfish, he called me a bitch. It was a roller coaster. It ended with him saying 'I'm going to commit suicide and take a picture of that so I'm going to inflict the same pain you are inflicting on me'."
They met up once more and Mr Wilson told her he would be moving to Ghana for a job.
The trial continues.
