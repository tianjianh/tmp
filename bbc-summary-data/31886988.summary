Conner Marshall, 18, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, died four days after being found critically injured at Trecco Bay Caravan Park, Porthcawl.
A man from Caerphilly will now appear at Bridgend Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Det Supt Paul Hurley from South Wales Police added: "I would like to reassure residents and visitors to Porthcawl and Trecco Bay caravan park that this appears to be an isolated incident on a well-managed site.
"Parkdean Trecco Bay Management are continuing to work closely with South Wales Police and I would like to thank both Parkdean and the local community for their support and assistance.
"Our thoughts are with Conner's family and all those affected by this tragic incident - and we are continuing to support his family with specially trained officers."
A family tribute described the teenager as "a unique, caring and compassionate young man with a warm, infectious smile complete with a cheeky wink".
