Scotland's Fraser Brown has been cited for his dangerous tackle on Elliot Daly in the Six Nations defeat by England.

Hooker Brown was sin-binned for his challenge in the 61-21 loss on Saturday but now faces a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday to review the incident.
He could now be banned against Italy and forwards coach Jonathan Humphreys said: "We're obviously going to take contingencies in case that happens.
"But we're fairly hopeful that the right punishment was on the field."
Should the disciplinary committee decide Brown should have had a red card for the tip tackle, a suspension would rule the Glasgow Warriors out of Scotland's closing Six Nations match in Edinburgh on Saturday.
French referee Mathieu Raynal chose to sin-bin Brown for the second-minute tackle on Daly after consultation with television match official (TMO) Ben Skeen.
"He didn't land on his neck, so we're hopeful, when they review it, they'll see that and hopefully Fraser will be available for us," said Humphreys.
England retained their Six Nations title courtesy of their seven-try hammering of Scotland in London and also equalled New Zealand's world-record run of 18 consecutive victories.
The Scots have already been hit with injuries to key players, with Mark Bennett ruled out for the Italy match and six others being assessed for injuries.
Scotland coach Vern Cotter also faces the task of lifting his players after a defeat that could be as bruising psychologically as it was physically.
"We moved on pretty quickly after the game," insisted his forwards coach. "It's such a short turnaround that we really have to focus on what's coming next.
"There's not a lot of benefit in going back over that game.
"We'll obviously look at what we can do better and what we can learn going into this week, but it's certainly a case of we've had a bad day, let's move on."
Humphreys backed Scotland's players to bounce back from their Twickenham experience against Italy.
"This group has been through a helluva lot together and we've came out of adversity many times," he said.
"We hope those experiences that we've shared over the last three years will help us in preparation for what's going to be a tough game."
It will be Cotter's final game before Glasgow's Gregor Townsend takes over as national coach, but Humphreys played down suggestions that giving the New Zealander a winning send-off would be extra motivation.
"As a group, we really want to park that and we'll think about that after the game," he added.
"This is about focusing on the job. We want to represent ourselves in the right manner."
