D'Andrea, of Holloway Head, Birmingham, also pleaded guilty to criminal damage after punching a hole in the wall of a property during an argument.
Two further counts of common assault on D'Andrea's partner were ordered to lie on his file.
He was also ordered to pay Â£300 in compensation.
Deputy Chief Constable Mike Colbourne from Bedfordshire Police said: "We expect our officers to act with integrity at all times but clearly PC D'Andrea's actions fell well below the standards we demand as a police force.
"His actions led to an innocent woman being arrested and interviewed about the fabricated claims.
"This case shows how we will not tolerate such behaviour."
