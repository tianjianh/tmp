[SN]TITLE[SN]
Preston 2-2 Bournemouth (2-3 pens)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premier League Bournemouth survived a scare against Preston to reach the League Cup fourth round on penalties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shaun MacDonald's looping header gave Bournemouth the lead but substitute Jordan Hugill nodded the Championship side level to force extra time.
The Cherries took the lead again through Marc Pugh's close-range strike before Daniel Johnson levelled from the penalty spot.
Johnson had the decisive penalty saved by Adam Federici in the shootout.
Hugill and Alan Browne also had penalties saved, with home keeper Jordan Pickford denying Dan Gosling, as Bournemouth won the shootout 3-2.
The Lilywhites, who knocked Premier League Watford out in the previous round, were deservedly behind at the break after MacDonald took advantage of some poor defending to open the scoring.
Simon Grayson's men rallied after the break, though, and Hugill got on the end of Greg Cunningham's cross from the left to head a leveller with six minutes left.
Pugh was at the centre of the action in extra time, stabbing home after Josh King's shot was blocked, before Johnson punished his handball from the penalty spot.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe:
"Adam Federici is an outstanding goalkeeper and he's made some great saves there that's got us through and the lads have shown great composure to score at the other end,
"He's an outstanding, experienced international goalkeeper who we certainly believe in.
"He's also a great character and brilliant with the lads, even though he's not playing at the moment he's certainly giving competition for places."
Preston boss Simon Grayson:
"They showed a lot of character and worked extremely hard and showed all of the things that we asked of them after the weekend with that second-half performance.
"I'm pleased with them and disappointed to go out but if you're going to lose a game and respond after a disappointing performance that was the way to do it tonight."
