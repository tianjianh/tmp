After an earlier downpour, Marquez made the most of a change to slick tyres on his way to a win in a time of 47 mins 03.239 secs at the Sachsenring Circuit.
He moved 48 points clear of fellow Spaniard and reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who only finished 15th.
Italian Andrea Dovizioso was third, with Britain's Scott Redding fourth.
Marquez finished 9.857 secs in front of Crutchlow, who claimed his first podium finish since Argentina in April 2015, while Redding missed out on a top-three spot as he was passed by Dovizioso on the final lap.
With nine races of the season left, Marquez has 170 points and Lorenzo 122, with seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi third overall on 111 points after an eighth-place finish in Germany.
The next race takes place on 14 August from the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg, Austria.
