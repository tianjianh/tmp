The Radio Amateurs' Emergency Network (RAYNET) provided communications over 2,000 square miles in North Yorkshire.
Radios were operated by 42 volunteers. The money has been donated by North Yorkshire County Council.
The volunteers will also provide communications on the Tour de Yorkshire cycling event in May.
The Tour de France generated £102m in revenue on the two stages across Yorkshire, watched by 2.5m spectators.
During the race the radio network linked control rooms in Skipton, Richmond, Harrogate, York and Wakefield.
Brian Dooks, a member of RAYNET, said: "We are grateful for the donation, which will be used to purchase and replace equipment.
"Some members slept in their cars to be ready to operate from 4am each day. It was not easy, but nobody who worked on the Tour will forget being involved in something very special."
