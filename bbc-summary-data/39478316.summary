Mo beat competition from Michelle John, Into The Ark and Jamie Miller to take the prize during Sunday night's live final.
The 21-year-old hotel worker looked in shock as the winner was announced.
Mo thanked his mentor, singer and actress Jennifer Hudson, for her support.
The win brings a record deal with Polydor so Mo will now head into the studio to record his music tracks.
The result wasn't the only drama of ITV's Sunday night final.
A man ran onto the stage just after finalists Mo Adeniran and Into The Ark were announced.
A member of the ITV team said: "There was a brief interruption on stage, which was dealt with immediately by security.
"The show continued as planned."
