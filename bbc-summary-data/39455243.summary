Lallana, 28, injured a thigh during England's World Cup qualifying win over Lithuania on Sunday after playing in a friendly against Germany on 22 March.
He could be out for a month, starting with Saturday's Merseyside derby.
"I was not happy that he played on Wednesday, but it is not about blaming Gareth Southgate," said the German.
"I think it is absolutely normal to have contact with the manager of the national team. It is not about appreciating [the call] it is about the normal situation. We both share players.
"I respect 100% the decisions of other managers because they have to respect my decisions, too."
Lallana played more than an hour of England's friendly against Germany in Dortmund - a game which came 72 hours after the Reds played Manchester City in the Premier League - before playing for 90 minutes against Lithuania.
But Klopp also suggests that the FA needs to work with the Premier League, clubs and broadcasters to better plan England's fixtures.
"I really think we could handle these situations better if we work together," he said.
"As long as we do not work together we will have these situations all the time."
