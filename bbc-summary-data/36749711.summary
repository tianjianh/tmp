Paramedics initially treated the driver at the scene of the accident in Kingswood Road, Bromley, before taking her to hospital "as a priority", London Ambulance Service said.
The memorial was left badly damaged in the crash at 10:20 BST. The Met is investigating.
The Grade II listed monument was unveiled in 1921.
It honours those who died in both World War One and Two.
