The Grecians took an early lead through Ollie Watkins' strike from the edge of the box, his eighth goal of the season.
Jake Taylor almost made it two, hitting the post from distance before Yeovil's Francois Zoko and Jack Compton forced saves from goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik.
Taylor sealed the points in the second half, scoring after Artur Krysiak failed to hold his initial shot.
Exeter are now unbeaten in nine league games and level on points with Wimbledon, who currently occupy the final play-off position.
