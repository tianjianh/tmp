Teenager Dan Lawrence (154) added 31 runs in the morning as Essex, who were 368-8 overnight, were all out for 423.
Leicestershire were skittled out for 175 as David Masters (4-39) and Jamie Porter (4-49) took four wickets each.
Only Neil Dexter's 44 provided any real resistance for the hosts, one of only three players who managed to progress past a score of 20.
Essex now have a commanding 44-point lead over Leicestershire and look set to return to Division One for the first time since 2010, especially with only one team being promoted to Division One following the Championship structure changes.
Essex fast bowler David Masters told BBC Radio Essex:
"To win in three days from the position we were in was an outstanding effort and shows our resilience as a team, and our winning mentality.
"Dan Lawrence was extraordinary: he's still a kid, really, and to go out there and get 150 in first against second was magnificent.
"It's great for him to have the likes of Ryan ten Doeschate and James Foster batting around him, but he's still go to do it, and I was talking to Alastair Cook in the dressing room and said that knock was just sensational.
"Having kept them out there for so long when we were batting must have killed them a little bit, mentally, having us down - it knocks the stuffing out of you. But we still had to bowl well and we did."
Leicestershire director of elite performance Andrew McDonald told BBC Radio Leicester:
"We came up against the best side in the competition and learned some valuable lessons.
"Essex didn't let us back into the contest and today we weren't at our best with the bat.
"We probably did the competition a bit of a disservice by being beaten as we were.
"They thoroughly deserve to go up - they totally outplayed us in this game."
