[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belfast's 'Soloist' building is sold to London firm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Soloist, one of Belfast's most distinctive office developments, has been sold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The building, opposite the High Court, houses the Belfast office of law firm Pinsent Masons.
It was developed by the property company William Ewart, which has been selling assets as part of an agreement with the Cerberus investment fund.
Land Registry filings show the building has been bought by a London-registered firm, CL 10 Ltd.
The price was understood to be about Â£14.5m.
Other companies associated with CL 10 have bought other commercial properties in Belfast.
Construction of the Soloist, designed by Norwegian firm Niels Torp, started during the worst of the property crash.
The loans connected with the building were moved into the Irish National Assets Management Agency (Nama), and the agency provided funding which allowed it to be completed in 2014.
