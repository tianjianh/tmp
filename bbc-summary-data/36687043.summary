Helen Reeves, Olympic bronze medallist and BBC Sport analyst:
"It was a tough ask for Fiona Pennie in the final, but she has improved from the Olympics in 2008 when she failed to get past the heats.
"She will be disappointed because she knows she is capable of more.
"She was in quite a good position going into bottom half, but she ran out of steam."
