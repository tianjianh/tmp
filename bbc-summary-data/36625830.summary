Grace, 28, who won the RBC Heritage in April, said: "I am getting married in November and hoping to start a family. I must put their health first.
"I really hope to be able to qualify again in four years' time."
Northern Ireland duo Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell have already pulled out while Australia's world number one Jason Day is considering his options.
World number four McIlroy said on Wednesday that it was "a risk I am unwilling to take" despite the World Health Organisation stating that there is a "very low risk" for participants.
Fiji's Vijay Singh and Marc Leishman of Australia have already said they will not play because of the virus and the absence of the top players is a blow as the sport returns to the Olympics for the first time since 1904.
Zika, a mosquito-borne virus, has been linked to brain defects in newborn babies.
