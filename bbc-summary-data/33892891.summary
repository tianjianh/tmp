[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The entertainer's funeral will take place on Thursday 20 August at St Mary's Church in the suburb of Woolton.
The Right Reverend Thomas Williams, Auxiliary Bishop of Liverpool and former Parish Priest of St Anthony's, Scotland Road, will officiate.
Black, who emerged from the city's music scene to find fame in the 1960s before becoming a TV host, died after having a stroke at the age of 72.
After the funeral, her body will be laid to rest at a private ceremony in Allerton Cemetery, where her parents are buried.
Her late husband and manager, Bobby Willis, was cremated in 1999.
The late entertainer's representative said further details would be released "once all the preparations have been finalised".
A statement said: "Once again the family have asked for their privacy to be continually respected at this difficult time."
The Blind Date and Surprise Surprise host died of a stroke after falling over at her Spanish home earlier this month.
