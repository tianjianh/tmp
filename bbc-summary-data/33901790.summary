Banbury man reunited with 115 stolen pocket watches

An Oxfordshire man has been reunited with his stolen collection of over 100 pocket watches after they turned up in a pawnbrokers in the West Midlands.

Henry Peverill, 72, had his lifelong collection taken during a burglary at his Banbury home in March 2014.
The watches surfaced in August when a man tried to sell them to a Cash Converters shop in Coventry.
Police seized the timepieces and later arrested and charged a 28-year-old man with handling stolen goods.
Officers were able to trace the watches back to Mr Peverill after a faint "OX" postcode was revealed on one of the watches using ultra-violet equipment.
Scott Sheldon, a builder from Whoberley, Coventry, was given a 16-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months after he pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods at Coventry Magistrates' Court.
