Michael Mearns, 56, was found with serious injuries at Greenock Cemetery at 20:00 on Thursday, 30 July. He later died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital.
The boys police want to trace are aged between 13 and 16 years old.
They left a Spar shop in South Street and walked past the cemetery shortly before Mr Mearns was found.
One of the boys is described as white, with short dark hair and of medium build. He was wearing a dark jacket, dark trousers, black and white trainers and a blue jumper with what appeared to be a light collar underneath.
The second teenager is described as white, with short dark hair and of slim build. He was wearing a dark jacket, dark trousers, black shoes or trainers and a dark jumper with what appeared to be a light collar underneath.
The third boy is described as white, with short dark hair and of slim build. He was wearing a dark jacket, dark trousers, blue jumper and black shoes or trainers.
All three teenagers were last seen walking on Orangefield Lane.
Det Ch Insp Laura McLuckie, of Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team, said: "Again I would like to thank the public for their help and support over the last couple of weeks.
"It is of great importance that we trace the three teenage boys who were seen in the vicinity at around 19:50 on the night that Mr Mearns was assaulted within the cemetery.
"I urge them to contact police immediately even if they think they have no valuable information to give."
Last week, police appealed for help in tracing two men and two women who were seen in the area around the time Mr Mearns was found.
That appeal came after officers staged a stop-and-question operation involving up to 60 people.
A similar operation was held the previous week.
