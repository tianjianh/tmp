[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers' Mark Warburton has accepted a one-match touchline ban after being accused of using "offensive, abusing and insulting language" at officials.

The Ibrox manager was left angry after Aberdeen were awarded a free-kick that led to James Maddison's late winning goal at Pittodrie on Sunday.
Warburton was also unhappy about an offside call involving Barrie McKay.
He will sit out Saturday's match against Partick Thistle after admitting a Scottish FA misconduct charge.

Warburton told Rangers' website: "My frustration over two big decisions hasn't changed, but it is what it is - a process - so it will be a one-match ban.
"I pride myself on being respectful and being disciplined and if I appeared to lose that then you deserve to be punished accordingly.
"I'm not proud of that, if that is the case, but I think my frustration was very evident.
"The two decisions, when we looked at it post-match, it was quite clear we were right in our assumptions."
