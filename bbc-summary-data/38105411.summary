Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe received an emailed apology from referee Roger East after failing to award the Cherries a penalty against Stoke.

Callum Wilson appeared to be fouled by Potters defender Ryan Shawcross in the first half of Bournemouth's 1-0 Premier League win on Saturday.
East waved play on as Wilson and Howe protested.
"To be fair to Roger, he got in contact straight away once he'd acknowledged he was wrong," Howe told BBC Radio Solent.
The game was goalless when Shawcross seemed to bring Wilson down in the 10th minute without making contact with the ball.
Bournemouth went on to record a first league away win of the season courtesy of Nathan Ake's first-half header.
"You can't ask for anything more than an apology," Howe added. "We all make mistakes, I certainly make enough as a coach.
"But, when you make a mistake, you have to acknowledge it and move on."
East has been left off the referees' appointments for the weekend's Premier League fixtures, and will be fourth official between Southampton and Everton on Sunday.
But Howe said that, like players and managers, you cannot judge referees on one game.
"If we had that attitude with referees, there wouldn't be any left," the 38-year-old added.
"It's such a difficult environment to work in and the pressure is so high. But as long as they analyse themselves like we would as players and coaches, they will get better."
