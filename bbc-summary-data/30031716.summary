Midlands Muslim groups also said their sense of safety was being undermined by the online terrorists, who they said did not represent Islam.
Det Ch Supt Sue Southern, from West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said: "There is a propaganda machine that sits supporting IS, pushing out messages...and drawing young people in particular, to what is being portrayed as this idealistic environment."
But Haroon Khan, of Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association who helped to sell poppies for the British Legion, said Islam "categorically condemns" the acts of "young, radicalised youths".
Waseem Khan, of Green Lane Mosque, added: "Isis propaganda is very powerful, very slick production.
"The mosques really need to empower the youngsters, start talking about these issues."
BBC Midlands Today's special correspondent, Peter Wilson, reports.
