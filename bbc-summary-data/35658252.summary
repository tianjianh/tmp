[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Murder charges have been dropped against two brothers accused of killing their mother, due to "insufficient evidence".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohammed Member and Shafiq Member - together with Shafiq's partner Fatima Patel - were charged with murdering their mother Mumtaz Member in December.
But the Crown Prosecution Service said the case against all three defendants has now been discontinued.
Leicestershire Police said it will continue to investigate the death.
"While the prosecution case has been brought to a close, our investigations into her death remain ongoing," the force said in a statement.
"We have been conducting active inquiries since the death on Saturday 12 December and will continue to do so in order to gather further evidence in the case."
Mrs Member, 56, was found at a home in Holmfield Avenue, Stoneygate, Leicester, on 12 December.
Mohammed Member, 25, Shafiq Member, 29, and Fatima Patel, 27, were arrested on the same day.
Mrs Member had extensive injuries but her cause of death has not been made public.
The Leicester Mercury said her family is well known in the business community, which "reacted with shock" to the death.
The brothers have been in custody since their arrests while Ms Patel was released on conditional bail after appearing in court in December.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the decision to charge the three people with murder was taken while investigative work continued, but has now been reviewed.
"A subsequent review of the case has now been undertaken using the Full Code Test, which takes account of all available evidence gathered as part of the investigation," CPS East Midlands said in a statement.
"This review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support murder charges against any of the three defendants.
"As a result, we have informed all parties involved that the case against each of the three defendants has been discontinued."
