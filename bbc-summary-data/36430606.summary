GMB union boss urges Corbyn to do more on EU campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Remain campaign could lose the EU referendum if Labour voters do not get more engaged in the debate, the new leader of the GMB union has warned.

In a BBC interview, Tim Roache urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to do more to make the case for EU membership.
It comes ahead of a speech by Mr Corbyn in which he will say workers' rights are best protected by being in the EU.
But Vote Leave chairwoman and Labour MP Gisela Stuart has said workers' rights were "hard won" in the UK, not Europe.
In other developments:
There are just weeks to go until the UK decides on its future in the European Union, in the in-out referendum on 23 June.
The Remain campaign believes that securing the support of Labour voters will be vital to winning the referendum.
How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.
But there are anxieties within the Remain camp that Labour voters might not turn out to vote, when the levels of turnout could be decisive.
In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Roache said his "biggest concern" was that Labour voters would "stay at home" on 23 June.
"I think they won't see it as the absolutely crucial vote that it is and I also think that they see it as a bunfight in the Tory party," he said.
Asked whether he thought Labour was doing enough to get its pro-Remain message across, he said it "is starting to do more".
But he argued that a bigger push was needed, warning: "The reality is that the more people that stay at home the more likely it is that we will leave the EU. I don't think we can even begin to contemplate that."

It's rare these days - especially as the referendum debate rages with both sides to varying degrees struggling to tell the public the truth, the whole truth, and absolutely nothing but the truth - that political figures are willing to say exactly what they think in public.
But the union movement, in the recently elected boss of the GMB, Tim Roache, might just have found themselves someone who might.
He's worked for the union for decades, starting as a teenager in the post room. But after years of working his way up, now he's in charge, Roache is clearly determined to change things.
And in an interview with me for Radio 4's World at One programme, he didn't hold back.

On Jeremy Corbyn - who has been urged to make a bolder case for staying in the UK - Mr Roache said he viewed the Labour leader as "a half-hearted Remain" but urged the party to get behind him and campaign vigorously to stay in the EU.
"I think he probably could do a bit more, let's hope he will," he said.
The union leader's call for action comes as the Labour leader prepares to make a speech warning about the impact on workers' rights if the UK left the EU.
Speaking at the Institute of Engineering Technology on Thursday, Mr Corbyn - who has been a long-standing critic of the EU and who is regarded as the most Eurosceptic Labour leader in years - will say British workers benefit from a host of rights and protections because of EU legislation.
He will say the European social chapter and other EU directives have secured:
"It's important to understand the benefit of these gains," he will say. "It means workers throughout Europe have decent rights at work, meaning it's harder to undercut terms and conditions across Europe."
The Labour leader will accuse Tory Leave supporters of wanting to "rip up" workers' protections and say it is the Conservative government that is the real "threat" to Britain - not the EU.
"Everything they have done as a government so far means we could not rely on them to protect the workplace rights that millions rely on.
"A Tory Brexit negotiation would be a disaster for the majority of people in Britain," he will add.
But Leave campaigners, including Vote Leave's Ms Stuart, say the EU has been "a disaster" for workers, pointing out that unemployment levels across the eurozone are "in the double digits".
The Labour MP has also dismissed Remain's argument that workers' rights have been secured by Europe.
"Workers' rights are not something that have been gifted to us by the EU, they have been hard won here at home and should be protected by a Parliament that is properly accountable to voters in the UK."
She has said the only way to "take back control of our economy, our democracy" is to leave the EU.
