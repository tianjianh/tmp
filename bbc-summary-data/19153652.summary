In a statement, he said: "Dawn and I are devastated to announce that we've lost our baby. Poppy Barlow was delivered stillborn on August 4 in London.
"Our focus now is giving her a beautiful funeral and loving our three children with all our hearts.
"We'd ask at this painful time that our privacy be respected."
The 41-year-old singer and his wife, a dancer, 42, have been married for 12 years and have three other children - Daniel, 11; Emily, 10; and Daisy, three.
As a member of Take That, Barlow has been part of one of Britain's most successful pop bands, and also recently organised the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace.
His group had been rumoured to be taking part in the Olympic Games closing ceremony on Sunday.
