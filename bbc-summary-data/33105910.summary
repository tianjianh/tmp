[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fire blew out the windows of the property on Lewes Road, initially leading to reports that there had been an explosion.
Emergency services attended the scene at 02:50 BST and the body was discovered in the upstairs of the house, which had been badly damaged.
Police and the fire service are carrying out a joint investigation into the cause of the fire.
Residents from several neighbouring homes, which were evacuated, have now been allowed back into their properties.
The street, just off Neasham Road, remains cordoned off.
