A man who went missing nearly two years ago was trying to expand his drug dealing operation at the time, police said.

Chris May, 28, was last seen at his home in Kelvedon, Essex, on 25 May 2015.
His Volkswagen Golf was found abandoned about 10 miles away in Fairstead.
His family said Mr May had "made mistakes, just some bigger than others" and described him as a "funny, caring and loving man".

Essex Police announced a year ago the case was being treated as a homicide rather than a missing person inquiry.
Mr May was a drug user and dealt in ecstasy, cocaine and mephedrone.
Det Ch Insp Stuart Smith said: "I know Chris was actively dealing drugs and I believe it is this involvement with drugs and him trying to extend his dealing which has led to his death.
"I am really keen to speak to dealers and users in the Coggeshall, Kelvedon, Feering and Braintree areas who had dealings with Chris."
On the eve of the two year anniversary of Mr May's disappearance, his family said they "deserved to know what happened".
"For us it marks two years of no longer living but merely existing. Two years of not being ourselves. Two years of indescribable pain. Two years of not being able to explain to innocent children where their adored uncle is. Two years of an emotional rollercoaster.
"It's time for someone to do the right thing and give us the answers that we desperately need. "
