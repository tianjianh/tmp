Donald MacMillan, 73, and his wife Morag, 67, were found in the village of Gravir, in the South Lochs area of Lewis, on Friday morning.
Police Scotland said their deaths were being treated as "unexplained".
Officers are investigating how the couple came to be outside as temperatures fell below freezing overnight.
Police Scotland said in a statement: "The investigation into the circumstances of their deaths is continuing.
"The deaths of Mr and Mrs MacMillan continue to be treated as unexplained."
Tributes were paid to the couple, who ran the Post Office in the village, as the local community was said to be "in shock".
Western Isles councillor Catherine Macdonald said: "It's very sad. I was absolutely stunned when I heard. They were a very well-known couple who did a lot in their community."
John Randall, former vice-chairman of community organisation the Pairc Trust which counted the couple as members, said: "They were very nice and an active part of the local community here. They were very much respected by everyone - everyone's in shock."
