[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who says she was stuck in a two-hour queue to exit a Coventry car park has been issued with a £70 charge for overstaying the time limit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dionne Russell, from Radford, was issued with the penalty on Thursday after using the Central Six retail park on 14 May.
Miss Russell, who spent 40 minutes shopping at the site, said the charge was a "cheek".
G24, which runs the car park, declined to comment.
Miss Russell told the Coventry Telegraph she had gone to Hobbycraft at about 14:45 BST and had spent 40 minutes shopping before returning to her car.
On trying to exit the site, she said she hit a bottleneck caused by the Friargate roadworks and could not leave until 18:10.
She said: "I was quite annoyed that, having completely wasted two hours of my life in a queue, the company had the cheek to send out the notice.
"Surely they should have somebody on site to tell the parking people that the road was gridlocked."
She said she would be "interested" to know if anybody else had been charged.
Miss Russell was sent images of her car entering and leaving the site which has a three-hour maximum time limit.
"The photo of me leaving the site had cars behind me and in front of me because it was a stationary queue," she said.
She added she would be contesting the penalty.
