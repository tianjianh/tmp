The scheme to create a "strategic business park" off the M1 close to junction 36 in the Dearne Valley was backed by the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority.
Road building along the site is expected to start in October 2015.
The authority said it would allow potential employment and housing sites to develop.
After giving the scheme approval, the authority said in a statement: "This will allow work to take place on the key highway connections along the Dearne Valley Parkway and will see the provision of access roads along with the preparation of additional sites along the route.
"It will provide businesses with the right infrastructure they need to thrive and is essential in helping to attract and retain new and existing businesses.
"There will be significant impact on the number and proportion of private sector jobs in Barnsley."
The Sheffield City Region Combined Authority is made up of councillors from Barnsley, Rotherham, Doncaster and Sheffield along with others from parts of neighbouring Derbyshire.
