The result means the Amajita will almost certainly go home after their final group game against Uruguay.
Having lost their opening game against Japan 2-1 on Sunday, the South Africans went into this Group D match with little room for error.
But they were undone by goals from Andrea Favilli and Riccardo Orsolini.
Uruguay, meanwhile, have qualified for the round of 16 by defeating Japan 2-0.
Japan midfielder Takefusa Kubo missed a chance to become the youngest scorer in the competition's history.
The 15-year-old headed an attempt over the bar.
