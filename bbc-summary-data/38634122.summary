Powys traveller site funding expected to be approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are expected to approve funding for potential gypsy and traveller sites in Powys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council has allocated £200,000 towards a £2.28m site in Machynlleth this year, with the rest coming from the Welsh Government and borrowing.
But a report said the rental income would leave a £46.6k shortfall over two years and more money would be needed.
It also questioned whether the Welsh Government would continue funding at its current level.
But the report, which will be discussed at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, added any financial change in position would be subject to further approval.
It added Welshpool councillors had been told of the need for two additional pitches, and those in Brecon would be advised of scheduled work on three un-serviced pitches on the Kings Meadow there.
