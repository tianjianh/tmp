Arctic expedition pupils flying in a boat in the sky

Pupils from a Nottinghamshire school have set off from Scotland in a World War Two submarine killer plane, on a unique expedition to the Arctic Circle.

The group, from Worksop College, took off from Loch Lomond on Tuesday. They'll spend three weeks climbing mountains and surveying biodiversity.
They trained for the trip in the Lake District and in near Arctic conditions in the Cairngorms in February.
They're flying in the last operational Catalina in the UK,
Pupils taking part in the trip told the BBC they couldn't believe they were finally on their way.
Sixth form pupil Abigail said she was looking to making life-long friends.
"I'm also looking forward to how hard it's going to be, to test myself", she added.
"Nobody's ever been there", her friend Duncan explained.
"It's completely untouched. And I think it's a rare bit of earth that is like that.
"And I hope it's beautiful."
Headteacher Gavin Horgan said the trip was designed to be "inspirational" for his pupils.
"It's children not just competing on the same stage as other children but as adults. And beating them," he said.
"These children will be climbing un-climbed ascents, and doing things that adults have never done."
But surely taking pupils into un-charted areas is risky? Even dangerous?
Neal Gwynne, the leader of the expedition, says "we can keep them safe."
"We have an amazing team. Amazing pilots, amazing mountaineering instructors, an amazing doctor who are experienced at working in the Arctic environment.
"And I think one of the most important parts of risk management is that the students wrote the risk assessment - under my guidance.
"It's them that need to know what the risks are. It's obvious to me. But that was a very important part of the process for them."
And his deputy, Fort William based Al Halewood, said: "At the end of the day, as leaders, we are - of course - responsible for what happens.
"(But) we would never take ourselves to the limit of what either we or they are capable of.
"We'll always assess the risk, and leave ourselves a little wiggle room. So we wouldn't try the hardest climbing, or the longest walks, or the worst situations we could put ourselves into."
Despite that planning and preparation, I wondered, how hard had it been to get mums and dads to give permission for the pupils to take part.
Sixth former Shirlyn said: "It was actually very easy."
"My family definitely had to say yes. They didn't have any choice".
And amongst the family and friends who'd clustered around the pier at Tarbert to wave goodbye there was excitement, as well as some last minute nerves.
Louise Holliday, who's son is on the trip, said: "What a fabulous opportunity, and I'm really excited for him.
"And I can't wait for that plane to take off. A little nervous. But I'm confident that the expedition leaders have got everything under control."
But there is, perhaps, one possible outcome from being on the expedition which no-one can guard against.
That instead of being a "once in a lifetime experience" it is the stimulus to a lifetime full of adventure.
Huw (no relation of mine) laughed as he told me that because of going on the trip he'd had the chance to meet two veterans of Arctic exploration.
"They've been to Greenland 30 times since the 1960 or 70s. And to be honest the thing I'm most worried about is not wanting to go home again."
So you're going to get addicted too, I asked.
"Potentially, yes."
