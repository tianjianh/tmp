Joey Barton: Rangers midfielder not expected back at club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joey Barton will not report back for training at Rangers on Monday and is unlikely to play for the club again.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder, 34, was suspended over a training ground row in September and has since been charged by the Scottish FA for breaching gambling rules.
Barton, who remains on full pay, was asked to attend a hearing at the Scottish Premiership club but refused.
It is understood talks between both parties have reached a stalemate over the disciplinary process.
Barton joined Rangers from Burnley on a two-year contract in May.
But, after eight appearances, he was suspended by the club following a reported altercation with team-mate Andy Halliday as players reviewed September's 5-1 defeat by Celtic. He was due to return on 10 October.
The SFA then alleged that Barton had breached rules by placing 44 bets on matches between 1 July and 15 September.
Rangers subsequently announced that the player had been told to stay away for another seven days after launching a "formal disciplinary procedure".
Barton asked for more time to consider the SFA charge against him.
The parent body's disciplinary rule 33 prohibits players, coaches, club officials and referees in Scotland from betting on football anywhere in the world. A hearing is now due on 17 November.
In Barton's absence, Rangers have won three, drawn one and lost another in all competitions.
Capped once by England, Barton has made more than 400 senior club appearances in a career that has taken in spells at Manchester City, Newcastle United, QPR and Marseille.
He has won the Championship with Newcastle and Burnley and was also part of QPR's Championship play-off final-winning side in 2014.
