The 69-year-old from Devizes, Wiltshire, has not been seen since 25 September.
Extensive searches have been made since then and have involved helicopters, mountain rescue teams and search dogs.
At the weekend, searches were made of Aonach Eagach Ridge and the area around the Three Sisters.
In a statement, Mr Garton's family said: "We are extremely grateful to members of the emergency services and search and rescue personnel who have been helping in the search for Robin.
"We are increasingly desperate to find him.  Somebody will have seen him on the morning of 25 September and we would appeal to anyone in the area that day to rack their brains.
"Alternatively, do you know of others that were walking that day who might have seen him?
"Any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, may assist in bringing Robin home to his wife and children."
Mr Garton is described as 6ft 2in tall, of slim to medium build, with fair hair which is slightly balding. He occasionally wears glasses.
