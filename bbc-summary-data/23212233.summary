The number of inmates at Guernsey's prison reached a record high in 2012, according to the governor's report.

The prison roll peaked at 127 in August, 12 short of the maximum that can be held at Les Nicolles Prison.
Despite the increasing numbers, crime and anti-social behaviour within the prison had dropped, said Governor Dave Matthews.
He said this was because of an increasing emphasis on work and education.
The report shows that in 2012 there were a total of 132 offences within the prison, which compares to 210 in 2011 and 176 in 2010.
Mr Matthews said rates of assault, self-harm and bullying in the prison fell dramatically as a result of moves to instil a strong work ethic among prisoners.
He said: "Every prisoner that comes in, we set them a target of learning something, even if that is just getting up in the morning and going to work, to develop a work ethic.
"It is even better if they can attach a qualification, following a qualification they can do some offender rehabilitation work and prepare them for release."
