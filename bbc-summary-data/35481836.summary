Alex Neil: Norwich City boss frustrated by penalty decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich manager Alex Neil described Tottenham's penalty in Tuesday's 3-0 loss at Carrow Road, as "probably the weakest penalty" he has seen all term.

Kevin Friend pointed to the spot after Norwich's Sebastien Bassong collided with Dele Alli in the box, and Harry Kane converted to put Spurs 2-0 up.
"The penalty was an extremely poor decision," Neil said.
"Dele Alli gets a shot at goal, if he ends up putting it in the net it's a goal."
Neil continued to BBC Radio Norfolk: "Bassong has no bearing on where the ball's going to go - as he hits it, he has a free shot at goal, (goalkeeper) Declan Rudd gathers the ball and then there's a collision of bodies.
"It happens all over the pitch on a regular basis and there's very few times you see a free-kick given - for him to make such a key decision in such a big game was really frustrating."
Neil was also unhappy with Kane's second goal just before full-time, which came after Christian Eriksen dispossessed Martin Olsson.
"The ball's on the wrong side of him, Eriksen's come in from the back and he's bumped Martin as he's tried to play the pass, put him on his backside and then runs through," he said.
"Nine times out of 10, the defender would get the benefit of the doubt with that one.
"There was one in the first half with Youssouf Mulumbu that happened with their defender and we didn't get a free-kick for it. I feel like nearly all the 50-50 contentious decisions went in their favour."
Following the defeat, Norwich - who have lost their last five games in all competitions - could find themselves in the bottom three on Wednesday if Newcastle beat Everton.
