Magstim Company Limited, which manufactures devices used in brain therapy, has announced plans to expand its plant in Whitland.
The company said the move will take its total workforce there to 150 and will boost its market in the USA.
The three-year expansion project has been supported by Â£2.7m of Welsh government funding.
Managing director Robin Davies said expansion would "help us achieve our growth plans".
Economy Minister Edwina Hart said: "It's always good to see an indigenous company with considerable expertise in its specialist field continuing to make its mark worldwide.
"It serves to promote Welsh capability on an international stage and is a very welcome boost for our rapidly expanding life science sector."
