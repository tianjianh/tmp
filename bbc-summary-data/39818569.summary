The 18-year-old is a product of the Gloucestershire outfit's academy.
He captained Cheltenham's under-18 side this season and had a loan spell at non-league North Leigh, but will switch to first-team training from June.
The Robins are 20th in League Two with one match remaining this term, away at already-promoted Portsmouth on Saturday.
