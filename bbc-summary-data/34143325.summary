Nottinghamshire PCSO jailed for having sex with teenage girl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A PCSO has been jailed for five years after he had a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Childs had exchanged numbers with the teenager at a charity event while working as an officer with Nottinghamshire Police.
Childs, 30, was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child under 16 in July.
Passing sentence, Judge Simon Hammond, said Childs had "taken advantage" of an "impressionable" under-age girl.
The trial at Leicester Crown Court heard Childs encouraged his victim, now in her 20s, to "skive off" school and meet him while he was off duty.
During the same trial Childs, of Kilton Hill in Worksop, Nottinghamshire was cleared of allegations of sexual activity with other girls and misconduct in a public office over a seven-year period.
The married officer was suspended from duty in 2013 when he was arrested.
Temporary Det Supt Paul Murphy, from the force's professional standards directorate, said: "Cases of this nature are rare and risk damaging the trust and confidence of our communities.
"The public deserve high standards from the police, while Child's failed to display any standard of decent behaviour in his conduct."
Childs has now been placed on the sex offenders' register for life.
