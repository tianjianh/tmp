Brexit negotiations 'danger' to NHS Wales recruitment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tory Brexit negations pose a "danger" to the "hugely successful" campaign to recruit more doctors and nurses in Wales, Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary has said.

Sir Keir Starmer accused the Conservatives of using NHS staff as "bargaining chips".
He was speaking ahead of a visit to Gower, Swansea county, on Monday.
The Tories said Theresa May would provide "strong and stable leadership".
A spokesman said: "Only a vote for Theresa May and her Conservative team will deliver the strong and stable leadership to see us through Brexit and beyond, locking in our strong economy and the funding that secures strong public services.
"A vote for anyone else puts that at risk by putting Jeremy Corbyn a step closer to Downing Street."
Plaid Cymru said an "emboldened Tory government left unopposed by a weak and divided Labour Party" would "put the safety of patients at risk" by restricting the recruitment of doctors and nurses.
The Liberal Democrats and UKIP have been asked to comment.
On Tuesday, Welsh Labour's Cabinet Secretary for Health, Vaughan Gething, launched a major campaign to attract nurses to Wales following a successful GP recruitment drive.

Sir Keir said a Labour UK government would immediately guarantee the legal status of all EU nationals in the UK.
"It is the right thing for us to do for the NHS and the right thing to do for the country," he added.
He said the Train, Work, Live campaign had "transformed GP recruitment in Wales, and will surely do the same for nursing."
"The schemes are attracting applicants from across the globe, with many from the EU.
"EU nationals do not just contribute to our society - they are our society," he said.
