Police reissued their appeal for information earlier on Friday, saying it is "important that we can inform the man's loved ones".
The body of the man, believed to be in his 50s, was discovered near Shaw's Bridge in south Belfast on the afternoon of Friday 14 July.
His death is not being treated as suspicious.
The man's name has not yet been released.
His identity had remained a mystery for a week in spite of fingerprint checks and a search of missing persons records.
