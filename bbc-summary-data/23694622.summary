Oh, who won a Golden Globe for her role as prickly Dr Cristina Yang, was one of the original six cast members, all of whom started the series as interns.
"Creatively, I really feel like I gave it my all, and I feel ready to let her go," Oh told the Hollywood Reporter.
It has not been revealed how the 42-year-old will exit the ABC show at the end of its upcoming 10th season.
Oh added: "It's such an interesting thing to play a character for so long and to actually get the sense that she wants to be let go as well.
"Cristina wants to be let go, and I am ready to let her go. We have to start the process, story-wise, for the Grey's writers to think of why she's going to go."
Oh has received five supporting actress Emmy nominations for her portrayal of Dr Yang, an ambitious and driven doctor who repeatedly puts her career before her personal life.
She told the Hollywood Reporter that she started to consider leaving in May 2012, when she and the show's other stars signed two-year deals, taking them to the end of forthcoming 10th season.
Grey's Anatomy creator, Shonda Rhimes, who also conceived Oh's character, thanked the popular actress for her "collaboration on a character we both love so deeply".
"One of the best days of my life as a writer happened the day Sandra Oh walked in my door to audition and forever changed the course of Grey's Anatomy with her brilliant, nuanced portrayal of Cristina Yang," said Rhimes.
"This year is going to be bittersweet for us - we're both going to savour every moment of Cristina Yang, and then we're going to give her the exit she deserves. And when Sandra walks out of my door, Grey's Anatomy will once again be forever changed."
Oh told her co-stars about her decision on Tuesday, during a reading for the 200th episode.
It is expected that negotiations will take place shortly with the rest of the cast about their future on the show, which has picked up several industry awards since it began in 2005.
In a statement, a spokesperson for ABC said: "It's our intention to have Grey's on the air for many years to come, with as many of the original cast as possible."
