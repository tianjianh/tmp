The 30-year-old Briton's lap of two minutes 19.265 seconds was 0.998secs quicker than Italy's seven-time champion Valentino Rossi.
"I took the risk at the right time," said Crutchlow.
He became Britain's first MotoGP winner since Barry Sheene in 1981 with victory in the Czech Republic last month.
"I think tomorrow in a dry race we can be competitive and I'll do my best to battle at the front," added Crutchlow, who clinched top spot for the third time in his career in wet conditions with seven minutes remaining in the qualifying session.
"I really appreciate the reception I've had, and it's so nice to see so many people here to watch what we consider to be the best sport in the world."
Maverick Vinales was third, while Crutchlow's compatriot Scott Redding qualified seventh, as championship leader Marc Marquez came in fifth, 1.514 seconds off the pace.
