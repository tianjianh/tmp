Gray tore a chest muscle in Scotland's Six Nations win over France, ruling him out of their final match in Ireland.
But along with fly-half Finn Russell, who also missed the Dublin match after concussion, Gray has been declared fit.
"It's great having Jonny back for the run-in," said Warriors forwards coach Dan McFarland.
"While the international players have been away, the guys who have been here have excelled. But Jonny is an excellent player, in my mind a world-class player already at a young age."
Glasgow, sixth in the table, have won four games in a row since losing 13-10 at Ulster in early February and are now four points behind the Northern Irish province in fourth, with a game in hand.
With Gray, Russell and the rest of their Scotland contingent - Glasgow had 11 players on duty in Dublin - returning to the fray, lock Rob Harley admits there has been a step up in intensity at training.
"You know when the players around you are of a very high quality, you have to lift your level and perform everything to a very high standard," he told BBC Scotland.
"It is challenging but fun as well to be training at that level."
