A woman has been arrested on suspicion of theft after a "five-figure sum" went missing from a Kent football club.

The alleged fraud, at Dover Athletic football club's Crabble Stadium, was discovered after an internal audit revealed a discrepancy in its accounts.
Club chairman Jim Parmenter said the amount lost was bound to have an impact on the club, but would not put it in "any form of financial difficulty".
Kent Police said the 43-year-old woman from Gillingham had been freed on bail.
