Jimmy denies bullying in the Celebrity jungle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The banter backfired on Jimmy Bullard as the former footballer became the first contestant to be voted off I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!

The 36-year-old was touted as an early favourite to win the show because of his "ledge bantz" and jokes.
But he was criticised by some viewers for going too far when joking with former X Factor contestant Jake Quickenden.
Many people claimed it was more like bullying.
He fired insults at the 26-year-old, questioning how he had managed to get a part on the programme.
"The more I'm getting to know you, the more I'm thinking what the [SWEAR WORD] is this [OFFENSIVE WORD] doing in here? What's he offering?
"Like why the [SWEAR WORD] is he in here? What are you? What sort of skill have you got? Picked a mic up?"
At the time he put it down to "pure banter", but it may have contributed to the voting public turning against him.
The former Wigan, Fulham and Hull midfielder left the show after 17 days in the jungle.
I'm A Celeb hosts Ant and Dec questioned him about his behaviour when he came out. He said it was all done as a joke and that Jake understood that.
"Me and Jake and Foggy, I can go that deep. I couldn't go as deep on Michael.
"I sort of got my lines where I can go above but Jake and Foggy I let them have it full blast.
"I thought I could anyway."
