[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bahman Daroshafaei was arrested at his home in Tehran on Wednesday, according to the opposition website Kaleme.com.
Mr Daroshafaei, who has dual British and Iranian citizenship, has been working as a translator since leaving BBC Persian about two years ago.
Officials have so far given no reason for his arrest, which came on the eve of a visit to the UK by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.
In November, two prominent journalists were arrested as part of what appeared to be a crackdown on writers, artists and other cultural figures in Iran.
A lawyer for Isa Saharkhiz and Ehsun Mazandarani said earlier this week that they had been accused of acting against national security.
Mr Saharkhiz's son linked his arrest to this months' elections for Iran's parliament and Assembly of Experts, in which reformists are hoping to make a comeback.
In October, poets Fatemeh Ekhtesari and Mehdi Mousavi and a filmmaker Keywan Karimi were handed lengthy prison terms by a court after being convicted of charges including "insulting sanctities and propaganda against the state".
