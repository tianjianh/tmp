The Tiree Music festival-goers were sheltered in schools, the island airport and people's homes.
Organisers said the festival, headlined by The Fratellis and due to run until Sunday night, would get back under way again on Saturday.
Director Daniel Gillespie said: "We've got 1,000 campers under shelter and to do it so quickly has been amazing."
He added: "It's been pretty humbling seeing the response. We were driving round last night taking food and water to the people and even their spirits, their reaction, was incredible as well."
An official statement from festival organisers said they had "no major issues or concerns but have taken this measure as a caution".
It added: "Working closely with Argyll and Bute council, our in-house health and safety team and emergency services, coaches and buses have been arranged for attendees and we have provided accommodation for campers in local schools, business centres and churches.
"We would like to take this opportunity to thank the wonderful people of Tiree who have been tremendous in opening their doors to our visitors."
The festival, founded in 2010, has previously won awards including Best Small Event at the UK Event Awards and Best Small Festival in Scotland at the Scottish Event Awards.
This weekend's line-up includes The Fratellis, Funbox, We Banjo 3, Skerryvore, Manran, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Gentlemen of Few, Skipinnish, The Chaplins, Cherry Grove, Trail West, Gunna Sound, Dun Mor, The Lowground and Chunks.
