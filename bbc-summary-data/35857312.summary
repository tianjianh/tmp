Four people died in Saturday's attack on Istiklal Street, a popular shopping area, while another 36 were injured.
Hours before kick-off the Istanbul governor's office said Sunday's match "has been postponed after the evaluation of credible intelligence".
"It comes at the request and agreement of the teams," the authorities added.
