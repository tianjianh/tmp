Connacht are defending champions after their 20-10 win over Irish derby rivals Leinster at Murrayfield.
"Aviva Stadium is another grand stage that rewards clubs, players and fans from across the Championship," said Pro12 managing director Martin Anayi.
"Since its redevelopment in 2010 it has fast become an iconic rugby arena."
He added: "After a thrilling final at Murrayfield that set a new attendance record, it seems only right that we should try to raise the bar yet again here in Dublin."
The Pro12 final will be played on Saturday, 27 May.
