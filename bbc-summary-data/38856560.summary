Woman is charged with murder after a man was attacked with acid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has been charged with murder following the death of a man who was attacked with acid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark van Dongen, 29, a Dutch national, lost a leg, an eye and movement from the neck down after suffering 80% burns when he was attacked in Bristol in September 2015.
He died in Belgium on 2 January.
Berlinah Wallace, 47, of Ladysmith Road, Westbury Park, Bristol, appeared at Bristol Crown Court and has been remanded in custody until 27 March.
She was previously charged with throwing/casting a corrosive fluid with intent, but the charge was changed to murder during the court hearing, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Mr van Dongen was from the Netherlands but had been working in Bristol as a civil engineer.
He was injured on Ladysmith Road and spent two months in intensive care at Southmead Hospital before being moved to its burns centre.
Friends of his family eventually raised money for a private ambulance to take him to a hospital in Belgium, where his father lives, in November 2016.
