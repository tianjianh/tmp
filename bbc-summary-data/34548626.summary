A rugby ball-shaped lump of ice fell from the sky and left a "gaping hole" in the roof of a house in Wiltshire.

Keith Mead, from Melksham, ran out of his house fearing there had been an accident after hearing a "horrendous noise" on Wednesday morning.
He found tiles and a lump of yellow ice measuring about seven inches (17.7 cm) and weighing about 0.5 kg (1.1 lbs) lying nearby. No-one was injured.
Mr Mead, of Corncockle Close, believes the ice came from a passing plane.
No other houses were damaged.
Mr Mead said: "It was just as if someone had crashed into our house. I looked up and there was a gaping hole where a large lump of ice had impacted the roof."
He said he is "guessing" the ice came from a passing plane, and being "yellowish in colour could possibly be frozen urine".
He picked up the ice, put it in a bag, triple-wrapped it and put it in his freezer, ahead of contacting his insurance company.
Mr Mead said his insurers inspected the damage within two hours of the incident.
Surveyors are due to inspect the roof later and he expects to have the damage fixed "within a week or two".
