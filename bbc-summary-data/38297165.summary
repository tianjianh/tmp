Llanmadoc villagers' anger over Wales Coastal Path decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Villagers have criticised Natural Resources Wales (NRW) after it said a path around their village should not be re-opened two years after flooding.

The path near Llanmadoc, north Gower, has been impassable since storms in 2014 breached a medieval seawall letting water flood in.
Local walkers have been calling for the section of the Wales Coastal Path at Cwm Ivy to be restored and rejoined.
But NRW have said this is not feasible.
After the storms a diversion was created through the nearby Cwm Ivy woods so that the Wales Coastal Path would be kept intact.
But locals in the Swansea village argue the loss of the seawall path to the route has spoiled a pretty, circular walk and it should be re-connected to the continuous walk.
Local resident Randolph Jenkins said: "Three years ago this marshland was grassland, full of flowers and wildlife. The wall has been here for centuries, and my family has been here since 1923. I have grown up with the wall and the footpath.
"There are so many people who support re-connecting the path - from local walking and rambling groups to the local assembly member. But Natural Resources Wales is against it."
Cafe owner Sian Griffiths said the loss of the route had impacted on footfall for her business.
She said: "There was a lot of places you could go for a walk. That has all gone now."
NRW have suggested a number of alternatives to owners Swansea council, including building a new path away from the marshland, or considering building a new wooden or rope bridge to bridge the gap.
Hywel Manley of NRW said: "The council is responsible for the public footpath, and we have suggested alternatives.
"But re-joining the old path is not feasible."
Swansea council said it was working with a number of bodies to try and resolve the issue.
