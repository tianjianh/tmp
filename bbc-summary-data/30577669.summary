The agreement will see more than £2m invested in eight key races, while annual prize money will increase.
Glorious Goodwood, the main event, will become the Qatar Goodwood Festival.
"Our partnership with Qatar will make an enormous contribution to horseracing in the UK," said course owner, Lord March.
The inaugural Qatar Goodwood Festival will run from 28 July to 1 August.
Hamad Al Attiyah, president of the Qatar Equestrian Federation, said: "The sponsorship demonstrates Qatar's further commitment to British racing.
"With such huge prize-money on offer, we hope it will help to attract international runners from all over the world as well as continuing to see the best in Britain, France and Ireland."
Races to benefit from the cash injection include the Qatar Sussex Stakes which will have a total prize fund of £1m and the Qatar Nassau Stakes which will now be worth £600,000.
