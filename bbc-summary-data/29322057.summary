Leanne Maguire's daughter Sophie was transferred from Altnagelvin Hospital to the London hospital after her birth, but died days after surgery in April 2013.
The chief coroner of England and Wales has ordered an investigation.
The hospital said they took all concerns around the care they provided extremely seriously.
The family received a letter from the chief coroner of England and Wales at the beginning of September informing them that an investigation into Sophie's death had been ordered.
Sophie's mother, Leanne, said no post mortem examination had been carried out and although the family did receive a death certificate, they claim there were many unanswered questions about the baby's death.
Sophie was transferred to Great Ormond Street after being born with blood flow problems in her brain at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry.
Her mother, Leanne, told BBC Radio Foyle how Sophie had been affected following the surgery at the London hospital.
"She started getting clots and her stats were going up and down. All of sudden she got sepsis and clots in her legs," she said.
"We left that night and the next morning we got a phone call to say she had taken a turn for the worst.
"Her abdomen was swollen and she had a large clot blocking the liver.
"We were told that there was no other way and we would have to turn off the machine on her.  I was numb and my partner collapsed.
"The way she died in my arms I will never forget."
Although Sophie died in April, the family did not find out until some months later that the cause of her death was being investigated.
"I got a phone call in August from a member of staff at Great Ormond Hospital saying that Sophie's case is being reopened," Mrs Maguire said.
"I said to her 'why did you feel the need to open Sophie's case?' and she said to me 'Sophie should never have died'.
"How is a mother and father supposed to grieve for their baby if you don't know how they died? I won't stop until I get my answers."
A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street said: "Providing the best patient care in a safe environment is the trust's number one priority and we take all concerns around the care we provide extremely seriously.
"However, at this time, whilst we understand an investigation is taking place, we do not feel it appropriate to comment on this patient's care."
