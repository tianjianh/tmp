Belfast was one of six UK cities to host the Sport Relief flagship games, but swimathons and mile-long runs were held in other local towns and cities.
Custom House Square was the starting point for the Belfast Mile - those taking part could walk, jog or run it.
Olympian Dame Mary Peters and boxer Carl Frampton took part in the event.
Frampton ran part of the Belfast mile with his young daughter and speaking before it began he said: "It's good to get people out, being active and getting involved in sport.
"Obviously it helps raise money for a lot of worthwhile charities that need it, and what better way to do it? It's a great turnout here already, I'm looking forward to this."
Other events including a family cycle through the city and an aerobics workout in Custom House Square.
