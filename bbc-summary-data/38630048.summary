Mystics led at every quarter, and in Dominique Allen had the games' Most Valuable Player for her 21 points haul, 11 rebounds and two assists.
Rheanne Bailey top-scored with 23 points for Manchester.
Nottingham did enjoy some success, levelling up at 37-37 in the third quarter, before Mystics pulled away.
"We played about 25 minutes of our kind of basketball," said Manchester coach Jeff Jones. "It's the first trophy but hopefully not the last."
Nottingham skipper Siobhan admitted her team had allowed the Mystics to set the tone for the final. "We didn't shoot the ball well or get out of the blocks," she said. "We got into our rhythm in the second half but couldn't sustain it."
Wildcats are the current leaders of the WBBL regular-season table, and had won the four-team WBBL Betty Codona Classic earlier in the season.
