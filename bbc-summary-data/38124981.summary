It means the Derry club have completed a remarkable treble of provincial football, hurling and camogie titles.
Slaughtneil saw off a determined second-half fight back by the Down champions to secure the Ulster crown for the second time in three years.
"There was pressure on us, and to get over the line is unbelievable," said dual star Chrissy McKaigue.
"It is hard to put it into words, it has been an unbelievable year.
"We knew we might not have this opportunity again, so we wanted to do it so badly.
"We have high standards and high expectations, and we knew Kilcoo would represent an incredible task."
Kilcoo manager Paul McIver said his players were devastated to have come so close to a first provincial crown.
"The boys have put in so much effort over the last five years, and to come within a kick of the ball to win the Ulster is hard for us.
"We were in a good position but those last five minutes before half-time were gut-wrenching and we found ourselves four points behind.
"But this club will be back - they deserve their Ulster Championship. We will be top of the pile at some stage."
The sides were locked on five points each in the first half, but the Derry champions landed points through Christopher Bradley, Chrissy McKaigue, Shane McGuigan and Cormac O'Doherty to be 0-9 to 0-5 up at the interval.
Kilcoo, Down winners for five years in a row, replied with three on the bounce by Ceilin Doherty, Daragh O'Hanlon and Martin Devlin to reduce the deficit to just one.
Mickey Moran's Slaughtneil, though, kept their noses in front to clinch a second provincial triumph in three years.
