[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ysgol-y-Gogarth head 'failed to deal with drunk' staff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A head teacher did not take appropriate action after complaints teaching assistants were drunk on a school trip, a disciplinary panel has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident is said to have involved four staff from Llandudno's Ysgol-y-Gogarth on a trip to the Urdd Eisteddfod in Carmarthen in 2007.
The Flintshire hearing was told Alan Howells failed to record the full details of allegations.
It is also alleged he did not respond appropriately to parents' complaints.
A teacher who was in charge of the half-term trip told the tribunal she had been shocked and traumatised by the incident which also involved "sexual behaviour" at a hostel where they were staying.
Carys Garner, who teaches at the school for pupils with special educational needs, said the incident happened in the early hours of the morning and there was a risk it might have been seen by children.
She said she phoned the then head teacher Alan Howells to report the behaviour.
Among the allegations he faces, Mr Howells is said to have failed to ensure child protection policies were followed and is alleged to have sought to unduly influence the disciplinary process.
The hearing continues.
