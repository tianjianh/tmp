Benjamin Waterfield was a passenger in silver Citroen C2 that collided with a blue Seat Leon at about 02:15 on Saturday.
The 17-year-old was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary but did not survive the injuries he received in the crash.
The teenager's family said in a statement they were "devastated and heartbroken" at their loss.
The statement added: "We would like to thank all the emergency workers involved in the inquiry, and would particularly like to thank the staff at the Intensive Care Unit who fought just as hard as Benjamin did.
"We would request that our family be left as we try to come to terms with our loss. As a family we are thinking of everyone involved in the accident."
Three other people were taken to hospital. Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
