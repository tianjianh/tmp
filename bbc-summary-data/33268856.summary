A children's paddling pool was closed for four days after dozens of alcohol bottles were smashed into the water.

It is thought about 300 post-exam teenagers gathered at the Newnham pool in Cambridge on Saturday night after a party was advertised on Facebook.
A Cambridge City Council spokesman said their "vandalism" at the open-air pool "had put young children in danger".
He said the council was considering fencing off the pool next year "as it's cheaper than closing and clearing it".
Damage at the large council-owned pool in a park known as Lammas Land was noticed on Sunday morning and the facility was immediately closed.
One resident, who photographed the aftermath and clean-up operation, said she was "shocked and appalled by this very deliberate and very nasty act".
She said one of the pool engineers told her he had collected five "very large" buckets of bottles and shattered glass.
"It's bonkers, the amount of alcohol they must have got through," she added.
Ian Ross, city council manager for sport and recreation, said he was aware a party had been advertised on social media and had been told about 300 children attended.
"It was a mix of GCSE and A-level students celebrating the end of exams, as far as I am aware.
"Shall we just say it was a very well-attended reverie," he said.
Although it is not the first time the park and pool have been used for parties, it is the first time the pool has had to be drained.
It took one-and-a-half days to drain, and several days to clear and refill, Mr Ross said.
The pool has now reopened.
