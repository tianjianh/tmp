[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A team of about 60 volunteers have carried a dismantled replica of a Model T Ford car up and then back down from the summit of Ben Nevis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The attempt, made in strong winds, hail and snow, reached the top at 1130 BST.
Volunteers carried wheels, seats and the chassis. Other parts of the car were put into 40 bags weighing 10 pounds (4kg) each.
After being reassembled on the summit the car was again dismantled for the descent.
In 1911, a Model T was driven to the summit in a publicity stunt by a Ford selling agents in Edinburgh.
Landscape conservation charity, the John Muir Trust, which owns Britain's highest mountain, agreed to allow the replica on the peak.
Outdoor pursuits company No Fuss Events was involved in the attempt.
David Munro, of No Fuss, said 71 people had volunteered to help carry the car to and from the summit, which is 1,344 m (4,409 ft) above sea level.
