A man who subjected a woman in her 60s to a "most appalling" rape attack has been sentenced to 12 years' detention.

Jack Karl Thomas Williams, who was 18 at the time, attacked the woman while she was walking her dog on a Conwy beach.
Mold Crown Court heard he was a total stranger who was high on alcohol and drugs at the time.
Williams, 19, of Mount Road, Rhyl, had admitted kidnapping and raping the woman.
The victim, said to have been completely traumatised, believed she was about to be killed in the attack in which Williams threatened to throw her in the sea.
Judge Rhys Rowlands said it begged the question what would have happened had Williams not been disturbed by a passer-by during the attack at Pensarn Beach near Abergele at the end of August.
The judge said the woman's injuries, which included a fractured eye socket, cuts, bruising and scratches, were "shocking, absolutely dreadful".
"It was a most appalling and protracted incident", he said, in which significant violence was used with additional degradation and humiliation.
It had been devastating and life-changing for the victim, who had feared she would never see her family again, he said.
Matthew Curtis, defending, said it was a terrible crime by an immature and emotionally damaged young man who had been neglected as a child.
In a victim impact statement, the woman said: "My life has changed and I honestly feel it will never be the same for me or my family again. This horrendous experience will only end when I am in the grave."
Williams pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to kidnapping the woman, holding her against her will, inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, and three charges of rape.
He was ordered to register as a sex offender for life and a 10-year restraining order was made banning him from approaching the victim or entering the town where she lives.
Det Insp Iwan Roberts said it was a "horrific, sustained and brutal attack on a defenceless victim".
He said: "I commend and thank the two fellow dog walkers, the first who saw the victim's dog running loose and came to look for the victim and the second who saw Jack Williams and the victim and realised that something was amiss.
"This timely intervention was crucial in saving the victim from further harm, and in alerting the police."
