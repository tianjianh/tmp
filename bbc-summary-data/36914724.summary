A total of 1,400 tickets have sold out for the opening weekend at Bramall Hall in Stockport, Greater Manchester after renovation work began in 2014.
Stained glass windows and ceilings have been restored, while the public will be able to visit the dining room and butler's pantry for the first time.
Councillor Kate Butler, from Stockport Council, called it the "jewel in the crown" of the town's heritage.
The manor dates back to the reign of William the Conqueror when he bestowed the lands upon one of his followers, Hamon de Masci, who became the first Baron of Dunham Massey.
Since then the estate has been under the ownership of just three families: the Davenports, De Bromales and Nevills.
In 1936, the timber-framed hall and its surrounding parkland was handed over to the local council.
The transformation followed a £1.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £400,000 in council funding.
