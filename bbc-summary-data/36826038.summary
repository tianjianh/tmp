[SN]TITLE[SN]
Original Bramley apple tree in Southwell is dying

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The original Bramley apple tree - planted more than 200 years ago and the "mother" of all modern Bramley apples - is dying from a fungal infection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tree was sown by a girl called Mary Ann Brailsford in 1809 in the Nottinghamshire town of Southwell.
It has been neglected since the death of owner Nancy Harrison almost two years ago.
Bio-scientist Prof Ted Cocking, who has cloned the tree, said the people of Southwell should care for the Bramley.
Prof Cocking, from Nottingham University, has studied the tree for many years and used tissue cultures to micro-propagate the tree and create clones of the original Bramley.
"It looks as though it is going to die - although we can never be 100% certain with a tree.
"It is a great shame. Ms Harrison devoted most of her life looking after the tree and entertaining people who came from all over the world to visit the tree.
"Since her death, nobody has looked after the tree. The people of Southwell should club together to care for the tree and the garden - it wouldn't cost much.
"Even if it is dying - we all want to die with dignity. It needs to be nursed in its terminal years."
Prof Cocking said the fungal infection gets into the water transport system of the tree and slowly kills it off - similar to a human's arteries getting clogged up.
Any extra stresses - such as a long hot summer - could hasten its death.
Clones taken by Prof Cocking and his team have now reached maturity and are sold commercially.
He said the fruit has a higher concentration of vitamin C and more flavour than that of the 200-year-old specimen and its descendants.
Sir John Starkey, who sells the fruit, said he asked Prof Cocking to clone the original tree as an experiment to "see how they behaved in commercial conditions."
"They looked more like tomato plants, little thin spindly things. I thought they are not going to survive in the wild but how wrong I was because in a few years they were outgrowing in dimensions and vigour the trees which I had from my nursery men," said.
The Bramley became popular because the apple stores well and keeps its flavour when cooked. About 83,000 tonnes of them are now grown in Britain annually.
According to the The Bramley Apple Information Service, it is not well known outside the UK except in Japan where it is revered.
One Japanese apple farmer said he "nearly cried" when he visited Southwell.
