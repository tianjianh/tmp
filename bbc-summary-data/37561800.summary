The company plans to hire 4,000 staff at its Dunfermline facility, where 1,500 permanent employees are based.
More than 1,000 seasonal recruits are also being sought for its distribution centre in Gourock, Inverclyde.
Amazon is looking to hire more than 20,000 seasonal staff across the UK in the run-up to Christmas.
The company said that it was anticipating its biggest festive period on record, including Black Friday.
Black Friday is the discount shopping day that follows Thanksgiving in America, and signals the start of the Christmas shopping period.
John Tagawa, Amazon's vice president of UK Operations, said: "The thousands of seasonal associates who join us at this time each year play an integral role in helping us deliver an exceptional experience for our customers during the Christmas season."
