The Wales and British and Irish Lions flanker scored a try in each half as Ospreys ran out 39-22 winners to claim their third successive Pro12 win.
Tipuric, who was captain for the day, also had a hand in two more tries in a fine all-round display.
"Justin is a class act. When he plays like that he can be pretty much unplayable," said Tandy.
"He leads from the front and the way in which he plays the game - he doesn't say a lot when he does speak everyone listens."
Tipuric took advantage of a defensive slip by Zebre wing Kayle van Zyl to score his first try, which came two minutes after his pin-point pass had put Eli Walker over for a score.
And in the second half Tipuric dummied and side-stepped his way over from 40 metres before again splitting the defence to set up a try for Jonathan Spratt.
After winning once in their opening six Pro12 games this season, the Swansea-based region have now won three consecutive league matches.
Ospreys top their qualifying pool in the European Champions Cup after a win against Exeter and gaining two bonus points in their defeat at Clermont Auvergne.
And Tandy believes Ospreys are in good shape for their match against Bordeaux-Begles in Swansea on 12 December.
"It's a six day turnaround but we were able to rest some of the players who played in the World Cup so we should be in good shape for that," he added.
