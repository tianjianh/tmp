The 210-room hotel, will include a top-floor bar with panoramic 360 degree views, according to plans drawn up by architects Jestico + Whiles.
It is part of the Â£850m development which is to replace the St James Centre at the east end of Princes Street.
Work is due to start on the development by the end of the year.
The site, which is to have luxury apartments, 30 restaurants and a multi-screen cinema, is due to be completed in 2020.
Heinz Richardson, director of Jestico + Whiles, said: "We are thrilled to have been selected by TH Real Estate to be part of one of the biggest and most exciting regeneration projects currently under way in the UK.
"The contemporary design will be sympathetic to the surrounding World Heritage site and its history, providing a first-class destination for Edinburgh at the heart of the city's new retail quarter."
Martin Perry, director of development TIAA Henderson Real Estate, which appointed Jestico + Whiles, said: "Jestico + Whiles has a well-deserved reputation for its excellent work on a number of prestigious hotel and leisure facilities throughout the world.
"The team demonstrated a thorough understanding and imagination for what we would like to achieve for Edinburgh St James which was reflected in their proposals.
"The final hotel design is likely to be influenced by the operator and given Edinburgh is continuing to prove a highly attractive destination with a growing tourist economy and strong finance market, we are encouraged by the response we have received from interested parties so far."
