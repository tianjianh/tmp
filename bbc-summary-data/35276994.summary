A main road closed by a sinkhole in Neath Port Talbot is being reopened following emergency repairs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police sealed off Cimla Road, Neath, on Thursday morning following its discovery at the bottom of Cimla Hill.
Although it was only 1.5ft (0.5m) wide on the surface, the council said the void below was 20ft (6m) wide and deep.
The road was due to reopen to cars at about 18:00 GMT on Sunday, after the hole was filled with 64 tonnes of concrete and stone.
Local councillor John Warman praised the authority's highways teams for "pulling out all the stops" to get the road repaired.
He described it as one of the busiest roads in the area - feeding 24 junctions, with refuse collections also hit by the closure.
