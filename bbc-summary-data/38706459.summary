[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forfar Athletic moved eight points clear at the top of Scottish League Two after beating Edinburgh City 1-0.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Second-placed Arbroath lost ground on the leaders by losing 2-1 at home to Annan Athletic.
Cowdenbeath missed the chance to move off the bottom of the table as they went down 2-1 to Montrose.
Berwick Rangers, Elgin City, Stirling Albion and Clyde were not in league action, with the latter two drawing 2-2 in the Scottish Cup.
At Meadowbank, David Cox's first-half penalty proved to be enough for Forfar with Aaron Dunsmore having fouled Jamie Bain.
Arbroath went ahead against Annan through Steven Doris' strike but a spot-kick brought Annan level before half time, Darren Ramsay converting after Nathan Flanagan had been felled by Ricky Gomes.
And Raffi Krissian headed the visitors level midway through the second half.
Montrose got the better of Cowden in an eventful match at Links Park.
Gerry McLauchlan's own goal put the hosts in front before the break but they had Matthew Smith sent off for a second booking with 10 minutes left.
Dean Brett struck to bring the visitors level but there was more drama when McLauchlan fouled Gary Fraser in the box.
Fraser scored the resulting penalty but then received a second yellow card for his celebration, meaning the home side finished with nine men.
