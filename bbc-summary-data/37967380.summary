A character-building project run by firefighters is having a positive impact on teenagers, North Wales Fire and Rescue Service has said.

It is aimed at young people who may have been involved in arson and hoax calls or those with low self-esteem and poor communication skills.
During the week-long course, the students learn activities like hose-running drills and fighting fires.
About 2,500 have taken part in the Phoenix Project in the last 12 years.
Watch manager and Phoenix co-ordinator Pam Roberts said: "We want to give them the confidence to achieve things that they maybe thought they couldn't achieve before.
"Even though they may not become a firefighter, we can maybe give them the belief they can achieve things."
The Welsh Government-funded course is aimed at youngsters aged 13 to 17.
As well as fire safety, they are taught search and rescue techniques and risk management.
Community safety manager Gwyn Jones said of the current group: "They're working hard as a team, excellent communication skills going on, and they're making decisions under pressure.
"These are skills that can be transposed to their school life, to their home life, and when they're interacting in the community."
He said the fire service tracks the progress of participants for 12 months after they finish the course and has found two-thirds "do show a marked improvement in their academic achievement, attendance in school and all-round ability to be better members of the community".
Course participant Billy said the most important thing he had learned was "team work and loyalty".
He said: "These aren't my friends, I've walked out with some brothers.
"I would honestly say that they taught us how to be disciplined and be kind to each other."
