The 23-year-old joined Spurs from Swansea in 2014 and has made 68 appearances in all competitions.
"It's a fantastic club to be part of at the moment and you can only see it getting better," the Welshman said.
"If you'd have said this before the start of my career I would probably have been in shock, I wouldn't have believed it."
