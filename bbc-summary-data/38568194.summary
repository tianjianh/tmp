The police said the telephone had no essential components. As a result, no further investigations will be carried out on it.
On Monday, it was revealed Mr Mckeague was due to become a father.
Forbes McKenzie, of McKenzie Intelligence Services which was brought in to assist the search, said the whereabouts of Mr Mckeague's telephone was "key".
Mr McKenzie said: "Where the phone finished is indicative of where Corrie last was.
"I'm very interested in what other phones were co-located with Corrie's phone."
Mr Mckeague's Nokia Lumia 435 phone is thought to have been in a black PVC case which was frayed and worn around the edges.
