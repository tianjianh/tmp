£100k Asian gold burglary gang member jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A member of a gang of burglars that targeted Asian families for their gold has been jailed for four years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nine men were jailed in September after goods worth more than £100,000 across north Wales and parts of England.
Patrick Doran, 30, of Wolverhampton, was given two-and-a-half years at Mold Crown Court after admitting his part in the conspiracy, plus 18 months for a separate burglary in Wolverhampton.
The court heard Doran was sentenced for conspiracy in two of the 37 burglaries.
Doran, who was living at the Ruthin Road Caravan Site, Wrexham, at the time of the offences went with two other conspirators involved in the disposal of stolen goods at a pawn brokers.
Operation Analogue, a joint investigation by North Wales and Cheshire Police, arrested the gang in 2015 after burglaries in north Wales, Shropshire, Merseyside and Cheshire.
The court heard Doran committed another burglary in Wolverhampton of an Asian family while he knew he was wanted by police.
Defending, Philip Tully said married father Doran, the main carer for a severely disabled family member, had mental health problems and had been persuaded by others to get involved.
A previous hearing heard the gang got clothes from charity shops - including Beatle wigs - to disguise themselves.
