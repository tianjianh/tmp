Jamie Ward: Nottingham Forest forward joins Burton Albion on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottingham Forest forward Jamie Ward has joined fellow Championship side Burton Albion on a season-long loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ward signed for Forest in 2015 on a free transfer after his contract with Derby County came to an end.
The Northern Ireland international has made a total of 37 appearances for Forest, scoring four goals.
But Ward has found his first team opportunities limited under Philippe Montanier, with just one league appearance this season.
