[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major street art festival in Aberdeen is officially getting under way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nuart has taken place in Stavanger, Norway, since 2001 but has now been introduced in Aberdeen.
Large and small images have been appearing on city buildings in recent days, and the festival officially runs from Friday until Sunday.
Nuart general manager James Finucane said: "Nuart Aberdeen aims to stimulate debate about what art is, and more importantly, who it is for."
The images have attracted high levels of interest on social media.
Walking tours have been organised to guide members of the public around the various spots.
The organisers hope it could become an annual event.
The festival has been supported by business-led initiative Aberdeen Inspired and Aberdeen City Council.
Adrian Watson, chief executive of Aberdeen Inspired, said: "As well as admiring the wonderful murals and smaller artworks, there is a diverse range of activities on throughout the festival, from chalking workshops and street art debates to exclusive film screenings, walking tours and artist talks.
"This event is on a scale that Aberdeen hasn't seen before and we are delighted to have secured it for our city."
