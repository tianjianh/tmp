Anneka Sherratt, 31, was discovered at her Plymouth home on Monday, where it is thought she may have died on Friday.
Contributions to a fund to support her son aged three and pay for the funeral have reached more than £6,200.
Flowers with messages of sympathy have been left at the door of Ms Sherratt's flat in Savage Road.
"We would like to thank you all for your donations so far," said Emma Louise Fowler who created the fundraising page.
Ms Fowler described how Ms Sherratt had died on Friday, leaving her son behind.
"Anneka was very kind and friendly who would help anyone out," she said.
Ms Sherratt's death is not being treated as suspicious and the cause is yet to be established, police said.
Officers were called to the flat at 13.15 GMT on Monday.
One of the messages left at Ms Sherratt's' door said: "I always cherish and carry you in my heart. I feel so blessed and lucky for our time together."
Another said: "Life will be so hard without you but your memory will live on in me."
Plymouth Coroners' Court confirmed an investigation was opened into Ms Sherratt's death on 25 February.
