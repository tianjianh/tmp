More than 2,000 riders are expected to take part in the Tour O The Borders, compared to just 300 when it began in 2012.
Participants will cover a 75-mile route on roads closed to traffic from Peebles on 9 August.
They will take in Stobo, Tweedsmuir and St Marys Loch.
The team of local cyclists who set up the event claim the route includes "some of the best road cycling terrain in the UK".
They said that the 2015 event will include a new timed hill climb section, improved feed stations, more road signage and an event village at the start area in Peebles.
Event organiser Neil Dalgleish said they were able to develop the improvements with the help of their new partner, Tesco Bank.
Last year's event also started at Peebles, but cyclists travelled through Cardrona, Selkirk, Clovenfords and Roberton.
A report commissioned by Scottish Borders Council found that it generated almost ??200,000 for the local economy.
