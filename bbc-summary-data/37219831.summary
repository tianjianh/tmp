[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hampshire seamer Gareth Berg took five wickets as Yorkshire struggled with the bat on day one at the Ageas Bowl.

Yorkshire's first three wickets went cheaply, including England's Gary Ballance (10) caught behind off Berg.
Jake Lehmann (58) and Tim Bresnan (56) led a middle-order recovery but both were dismissed by Berg (5-54).
Jack Brooks (29 not out) and Ryan Sidebottom put on an unbroken stand of 41 to take the visitors to 275-9 when bad light stopped play early.
Yorkshire, who started five points behind Division One leaders Middlesex, simply could not find any momentum in their innings with wickets falling at regular intervals.
A highlight for the reigning county champions was the form of Lehmann, who registered his first half-century since replacing Travis Head as their overseas signing.
All-rounder Bresnan also continued his fine season with the bat, spending almost two hours and 113 balls at the crease, to make sure Yorkshire edged up towards a competitive total.
Hampshire, who sit eighth and 14 points behind Durham, will realistically need to win at least one of their remaining three games to avoid relegation.
