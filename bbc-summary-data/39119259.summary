Tyrone football captain Sean Cavanagh has entered the debate over claims that the team is under-funded by releasing a statement insisting the Red Hand squad is "very well resourced".

Last week, an unnamed Tyrone player claimed an "ongoing battle" with the county's GAA board over funding was hurting the team's All-Ireland chances.
Squad member Ronan McNamee appeared to back this up in comments on Monday.
However, the Tyrone GAA board released Cavanagh's statement on Tuesday.
"On behalf of the Tyrone senior football squad [2017], I wish to make it known that we are very well resourced by the county board, Club Tyrone and our other sponsors and brand partners," said Cavanagh's statement.
"Yes, there were some issues of a minor nature but these matters are being addressed. We are most grateful for the continued support of the county board, Club Tyrone and our other generous sponsors."
The frustration about the Red Hand squad's funding was aired in an email sent to Irish radio station Newstalk's Off the Ball programme last Thursday.
"It's becoming impossible to prepare ourselves to win an All-Ireland," said the unnamed player.
"We are told that we need to tighten our belts."
A recent Irish Independent survey listed Tyrone as only being 25th in terms of spending on senior inter-county football teams in 2016.
The county's funding last year was reported to be £17,800 down on the 2015 figure.
Tyrone spent £408,000 on the team in 2016 with the highest spenders Mayo's figure said to be almost £1.4m.
"When we look at the money spent on the preparation of the county teams we are nowhere near the top spenders," continued the player's email.
In response, Tyrone county chairman Roisin Jordan insisted on Friday that the county's GAA board was fully behind the team's efforts to win another Sam Maguire Cup.
"In terms of finance, Tyrone are highly fortunate to have generous backers in the form of corporate sponsors and Club Tyrone," she said in a statement.
"It is incumbent upon Tyrone GAA to ensure their investment is properly applied to GAA purposes.
"Let there be no doubt that everyone within Tyrone GAA are fully behind Mickey Harte and his county team."
Speaking on Monday, squad member McNamee said that there were "constant issues" with mileage expenses.
"Some people don't get paid full amounts of what they would claim," added McNamee, speaking at an event to promote Saturday's Football League game against Monaghan.
"If it has been talked about by players, it's obviously going to affect it [morale] in some way. If it wasn't a problem, they wouldn't be talking about it.
"I'm not sure all of it [letter] would have been as bad as it came out but at the same time, there are things than could improve.
"Money is not everything but it would damn help. So if other teams are the top of the pile are spending 1.6m Euro, they're spending it for a reason."
