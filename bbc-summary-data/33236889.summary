Denise Shields and fiancÃ© Peter Magee have spent the last year planning their wedding on Scotland's Isle of Mull.
But a strike by RMT union members of ferry operator CalMac means the Belfast couple and their guests may not get to the island for Saturday's ceremony.
Denise is now hoping for a last minute intervention help to save her day.
The couple chose Tobermory on the Isle of Mull as their wedding venue after they "fell in love" with it during holidays to the West Highland Yachting Week, one of Scotland's biggest yachting events.
She told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that there was a possibility the wedding could be called-off.
The hotel the couple have booked contacted Denise on Sunday to inform her of the planned industrial action that will affect sailings on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Denise, Peter and most of their families and friends had planned to leave for Oban on Scotland's west coast on Thursday, before catching the ferry on Friday.
Some guests are travelling from as far as Spain and Saudi Arabia for the wedding.
"I'm on the final stages of a panic," Denise said.
"I would quite like the ferry company to come forward with a solution themselves, and possibly the RMT union.
"We can charter a boat but it's incredibly expensive and it has to be at all our own costs, as the ferry company are basically saying it'll only refund our tickets and that's it."
Denise and Peter are both keen sailors, and they hope a good Samaritan with a sizable boat will be able to end their logistical nightmare if CalMac cannot.
"Myself and Peter have been sailing for many, many years and we go to the race week most years, the western islands of Scotland are beautiful."
The hotel has suggested other solutions for the couple, but Denise says they are "not ideal".
"The hotel are being amazing and the only reason we know about the strike is because of the hotel - the ferry company never contacted us.
"They're saying there's the potential of a small boat from a place called Lochaline.
"It's another two-and-a-half, three-hour journey from Oban to get to it and everybody who wants to get to Mull will be waiting for that small ferry."
