The sport has come over from Scandinavia, but is now popular all over the world.
Ice-bikes are different to regular bikes, as their back wheels have been replaced with blades, similar to those on ice skates.
And the front wheels have spikes on them to help grip into the ice.
BBC Sport's Mike Bushell has been checking it out for us!
