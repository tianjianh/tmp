The Battle of the Somme took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916, fought by the armies of France and Britain against Germany.
To mark the centenary, a battalion of the Welsh Regiment, known as the 'Swansea Pals', will be remembered.
Of 1,200 men, 100 were killed in the Battle of Mametz Wood in summer 1916 and 600 in the conflict altogether.
An exhibition in Swansea Museum's main gallery focuses on the stories of men from Swansea who went to fight.
It also explores the stories of conscientious objectors and reveals the struggles faced by women who were left behind.
"It's vital we do all we can to recognise their sacrifices," said councillor Robert Francis-Davies.
On Friday 19 August, the Swansea Pals Re-enactment Group will give performances while there will be talks on the trenches and equipment used.
The talks are part of a series of events in the city taking place up until 2018 to mark 100 years since the conflict.
