From 4 April, the three-hour courses will be rolled out across the UK.
They will be delivered by the Freestyle Football Federation's Daniel Wood and British four-time freestyle football world champion Andrew Henderson.
The aim is to improve balance, touch, body awareness, and self-confidence, as well as bring health benefits.
The teachers and coaches will also be shown how to create the right environment for young people to express themselves.
It follows a pilot scheme at Hackney Marshes, which saw 25 participants take part in the training sessions with the support of the London Borough of Hackney.
From June 2016, the scheme will be launched globally in regions including North American, Europe and China.
Former Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris St Germain star Ronaldinho, who is a global ambassador for freestyle football, said: "Freestyle Football is my beach.
"I have always enjoyed to freestyle and I'm honoured to be a part of the Freestyle Football Federation to help grow the sport and improve healthy lifestyles for young people all over the world".
