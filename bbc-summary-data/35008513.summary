Plans have been drawn up to create replica trenches alongside the original ones as a tourist attraction in the grounds of Bodelwyddan Castle.
Councillors have been recommended to approve the proposals at a planning committee meeting next week.
A decision was deferred to await results of the archaeological study.
The trenches, used by soldiers based at Kimnel Park Camp in 1915, have filled in over time.
Cadw, the Welsh government's historic environment service, said the scheme would have an impact on the area, which is a Grade II historic park, and the views within it.
And the Welsh Historic Gardens Trust lodged an objection, claiming it would "interrupt an undisturbed area of parkland".
Apart from a few finds, the archaeological study concluded that the area was likely to have been left "mostly untouched since it was agricultural land".
Recommending the scheme be approved, the report said: "It is accepted that there will be views of the trenches and this will be in place of currently undisturbed gently sloping grassland, but again given the tourism and history benefits of the scheme such a visual appearance is considered to be appropriate."
