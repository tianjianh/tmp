Heavy rain and flooding has led to the early closure of Farnborough International Air Show amid "safety concerns", organisers have said.

The Hampshire site was evacuated on the show's opening day after trade stands were left without power. Flying displays were also cancelled.
The biennial show runs until Friday and organisers said Monday's tickets would be valid on Tuesday.
The event boasts about 1,500 exhibitors and 100,000 visitors each year.
Farnborough airshow tweeted: "Disappointing to close today's show early. However, we expect to run a full programme of events tomorrow and for the rest of the week."
Marc Curant, who was at the show, said the airfield "looks like an an ocean".
