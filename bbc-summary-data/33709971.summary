Northwich bridge petition draws 1,200 signatures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 1,200 people have signed a petition calling for a new bridge on a main route in Cheshire, amid complaints the existing one causes 40-minute traffic jams

The swing bridge over the River Weaver Navigation at Northwich was built in 1908 but is only one lane wide.
Parish councillors behind the petition describe rush hour as "mayhem".
The campaign also has the backing of the area's MP, Chancellor George Osborne.
Cheshire West and Chester Council said a feasibility study would start soon.
The Winnington Turn Bridge, which is part of the A533 between Northwich and the M56, is a Grade II listed structure and was one of the earliest swing bridges in Britain to have electric power.
Vehicles can cross from both directions, but Dilys Hooper, the chairman of Barnton Parish Council, says waiting times of 40 minutes are common during rush hour in term time.
"It's just sheer mayhem, completely. It's a case of who can get across the bridge first," she said.
Land across Northwich has been earmarked for at least 4,300 new homes.
Ms Hooper said this would have a "phenomenal" impact on traffic, and claims the bottleneck is damaging the local economy.
"At the moment the majority of people shop at Runcorn, Chester, Stockton Heath or even Warrington, because - within the 40 minutes it takes to cross over the bridge with the traffic - I can be in the centre of Chester."
The northern side of the river navigation is within the Tatton constituency of Chancellor George Osborne, who said the traffic queues were "unacceptable".
"â€ŽI believe there is a real need to build a second bridge between Barnton and Winnington and I have taken up the case with the local council, [neighbouring MP] Graham Evans and the transport secretary."
