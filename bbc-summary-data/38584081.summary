Inspectors at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in October said the room's bed frame and stirrups were rusty and a mattress cover was damaged.
The hospital was praised for hand-hygiene and general cleanliness.
An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokeswoman said all the requirements had now been addressed.
During the inspection concerns were also raised about stained incubator mattresses and the safe storage of breast milk.
Concerns had been raised about breast milk storage at the hospital in 2014.
The Health Improvement Scotland inspectors ordered the health board to take action in six areas, including safe storage of breast milk, and ensuring the emergency birthing room and equipment was clean.
The watchdog said improvements were seen at a follow-up inspection the next day.
Inspectors said the standard of equipment cleanliness had "markedly improved", and the damaged mattress cover on a specialist piece of newborn equipment had been replaced.
Claire Sweeney, from Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said a return visit was made a week later where they had been "satisfied that key improvements had been made".
She said: "We will continue to monitor the cleanliness of Princess Royal Maternity Hospital at future inspections."
A NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokeswoman said: "We have put in place revised cleaning schedules in the emergency birthing room, replaced mattresses and implemented further staff training in infection control and safe storage of breast milk.
"We are delighted that the inspectors found good compliance in a number of areas including high standards of cleanliness in wards and departments and uniform policy."
