During the nine weeks to 2 January like-for-like sales were weaker, compared to the previous year.
It blamed "warmer and wetter" weather across Europe before and over the Christmas period.
However, parent company Associated British Foods, said that in the 16 weeks to 2 January Primark's total sales rose by 3%.
Overall, AB Food's group revenue fell by 2% over the same time, with the company's agriculture businesses hit by lower commodity prices.
AB Foods maintained its profit outlook for the year saying it expected a modest fall in operating profit as a result of the strong pound.
In November, AB Foods reported a 30% fall in pre-tax annual profits to Â£717m following falls in food prices and significant currency movements.
