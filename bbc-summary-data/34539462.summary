Roberto Mancini says he expects his former club Manchester City to win the Premier League title this season.

The Inter Milan boss guided City, now managed by Manuel Pellegrini, to a first league title for 44 years in the 2011-12 season.
He also won the FA Cup during his three-year spell, and clearly his affection remains.
"I think that we win the league - Manchester City will win the league," he told BBC's World Football programme.

Mancini was sacked in 2013, exactly a year after winning the title, and is now back for his second spell at Inter after a short stint in Turkey with Galatasaray.
"I was really proud about what I did in Manchester because we changed the situation there after many years," he said.
"Seven or eight years ago, they played for relegation or mid-table. In the last four or five years Manchester City is the best team in the Premier League."
Mancini joined City after his first spell at the San Siro, where he was succeeded by Jose Mourinho. The current Chelsea boss went on to win the Champions League with Inter but is now struggling in his second spell with the Blues.
"I think Chelsea are like Juventus," said Mancini, referring to the Italian champions who currently lie 10 points behind Serie A leaders Fiorentina.
"They had problems at the start of the season, but, for me, they will come up in two or three months.
"They have a good team and a good manager. I don't think they will have a problem to get a Champions League position."
