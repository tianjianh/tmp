This dramatic picture by Ricardo Matiello shows the spire of Maringa Cathedral in Brazil on a foggy morning.
The annual Al Marmoum Camel Race in Dubai was shot from above by Shoyab.
The user Dronarium captured this image of Amalfi on the west coast of Italy.
Alexandre Salem shot this image on his drone high above the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Salem said: "One of my favourite activities is to take the drone for hiking trips in nature. On this day, after a walk of two hours, I arrived at the feet of the Christ the Redeemer statue. The evening and the beautiful sun beating on the back of the statue created the perfect combination for this photo."
This beautiful island image was made by the user Marama Photo Video who said: "We were waiting for sunset, drinking a Hinano, installed in warm water, rain was behind us, a rainbow appeared, this is Tahitian life."
Early one morning as the water slowly turned Mont Saint Michel in Normandy, France, into an island once more, Jeremie Eloy was on hand to record the moment with his drone camera.
Alexandre Salem's picture shows a church in Paracatu that was caught in a mudslide in Brazil caused by a mining accident.  At least 17 people were killed when the dam burst in the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais, polluting rivers and destroying farmland over a vast area.
Alejandro Ochoa caught the moment a cliff diver plunged into the sea from the diving platform in Mazatlan, Mexico. The platform is nearly 50ft (15m) high and the divers perform for tourists during the afternoon.
This picture of a hole drilled into a frozen lake by fishermen in Lake Turgoyak in Russia was taken by Maksim Tarasov.
A wedding in Aburi, Ghana, was captured from an unusual angle by Aeroshutter.
