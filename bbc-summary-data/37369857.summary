The USA captain has been undergoing medical evaluations since last month, his club Seattle Sounders revealed.
The 33-year-old, who spent seven years playing in England, returned to training with Seattle on Wednesday.
"You can't just say, 'Clint's important to us'. You have to mean it. And that means Clint's health comes first," said Seattle general manager Garth Lagerwey.
