[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dundee United 1-1 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk remain nine points behind Championship leaders Hibernian after finding a late equaliser at Tannadice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Murray shot Dundee United ahead on 50 minutes, racing clear and slotting a shot under Robbie Thomson.
Soon after, Murray smacked the post with a looping shot, while Thomson did well to keep out a Tony Andreu effort.
Luke Leahy nodded in a James Craigen free-kick and the Bairns almost snatched victory when Scott Shepherd hit the post from close range.
The top four all drew, with Hibs and Morton sharing the same scoreline at Cappielow.
The Greenock side can overtake the Bairns if they win their game at hand against local rivals St Mirren on Tuesday, while United can close to within a point of Falkirk if they beat Dunfermline on the same evening.
The first half at Tannadice was a tepid affair, with very little goalmouth action.
However, United were roused by Murray's smart break and finish and they will rue a series of missed chances.
Leahy's header arrived on 83 minutes, with Peter Houston's side then going on to look the likelier side in the closing stages.
