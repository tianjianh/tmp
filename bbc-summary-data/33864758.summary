A Devon teenager has described his actions as "instinct" after he saved his dad's life while fishing at sea.

Tyler Gywnne, 14, called the coastguards while pinning down his father, who was "thrashing around" having a seizure in a 16ft (4.9m) boat two miles off Plymouth.
"I just went with my instinct and did the best I could," Tyler said.
Shaun Gwynne, 53, was rushed to hospital by ambulance after being taken ashore by the lifeboat.
The pair had been fishing near Fort Picklecombe, two miles off Plymouth Sound on Saturday, when Mr Gywnne started to feel unwell.
The former lorry driver kicked and damaged the boat's engine, leaving them floating, during the first of two fits he suffered on the boat.
He said his son's actions prevented him from falling overboard.
"I started to deteriorate, lost my vision and then started to convulse. I blacked out and my son took over," he said.
"It's absolutely amazing, he's beyond his years - I can't thank him enough. I owe him my life."
Tyler alerted the Plymouth inshore lifeboat which transported Mr Gywnne to Millbay Docks where an ambulance was waiting.
Tyler, who received an award in 2011 after caring for his father when he had his left leg amputated, said he was able to remain calm.
"I didn't panic really, if you panic it can make things worse," Tyler said.
"I got him into a safe position to make sure he didn't go over the side of the boat because that could have led to more problems.
"Looking back at the situation, it could have been a lot worse, so I'm glad how it went."
Mr Gywnne told the Plymouth Herald that the reason for the seizures was still unknown, but he would be tested over the next few weeks to determine the cause.
