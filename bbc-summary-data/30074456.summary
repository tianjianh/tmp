"Surreal" is how Zoella described the experience of joining high profile musicians to sing on the new Band Aid 30 track.

She, along with fellow YouTubers Alfie Deyes and Joe Sugg, was invited by Bob Geldof to join in on the chorus of the revamped version of Do They Know It's Christmas?
"It was really fun (and scary)," she later told fans during a Twitter Q&A.
One Twitter user said Geldof's decision to include YouTubers was a "fail".
Zoella responded: "If you were asked to help raise awareness and money for Ebola by Bob Geldof would you seriously say no?
When the same person added that Geldof should not have asked them to join in, Zoella said: "I'm afraid that's not your decision.
"Have a nice day! Hope you enjoy the song :)"
One Direction, Emeli Sande, Bono and Sam Smith are among some of the stars appearing on the song, which aims to raise money to help the Ebola crisis in West Africa.
Many of the musicians dropped other commitments in order to be a part of the fundraising.
Rita Ora was the first to record her lines and left early so she could travel to Salford to film BBC One's The Voice.
Ed Sheeran flew in from his tour in Germany, while Bastille cancelled two US arena gigs to be involved.
Tweeting after the recording, Joe Sugg wrote: "Well.. Today has been eventful! But AMAZING! Feeling so grateful for all the amazing opportunities that have come my way."
Alfie Deyes shared a picture of Harry Styles going in to the recording studio and also posted: "Today has been the most surreal day of my entire life."
He added: "I'm so thankful to be involved with @BandAid30! Let's make a real change."
