Henri Gonay, from Belgium, died in June 1944 after his aircraft crashed into a farm.
The road at the northern end of Route de Grantez, St Ouen, which was unnamed, has been called Rue Henri Gonay.
Parish Constable Michael Paddock said: "He was a well-decorated pilot and was part of the forces which helped to secure our future."
A number of Belgian delegates attended a ceremony to mark the unveiling.
