Australia captain Stephen Moore is proud of how his team-mates "hung in there" to snatch a 23-22 victory late on against Scotland at Murrayfield.

The Scots led 22-13 early in the second half, but Tevita Kuridrani's converted try four minutes from the end won it for the Wallabies.
"I was proud of how the boys stuck to the game plan," said Moore.
"I knew when we were within six that we just had to keep going at it, that we would get an opportunity."
For an hour Scotland played with impressive variety in attack and extraordinary aggression in defence. They were rewarded through a brace of tries from centre Huw Jones on his home debut, with lock Jonny Gray capping a towering display with his own five-pointer.
The Aussies had crafted a beautiful first-half try of their own, Reece Hodge finishing off a first-phase backs move of stunning precision.
As they fought to repel the onslaught from an inspired home side, Bernard Foley kept the Wallabies in touch with three penalties, and Kuridrani's late try saw them home for the win.
"I thought Scotland played very well," Moore said. "They did a lot of good things.
"We said they'd be strong up front and they were. They've got some very lively backs.
"Of course it's always better to be on the right side of the result. We know what it feels like to be on the other side. I feel for Scotland, it's not a nice way to finish the game. We've got enormous respect for them as a team and we're very happy with the result."
Australia head coach Michael Cheika admitted the Scots did not allow his men to get into their stride, and was delighted to come through such a tough examination.
"We didn't get the cleanliness of our game that we wanted but I know there are going to be games like that on this tour where you've just got to scrap it out and we were able to do that," Cheika explained.
"Scotland spoiled us a fair bit at set-piece and they put pressure on us on the ground so we weren't able to get the flow we wanted to in attack. Second half we squared our defence away, got our line-speed back up and started getting back into the contest from there.
"At half-time we said it's not attack that's going to win us this game it's defence. We'll always back ourselves to score a try. We limited their line-breaks in the second half and stayed in the contest.
"They've improved a lot Scotland. Their footy's really improved, they've got fine players. Their domestic teams are playing much better and are competing at high levels. There's no gimmes in this game."
