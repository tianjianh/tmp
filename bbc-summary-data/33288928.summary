Architect Sir Terry Farrell said his designs will eliminate queues and speed up passenger transit at the West Sussex airport.
The plan for a new runway at Gatwick is one of three options being considered by the Airports Commission.
It is expected to report within days on whether Gatwick or one of two scheme at Heathrow should be approved.
Sir Terry said a second runway at Gatwick would "turbocharge" economic growth in the South East in the same way the 2012 Olympics had benefited east London.
He said: "Our proposals for Gatwick are not just for another runway but an entirely new world-class airport for London and the UK."
