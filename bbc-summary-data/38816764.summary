The 21-year-old has made one senior appearance for the Canaries, and has been involved in their EFL Trophy Under-21 side this term.
He scored eight goals in 33 games for Scottish side Hamilton Academical last term, and previously spent time at Oxford and York.
"He's really mobile, direct," Millers boss Paul Warne said.
"He's really hard-working and really athletic, which is what I want. He's a good age and he's friends with Tom Adeyemi here, so Tom knows him and has explained how the club works and he's really keen to come in and play."
