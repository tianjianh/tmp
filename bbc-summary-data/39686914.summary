Should Roberts feature in the showpiece against Aberdeen, it will likely be his last appearance for Celtic, with his 18-month deal up in the summer.
"I want to go out the best way possible," Roberts told BBC Scotland.
"To win the Scottish Cup would be a huge honour, especially if it won us the treble."
As things stand, the winger will report to the Premier League side for pre-season training, but he remains unclear where his long-term future lies.
The England Under-20 international has thrived under Brendan Rodgers this season, scoring seven goals, including a fine individual effort against his parent club in the Champions League.
"I haven't decided what's going to happen," Roberts said. "My loan spell ends and I'll be at City for pre-season, but I'm going to play my future by ear and see where it takes me next year."
The 20-year-old has enjoyed his stay in Glasgow.
"It has been wonderful," he said. "I couldn't ask for anything more and it's been a huge achievement for me this year.
"Coming to a club like this, you've got a huge expectation to win trophies, play well and I feel I've done that this year and come on leaps and bounds.
"All I wanted to do was show these fans and show the world what I can do."
Celtic are unbeaten in domestic football this season, lifting the League Cup in November then wrapping up the Premiership title earlier this month.
The Parkhead side eased past rivals Rangers 2-0 in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final to leave them one game away from clinching a first treble since 2001.
"That was the aim at the start of the season - the League Cup, the league was done a few weeks ago and the last one was to get into the cup final," Roberts added.
"We did that quite comfortably, I felt.
"It was a well-played game from us and we deserve to be in the final."
