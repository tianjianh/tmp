The officers, who speak Italian, are being sent in a bid to make Chinese tourists feel safe during the peak tourism period, said Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano.
"If the experiment is successful, we will expand it to other cities in Italy," he said.
Around three million Chinese tourists visit Italy annually.
Mr Alfano said that Italian officers would also soon be heading to Beijing and Shanghai to patrol alongside Chinese officers.
