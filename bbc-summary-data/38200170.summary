[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He is due to meet business leaders in New York.
He will also have bilateral meetings with senior political figures, including former US Senator George Mitchell and President of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass.
Mr Brokenshire will provide updates on the UK government's priorities in NI.
The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said these included "political stability, economic prosperity and keeping people safe".
He will also highlight ongoing engagement between the UK government, Irish government and the NI Executive in the wake of the vote for Brexit.
Mr Brokenshire said US investors and businesses would find "outstanding opportunities in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom as a whole".
He said he was determined to "maintain and strengthen the unique relationship between the UK, Ireland and the US which is founded on centuries of shared history, geography and trade".
"Hard-won political stability makes Northern Ireland an outstanding place in which to invest and do business."
"In New York I am making clear to US partners that the UK government is doing everything possible to build on recent progress and create the right conditions for an even brighter future.
"This is a timely visit. The decision of the people of the UK to leave the EU is one of the most significant acts of British post-war history and we are determined to make a success of it.
"As we build on our strengths as an open, dynamic trading nation and forge a new global role, the enduring relationship with our friends and partners in America will be crucial."
Mr Brokenshire is expected to highlight the expertise of Northern Ireland firms during his meeting with US business leaders.
The US is Northern Ireland's number one foreign direct investor and is "an important trading partner, accounting for over a fifth of Northern Ireland's exports in 2015", said the NIO.
