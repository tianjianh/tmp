[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Nick Compton makes 11 on return for Middlesex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England batsman Nick Compton made just 11 on his return to competitive cricket for Division One leaders Middlesex against Surrey at Lord's.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Compton had taken an indefinite break from cricket following the Test series against Sri Lanka, but he and Middlesex struggled as they were reduced to 45-2.
Nick Gubbins made 82 before he was bowled by Zafar Ansari (2-61) as Middlesex ended the day on 249-5.
Earlier, Ben Foakes finished 63 not out as Surrey finished on 415 all out.
Middlesex opener Gubbins hit 14 fours and one six to record his sixth half-century in the County Championship this season.
Compton, 32, scored just 51 runs in five innings during England's Test series win against Sri Lanka and had not played since the third Test at Lord's in June.
His return to action was short-lived as he was bowled by Stuart Meaker (1-65) and Middlesex struggled to get going, as their middle-order batsmen made starts but could not capitalise.
John Simpson will begin day three on 52 not out as the home side look to reduce their 166-run deficit.
