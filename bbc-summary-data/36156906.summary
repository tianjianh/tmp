[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Retired police officers who served in South Yorkshire in the 1980s have been told to be proud of their work, despite the Hillsborough inquests' verdict.

A message on a website for the force's retired officers said they had served dedicated and courageous careers.
The force's current chief constable was suspended on Wednesday because of the approach the force took to the inquest.
A statement by the retired officers said they were "proud" 200 of them had co-operated with the proceedings.
After hearing more than two years of evidence, jurors concluded the 96 victims of the disaster were unlawfully killed and there were police failings.
They found Liverpool fans were not to blame for what happened.

The message on the website of the South Yorkshire branch of the National Association of Retired Police Officers (Narpo) was made public by accident.
In the message, South Yorkshire Narpo secretary Rick Naylor said former officers had "great sympathy" for the families and friends of the victims killed.
"Mistakes were made and we would all like to turn the clock back," he wrote.
But despite criticism of the force in the wake of the jury's conclusions, his message pointed out "there were many examples of outstanding actions and selflessness by police officers on that tragic day as they did their best to deal with the disaster unfolding before them".
Mr Naylor said in his message that the group had tried to remain dignified while "bile and hatred" was directed towards the force.
He said South Yorkshire Police had faced "immense challenges" in the 1980s, including Hillsborough and the Miners' Dispute.
"Along the way we caught the Yorkshire Ripper!" he wrote.
"You will be feeling sore, angry and disheartened, but you did a good job - we all did," he added.
The comments were later removed from the website and Mr Naylor said they had not been intended for public consumption and were not designed to offend.
He was a co-signatory on a later press statement by the group, which said that many of the force's former officers - some of them elderly and in failing health - had voluntarily travelled to Warrington to give evidence at the inquests.
Many of them had also made statements to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and Operation Resolve, a criminal investigation into the disaster, the statement added.
"This was completely voluntary as there was no legal obligation to submit themselves for interview."
Jurors at the inquests pinpointed police failures before and after the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
On Tuesday, after their conclusions were delivered, chief constable David Crompton admitted the policing of the match was "catastrophically wrong" and "unequivocally" accepted the findings.
The next day, the force's Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings said there had been an "erosion of trust" and he had no choice but to suspend Mr Crompton.
Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham accused the force of "retelling discredited lies" during the inquests.
The MP, who has backed the campaign for justice for the Hillsborough victims, said lawyers representing retired officers "threw disgusting slurs" about victims in court.
Families of those who died have called for criminal prosecutions to follow the hearings.
Two ongoing investigations into the disaster and its aftermath could finish by the end of this year.
A police inquiry is looking at the lead-up to the crush on the day of the match, while a separate inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating allegations of a cover-up.
