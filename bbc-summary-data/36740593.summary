France reaching the final of their home Euro 2016 is helping to bring back a feelgood factor in the country, says manager Didier Deschamps.

Les Bleus beat world champions Germany 2-0 in their semi-final in front of a fiercely partisan Marseille crowd.
"We don't have the power to solve the French people's problems but we can ease their worries," Deschamps said.
"There is a lot of passion and fervour. There is a lot of happiness all over France tonight."
There had been security concerns in the build-up to the tournament following the November attacks across Paris, including at the Stade de France, which killed 130 people.
Towards the start of the tournament there were strikes in France and protests in Paris over a labour reform bill, which saw 58 arrests and 29 police officers among 40 people injured.
"We experience the passion when we talk to the people," said Deschamps, whose side face Portugal in Sunday's final at the Stade de France (kick-off 20:00 BST).
"Now the players are well aware of that power, and what they can give to the French people by wearing these colours.
"When you see the passion, inside and outside the stadium, this team has everything it takes to be loved, the players are performing well on the pitch and I'm very proud.
"We are in a final. We have our chance and Portugal have their chance too. It's not as if just because we're hosts and have knocked out Germany that gives us additional power. Portugal believe in themselves, and we believe in ourselves. It's still very open."
"We again have a hero, a striker who can make us win tournaments. Hopefully. What a player."
When those words come from France's all-time top scorer, Thierry Henry, you know something special has happened.
Antoine Griezmann scored both goals against Germany to take his tally for the tournament to six - twice as many goals as anyone else.
"We're very happy. We can start dreaming of 10 July. There's still one match to go to finish with a flourish. It's going to be tricky but I hope this won't be the end. It's our duty to win matches for the French public."
Atletico Madrid striker Griezmann opened the scoring at the end of the first half from a penalty.
It was his first spot-kick from open play since missing in the Champions League final against Real Madrid, although he did go on to score in the shootout which his team lost.
"I missed my penalty in the Champions League final and I really wanted to take a penalty in another important match," the 25-year-old said. "I'm pleased to have taken that decision, and to have scored."
His second goal, after Germany keeper Manuel Neuer failed to full clear a Paul Pogba cross, came midway through the second half.
Griezmann's six goals is the second highest tally for one player at a single European Championship. Michel Platini has the record with nine at Euro 1984 - a tournament which France won as hosts.
He is the joint fourth top scorer in all European Championship games combined - level with, among others, Henry, who took three tournaments to score six.
Platini - who never played in another Euros - and Cristiano Ronaldo, who will face France in the final, are level at the top on nine.
"I'm still very far off Michel Platini and hopefully one day I can get closer to that," said Griezmann, who was famously pictured in tears after Germany beat France in the 2014 World Cup quarter-final.
His strike partner Olivier Giroud said: "It's an emotional night. We will savour this and then tomorrow focus on the next game in three days' time.
"Antoine Griezmann has grown as this tournament has gone on. I'm delighted for him. He gives us a bit extra.
"I'd really like to write a chapter in history. Everyone wants to achieve something great on Sunday."
BBC pundit Henry said: "I am so emotional. It's nice to see that togetherness in the team, and with the fans.
"At the back they were great. The main man Griezmann, we all knew that he had to play this type of game. Germany made two mistakes on the goals but he put them in the back of the net."
About Griezmann equalling his Euros haul of six, Henry said: "What the guy is doing is astonishing. He can score a hat-trick or four goals, I don't care. What a player."
Germany manager Joachim Low was uncertain about his future when asked after the game.
Die Mannschaft have reached the semi-finals in each of the five tournaments Low has managed them in, reaching two finals - their Euro 2008 defeat and 2014 World Cup win.
"I can't predict things from tomorrow. I'm still disappointed. I won't think about that tonight," said Low, whose contract has another two years left to run.
"How I cope with that, it's difficult to answer. We haven't discussed beforehand what we would do after a loss. Maybe tomorrow [Friday] or in two or three days we will talk about that and consider if there is anything to discuss."
He thought his side were unfortunate to lose to France, but now expected Les Bleus to win the tournament.
"I think they will win against Portugal. Portugal has not convinced that much in the games so far. I think France are a very good side," he said.
"But in 2012 or 2010 when we went out, the other sides were better than us. Today that wasn't the case. We were better than the French. We didn't have the luck we needed.
"If we had scored, we could have dominated this match. If you concede in the 44th minute, everyone was shocked. I had to calm the players down in the dressing room."
