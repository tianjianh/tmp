The men, all aged 19, from Ilford, Rugby and Sheerness were arrested on suspicion of endangering the safety of an aircraft, police said.
A report of trespassing at Robin Hood Airport, near Doncaster, was made to South Yorkshire Police on 20 November.
The men are in custody and are being being questioned by officers, the force said.
An airport spokesperson previously said an "incident" took place in a hangar and did not occur in a passenger area.
A video was posted on YouTube but has since been removed.
