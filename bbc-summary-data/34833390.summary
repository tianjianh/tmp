Griefing is a name for a type of bullying that can happen in Minecraft.
It can happen on multi-player games online.
It's when someone damages a person's buildings, sets harmful traps, or steals all of their items on purpose, just to be mean.
This can be frustrating for players, whose hard work can be destroyed very quickly.
Ayshah has been speaking to some of you, who have experienced griefing, and also got some top tips from Youtuber Stampy.
