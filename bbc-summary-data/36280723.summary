Phil Brown: Southend United boss charged with misconduct by Football Association

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend United manager Phil Brown has been charged by the Football Association for misconduct during and after Sunday's 3-2 loss to Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is alleged that from the 93rd minute through to 30 minutes after the game, Brown's language and/or behaviour was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper on five separate occasions.
The Shrimpers lost the game following Ryan Lowe's 94th-minute penalty.
Brown has until 18:00 BST on 16 May to respond to the charge.
The former Hull and Preston boss said after the match that assistant referee Barry Gordon should be "struck off" for his role in awarding the late spot-kick for a handball by Sam McQueen.
