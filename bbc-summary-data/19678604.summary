Surgical ward at Raigmore Hospital closed by C.diff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cancer ward at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness has been closed to new admissions following three cases of the bug Clostridium difficile.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
NHS Highland said two affected patients were still at Raigmore and were being treated in isolation.
A deep clean is now under way at 4C, which is a surgical ward.
NHS Highland chiefs said they were not treating the cases as an outbreak because they had not been traced to a common source.
