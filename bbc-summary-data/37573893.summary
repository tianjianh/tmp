Studio manager Phil Lupton was filmed by the singer in London while riding his motorbike home.
Spears posted the footage on her Instagram account, which has more than 13m followers making Mr Lupton unwittingly famous.
On the footage the 34-year-old singer can be heard saying: "My crush in London. Very hot, very hot, very hot."
Mr Lupton said he only became aware of her affections a couple of days ago when a colleague pointed the video out to him.
He told BBC London his wife "didn't understand the fuss".
