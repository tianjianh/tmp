That was just marginally below the firm's record profit in 2013.
Turnover was up slightly from £91m to £92m.
Randox is one of Northern Ireland's major exporters, shipping to 145 countries.
The firm continued to spend heavily on research and development, with its total R&D spending just over £8m in 2014.
At the end of 2013, the firm bought the former Massereene army base in Antrim to develop into a manufacturing and research facility.
Randox's owner Dr Peter Fitzgerald bought the 1,200 acre Dundarave estate in north Antrim in 2014.
