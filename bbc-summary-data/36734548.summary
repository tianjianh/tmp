[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ivor Bell to face trial in connection with Jean McConville murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Veteran republican Ivor Bell is to stand trial for involvement in the murder of Jean McConville.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Bell, 79, from Ramoan Gardens in west Belfast is charged with two counts of soliciting the murder of Mrs McConville in 1972.
The IRA kidnapped 37-year-old Mrs McConville in front of her children at her home in the Divis flats.
When asked if he had any reply to the two charges he said "no".
He was asked if he wanted to call witnesses, and again he said "no".
The district judge said that following a two-day preliminary hearing last week she was satisfied that the standard proof had been met and there was sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial.
Six of Jean McConville's children were in the court to hear the decision.  None of them wanted to speak after the hearing.
Ivor Bell was released on continuing bail. His bail conditions were amended, and he must now report to police once a week rather than twice.
