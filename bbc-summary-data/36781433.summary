No SNP applause on Cameron's legacy at final PMQs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron's legacy as prime minister will be taking Scotland to the brink of withdrawal from the EU, the SNP's Angus Robertson has told MPs.

Speaking at Mr Cameron's final Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Robertson said he could not applaud such a record.
The prime minister said his successor Theresa May was a "brilliant negotiator" who would secure a good deal for the UK and for Scotland.
David Cameron is due to be replaced as prime minister by Mrs May.
Mr Robertson did however wish Mr Cameron and his family well "notwithstanding our differences".
During a raucous PMQs in which Mr Cameron was loudly praised by his own MPs, the SNP's Westminster leader said: "The prime minister's legacy will undoubtedly be that he has taken us to the brink of being taken out of the European Union, so we will not be applauding his premiership on these benches.
"What advice has he given his successor on taking Scotland out of the EU against the wishes of Scottish voters?"
The prime minister responded that the UK should "should try to be as close to the European Union as we can be, for the benefits of trade, of co-operation and of security".
He added: "The channel will not get any wider once we leave the European Union and that is the relationship we should seek. That will be good for the United Kingdom and for Scotland."
Angus Robertson also used Mr Cameron's final appearance at the dispatch box to attack Mrs May and draw further attention to the Brain family, who are facing deportation from the UK after coming to the Highlands from Australia in 2011.
He told the House of Commons: "The prime minister's successor is very, very well known in Scotland...because of the threat to deport the very much liked and loved Brain family from the Highlands."
Mr Robertson said one of Mrs May's first tasks would be to impose Trident "against the will of almost every single MP from Scotland".
The prime minister said he was hopeful that the Brain family would secure a work visa to remain in Scotland.
Mr Cameron said:  "We've given them an extension to the 1 August to put in an application for a work visa in the normal way, and I very much hope that will happen.
"On Trident, there will be a vote in this house and it's right that this house should decide and many people in Scotland support our nuclear deterrent, maintaining it and the jobs that come to Scotland.
"He asks about the record of this government when it comes to Scotland, well I'll tell him what it is - 143,000 more people in work in Scotland, massive investment in the renewable industries in Scotland, the two biggest war ships ever built in our history built in Scotland, a powerhouse parliament, a referendum that was legal, decisive and fair and, I might add, a Scotsman winning Wimbledon twice while I was prime minister.
"Never mind Indy2, I think it's time for Andy2."
