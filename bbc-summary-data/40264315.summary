Evans will defend his WBO European title in Belfast against Stephen Ormond on Saturday, 17 June.
Listed ninth by the WBO on their world rankings list, Evans is keen to test himself against Flanagan.
"I dream of a crack at 'Turbo'," Evans said. "We've sparred loads of good rounds and Terry knows... I'd give him a competitive fight."
Evans has lost just once in a professional career spanning seven years but admits Ormond represents a step up in class.
"Ormond is probably the best I've faced as a pro," Evans added.
"He's very aggressive and experienced. He should bring out the best in me."
