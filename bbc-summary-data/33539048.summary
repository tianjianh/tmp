Rock star Brian May's pig farm views 'should not take precedence'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queen guitarist Brian May should not be able to influence a planning decision over a big pig farm development in County Antrim, a farmers' union says.

In June, the rock star said a plan for a facility to house up to 30,000 pigs on a Newtownabbey farm was "horrific".
But the Ulster Farmers' Union said a campaign was being orchestrated against the farm.
They said "celebrity views" should not take precedence over those of local people in planning decisions.
The union said Brian May's views should not "weigh more heavily than those of people who live in the area or the thousands who work in processing jobs that depend on supplies coming from local farms".
Farmer Derek Hall has applied to build a large pig production facility on land on the Reahill Road in Newtownabbey as his existing farm has reached capacity.
He said it would be a "state of the art" facility with modern technology to minimise noise and odour issues.
He said the cost of the technology that he is introducing, coupled with tight profit margins in the industry, means the farm has to be of sufficient scale to pay back the money he will need to borrow.
If passed, it will be built in two phases. The first phase will see 15,000 animals housed, with the potential to double that number.
Brian May told the Belfast Telegraph that he was opposed to the scale of the development.
He said he was against what he described as "cruel and degrading" animal welfare conditions on "mechanised" farms.
Mr Hall said animal welfare is at the core of what he is planning.
The UFU said a campaign was being orchestrated against the development because of its scale.
But, it said, in a global context, the Newtownabbey farm was not that big, as some units in Brazil produce more than 100,000 pigs.
Friends of the Earth has circulated an objection letter that it is encouraging people to sign and send to Antrim and Newtownabbey Council.
It said its objections centre on the size of the development and any potential environmental and health impacts.
There has also been opposition to the plan from people who live nearby.
Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council have received 789 letters of objection and will also consider an online petition site that has received more than 200,000 signatures in relation to the application.
Brian May achieved global fame in the 1970s with Queen and has gone on to become an active campaigner, particularly in the sphere of animal rights.
He founded the animal charity Save Me and has spoken out against badger cullings.
