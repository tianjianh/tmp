Election 2015: Why are Cameron, Miliband and Clegg dressed the same?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As each party protests how different they are from the others it appears this may not entirely be the case.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The leaders of the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems appear to have adopted a political uniform of dark blue jumpers over light blue shirts out on the campaign trail.
Whether he's out pressing the flesh on the campaign trail or busy kissing babies, David Cameron looks quite at home in his blue jumper/shirt combination.
And he's not the only one... as Ed Miliband has shown.
Nick Clegg has also adopted the look, meaning that the trio end up looking much the same, while they are trying to persuade voters how different they are.
And it hasn't gone unnoticed on social media... with journalists drawing attention to the political wardrobe malfunction.
