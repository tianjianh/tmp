[SN]TITLE[SN]
Celtic 2-1 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic survived a late Dundee fightback to re-establish an 11-point lead at the top of the Premiership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leigh Griffiths' stunning free-kick put the champions ahead on the stroke of half-time.
Nir Bitton then curled home Celtic's second after the break before Marcus Haber's goal brought the visitors back into the match.
Faisal El Bakhtaoui passed up a glorious chance to claim a point for Dundee as the home side held on.
The win means it is now 20 domestic matches unbeaten for Celtic under Brendan Rodgers, and in addition to their 11-point cushion at the Premiership summit they have two matches in hand over second-placed Rangers.
Dundee are in tenth place, just a point above the bottom but only four points off the top six.
After his winner against Hamilton Academical in midweek, Leigh Griffiths started up front with Moussa Dembele demoted to the bench.
Manager Brendan Rodgers has said that he does not feel Griffiths and Dembele playing together up front works.
Griffiths looked lively from the off. A one-two at the edge of the box gave Griffiths space in the box. His dinked shot came back off the post.
It took until first-half injury time for Griffiths to give Celtic the breakthrough. A free-kick 25 yards from goal and Griffiths dispatched it expertly with his left foot into the corner of the net.
How do you stop Celtic? You need a game plan, and Dundee's plan was to stifle the home side.
A back three? It was more of a back five, with four in midfield. Haber had the job of leading the line.
Celtic were utterly dominant but Dundee had a couple of big chances.
Tom Hateley fired over the bar from the edge of the box but it was Kevin Holt who came even closer. The left wing-back was given far too much time and arrowed a shot narrowly wide of the post.
Haber hit the post in the second half from a corner, as they continued to carry the odd goal threat. His deflected effort then found the back of the net and the complexion of the game changed.
Dundee almost equalised at the death. El Bakhtaoui was clean through on goal but disappointingly for Dundee his shot went over the bar.
Celtic were in charge from the get-go, but despite wave after wave of attacks both sides almost went in at the break level.
The home side should have been well in front after Griffiths hit the post. Tom Rogic then fired over from six yards out when he should have scored.
After an intense period of second-half pressure Celtic made it 2-0. Dundee just couldn't get the ball clear and Bitton curled home an effort from the edge of the box.
On the balance of play Celtic deserved the points.
Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: "The overall performance I was pleased with. It wasn't perfect, that's for sure.
"We dominated the first-half, created a number of chances, some fantastic football. It's very difficult when you play against a team with 11 players behind the ball, but I thought the level of our football was very good. It was wave after wave of attack.
"Second-half we came out started to dominate again, got the second goal and I then think we got a bit carried away. We looked like we maybe thought we could get four or five so then we start to lose our tactical discipline and it then becomes a game of basketball for about 10 minutes. In that basketball period they get the goal, 2-1, and then of course have to control it again.
"We had chances towards the end to close it out for 3-1, but they had an opportunity that they'll be disappointed they didn't do better with. Overall I think the best team won but we need to learn to be better in certain moments in the game."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "I felt the players were terrific today. First half we had a lot pressure against us but they never really cut us open. You see their two goals, they're both from outside the box.
"We get back in the game then Bakhtaoui has a chance. He's gutted in there but we missed other chances.
"When you come here you've got to be clinical and take your chances. We hit the post, Wighton has one, Holt has one in the first-half. We knew they were going to have loads of possession, that was the game plan.
"I thought our players' attitude was first class today."
