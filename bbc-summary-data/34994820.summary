Bath prop Nathan Catt says he is ready for a physical battle with Northampton Saints on Saturday at The Rec.

Both sides have won just two of their opening five Premiership matches.
"We know Northampton are a very good side, it'll be hugely physical, so big set-pieces, scrum battles, big line-out battles," Catt told BBC Radio Bristol.
"It's going to be pretty physical with both those sides looking to win that arm-wrestle in the pack, so it should be good fun."

Catt, 27, signed a new contract with Bath in the week and he said he never had any intention of playing elsewhere.
"I always wanted to stay," he said. "I've been here a long time and came through the academy so I had no interest in leaving.
"I love being here, I love being with the boys so as soon as the opportunity came to sign on with the club it was a no brainer to me."
Catt missed a year through injury after a neck operation and shoulder injury kept him sidelined - but he says he is now close to working his way back to full fitness.
"After the first game I was in absolute pieces," he admitted. "It's going to take time for me to get back up to speed but with every game I'm getting that little bit sharper."
