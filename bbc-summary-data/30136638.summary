[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Ness grabbed the woman from behind as she walked along St Leonard's Bank in the early hours of 25 May.
He pushed her to the ground and, removing her top and bra, placed his hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet.
Ness, who has two previous high court convictions for sex attacks, was placed on the sex offenders' register.
Following his conviction at the High Court in Edinburgh, it emerged Ness, a prisoner at HMP Perth, had also been convicted of attempted rape at the same court in 1988.
He was then convicted at the High Court in Dunfermline in 1992 of another indecent assault .
Jailing him for six years, Lord Glennie told Ness: "You have left your victim traumatised.
"It appears to me that you haven't learned anything from your previous convictions."
