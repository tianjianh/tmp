[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Drivers were asked to avoid the A76 between Dumfries and Courthill and were warned of significant delays.
The road closure, just after midday, came after police also closed part of the town's bypass.
The A75 between the Cuckoo Bridge roundabout and the Bloomfield roundabout was temporarily shut during rush hour.
Dumfries was said to have been at a "standstill".
A Police Scotland spokesman said: At around 12:10, as part of an ongoing intelligence-led operation into alleged drug offences, officers searched a number of areas close to the A76, close to Dumfries.
"The road has now reopened and inquiries continue."
