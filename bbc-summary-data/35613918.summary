Robert Munce, 47, was travelling along the A1 near Newark, Nottinghamshire, in November 2014 when he failed to see traffic was slowing down.
He hit Margaret Nile's car at 60mph, killing the 65-year-old and causing a series of other crashes.
At Nottingham Crown Court Munce admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was given four years.
He was also banned from driving for seven years.
The court was told the crash happened because Munce, of Dunster Walk, Immingham, North East Lincolnshire, was using his phone "for a prolonged period of time".
Det Con Paul Jaycock, from Nottinghamshire Police, said Ms Nile, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, died because Munce was "needlessly distracted by his mobile phone".
"Margaret's family now have to try and rebuild their shattered lives. Their lives... have changed forever," he said.
