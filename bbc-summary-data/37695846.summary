[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigning is in its final day in two Westminster by-elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Voters will choose new MPs for Witney, in Oxfordshire, and Batley and Spen, in West Yorkshire, on Thursday.
Former Prime Minister David Cameron, who stood down as an MP after quitting Downing Street, is being replaced in Witney.
The by-election in Batley and Spen was prompted by the death of Labour MP Jo Cox, who was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire, in June.
Mrs Cox won the seat with a 6,057 majority in 2015.
Labour's Batley and Spen candidate Tracy Brabin is up against nine others representing smaller parties or running as independents.
The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and UKIP have all said they will not be fielding a candidate.
In Witney, the Conservatives are defending a 25,155 majority from 2015, and have chosen barrister Robert Courts as their candidate.
Polls in both constituencies open at 07:00 BST on 20 October.
