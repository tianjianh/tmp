Saturday's game at Tadcaster Albion's i2i stadium in North Yorkshire saw visitors Highworth Town run out 1-0 winners.
Trouble flared at the end of the match with reports Highworth's chairman and goalkeeper were among those injured.
In a statement, Tadcaster officials said they were "devastated" by the "totally unacceptable" violence.
Meanwhile, the visitors from Wiltshire said the scenes were "regrettable and ruined what should have been a celebration of a magnificent achievement for Highworth Town".
The Tadcaster statement said: "We are devastated with the scenes at the end of yesterday's game.
"We will continue to work closely with the police, Highworth Town and the FA.
"We are determined to bring those responsible to account.
"As a club we apologise to everyone who witnessed and were on the receiving end of totally unacceptable behaviour.
"We do however wish to thank the majority of the 1,307 crowd who behaved impeccably."
There have been no arrests.
