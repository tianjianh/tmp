The 25-year-old England international may need surgery on the problem, which forced him off at the City Ground.
However, there is better news for Leicester boss Richard Cockerill on the fitness of centre Manu Tuilagi.
"Manu tweaked his knee and he'll be rested this weekend," Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
"He's fine, he's got a mild tweak of his medial ligament but he'll come back into the squad well before the end of the season."
Victory for Tigers at home to Worcester on Saturday will secure their place in the Premiership play-offs for the 12th year in a row.
