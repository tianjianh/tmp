Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend hopes to get the green light from councillors to install an artificial pitch at their stadium.

The Pro12 club have endured serious problems with the drainage on their current grass surface in recent years.
Glasgow City Council - which owns Scotstoun Stadium - will vote on the club's proposal this week.
"It's fantastic news that we're close to securing a brand new pitch for next season," said Townsend.
"We've played a lot on the Cardiff Arms Park surface over the last few years and we enjoyed playing on the Rugby Park pitch last season.
"We aim to play high tempo rugby and this state-of-the-art artificial surface will help us produce a faster game."
Heavy rainfall forced Warriors to postpone four games last season as the pitch failed to cope.
The club were forced to stage three of those rearranged fixtures at Kilmarnock Football Club's Rugby Park and, after being impressed by the 4G surface laid there, Glasgow have now decided to introduce their own.
Scotstoun is also a venue for athletics events and Glasgow's plan also includes measures to improve athletics and rugby training facilities, create a new area for throwing events and improve the existing outdoor running track.
By opting to go artificial, Glasgow will follow the lead of Cardiff Blues, Saracens and Newcastle Falcons, and veteran wing Sean Lamont has backed the decision.
"We've played on Kilmarnock's pitch a few times and, when its wet, it's a great surface, especially for the style we want to play at Glasgow.
"We're all about fast, top-of-the-ground rugby, so I think a synthetic pitch would be great."
The project will be funded by Glasgow City Council, Scottish Rugby and sportscotland, with work expected to be completed "ahead of the 2016-17 rugby season".
