Teams will face off on Cardiff Bay's floating pitch on Friday ahead of Saturday's showpiece match.
Former Real Madrid and Barcelona midfielder Luis Figo, ex-Juventus star David Trezeguet and Brazil legend Cafu are among those in the squads.
Real Madrid great Emilio Butragueno and Dutchman Ruud Gullit are the managers.
The match kicks off at 16:00 BST ahead of the final between Real Madrid and Juventus at the National Stadium of Wales on Saturday.
Gullit was part of the AC Milan side which was the last team to retain the European Cup, in 1989 and 1990.
If Real Madrid win at the weekend, they will become the first team to win back-to-back trophies in the Champions League era.
Wales' own Ian Rush and Ryan Giggs will line-up alongside one another in Gullit's side.
