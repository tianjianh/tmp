[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Whyte, 23, got out his car to have an argument with Katrina Michie, 46, at a roundabout.
Whyte then reversed into the woman, pinning her leg against the bonnet of her car in October of last year.
Whyte was found guilty of charges including dangerous driving and threatening and abusive behaviour at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.
The father-of-one, of Aberdeen, was also disqualified from driving for two years.
The victim suffered cuts and tissue damage to her leg.
The incident happened at the Tesco roundabout at Persley Bridge, in the Bridge of Don area.
Sheriff Annella Cowan told Whyte: "It's obvious that in moments of frustration you resort to violence.
"You deliberately drove backwards and crushed her leg."
