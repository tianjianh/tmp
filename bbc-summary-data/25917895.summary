[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former teacher is accused of nine offences of indecent assault and one serious sexual assault against a total of five complainants, Greater Manchester Police said.
Four of the alleged victims attended Altrincham Grammar School for Boys and one was at Elgin High, Gateshead.
Mr Talbot, 64, is due to appear before Manchester magistrates next month.
Six counts of indecent assault relate to one alleged victim at Elgin High where Mr Talbot previously taught, police said.
The other offences relate to four alleged victims from Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, where Mr Talbot also taught.
Nazir Afzal, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "We have carefully considered all the evidence gathered by Greater Manchester Police in relation to allegations from five complainants that Fred Talbot sexually assaulted them between the 1960s and 1980s.
"Having completed our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Talbot to be charged with 10 sexual offences relating to five complainants, three of whom were under 16 years of age at the time."
Mr Talbot, of Bowdon, is best known for his work on the ITV programme This Morning in the late 80s and 90s when it was hosted by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan.
He was also the weatherman on ITV's Granada Reports but has not appeared on the show since the claims emerged last year.
