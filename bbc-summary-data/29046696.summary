The ex-England international, who played for United between 1979 and 1984, was most recently assistant to Rene Meulensteen at Fulham, until his dismissal in February.
Wilkins, 57, will be assisted by former Arsenal forward Frank Stapleton.
His first match in charge will be against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur on 11 October.
He will then lead the team at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup in Australia.
A Jordan Football Association statement said Wilkins was chosen "under the guidance of JFA President HRH Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein", who was entrusted with the decision because of "his great vision in leading Jordanian football towards success".
Wilkins, who also played for Chelsea, AC Milan and Paris St-Germain and won 84 caps for England before retiring in 1997, has previously worked as assistant manager at Chelsea.
He also stepped in as caretaker manager at the Blues after Luiz Felipe Scolari was sacked in February 2009.
Wilkins managed Fulham in 1997 but left the following year before becoming assistant at Chelsea.
Former Republic of Ireland international Stapleton, 58, an FA Cup winner with Arsenal in 1979, was player-manager at Bradford City from 1991-94 and also coached Major League Soccer side New England Revolution.
