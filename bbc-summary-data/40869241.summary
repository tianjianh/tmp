Neymar scores on Paris St-Germain debut against Guingamp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neymar scored on his Paris St-Germain debut following his world record £200m transfer from Barcelona.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Brazilian had a hand in all three goals as PSG beat Guingamp to maintain their 100% start to the season.
Jordan Ikoko opened the scoring with an own goal moments after Neymar's pass to Edinson Cavani was cut out.
Neymar then assisted Cavani with an excellent through ball, before the Uruguayan passed to his new team-mate late on to score from six yards out.
The 25-year-old Brazil international, who played on the left side but got involved centrally too, had a bright debut with plenty of flicks and tricks - although most of his shots were blocked before his late strike.
