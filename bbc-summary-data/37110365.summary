D'Agostino, 24, collided with New Zealand's Nikki Hamblin during qualifying in Rio on Tuesday.
Hamblin was left in tears but the pair encouraged each other to continue, despite D'Agostino visibly limping.
The American ran four laps with a torn ACL but will miss Friday's final because of the injury.
D'Agostino managed a few steps after helping Hamblin to her feet before falling to the track, with the New Zealander returning the favour and helping her rival up.
The American hobbled over the finish line, with the two embracing before both runners were put through to the final by the track officials.
However, D'Agostino, who left the arena in a wheelchair, will miss the rest of the season.
"By far the best part of my experience of the Olympics has been the community it creates and what the Games symbolises," D'Agostino said.
