Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and Royal Blood have taken the top spots in the first UK album chart to count streaming data alongside sales.

All three enjoyed a boost after winning Brit Awards earlier in the week.
Smith returned to number one after picking up best breakthrough artist and the global success award.
Sheeran - who won best British male and album - rose to number two, while Royal Blood climbed 15 places to number three after scooping best British group.
George Ezra, who performed at the Brits ceremony on Wednesday, climbed two places to four.
Best international female winner Taylor Swift rose three places to number five - despite having removed her music from Spotify last November, saying free streaming was devaluing music.
She is one of the few stars to resist the rise of streaming, which doubled in the UK in 2014 while CD sales dropped by 8%.
The Official Charts Company has now devised a formula to add streams from services like Spotify, Deezer and Google Play to figures from the sales of downloads, CDs and vinyl.
The formula looks at how many times the tracks on each album have been played.
The figures for the two most popular songs are then reduced to prevent huge hit singles distorting the album chart. If an album has more than 12 songs, just the most popular 12 are counted.
The adjusted total number of streams for the songs on each album is then divided by 1,000, and that figure is added to the physical and digital sales.
Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour sold 38,000 copies in the past week and its streaming figure was 2,900.
Ed Sheeran's X sold 35,000 copies and had a "stream factor" of 3,400.
"Sam and Ed are both established as genuine superstars now - and the fact that they appeal to fans who buy CDs, snap up album downloads and stream music highlights just how broad their appeal is," Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot said.
Streaming was incorporated into the singles chart last July.
Elsewhere on the chart, the 40th anniversary reissue of Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti took it to number six, while Chris Brown and Tyga entered at number seven with Fan of a Fan: The Album.
Paloma Faith's A Perfect Contradiction rose from number 33 to eight following her victory in the best British female category at the Brit Awards.
The track Madonna performed at the Brits, Living For Love, entered the singles chart at number 26.
This week's top five singles are unchanged, with Ellie Goulding spending a fourth week at the top, followed by Hozier; Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars; The Weeknd; and the collaboration between Sir Paul McCartney, Rihanna and Kanye West.
