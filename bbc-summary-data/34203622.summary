Alvaro Morata & Mario Mandzukic score as Juventus shock Man City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City's Champions League campaign got off to a disappointing start with a home defeat by last season's runners-up Juventus.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City, who have struggled to make a serious impact in the Champions League and have never won their opening home game in the group stage, looked to be on course for victory when Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini headed into his own net under pressure from Vincent Kompany.
The Italians protested furiously that Chiellini had been fouled but then produced an impressive response to come from behind and close out the win.
Paul Pogba's superb ball allowed Mario Mandzukic to steal in behind Eliaquim Mangala for the equaliser, then Alvaro Morata pulled substitute Nicolas Otamendi - on for Kompany - out of position before curling a precise left-foot finish beyond City keeper Joe Hart for the 81st-minute winner.
Raheem Sterling had two big opportunities for City but wasted both as Manuel Pellegrini's side find themselves on the back foot once more in the Champions League.
Once again this was a night where City, dominant domestically with five wins out of five in the Premier League, still looked like they are struggling to convince themselves they belong in the exalted company of the Champions League.
Juventus' pedigree is clear - they reached last season's final - but they had not won a game all season until beating City, whose cast-iron confidence in the league looks to be somewhat stripped away here and opponents like the experienced Italians are only too happy to expose those flaws in self-belief.
This even seems to extend to City's fans, anxious throughout and streaming out in droves even before three minutes of stoppage time, clearly not convinced their team would rescue a point.
City missed striker Sergio Aguero, not fully fit after picking up an injury at Crystal Palace and restricted to a brief appearance as a substitute, and they have learned the hard way that chances do not come along as often in the Champions League as they do in the Premier League - and the price for not taking them is an expensive one.
There is still plenty of time to recover but City need to win games such as this if they are to finish top of the group and avoid the potentially hazardous last-16 draw.

Sterling has made a big early impact following his £49m move to Manchester City from Liverpool - but one area of his game still needs some serious work.
The 20-year-old needs to improve his conversion rate when presented with chances and, before his substitution 20 minutes from time, he demonstrated once again that he must be more ruthless when applying that final flourish.
He wasted a perfect early chance when he shot straight at Juve keeper Gigi Buffon, then did the same again later after he was set up by David Silva with City leading 1-0. Yes, they were two pieces of fine goalkeeping but Sterling should have made at least one of those opportunities count.
Pogba was football's most wanted in the summer. The 22-year-old was courted by all of Europe's top clubs, including Manchester City, but a £70m price tag plus the player's own demands made the deal too rich even for them.
The Frenchman made fleeting contributions here but, make no mistake, the player that Sir Alex Ferguson somehow allowed to escape from Manchester United's grasp in 2012 is a class act.
Tall, rangy and more more than willing to mix it in the physical challenges with Yaya Toure, Pogba has that touch of class that marks him out as a special talent.
He always looks for the positive pass, as he proved with the glorious ball in behind Mangala that allowed Mandzukic to equalise for Juventus.
Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri praised the contribution of 37-year-old goalkeeper Buffon, with the Italian World Cup winner making particularly good stops from Sterling.
"Buffon pulled off many miraculous saves, particularly just after we went 1-0 down," said Allegri.
"I hope he will go on for as long as possible, certainly as long as I am manager. Buffon is an extraordinary goalkeeper, perhaps the best ever in the history of football. He never fails."
