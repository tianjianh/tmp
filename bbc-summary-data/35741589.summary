There have been spectacular displays of the Aurora Borealis - better known as the Northern Lights - across parts of the UK overnight.

The colourful phenomenon was visible in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but was also spotted as far south as Anglesey in Wales and Staffordshire in England.
Aurora Borealis occurs when electrically-charged particles from the sun enter the earth's atmosphere.
Many people took to social media to share photographs of the dramatic show.
Forecasters had predicted a solar storm and good conditions for Aurora Borealis, and sightings of green, pink, purple, red and yellow lights were reported for several hours from about 20:00 GMT.
Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: "Well worth getting back out of bed for!!"
Donna Butcher tweeted: "Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria. Shafts of light streaming directly towards Polaris."
