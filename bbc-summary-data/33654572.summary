Ministers received rail upgrade warning 'before election'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ministers were warned before the election that major rail upgrades might have to be delayed, the BBC has learnt.

Network Rail boss Mark Carne said the Department for Transport was told in March that decisions about deferring schemes could be due within months.
The department had previously said it was not told Network Rail's board expected delays until after the election.
Labour accused the government of a cover up.
Shadow minister Lillian Greenwood said the Conservatives had "serious questions to answer" about why they promised rail electrification in their manifesto.
In a letter to shadow rail minister Lillian Greenwood, Mr Carne wrote: "In mid-March 2015, Network Rail informed DfT that decisions may need to be made in the coming months about the deferral of certain schemes."
Mr Carne added Network Rail had recommended another assessment was made before decisions were taken. It was completed after the election.
He said Network Rail, the DfT and the Office of Rail Regulation all knew around 80% of current projects were "at an extremely early stage of development, with inevitably high levels of uncertainty regarding their cost".
Earlier this month, the department said it was not sent a minute from a Network Rail meeting - uncovered by the BBC - revealing such a decision was required until after the election.
It has refused a Freedom of Information request from the BBC to release a document that shows the scale of delays and cost overruns in major rail upgrades.
The assessment was provided to ministers after the election, but commissioned beforehand.
The government put the electrification of two major lines on hold shortly after the election, after receiving an assessment of the state of major Network Rail projects.
Several warnings that the rail programme was in trouble were made public in 2014 and early 2015.
The department said the assessment would remain confidential because ministers and officials were still making decisions about the future of rail upgrades.
They needed "a free space" to reassess rail plans, it said.
Labour has accused the Conservatives of promising to electrify lines in their manifesto knowing the projects would be shelved.
Shadow rail minister Lillian Greenwood said: "Ministers have covered up the extent of Network Rail's problems for months and they are still failing to come clean with passengers and the public.
"There are serious questions to answer over the conduct of senior Conservative politicians who promised to deliver vital electrification projects during the election, only to then shelve them once the ballot boxes had closed."
Calling on Mr McLoughlin to explain, she added: "There can now be no doubt that ministers knew that important projects faced the axe, but they chose to mislead voters in the Midlands and the North instead of admitting the truth."
In a letter responding to queries from the Labour party, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said he first received advice that major programmes should be paused on 15 June - after the election.
He said he had been open about "very significant challenges" to the rail programme as early as December last year, and stressed electrification had been paused not halted.
He wrote: "The government remains committed to the Â£38bn investment through Network Rail and the vital benefits that rail enhancements will provide for passengers."
A new plan for rail upgrades produced by the chairman of Network Rail, Sir Peter Hendy, is to be completed by the autumn.
The electrification of the Trans-Pennine and Midland main line routes was put on hold in June.
The department also refused to release any correspondence with Network Rail that could show warnings of problems so serious they might lead to the pause in electrification.
It said the information would cost too much to produce.
The Freedom of Information Act allows departments to refuse to release information related to developing government policy, or documents that would cost more than Â£600 to produce.
