NIE worker stung by swarm of bees that built hive in electricity meter box

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Northern Ireland Electricity worker got more than he bargained for when he went to take a meter reading in County Armagh.

He was checking the box in a house at Belleeks when he was confronted by a swarm of angry honey bees. They had built a nest around the meter.
He was stung up to 10 times on his face and neck and had to run for safety.
NIE's meter reading manager said the incident could have been more serious if the worker had a bee sting allergy.
"Obviously we have a duty of care to our staff member, but we didn't want to see the bees destroyed." Cormac McCamphill told the BBC.
Instead, NIE called in an expert from the Ulster Beekeepers' Association.
Darren Nugent used a homemade suction device to remove the bees.
He cut out the comb and transferred it to a hive at his home in Kilkeel, County Down.
"I just sucked up every bee I could see and took a chance that the queen was in there," Mr Nugent said.
Luckily, she was and now the bees have successfully relocated.
"They're none the wiser that they were moved and they're as happy as they were in the meter board," he added.
Mr McCamphill said his staff sometimes had to deal with animal hazards like livestock and dogs, but this was the first time that they had encountered bees in a meter box.
Mr Nugent said the bees appeared to have been in the box for about eight weeks.
"There was a fair bit of honey in there. I shared some with the farmer who owned the house and and took the rest home.
"I'd say we got half a dozen jars of honey out of it."
"They were doing well in there.  In fact, they were doing better than some of the bees in the hives outside my house."
