Cecil Henry Hight, 22, was brought down by German bombers during a combat mission off Portland on 15 August 1940.
He bailed out of the plane and deployed his parachute, but it failed to open.
The memorial has been placed at the crash site where the fighter came down on the corner of Leven Avenue and Walsford Road.
The Portland stone was unveiled on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain by Mayor John Adams and MP Conor Burns.
It is thought once shot, he piloted the plane away from the centre of Bournemouth to avoid killing civilians.
Cecil Hight, originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, served as a pilot officer with the RAF's 234 Squadron based at Middle Wallop, Hampshire.
He was buried with full military honours in Boscombe Cemetery.
After the war Pilot Hight Road in West Howe, Bournemouth was named after him.
In 2010 a new road sign was installed bearing a picture of a Spitfire in tribute.
