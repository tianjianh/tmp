Taylor Jones, 15, was told that his "extreme hairstyle" was inappropriate when he returned after the holiday.
Launceston College, in Cornwall, says he is being given "individual specialist tuition" for four days until it grows back.
But Taylor's mother Lesley says he should not be punished for trying to help others.

Mrs Jones said her son had decided to raise money for Cancer Research UK after a friend was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
He had been growing his hair for months in preparation for the event, which he had planned for June.
But Mrs Jones said she and her husband encouraged Taylor to move the shave forward to Easter, because his hair was so long it was covering his face.
When he returned to school he was told he would have to spend his school days in an "exclusion room", Mrs Jones said.
She said: "Everywhere has rules, but I just think in this circumstance, they could make an exception."
"They could have had an assembly and recognised what Taylor had done, but pointed out that normally, this haircut wouldn't be appropriate for school."
Launceston College said Taylor would have individual specialist tuition for the four days he would not be in lessons.
Principal Bryan Maywood said: "After this period his hair will no longer be considered an extreme hairstyle; he will return to normal lessons."
According to the college, Taylor was advised before the holiday to have his hair cut to a "very short but acceptable length".
Mr Maywood said Taylor "went against this advice" by having it cut "extremely short in the days immediately before term began".
