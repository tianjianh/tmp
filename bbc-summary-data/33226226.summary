Fire-hit Oxfordshire council is to open to the public

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two councils left without offices after a major fire will open to the public on Monday for the first time in six months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse offices in Crowmarsh Gifford were gutted by a fire on 15 January.
Last month workers moved to a new base at Milton Park, in Abingdon, after the councils signed a four-year lease.
Andrew Main, 47, from Rokemarsh, admitted starting three fires and was detained in a mental health unit.
People will be able to visit the office in Eastern Avenue from Monday, June 29.
Matthew Barber, leader of Vale of White Horse District Council, said: "I think we all responded well to the fire, and whilst we've kept disruption to a minimum over the past six months, it'll be good to restore a bit of normality.
"Staff have been scattered everywhere, so it's a relief to be under one roof."
Since the fire some staff were housed in temporary accommodation in Abingdon and Sandford-on-Thames, and others worked from home.
The council has not yet decided what it will do with the Crowmarsh site, which was destroyed by the fire.
