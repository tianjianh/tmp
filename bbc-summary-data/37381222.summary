[SN]TITLE[SN]
Championship: Preston North End 1-0 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jordan Hugill's early goal gave Preston victory over north-west rivals Wigan and extended the Latics' winless run to seven Championship games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hugill diverted Aiden McGeady's shot past Wigan keeper Adam Bogdan in a first half of few chances at Deepdale.
Nathan Byrne hit the post for Wigan early in the second half after being denied by a good Chris Maxwell save.
The defeat was the visitors' seventh in all competitions so far this term. They last won away from home in April.
Ben Pearson almost doubled Preston's lead late on but struck narrowly wide, as Simon Grayson's side moved above Aston Villa into 18th before the rest of the weekend's fixtures.
The two sides had not met in the league since April 2005 and Preston had not enjoyed a home win over the Latics since a fourth-tier meeting in the 1994-95 campaign.
The hosts started brightly and were rewarded with Hugill's opening goal on seven minutes, as he deflected in McGeady's effort from the edge of the area.
Wigan had the greater share of possession but lacked a clinical edge in the final third and remain in the bottom three after nine games.
