Eight people were killed and 48 injured when three men hit pedestrians on London Bridge before getting out and stabbing people in nearby Borough Market on Saturday.
There are 29 people being treated in London hospitals, with 10 in a critical condition, NHS England said.
The Spanish Ministry told the BBC that Ignacio Echeverria, 39, who tried to defend a woman, was killed.
Mr Echeverria, from Madrid, and was working for HSBC bank in London.
He saw the attack unfolding as he cycled back from a park with two friends he had been skateboarding with.
He used his skateboard against one of the attackers, who was stabbing a woman, Spanish media has reported.
The prime Minister of Spain has requested that Mr Echeverria be granted an award - the Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit.
On Tuesday evening, police discovered a body in the River Thames during their search for Frenchman Xavier Thomas.
It was thought the 45-year-old was thrown off London Bridge into the River Thames after being hit by the white van driven by the three attackers.
He was walking along the bridge with his girlfriend Christine Delcros, who was seriously injured.
The body has not been formally identified as Mr Thomas's, but his next of kin have been informed.
French chef Sebastien Belanger, who worked at the Coq d'Argent near Bank, was killed in the attack.
The 36-year-old had been watching the Champions League final with friends at a nearby pub.
His girlfriend's sister told the Evening Standard they left the pub just before the attack.
"When the van hit they thought it was just a car accident. Then after a few seconds they saw people running, screaming, and a guy with a knife attacking," said Greta Tubutyte.
"He stabbed a woman just in front of them. One of Sebastien's friend's got all the blood on him and they panicked and screamed 'run'."
Australian Sara Zelenak, was one of the victims of Saturday's attack.
The 21-year-old, from Brisbane, was working as an au pair in London.
Her parents said they were "deeply saddened at the tragic loss of our beautiful daughter".
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said she was seen fleeing from the knifemen during the attack.
Her aunt described her niece as "the girl next door, very special and a kindred spirit".
Sara had reportedly been due to babysit on Saturday night, but the child's grandmother stepped in, which meant she could go out with friends.
The family of Australian Kirsty Boden said she died after running towards the danger to help victims on the bridge.
The 28-year-old was from Loxton in South Australia and had been working in the UK as a senior staff nurse in Theatres Recovery.
"Kirsty was loved and adored by her family, friends and boyfriend," their statement said. "She was the most outgoing, kind and generous person who loved to help people.
"Helping people was what she loved to do in her job as a nurse and in her daily life.
"We are so proud of Kirsty's brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life. Kirsty - we love you and we will miss you dearly."
Dame Eileen Sills, chief nurse at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, said colleagues described Kirsty as "one in a million who always went the extra mile for the patients in her care".
Niall Dickson, CEO of the NHS Confederation, added: "Her courage and selflessness reflect all that is best about the NHS and will not be forgotten."
The first person to be named as killed in Saturday's attacks was Canadian Chrissy Archibald, who was originally from British Columbia.
Ms Archibald, who worked in a homeless shelter until she moved to Europe, died in the arms of her fiancÃ©, Tyler Ferguson, on London Bridge.
"She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected," the family statement said. "She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death.
"Please honour her by making your community a better place. Volunteer your time and labour or donate to a homeless shelter. Tell them Chrissy sent you."
Her fiancÃ©'s sister, Cassie, wrote on Facebook: "Hearing his painful sobs on the phone while he's alone trying to deal with this tears me apart."
Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was "heartbroken" that a Canadian national had been among those killed.
The family of 32-year-old James McMullan - who has been missing since Saturday night - say they believe he was killed, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene.
His sister, Melissa McMullan, told the BBC: "While our pain will never diminish, it is important for us to all carry on with our lives in direct opposition to those who are trying to destroy us and remember that hatred is the refuge of small-minded individuals and will only breed more.
"This is not a course we will follow despite our loss.
"From his friends that were with him that night, they want everyone to know what a generous and caring friend he was."
French national Alexandre Pigeard, 27, also died.
Manager of the Boro Bistro, Vincent Le Berre told the Brittany news outlet Le Telegramme how his colleague, Mr Pigeard, was attacked by a terrorist in a bar near Borough Market.
"I managed to escape him, but my friend Alexandre did not have that chance," he said. "He was hit in the neck with a knife."
According to French media, Mr Pigeard was from Caen, in Normandy, but had been living in London for more than two years.
Another news outlet in Normandy, La Manche Libre, said that the local mayor of Colleville-Montgomery, where Mr Pigeard has family, confirmed the death to locals on Tuesday.
A college friend of Mr Pigeard's told the BBC the victim's mother was devastated by the news.
His father told French media he was a "marvellous son" and a "radiant young man".
Another seven French nationals are also believed to have been injured in the attack, with four in a critical condition.
Elisabeth O'Neill told the BBC how her 23-year-old son Daniel received a seven-inch cut from his stomach to his back outside a bar near Borough Market. He is recovering in hospital.
"He had just stepped outside the bar for a second and a man ran up to him and said 'this is for my family, this is for Islam' and put a knife in him," she said.
"I'm still in shock. I can't quite believe it's happened."
Four police officers were hurt, three from the Metropolitan Police and one from British Transport Police (BTP).
The officer from the BTP is "seriously unwell", the organisation said, but was able to talk about how he fought the attackers, armed only with a baton.
One of the Met officers - a rugby player who was off-duty at the time - was stabbed after tackling one of the three attackers. He is in a critical condition.
A member of the public is recovering in hospital after being accidentally shot by police, the Met's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said.
Dr Malik Ramadhan, a consultant at the Royal London hospital, told the Guardian he had been shot in the head, but that they expected him to make a full recovery.
It is not yet clear if the gunshot victim he referred to is connected to the accidental police shooting.
Journalist Geoff Ho, the business editor of the Sunday Express, was stabbed in the neck while confronting the attackers in the Black & Blue restaurant.
"Most of my friends and the staff hid under tables but my one of my friends was frozen behind me," he said.
"I knew I had to face the attackers down, they were armed and I had the best chance of delaying them until the police arrived or they'd get everyone.
"I had to shield my friends and the people there.
"I think I got a hit in on one of them, but either he or his accomplice got me with a shot to the throat."
Minutes before, he had broken up a fight between a bouncer and two men outside a pub - initially leading to confusion over when he had faced the terrorists.
Sunday Express editor Martin Townsend described Mr Ho as a "fine and decent man" and said he was "hoping and praying for a speedy recovery".
The newspaper called him "a martial arts expert specialising in Kung Fu and kickboxing", and published video footage of Mr Ho being calmly led to an ambulance by a police officer, holding his neck.
Two Australians, Candice Hedge from Brisbane and Andrew Morrison from Darwin, are among the injured, after both being stabbed.
New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was providing consular assistance to the family of one of its citizens, Oliver Dowling.
He is thought to be in an induced coma at University College Hospital after a four-hour operation to treat stab wounds to his face, neck and stomach.
His sister wrote on Facebook: "Doctors are very happy with how he's come out the other side."
His girlfriend, French national Marie Bondeville, is also thought to be injured.
One Spanish citizen was injured, the embassy said, but is not in a life-threatening condition.
Germany's interior ministry has confirmed that two German nationals were also injured, one seriously.
