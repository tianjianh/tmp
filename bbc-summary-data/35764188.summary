Matt Doherty: Wolves defender's form helped by successive run of games

Wolves defender Matt Doherty says his latest run of games has helped him to improve his form at left-back.

Doherty, 24, has provided three assists in three games and also scored a 94th-minute winner against Bristol City.
"That's what happens when you're in the team and get successive games," he told BBC WM. "I was out of it earlier in the season a bit, which was frustrating.
"I thought to myself when I got in that I would do my best not to let it go even though it was at left-back."
Following the sale of left-back Scott Golbourne to Bristol City in January, Doherty has worked his way back into Wolves' back line and has started the last 16 games in all competitions.
He continued: "I always back myself and I'm quite comfortable to be able to change from right-back to left-back. My left foot is not the strongest but I can be clever by going round somebody or using the right side of my foot.
"We've got quite a young team but we have a talented team as well. Our bench [against Bristol City] wasn't full of experienced first teamers and neither was our starting 11."
Doherty has made more than 100 appearances for the club and now has the chance to utilise his experience in a young Wolves set-up.
"He's an asset for us as he's been strong defensively and the most important thing for Matt is that he's 24 and it has to be his time. He's had spells in the team before but I want him to come through and be a leader for us," boss Kenny Jackett said.
"There's not many experienced players at the club and he was one of the older players out there in the second half [in the win against Bristol City] and he has to step up now and build on the good work he's done and be one of the players that leads Wolves."
