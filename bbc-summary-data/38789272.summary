Cornwall lamb attack: 'Cult could have cut off ears and tail'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lamb has been deliberately mutilated in what could have been an attack by a cult, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The lamb, called Bounce by its owners because of its friendly nature, was found with its ears and tail cut off.
It died on Wednesday three days after it was found injured in a field at Wadebridge in Cornwall.
Devon and Cornwall Police have asked farmers to report people behaving suspiciously.
Farmer Tracy Rae said the lamb's ears and tail were cut off "cleanly, not ripped off".
She said: "The question is why would you do it?"
PC Helen Lentern said it was being treated as a deliberate attack.
She said: "We're confident that the lamb has been cut.
"We are asking if anyone is aware of any kind of cult that might have done this.
"Some people have been saying that is the case, and that is possible, but we have no ideas why the lamb was attacked at the moment.
"Fortunately this appears to have been an isolated incident."
