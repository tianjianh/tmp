Former Hull Kingston Rovers captain James Webster has been appointed as interim head coach for the 2016 season.

The 36-year-old Australian has replaced Chris Chester, who was sacked three games into the Super League campaign.
Ex-hooker Webster spent three years as a player at Rovers and was the head of the Hull joint academy after he parted company as Wakefield head coach.
"He's popular here and he knows what the club is about," chairman Neil Hudgell told the club website.
"We believe James has all the qualities needed to kick-start some life into our season and also begin to implement plans for 2017 and beyond, when he will become an integral part of the backroom working under our new head coach."
The announcement was made after Rovers' 30-16 loss at Widnes on Friday, which sees them sit 11th in the table having failed to win any of their first five games.
Webster added: "The club holds a special place in my heart and everybody connected to Hull KR has been great with me over the years.
"It's a fantastic club with great people and brilliant supporters and I'm looking forward to hopefully playing my part in turning the fortunes of the club around."
