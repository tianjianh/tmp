[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An army sergeant accused of tampering with his wife's parachute has denied two counts of attempted murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victoria Cilliers, 40, suffered "multiple serious injuries" during a 4,000ft (1.2km) jump at Netheravon Airfield in Wiltshire in April 2015.
Emile Cilliers, 36, pleaded not guilty to three charges relating to his wife when he appeared at Salisbury Crown Court.
He was released on bail and the case adjourned for a date yet to be set.
Mr Cilliers, of Aldershot, Hampshire, also denied a charge of damaging a gas fitting belonging to his wife, thereby recklessly endangering life, between 28 and 31 March last year.
Adjourning the case, Judge Keith Cutler told the defendant the trial would "likely" take five weeks and begin in May or next summer.
