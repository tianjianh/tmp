[SN]TITLE[SN]
Commission board members meet in private with convener

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the Crofting Commission's board have held a meeting in private amid a controversy over the future of its convener Colin Kennedy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In September, the board requested that Mr Kennedy resign following criticism of the commission's handling of a row with crofters in the Western Isles.
Mr Kennedy has refused to stand down, despite also coming under pressure from the government to do so.
He met the board members, known as commissioners,  in Inverness.
One of the members walked out of the gathering after it was decided not to open the meeting to the public.
Mr Kennedy has said he did nothing wrong in the row over the running of common grazings in parts of the Western Isles.
In a statement following the gathering at a hotel in Inverness, the Crofting Commission described it as a "special meeting" which was called by the interim chief executive at the request of Mr Kennedy.
The commission said that those present "reaffirmed the importance of working together effectively" in the final months of their terms. Elections to the commission are to be held next year.
The board is due to meet again next Wednesday.
