[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver who crashed after increasing her speed to more than 70mph (112kmh) into a sharp bend had passed her test just weeks before, it has emerged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Abigail Bonney, 18, of Thomas Road in Clacton, lost control of her Renault Clio on the A133 near Colchester.
Bonney admitted careless driving at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. One of her passengers was seriously injured.
The court heard a "black box" fitted to her car showed her speed increased to 71mph before the crash on 1 March.
The legal limit on the stretch of road where the crash happened is 60mph (96kmh).
The black box had been fitted by her insurance company, the court heard.
Although Bonney was unharmed, the front-seat passenger, an 18-year-old woman, suffered life-changing neck injuries.
Two other friends, who were sitting in the back of the car, suffered whiplash injuries and severe headaches.
Bonney was disqualified from driving for 12 months, fined Â£62 and ordered to pay Â£90 costs and a Â£20 victim surcharge.
After the case, PC Heidi Lee of Essex Police said: "The court heard that Bonney was a new and inexperienced driver who showed a total disregard for the safety of her passengers and other road users."
