Student Lydia Wilkinson attended the Stourbridge property in a visit organised by West Midlands Police.
Her mother, Mrs Wilkinson, and brother, Pierce, 13, were stabbed to death on Thursday. Her father, Peter Wilkinson, remains in hospital with stab wounds.
A 23-year-old man is accused of murder and attempted murder.
Aaron Barley, of no fixed abode, is due at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday.
Ms Wilkinson, 18, was at university at the time of the attack.
In a statement released through police, Ms Wilkinson said the family was devastated by their loss, adding her mother, 50, and brother were "extremely loved" by everyone.
She said: "Pierce was a fun-loving and friendly, happy boy who loved computer games and made everyone smile.
"Tracey was loving, caring and a wonderful mother and daughter, always putting others before herself."
She thanked the emergency services for their work after they were called to the house in Greyhound Lane, Norton, at about 08:00 BST on Thursday. She also praised hospital staff for their "excellent care".
Her 47-year-old father is now stable in hospital after being taken there in a critical condition when he was found with serious stab injuries in the back garden of his home.
Ms Wilkinson also asked for "privacy and respect during this distressing time".
She was supported by her boyfriend and his parents as she read the messages on the floral tributes from well-wishers and laid her own flowers.
