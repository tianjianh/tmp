[SN]TITLE[SN]
Elgin rapist guilty of raping and assaulting girls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Elgin man has been found guilty of raping and indecently assaulting girls in Moray.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Steven Thain was found guilty of eight charges relating to attacks carried out over a 12-year period between 2002 and 2014.
The 26-year-old's offending began when he was a teenager and his victims were as young as four and seven, the court heard.
Thain, who denied the charges, will be sentenced next month.
He was previously ordered to be detained for three years as a 19-year-old but was released after 18 months and began reoffending, the court heard.
Thain was found guilty of the latest charges brought against him by a jury following a trial.
Between 2010 and 2014, he was accused of raping three teenage girls at various addresses in Moray.
Judge Lord Armstrong called for a background report, including a risk assessment, to be prepared on Thain before sentencing.
Thain was placed on the sex offenders register.
