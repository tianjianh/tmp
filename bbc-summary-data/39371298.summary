The set, including a Military Cross and Albert Medal for gallantry, were awarded to Lt Col William Marychurch Morgan from Jeffreyston near Tenby.
They were for actions including saving comrades from a live grenade during a training exercise in France in 1916.
He was also commended for leading raids on enemy trenches in Arras, taking four prisoners.
He was awarded the Albert Medal Second Class in May 1916 following a potentially fatal incident during training in a trench in Locon in the Pas-de-Calais.
A man dropped a grenade, which sank in the mud, meaning only the smoke from the burning fuse could be seen.
The then Lt Morgan, who was outside the danger zone, sprang forward, found it and threw it away before it exploded, saving several lives.
He was later promoted to temporary Lieutenant and awarded the Military Cross in October 1916 after he led raids on enemy trenches in Arras.
The citation on his medal reads: "On seven consecutive nights, he carried out valuable reconnaissance under intense fire. Later he led a daring raid himself, accounting for one of the enemy.
"He has previously done fine work."
Col Morgan was presented with both medals by King George V at Buckingham Palace and later received the 1914 Star, known as the Mons Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal for his service during World War One.
He was promoted to temporary Captain in June 1917 and died on October 23 1944 while serving as a Lieutenant Colonel during World War Two.
Derek Ainsworth, medal specialist at Halls auctioneers, said it was a privilege to sell such an "exceptional" medal group at the Shrewsbury auction.
The medals, which were discovered at a valuation day in Tenby, were bought by a bidder from north Wales.
