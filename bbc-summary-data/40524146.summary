Anniversary Games 2017: Rooney and 4x400m team to get medals

Britain's men's 4x400m relay team from Beijing 2008 will finally receive their Olympic bronze medals at the Anniversary Games on 9 July.

The quartet of Michael Bingham, Martyn Rooney, Andrew Steele and Robert Tobin were upgraded to third after retested urine samples found Russia's Denis Alekseyev had used a banned substance.
"I can't wait to get the Olympic medals we all deserve," Rooney said.
The failed test was announced last year but was then subject to appeals.
It had initially been hoped these medals, and others, would be reallocated at the World Championships in London in August but the relay team will now receive their medals in front of a London Stadium crowd and live BBC television audience at 13:43 BST on Sunday.
"While it would have been an unforgettable moment to receive my medal in Beijing, I can't think of a better substitute than to stand on the podium in the London Stadium, in front of an appreciative and supportive British crowd," Rooney added.
The British Olympic Association is still waiting for final confirmation of reallocated medals from three other Beijing 2008 events - the women's javelin, women's 4x400m relay and heptathlon - which should result in bronze medals for the likes of Goldie Sayers and Kelly Sotherton.
