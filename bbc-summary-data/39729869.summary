Jersey care inquiry delays 'becoming unacceptable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Delays in publishing the Jersey Independent Care Inquiry report are becoming "unacceptable" according to the lawyer working with the victims.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£23m inquiry into historical child abuse in Jersey ended in 2016 after three years.
The report was first expected at the end of last year.
The independent panel referred the BBC to a previous statement that said: "We will announce the date of the report's publication in due course".
Alan Collins, who has been representing the Jersey Care Leavers Association, says the victims are "getting impatient".
"The longer this delay goes on the more unacceptable it becomes, because the publish occasion of the report has now been delayed twice," he said.
"We've got no real explanation as to why the delay and I think two points arise for this: number one, the report should have been published long before now, and secondly, because it has not been published, I think everyone is entitled to know why the delay? What's happening?"
