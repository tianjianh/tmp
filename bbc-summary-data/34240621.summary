Saido Berahino has faced West Brom dressing room "banter" about his threat to go on strike on deadline day, says his captain Darren Fletcher.

The Baggies turned down four bids from Tottenham for the 22-year-old striker, including two on 1 September.
He went on Twitter to indicate he would never play for Albion again but he came on against Southampton on Saturday.
"The lads have given him some stick. Sometimes it's the best way because it takes away the tension," Fletcher said.
"When somebody comes in and there is a little bit of banter, I'm sure he feels like one of the lads again."
Scotland midfielder Fletcher, who is not on Twitter, said: "It's about emotions really.
"You can do silly things and when you're on Twitter it allows you to voice your opinions. If he had sat quietly for 48 hours he wouldn't have done it."
