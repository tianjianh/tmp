Tourist spending in Northern Ireland has increased by 5%, according to data from the Department for the Economy.

It has published statistics for the 12 months to June.
They show expenditure grew to Â£789m, but the total number of visitor trips fell by 3% to 4.5m.
However, Economy Minister Simon Hamilton said the figures revealed that "visitors have, generally, been staying longer."
The data shows that external visitor markets - Great Britain and beyond - have been improving.
The weaker markets have been Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
But there is believed to have been a more recent surge in visits from across the border, a period not covered in the new data.
The pound's post-referendum slump is said to have boosted the tourism sector overall.
Hotel occupancy levels in August reached a record high.
"Tourism is an important sector for our economy," Mr Hamilton said.
"I intend to bring forward a new strategy later this year to work with the industry to build an internationally competitive and inspiring destination of which we are all proud."
