[SN]TITLE[SN]
Depraved doctor Michael Lever guilty of raping women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor has been convicted of carrying out a catalogue of rape and abuse against two women.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Lever, 46, attacked one woman in Ayr and another victim at locations in the Borders, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard the women were compelled to take part in acts which judge Lord Uist described as "unpleasant and indeed...disgusting".
The judge asked for psychiatric reports on Lever, who is being held at the State Hospital at Carstairs.
Lord Uist also placed the doctor on the sex offenders' register.
The judge told jurors on Wednesday: "It is most unfortunate you have had to deal with a case of this nature."
He said it was an "unpleasant and indeed, in many ways, disgusting case".
During the trial, one of Lever's victims told the court she had been told to consume a drink containing the drug GHB, sometimes known as liquid ecstasy.
The next day she woke up naked, covered in sick and saw "pornographic material" playing on a DVD.
She said from her physical symptoms it was obvious that sexual contact had taken place.
The victim also told the court that Lever had engaged in a type of sexual activity she had not wanted and that "there was blood everywhere".
Another woman said that Lever told her he was head of the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad.
She said he told her that if she did not do what he wanted he would have to kill her.
She said Lever was "deadly serious" when he made the threat.
The 45-year-old said: "Looking back now it was like I was being groomed like a teenage girl."
She said that "having fun" for Lever was taking drugs and playing with her sexually.
The court also heard details of the victims being tied up and forced to perform sex acts in front of a webcam and Lever ignoring their distress.
One witness told the trial that she found one of the victims in a wardrobe naked with her arms tied, looking badly bruised and crying.
Lever had denied raping and sexually assaulting the women but was unanimously convicted of the offences.
The court heard that he was a qualified doctor but had not practised since 2004.
He was in the process of taking up a post at a hospital in Ayr when he was detained in 2013.
Lord Uist said he would have to seek psychiatric reports before deciding on how to deal with Lever.
