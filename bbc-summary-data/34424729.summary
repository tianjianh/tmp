From Saturday 3 October, travellers using its services on the West Coast mainline - and who book their tickets via the company app or website - will receive automatic repayments.
The government urged other train operators to follow suit.
The idea follows the announcement that delayed passengers now have the right to compensation in cash.
Until this summer, all compensation was paid in vouchers.
"Our plan is to make sure passengers across the country benefit from schemes like this, and we are encouraging other operators to roll out similar schemes nationwide," said Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin.
Virgin train passengers who are delayed will receive compensation back on to the card they used for the purchase.
