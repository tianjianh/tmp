Jamal Lowe's football career has a come a long way in the space of the past six months, but he admits a second promotion in a year would be special.

Lowe, 22, helped maintain Portsmouth's League Two promotion push with his first goal for the club in a 3-1 win against Yeovil on Saturday.
In January, he joined from Hampton & Richmond in National League South.
"Last May, I got promoted from the Ryman Premier League, this May it could going up to League One," he said.
"It's a completely different experience, but a good feeling," the England C international told BBC Radio Solent.
"It's been a big weight off my shoulders to get my first goal and hopefully now the gates will open for more and more."
Third-placed Portsmouth need just eight more points from their remaining five games to secure automatic promotion from League Two.
Results elsewhere could even see them clinch it over the Easter weekend as Paul Cook's side host second-placed Plymouth on Friday before a trip to Notts County on Monday.
"We're in a great position," Lowe said. "It's a nice feeling when you get three points and see someone else slip up, but we're just focusing on ourselves."
