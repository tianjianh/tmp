James Maurice Henderson admits causing Strabane car crash death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 73-year-old man has pleaded guilty to causing the death of a retired businessman in a three-car crash on the outskirts of Strabane in January 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Maurice Henderson, of Limehill Road, Lisburn, admitted his careless driving caused the death of Alexander McEntee, 65, from Castleblaney, County Monaghan.
It happened on the A5 Mulvin Road between Newtownstewart and Victoria Bridge.
Henderson will be sentenced next month.
He also admitted causing grievously bodily injury to his own wife Hazel Henderson.
A prosecution lawyer told Dungannon Crown Court, that no mechanical defects were found with Mr Henderson's vehicle.
The court heard that the collision occurred when Henderson drove straight ahead, "for some unknown reason", instead of following the contours of a shallow bend in the road.
Mr Henderson's defence agreed that the case be adjourned for pre-sentence reports and for an impact report from the family of Mr McEntee.
