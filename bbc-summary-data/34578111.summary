Police said the 39-year-old was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault of his 25-year-old wife at their Sydney home.
El-Masri is a former ambassador for anti-domestic violence charity White Ribbon Australia.
Outgoing NRL head Dave Smith said Mr El-Masri has been stood down from ambassadorial roles with the sport.
"There is absolutely no place for domestic violence in our game, it's abhorrent to us," Mr Smith told the media on Tuesday.
"I don't know the details of that case but I can say that any ambassadorial role that he was playing with us, he's been stood down from."
"People have to make good choices and if they don't, there are consequences."
White Ribbon Australia - a male-led campaign to raise awareness of domestic violence - distanced themselves from Mr El-Masri, taking his photo down from their website.
"White Ribbon is very disappointed to learn of the charges laid against former Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs player and former White Ribbon Ambassador Hasem El-Masri," the group's Australian head Libby Davies said in a statement.
"White Ribbon advises that Hasem El-Masri is not currently a White Ribbon Ambassador and as always, White Ribbon will provide no further comment on a case before the courts."
His duties with the Bulldogs have also been suspended.
"As a club we are committed to our work with White Ribbon Australia to eliminate violence against women and firmly believe there is no place for it in our society," Bulldogs CEO Raelene Castle said.
