The academy product, 19, joined the Sky Blues at the age of nine and his new contract runs until June 2020.
Stevenson made his professional debut earlier this season in a 3-2 win over Portsmouth in the EFL Cup, and has made a further 10 appearances this term.
"Everybody here looks forward to helping Ben continue his progression," said caretaker manager Mark Venus.
