Davis Cup semi-final: 'Drained' Andy Murray aims to recover

Andy Murray will try to secure Great Britain's first Davis Cup final place in 37 years against Australia in Glasgow on Sunday.

Britain lead the best-of-five tie 2-1 heading into the final day, and need one win from the two remaining singles matches.
Murray will face Australian number one Bernard Tomic in the opening match at 13:00 BST.
Argentina lead Belgium 2-1 in the other semi-final in Brussels.
"To be 2-1 up going into the final day is very good but we've been here before," said GB captain Leon Smith. "There is an awful lot of work to get done."
Britain last reached the Davis Cup final in 1978, losing to the United States, and their ninth and most recent title came in 1936.
The British number one spent three hours and 56 minutes on court with his brother Jamie as they beat Lleyton Hewitt and Sam Groth in Saturday's vital doubles contest.
Murray, 28, did benefit from a swift win over Thanasi Kokkinakis in the day-one singles, however.
"I had a quick match on Friday and rather than the physical toll, it's more the emotional one for me in a match like the doubles," said Murray.
"I've done it before and I'll try and do it again tomorrow.
"The longer the match, the less time and the harder it is to recover. Physically it's tough but also emotionally, because matches like that are draining as well.
"I don't think enough is made of that. They're very tough matches to play, a lot of ups and downs. I'll just try and recover as best I can."
Australia captain Wally Masur used all four players in singles when they came back from 2-0 down to beat Kazakhstan in the quarter-final, so there could be a selection change on Sunday.
Tomic is the obvious choice, with a career-high ranking of 23 and having had a day off on Saturday, although Friday's win over Dan Evans was a draining affair.
"Obviously Andy's playing amazing tennis," said the 22-year-old. "It's not easy, that's why he's a top player in the world and been playing so well the last five years.
"For me, I have to come in believing I can win. I have nothing to lose and it's a huge opportunity for me."
Masur is banking on Murray feeling the effects of that dramatic four-hour doubles contest, and so failing to match his impressive level against Kokkinakis.
"Andy was scintillating but I can tell you he won't be quite as clinical, he won't feel quite as good as he did on Friday, because that was brutal," said Masur.
And asked whether he might be ready to step in, 34-year-old Hewitt, playing his final Davis Cup campaign, said: "I'll do what I'm needed to do."
There is every chance that the other semi-final will come down to a fifth rubber, after Argentina won the doubles to take a 2-1 lead over Belgium.
David Goffin, the world number 15, will play 39th-ranked Leonardo Mayer in Sunday's opening reverse singles in Brussels.
That could leave the evenly-matched Steve Darcis (ranked 64th) and Federico Delbonis (ranked 65th) facing each other in a decider.
Should Britain reach the final, they would play Argentina at home or Belgium away.
