A Liverpool arts centre is appealing for teenage musicians to feature on a charity CD in memory of schoolboy Erick Maina.

The 15-year-old from Liverpool was found dead at his home in Fazakerley in November 2014.
A fundraising campaign set up in his memory has already raised more than Â£3,000 for a cancer care charity.
Liverpool Lighthouse will record a CD with young musicians in support of that campaign.
The urban gospel arts centre, based in Anfield, works with disaffected young people in the area.
Erick Maina was described as a committed Christian who loved charity work and "just wanted to help others".
Floral tributes were left for him by residents and neighbours following his death.
Matt Moreton, from Liverpool Lighthouse, said: "Erick loved music and supporting people and had a particular passion for supporting Marie Curie and we wanted to reflect this whilst giving young people a chance to develop their own skills and experiences in the music industry.
"Musicians and bands of all styles and abilities are welcome to take part. We will make rehearsal space available so they can prepare themselves for their time in the recording studio."
An open day is being held on Wednesday for musicians to sign up to the project.
The CD will be recorded in the Lighthouse recording studio next week.
