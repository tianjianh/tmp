[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 2-2 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bury striker James Vaughan took his goal tally to six in two games as the Shakers twice came from behind to draw at Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vaughan, who now has 16 goals for the season, only just upstaged on-loan Vale debutant Tyler Walker, who scored one and made one following his midweek signing from Nottingham Forest.
Vale had to survive a big scare, Nathan Smith frantically clearing off the line from Vaughan, before Walker fired the hosts ahead from 20 yards.
Vaughan, who hit four in 20 first-half minutes against Peterborough six days earlier, then levelled from close range, guiding home Hallam Hope's right-wing cross, only for Vale to be back in front in first-half injury time.
Cameron Burgess felled Walker on the right corner of the box and Ryan Taylor sent goalkeeper Rob Lainton the wrong way from the resulting penalty.
But Bury were level again after 55 minutes when Scott Burgess sent Vaughan bursting clear down the inside right channel to drill in a low second.
Walker was one of four players to make his Vale debut, along with keeper Ryan Boot, impressive on-loan Derby midfielder Callum Guy and Chris Eagles, who appeared as a second-half substitute.
Earlier in the day, Vale came to a mutual agreement to terminate the contract of one of previous boss Bruno Ribeiro's glut of foreign signings, Dutch defender Calvin Mac-Intosch.
