Clean Bandit working with Elton John

Dance group Clean Bandit say they have been in the studio with Sir Elton John, recording music for their second album.

The collaboration came about after last year's Ivor Novello awards, where the group won two prizes.
"We actually met Elton John at that show, and we've since been doing stuff with him, which has been crazy," said saxophone player Jack Patterson.
"Grace [Chatto] wandered over to him, we were having a chat and the next thing we were in the studio."
"It was very surreal. A very odd day. He's very cheeky," Patterson added.
Sir Elton will reconvene with the band "next month" to finish their collaboration, Patterson said.
It is not the star's first dalliance with a dance act. In 2012, he released a remix album, Good Morning To The Night, with Australian producers Pnau.
"I love electronic music," he told the BBC at the time. "I love it to death - but I'm a Luddite and I don't know how to make electronic music."
Sir Elton's collaboration with Clean Bandit will feature on the Cambridge-based band's second album, which is due in 2017, and Patterson hinted he was not the only A-list star on the record.
"It's a vocal album and we don't have a singer, so all of the tracks will essentially be a collaboration of some sorts," he said.
"It's like a dream come true to work with some of the people we have been [in the studio] with.
"There are some big names but my manager's just told me not to mention any!"
Pressed for more details, he said that on a fame scale of 1 to 10, "some are a 10," but refused to go any further.
"It's not Rihanna. It's not Beyonce. I'm not allowed to say. My manager would be so upset."
The 2015 Ivor Novello Awards saw Clean Bandit win best contemporary song and most performed work for their number one hit Rather Be; while Sir Elton was there to induct Annie Lennox to the fellowship of the British Society of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (Basca).
Patterson will also attend the 2016 ceremony, after receiving a nomination for best song for his work on Jess Glynne's single Hold My Hand.
