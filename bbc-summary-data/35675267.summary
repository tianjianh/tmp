Hamilton 1-1 Celtic: Boyata red card was correct - Deila

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ronny Deila says referee Craig Thomson was correct in his decision to send off Dedrick Boyata for a last-man foul on Hamilton's Carlton Morris.

Boyata was shown a red card for halting Morris' run to goal in a frenetic 1-1 draw at New Douglas Park.
"I think it was an okay decision. He didn't get the ball and then it's a red card," the Celtic manager said.
"In these situations you have to stand on your feet and run with the player, not try and get in front of them."
Celtic led through a first-half Leigh Griffiths penalty, and had a chance to double their advantage after Boyata's sending off, but Michael McGovern saved a second Griffiths spot-kick.
Substitute Eamonn Brophy reacted first to a loose ball in the box to power home an equaliser for Accies 17 minutes from time.
Although his side played almost an hour with only 10 men, Deila was still frustrated that they could not hold on to take all three points.
"I think we defended well with 10 men," the Norwegian told BBC Scotland.
"They didn't have a lot of chances and we had good control, but we should have played more, been a little bit braver on the ball.
"It's hard to swallow but you have to do it.
"There are 11 matches left and there's a lot to play for. Nothing is finished and we're going to fight to the last game. Wednesday we have a game that we want three points."
Hamilton manager Martin Canning was pleased with his side's display, particularly in light of the 8-1 thrashing inflicted on his side when the teams met last month.
"I'm proud of the boys tonight because it's such a big effort to put in take something off Celtic, albeit with ten men but you've got to put in the work," Canning said.
"I put no extra pressure on the players to go and prove that they are better than they were that night.
"I think you see that tonight. They're a good bunch and they're capable of winning a lot of games in this league if they believe in themselves and continue to work as hard as they have tonight."

Accies conceded two penalties during the match, the first coming from a needless foul by Dougie Imrie on Leigh Griffith. The Scotland striker converted the first spot-kick, but saw his second saved by Michael McGovern after Ziggy Gordon had been penalised for wrestling Mikael Lustig to the ground at a corner.
Canning had no qualms about the first penalty award, but feels referees are inconsistent when it comes to penalising challenges at corners.
"The first one looks a penalty. Dougie was quite disappointed with himself at half-time which tells me that it probably was.
"The second one I haven't seen. Having spoken to Ziggy he says it's very soft, there's very little in it.
"He defends the same way at every set-piece in terms of trying to get close and make sure that he's doing his job.
"I think if you are going to give them then you have to give them a lot more."
