President of the studios, Kevin Feige, who has also been responsible for the Spider-Man films since 2002, revealed: "We want to play with Peter Parker in the high school years".
He told Collider: "So many things have not been done yet from the comics."
Feige said: "The most obvious being the 'young, doesn't quite fit in' kid before his powers."
The 'new' Spider-Man, the first time the character has been produced in a film by Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), is expected to make his debut in Captain America: Civil War, while the superhero's first solo Marvel film is currently due for release on 28 July 2017.
The deal came after Sony's Amazing Spider-Man 2 under-performed at the box office last year.
Speaking about the direction the Marvel Spider-Man storyline will take, Feige continued: "In some of my favourite Spider-Man arcs and Spider-Man stories, he's in high school for a lot of it.
"We want to explore that. That also makes him very, very different from any of our other characters in the MCU, which is something else we want to explore: how unique he is when now put against all these other characters."
