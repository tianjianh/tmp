South Bristol link road: Bristol City Council gives approval

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for the proposed south Bristol link road have been approved by the city council, by eight votes to two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors voted in favour of the 3.1-mile (5km) road linking the A370, near Long Ashton, to the Cater Road roundabout in Hartcliffe.
Earlier this month the plan was approved by councillors in North Somerset, the other authority involved with the Â£43m scheme.
The new road is due to be completed by 2017.
Campaigners had claimed the road would cause air pollution and destroy greenbelt land between the A370 and the A38.
Supporters said it would combat congestion and improve the local economy.
The combined road and bus route will also includes new cycle and pedestrian paths.
Bristol City Council and North Somerset Council will contribute about Â£15m towards the cost of the road, with other funding coming from the Department for Transport.
