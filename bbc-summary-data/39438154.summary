[SN]TITLE[SN]
David Crompton decision expected in 'two to eight weeks'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on whether it was unlawful for a police commissioner to suspend a chief constable from his job will not be known for weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Alan Billings suspended David Crompton after he appeared to justify police questioning of fans' behaviour after the Hillsborough disaster.
His comments came after a jury concluded force conduct contributed to or caused the deaths of 96 fans.
The High Court reserved a decision on whether the suspension was lawful.
Judges are expected to take between two and eight weeks to deliver a ruling.
The Hillsborough inquests ruled that all 96 people who died in the disaster in 1989 were unlawfully killed.
Mr Crompton gave two statements after the verdicts and in the second, appeared to justify the force's line of questioning about the behaviour of fans.
After the findings were delivered in April, the PCC decided to invoke a procedure under which Mr Crompton was suspended.
He was ultimately required to resign that September, but had intended to retire in November after 30 years of service.
On Tuesday, Mr Crompton's lawyers challenged his removal from the force, claiming there was "no fair basis" for the "draconian step".
Lawyers for the police and crime commissioner argued Mr Crompton's statement caused harm to the reputation of the force when its "standing was already at a low" following the inquests and Rotherham child sex abuse scandal.
The court heard Dr Billings was "entitled to conclude" that public trust and confidence in the force had been damaged.
