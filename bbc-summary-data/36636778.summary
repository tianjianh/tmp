About 70 people were wounded in the blast at a stadium, general Anthony Rakotoarison told AFP news agency.
He said officials considered it a "terrorist act".
The political situation remains fragile in the country, with supporters and opponents of President Hery Rajaonarimampianina at loggerheads.
It was not immediately clear who or what was behind the explosion.
The blast happened during a free concert at the Mahamasina stadium. A military parade had been held there earlier.
Prime Minister Olivier Solonandrasana Mahafaly visited the injured at a hospital and said this was a "disgusting and shameful" act.
In 2014, a grenade explosion killed a toddler and injured several other people outside the same stadium.
No arrests were made in connection with that attack and there was no claim of responsibility, AFP reported.
