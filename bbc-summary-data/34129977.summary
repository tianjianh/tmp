The victim, who is in his 70s, remains critically ill after being cut several times and beaten by a gang of men.
The incident happened while he was in bed at his home at Clogharevan Park at about 02:40 BST on Monday.
Police believe a sum of money was stolen and have renewed their appeal.
Det Insp David Henderson described the attack as "vile and terrifying".
He said the man was attacked with a "sharp implement, possibly a hook" and that police wanted to "identify the callous criminals responsible and bring them to justice".
"The man sustained multiple serious stab wounds and remains in a critical condition in hospital," he added.
"We have heard from several witnesses who were in the area at the time and we are grateful for their help, however we are keen to speak to others who have not yet come forward.
"We know from CCTV that there were several vehicles travelling on the McShanes Road at around the time the three men made their escape from the gentleman's home.
"I would like to appeal specifically to any motorist who was travelling on that stretch of road between 1.30am and 3.30am and who may have seen the three men or anything else that could be useful to investigators."
The man was taken to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry before being transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, where he remained in a critical condition on Wednesday.
