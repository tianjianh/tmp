Mustard put on 135 for the sixth wicket alongside Hamish Marshall, making his final appearance for the hosts.
Marshall passed 1,000 Championship runs for 2016 before being caught off Danny Briggs for 77 as a draw was called with Gloucestershire 131 ahead on 337-7.
Briggs (5-93) got his second five-for of 2016 as Sussex ended the season unbeaten away in the Championship.
Meanwhile, 23-year-old Australian batsman Cameron Bancroft is set to return to Gloucestershire in 2017.
Gloucestershire chief executive Will Brown told BBC Radio Bristol: "He played red ball cricket for us at the beginning of the season as a replacement for Michael Klinger and he's going to play red ball cricket for us for all of next season.
"He'll be here for the whole season, with the option to play white-ball cricket as well if we should need him or if the opportunity arises for him."
