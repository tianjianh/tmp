[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A number of homes had to be evacuated in the Tamfourhill area of Falkirk. Residents have since been allowed to return.
The device was found at about 16:30 on Thursday. The emergency services closed local roads and cleared the area.
The shell was subsequently dealt with by specialist engineers.
Insp Andrew Malcolm of Police Scotland said: "We were alerted to a home in Brodick Place, Falkirk, at around 4:30pm on Thursday, August 19th, after a member of the public reported the discovery of a suspected unexploded WW2 shell.
"Specialist engineers from the EOD were called to assess the situation and the item was later destroyed in a controlled explosion.
"A number of homes in the area were temporarily evacuated in the interest of public safety. I wish to thank the local community for their patience and cooperation."
