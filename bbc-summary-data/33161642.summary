A centenarian has watched every episode of BBC's Welsh language soap opera Pobol y Cwm since 1974 - despite not speaking a word of Welsh.

Ceridwen Bumford, from Penygraig, Rhondda Cynon Taff, has watched more than 6,900 episodes, following the plot using subtitles.
Her family said everything stops when the programme is on and she has strong views on the characters and storylines.
Mrs Bumford celebrated her 100th birthday with members of the cast.
She and her family also had the opportunity to see some familiar sights of the fictional village of Cwmderi and enjoy a party at its pub, the Deri.
Mrs Bumford was said to be overjoyed to meet her favourite character in the soap, Dai Ashurst, played for many years by Emyr Wyn.
"It's a great occasion - it's not often someone gets to celebrate their 100th birthday," Wyn said.
"I think I was asked to say a few words at the birthday party because I'm the closest in age to Ceridwen."
Family friend Lynfa Morgan, who helped organise the surprise, said: "She cannot watch anything else, she absolutely loves it even though she doesn't speak Welsh."
