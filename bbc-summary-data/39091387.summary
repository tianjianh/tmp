The crew of Bradley Hall, Joel Fearon, Bruce Tasker and Gregory Cackett were all unhurt after overturning in the second heat.
They were in 13th place after posting a time of 48.71 seconds on the first run.
"The guys are all on their feet and have been checked out by medical staff," said the British Bobsleigh & Skeleton Association.
Matthew Pinsent, who is in Konigssee with the BBC, posted on social media: "Pilot Bradley Hall is sitting track side absolutely inconsolable. His crew is trying nevertheless."
Co-commentator and skeleton Olympic gold medallist Amy Williams also tweeted: "Medals & Crashes. Highs & Lows. That's racing for you."
Britain's other crew of Lamin Deen, Ben Simons, John Baines and Andrew Matthew are in 21st place after two runs.
Germany are top of the standings before the final two runs on Sunday.
