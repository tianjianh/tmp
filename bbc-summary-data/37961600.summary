Andy O'Connell fired the stubborn visitors ahead on 68 minutes.
But Sutton restored parity when he volleyed in a long ball from Stevie Mallan and soon after the big striker poked in from a Kyle Magennis pass.
Lawrence Shankland hit the crossbar and had a header disallowed for shoving as the hosts finished strongly.
The Paisley side are the third Championship side into the last four after delivering manager Jack Ross his first win in five matches since his arrival from Alloa.
The first half really didn't do too much to set the pulses racing, although Ayr keeper Greg Fleming did well to save good efforts from Sutton and Kyle McAllister, before the visitor's Scotland under 21 midfielder Alan Forrest had the best chance 10 minutes before the interval.
A great run by Craig McGuffie ended with Forrest free inside the box but his effort lacked conviction and Saints keeper Scott Gallagher got down to save.
Mallan tested Fleming again seven minutes after the break, but it was the visitors who took the lead after a terrific driving run again from McGuffie ended with a slide rule pass to substitute O'Connell eight yards out and he knocked in his first goal for the club.
However, Sutton turned the game on its head, grabbing his fifth and sixth goals of the season, which could breathe new life into the Buddies' season.
St Mirren manager Jack Ross: "I thought we dominated possession and territory, without creating a lot of clear-cut chances.
"There's still a lot of things we need to improve on but I'm really pleased that the players have a reward for their efforts.
"There was a wobble after we went behind but we made a couple of changes and we carried a bit of fortune with both goals.
"Hopefully, this is a catalyst for us to start winning games on a regular basis."
Ayr United manager Ian McCall: "It must have been a rubbish match to watch because we didn't play at all like we can.
"I'm just gutted for all the players and the fans. We were so in control after we scored and looked like the team who might get a second on the counter.
"There were a couple of decisions in the lead up to both goals that were just wrong. The ball was clearly out and the linesman doesn't give it and for their second it's a clear corner and they give a bye kick. It's just wee Ayr United, so I don't suppose anyone cares."
