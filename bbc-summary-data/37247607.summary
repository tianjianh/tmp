Ben Marshall: Blackburn Rovers winger wants to stay, says manager Owen Coyle

Blackburn Rovers boss Owen Coyle says winger Ben Marshall wants to agree a new deal with the Championship club.

The 25-year-old's current contract runs out at the end of the season and has not yet signed a deal offered by the Lancashire side.
Rovers turned down offers for the ex-Leicester player from Wolves and Fulham during the transfer window.
"I'm hopeful something can be resolved to have Ben at the club long term, and it protects an asset," Coyle said.
"The great thing was Ben came to see me before the game last week and said 'listen gaffer, I really like it here and if something can be done I want to be here', which I thought was brilliant.
"Off the back of that, a couple of days ago I spoke to his representative."
Blackburn brought in 12 players over the summer, with eight leaving Ewood Park, though Owen Coyle received nearly £10m in transfer fees and spent just £250,000, on defender Derrick Williams.
Coyle has admitted he missed out on several deadline-day targets, including Lens defender Abdoul Ba.
"I eventually spoke to the president at Lens who explained that Abdoul was going into his last year of his contract, but even within that they want to keep him to try and get promoted," he added to BBC Radio Lancashire.
"Now that leaves the option open to us - if he's still not signed his new contract come January we can look to sign him (on a pre-contract agreement) and try to do business from there.
"I wish I had the budget the previous managers had year after year, but we haven't."
