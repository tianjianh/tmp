Earlier this month Ceredigion council cabinet opted to look for a private firm to run the nursing dementia home at Bodlondeb Care Home in Penparcau.
But after four councillors wrote to the council saying they wanted residential care to remain alongside the nursing dementia beds, a scrutiny committee reviewed the decision.
It has voted to ask the full council to make the decision.
