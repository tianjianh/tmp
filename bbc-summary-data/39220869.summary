Teenager's Froncysyllte aqueduct fall inquest adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest into the death of a teenager who fell from the aqueduct at Froncysyllte, Wrexham, has been adjourned for more evidence to be gathered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kris McDowell, 18, from Coronation Street in Cefn Mawr, died on 31 May last year.
The adjournment will allow the family's solicitor to appoint an expert witness to report on the condition of the railing Mr McDowell was holding on to.
A new date has not yet been set.
North Wales East and Central coroner John Gittins also said he would give consideration to summoning a jury for the hearing.
The inquest was first opened in June. A post-mortem examination had given chest trauma as the provisional cause of Mr McDowell's death.
He was found at the base of the 120ft (36m) tall aqueduct.
