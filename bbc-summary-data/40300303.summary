Taylor scored 154 off 97 balls in a thrilling 24-run win over Somerset to help Notts progress to the last four.
The former Zimbabwe captain told BBC Radio Nottingham: "We want to field first before the beers kick in.
"But whatever we do we will have to do it very, very well. If we are not on it 110% we can be found out for sure."
Notts last won the trophy in its previous format as a 40-over competition in 2013, beating Glamorgan by 87 runs in the final at Lord's.
