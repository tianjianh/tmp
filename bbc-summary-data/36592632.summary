Helena Thurm, 25, from the Altrincham area, suffered serious head injuries in the collision with a Vauxhall Astra in Sale shortly before 18.10 BST.
She was being treated in hospital overnight but died on Tuesday.
Helena's family said she was "a beautiful, kind, caring, intelligent and funny person" who was "at the threshold of adult life".
"Helena liked a challenge and was at the threshold of adult life having finished university. She had been to a job interview on the day of the accident that stole her life," they said.
They said she "was loved by everybody" and "will be sadly missed" by her friends and family.
Constable Paul Hailwood said Greater Manchester Police are "still establishing the exact circumstances" of the collision and want any witnesses or people who may have dash-cam footage to contact them.
