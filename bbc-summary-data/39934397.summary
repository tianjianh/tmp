[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Hilton, 25, of Aberdeen, was trying to catch up with a friend who was travelling in another car on the A920 Dufftown to Huntly road in 2015.
Patrick Pirie, 81, of Dufftown, was in a car involved in the resulting crash. He died in hospital from his injuries.
Hilton was jailed four years and two months.
Great-grandfather Mr Pirie was travelling home from a farmers' mart in nearby Huntly when the collision happened.
Judge Lord Woolman told the High Court in Edinburgh: "This is a tragic case for everyone involved. Mr Pirie was a retired farmer aged 81. He was married with four grown children.
"Your crime casts a terrible shadow over them. The harm caused by an offence that causes a person's death is immeasurable.
"My duty is to discourage others from such irresponsible conduct. I must also mark the gravity of what happened."
He also banned him from driving for nine years and until he passes a fresh test.
Defence counsel Tony Lenehan said Hilton had shown "genuine remorse".
Hilton had one previous conviction, a speeding offence from 2011.
