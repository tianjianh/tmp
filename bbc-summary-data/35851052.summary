The Westbury cement works were constructed in the early 1960s and mothballed in 2009.
The chimney is one of the tallest structures in the West and explosives experts will be brought in to demolish it.
Demolition site manager Nigel Osman said the chimney has been a feature of the Wiltshire landscape for decades: "You see the chimney and you know you're home."
Will Glennon reports.
