[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Gloucester centre Martin Roberts has died suddenly at the age of 48, the Premiership club have announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gloucester-born Roberts, who could also play at full-back, started his career with Cheltenham and joined the Cherry and Whites for the 1989-90 season.
He made his top-flight debut in the following season and went on to make 47 league starts for Gloucester, contributing 66 points in league games.
A statement said the thoughts of all at the club were with Roberts' family.
Roberts played in Gloucester's famous final-day relegation decider against Saracens in 1996, as they won 17-10 to avoid the drop.
He also played for nearby Cinderford and later coached at Hereford and Chosen Hill.
