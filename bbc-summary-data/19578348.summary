Cuba profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Cuban media are tightly controlled by the government and journalists must operate within the confines of laws against anti-government propaganda and the insulting of officials which carry penalties of up to three years in prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Private ownership of broadcast media is prohibited, and the government owns all mainstream media outlets.
Cuba is the only country in the Americas not to allow a non-state independent press, says Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Official media "serve first and foremost to transmit propaganda for the regime".

Cuban blogger denied travel visa
The US tries hard to reach Cuban audiences. Washington-backed Radio-TV Marti says it provides "balanced, uncensored" news for Cubans.
Internetlivestats.com says there were 3.1 million internet users by 2014.
US-based NGO Freedom House says access to the internet is tightly controlled, and it is difficult for most Cubans to connect from their homes. Bloggers have faced harassment and detention for supporting dissidents, it adds.
Cuba is one of RSF's "Enemies of the Internet". The authorities have been unable to blame connection problems on the US embargo since a submarine cable linking Cuba to Venezuela became operational, says the press freedom group.
