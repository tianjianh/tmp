The 24-year-old has been with the Gunners since 2011 but struggled for first-team football.
He scored four goals in 30 appearances for Arsenal last season, with three of those coming in 19 league outings.
Costa Rica international Campbell has previously been on loan at Lorient, Real Betis, Olympiakos and Villarreal.
"Everyone at Arsenal wishes Joel a successful season in Portugal," said a statement on Arsenal's website.
Campbell has not been in Arsenal's squad for either of their two opening Premier League games so far this season.
