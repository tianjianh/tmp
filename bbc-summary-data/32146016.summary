Library of Birmingham cuts weekend opening to six hours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The £189m Library of Birmingham, which has been open for less than two years, is to be shut on Sundays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It means the building, housing one million books, will be available for just six hours at weekends, from 11:00 to 17:00 on Saturdays.
The city council cut the hours - from 19 April - as part of needs to save nearly £113m from its 2015/16 budget.
In February, it announced opening hours would be reduced. Up to 90 staff are expected to lose their jobs.
The council stressed that staff redundancies were still being discussed, but cuts could affect a total of 100 people.
The library has more than 200 public access computers, theatres, an exhibition gallery and music rooms.
Loans were mostly used to fund its construction, with a small amount raised through donations and council land sales.
It replaced the 1970s Central Library, which Prince Charles famously described as looking like a place where books would be "incinerated rather than read".
But a mixture of budget cuts and a £1.1bn equal pay claim from female workers has left the council with significant financial problems.
Council leader Sir Albert Bore said the legal bill in particular had left the Labour-run council in a "horrendous position financially".
Library user Steve Godwin, 52, of Handsworth Wood, said he thought the move was "absolutely appalling".
"It's one of the highlights of the city. As a library it's wonderful, modern architecture at its better end. It's a crying shame."
Elaine Lawrence, 47, from Penkridge, Staffordshire, said she thought it was "a bit of a shame" but added: "I don't know how many read books these days.
"I assume if the council have done research, they'll know it doesn't need to open on Sundays."
Now:
From 19 April:
The Wolfson Centre for Archival Research will be open Tuesday to Saturday 11:00 - 16:00. This will be reviewed at the end of May.
Ciara Gallagher, 23, from Solihull, said it seemed "ridiculous to spend a huge amount of money" to then only have it open for 40 hours a week.
However, she thought there would only be a limited impact on tourism "because people would take photos outside anyway and may not go inside".
David Rostron, 34, of Dudley, said: "When they make such a bold statement with the library to rejuvenate the idea of the library and then cut staffing levels and hours, it's almost taking it away.
"The idea of having a library for people to drop into, that's flexible for people working or students - and then to take that away - it's huge, especially for families with children who may only be able to go on Sundays."
The Library of Birmingham was recently named the only attraction outside London on a list of the UK's 10 most-visited tourist sites last year.
It drew more than 2.4 million visitors, beating London's British Library, which saw about 1.6 million.
