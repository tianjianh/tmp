The 28-year-old defender has joined the Dragons on a two-year contract from Grimsby Town.
Keates revealed Pearson turned down a number of offers, including a Football League club, to sign for Wrexham.
"He's a leader and everything that I want at the football club," Keates said.
"He's the perfect match for this football club and how we want to go forward. He gives 110 percent in everything that he does and a great character on and off the field.
"He'll do a great job for this football club and all being well he can play his part in us going forward."
Pearson is Wrexham's second signing of the close season following the arrival of versatile full-back James Hurst.
Keates, who previously said he wanted to sign 14 players this summer, is hoping to confirm further additions this week
"It's all been agreed but I wouldn't say they are Wrexham players until the i's have been dotted and the t's have been crossed," Keates added.
"All being well we'll have one or two more added to the squad going forward."
