Kyle McFadzean: Burton Albion defender warned by Nigel Clough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyle McFadzean has "let down" Burton Albion with his disciplinary lapses and must curb his temper if he wants to stay, says boss Nigel Clough.

McFadzean, 29, joined the Championship side in July but will have missed seven games through suspension this season once he completes a four-game ban for clashing with Barnsley's Sam Winnall.
"There is no excuse," Clough told BBC Radio Derby.
"At his age we are looking for him to start learning."
Clough added: "In his general play there is not a problem. It is just these mad moments and lapses that he has to cut out if he wants to stay with us. He knows he has let everybody down again."
