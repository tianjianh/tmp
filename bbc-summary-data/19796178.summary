[SN]TITLE[SN]

A temporary sales ban on Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer in the US has been lifted by a US court.

District Judge Lucy Koh's move opens the way for US sales of Samsung's older tablet model to restart.
Separately, Samsung filed a motion on Tuesday against Apple's iPhone 5 saying its patents had been violated.
The iPhone 5 was launched last month and broke Apple's pre-sales record. Apple has not commented on either move.
The South Korean firm said it had "little choice little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights".
Apple and Samsung, the two market leaders in the lucrative smartphone market, are embroiled in patent disputes in as many as 10 countries.
The ban on sales of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the US was put in place in June ahead of a trial.
In August, at the conclusion of that trial, Apple was awarded victory in many of its patent violation claims, centring on accusations that Samsung had copied Apple's iPhone and iPad designs. It was also awarded more than $1bn (Â£664m) in damages.
However, the jury found that Samsung had not violated the patent that was the basis for the ban on the sale of the Galaxy Tab 10.1.
Samsung, therefore, argued for the sales ban to be lifted.
