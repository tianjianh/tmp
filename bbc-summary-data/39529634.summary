All three competed at the Rio Games in 2016 before turning to the paid ranks.
Okolie has already made his professional bow, while Cordina and Kelly will each make their debuts before the Wembley date.
The headline bout will be for Joshua's IBF title and the vacant WBA Super and IBO heavyweight belts.
