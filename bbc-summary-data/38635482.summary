Cornish Pirates coach Alan Paver says his side's improved discipline is a major factor in their return to form.

Pirates got a bonus point as they beat Ospreys' Premiership Select 34-10 in Maesteg to consolidate second place in their British and Irish Cup pool.
Paver told BBC Radio Cornwall: "Over the last month we've had a full review of why we lost close games and it came down to our discipline.
"We've had a massive focus on what can we do and what's in our control."
Pirates gave up just six penalties in the whole game as Brett Beukeboom scored two tries, while Tyler Gendall, Marlen Walker and a penalty try earned the Penzance-based club their bonus point.
"The guys have dealt with it pretty harshly in training and in games we have some very frank conversations about discipline issues," added Paver.
"Over the last four weeks our average penalty count has dramatically dropped, in some cases it's halved, which is absolutely outstanding.
"That's testament to their ability to retain the information and being able to deliver it under pressure."
