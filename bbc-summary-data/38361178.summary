Ricky Miller netted his 25th goal of the season but Dover spurned the opportunity to move into the National League play-off positions following a 1-1 home draw with Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts appeared to be heading for a first win in three matches when Miller fired home from the penalty spot in the 16th minute after he was tripped in the area.
But Maidstone levelled on the hour mark through Jamar Loza, whose cross caught out goalkeeper Steve Arnold and flew in off a post.
Dover almost stole the points late on but Miller's shot was well saved by Lee Worgan.
