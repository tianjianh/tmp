The lodge resort development on the outskirts of Holyhead was given the go-ahead in autumn 2013 after initially being turned down.
But developers had to agree to pay towards a community programme as part of the project.
It will see investment in education, medical services and a leisure centre.
As well as a 500 holiday lodge village on land at Penrhos country park, up to 320 houses will be built in the Kingsland area of Holyhead.
Much of the accommodation will initially be used to house the thousands of workers expected to be needed for a new nuclear power station at Wylfa.
Councillors were told that the developers had agreed to put £1.5m into education in the Kingsland area to help address additional pressures brought by the new planned housing.
A further £600,000 will be invested in medical services in the area, while about £1m will be spent mitigating any impact on tourism on the island while construction is ongoing.
As part of the agreement, money will also be spent relocating library facilities and meeting the cost of extra pressures on the emergency services on the island.
The developers are also committed to funding a 690 sq-m public leisure centre and spending more than £500,000 on swimming provision.
The package of 32 measures was backed by the meeting of the island's planning committee on Wednesday.
The overall Land and Lakes project is expected to cost about £120m, creating up to 600 jobs.
As part of deal, the developers are also committed to ensuring up to 80% of the workforce is local.
