Conner Marshall murder: Family raise cash for legal action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a murdered Vale of Glamorgan man have raised enough money to start legal action over the handling of his killer's probation.

Conner Marshall, 18, from Barry, died four days after he was attacked at a Porthcawl caravan park in March 2015.
David Braddon, 26, of Caerphilly, who claimed he mistook Mr Marshall for someone else, was jailed for life.
Wales Community Rehabilitation Company, who was monitoring Braddon, said public protection was its "top priority".
He was being monitored at the time of the killing after he was convicted for drugs offences and assaulting a police officer.
A report by the National Offender Management Service raised concerns about Braddon missing appointments with probation staff, as well as revealing risk assessments and reports that had not been completed.
But it concluded Mr Marshall's murder was not predictable or preventable, and that management of the case had not been linked to the crime.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme, Mr Marshall's parents Nadine and Richard said they had raised the money through a crowdfunding website to hire a legal team.
"We want to question the accountability and the processes taken or not taken whilst he (Braddon) was on community service," Mrs Marshall said.
"The sentence we keep getting from the Ministry of Justice or the Community Rehabilitation Company is that Conner's murder was not predictable and that it was unforeseeable which is gut-wrenchingly insulting because of what we now know."
The couple, who do not meet the requirements for legal aid because they both work, have exceeded their Â£5,000 target.
But they think they might need up to Â£25,000 to fully fund any further legal proceedings.
"The process that should be implemented cannot be, for lots of different reasons. So therefore there are lots of potentially harmfully offenders roaming and there are far more families just waiting for something like this to happen," Mrs Marshall said.
"I have got no faith at all in the system because it's just creaking, it's completely overwhelmed with problems."
In response, a Wales CRC spokesman said serious further offences are "rare" and all decisions were made and supervised by "fully-qualified and experienced probation workers".
"Public protection is our top priority and it is our job to help move people away from crime, and we strive continuously to improve the quality of the services that we provide. However, not all individuals desist from further offences," the spokesman said.
"The management of the case has not been linked to the crime committed - the serious further offence report found that Conner's death was not predictable or preventable.
"After thoroughly reviewing the case, we have strengthened our partnership working between offender managers and intervention providers, ensuring enhanced joint working between agencies to support consistent risk management."
