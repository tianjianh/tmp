Staff at the University of Surrey are being balloted on industrial action in a row over job losses.

The University and College Union (UCU) said 292 members at the Guildford-based institution were being balloted on a possible strike later this term.
The university announced last month that 75 academic posts and 25 other roles were to be cut from September.
It said it was disappointed the ballot was being held while consultations were still being held with staff.
UCU said the job losses affected politics, Surrey Business School, arts and music, electronic engineering, bioscience and computing.
"Any type of industrial action is always a last resort, especially for hard-working academics who care deeply about their students," said UCU spokesman Michael Moran.
"Staff and students are united in their opposition to the university's heavy-handed approach.
"We hope the university will now work with us to resolve the issue before any industrial action becomes necessary."
The university has said it will not close any departments or courses.
Spokesman Paul Stephenson said Surrey wanted to ensure it remained a leading UK university with a financially sustainable future.
"We are consulting widely with staff and the trade unions about the proposed changes," he said.
"As part of this, we are actively seeking ways to avoid any compulsory redundancies.
"While we recognise that it is UCU national policy to oppose compulsory redundancies, we are disappointed that UCU has decided to hold its ballot now given that consultation on the proposed changes will not be closing until 8 May, with final proposals set out later in May."
The strike ballot runs until 30 April.
