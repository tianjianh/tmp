Scotland v England: Terry Butcher says 'battle lines are drawn'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Terry Butcher is England's Lionheart former captain who spent much of his glittering career on "Auld Enemy" territory in Scotland.

So he knows what awaits manager Roy Hodgson and his players in Tuesday's friendly at Celtic Park.
Butcher was the patriotic symbol of England and is still remembered for the iconic image of his blood-stained bandage and shirt after playing on with a head injury in a crucial World Cup qualifier in Sweden in 1989.
He played in three World Cups, leading the late Sir Bobby Robson's side as they were beaten in the semi-final against West Germany in Turin in 1990.
Butcher won the Uefa Cup with his beloved Ipswich Town in 1981 but also had huge success after moving to Rangers five years later, winning three Scottish titles and two League Cups.
And after spending much of his managerial career north of the border in charge of Motherwell, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and latterly Hibernian, Butcher understands the special passions that will be stirred by England's first international in Scotland since 1999.
Celtic fans may know their magnificent stadium as "Paradise" but England will not find a friendly welcome on Tuesday.
Butcher says: "It is the most magnificent arena. There will be a huge noise and great hostility. When I played there in Old Firm games you couldn't hear yourself think or speak. You couldn't make yourself heard to the person five yards away.
"And it will be like this on Tuesday because the Scots have been waiting a long time to get England in their own backyard. Make no mistake, this date will have been marked on every Scotland football fan's calendar since the day it was confirmed. Scotland and England don't do 'friendly' in football.
"It will be manic. When I say hostile, I don't mean physically hostile, it will just be the noise. Wow, I remember one of the most hostile atmospheres I played in for England was against Turkey in Istanbul - this will be Istanbul cranked up another 10 times.
"These games are something special and it will be no place for faint hearts in that England team. I played in the goalless draw at Hampden Park in 1987. I'd just helped Rangers win the title and I thought 'they'll be OK with me - I'll get a good reception here'.
"What a slap in the face I got. What I'd done at Rangers was neither here nor there. I was an England player playing at Hampden Park. I got absolutely slaughtered. No prisoners were taken."
England's last game in Scotland was the 2-0 win at Hampden Park in a Euro 2000 qualifying play-off.
And Butcher thinks the long wait will make the Scots even more desperate to win.
He says: "In a sporting sense the Scots love to hate us, that's for sure, and you'll see and hear that on Tuesday.
"England have the same passion but maybe we don't show it as much as Scottish people do. It does mean a lot to beat the English.
"I've spent plenty of time up there and they still always go on about 1967, when they beat England at Wembley a year after we'd won the World Cup, a win they say meant they were unofficial world champions. I used to just tell them I didn't remember that but I remembered England winning the World Cup.
"I used to love the Home Internationals and a lot of my Ipswich team-mates, like George Burley, Alan Brazil and John Wark, played in them. Every year you looked forward to them and the Scotland game was always special.
"When it came to big tournaments, obviously Scotland weren't there for a lot of them so the shirts of our opponents seemed to fly out of the shop window as all the Scots bought the shirts.
"I got pelters when I was up there and England were playing. If England lost a game I would get massive stick but you give it back. You have to give it back. If you were strong and stood up and gave it back the Scots would respect you for that. I've got a lot of time for Scots and loved my time up there - but battles lines are drawn for this game and you know which side you're on."
Scotland have improved steadily under manager Gordon Strachan, losing unluckily away to World Cup holders Germany in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier, then beating Georgia at home before a creditable 2-2 draw in Poland. They went third in Group D with a 1-0 victory over the Republic of Ireland on Friday.
Butcher is convinced they will be out to prove their growing pedigree at the expense of their fiercest enemy.
He says: "It will be a cracking game. It will be totally different from the Euro group games but with a real competitive edge because of the rivalry between the countries.
"I don't think Scotland are a physical side - they like to play football. They don't have a Graeme Souness in their team like when I played against them and when we had the likes of Peter Reid, real hard men. Although Scotland have Scott Brown, who can mix it when he wants to.
"I've really been impressed with what Gordon has done there. There are players that George Burley brought in who have matured very well - like James Morrison, who has come on leaps and bounds.
"They have got a good footballing team. They have Everton's Steven Naismith up front, who is scoring goals for club and country and there is Shaun Maloney. They have got good players who have played in big games. Ikechi Anya from Watford has done well, showing great composure with his goal in Germany.
"They have got good results but they have also hardened, solidified as a team."
Butcher was part of BBC Radio 5 live's commentary team in Tallinn last month, when Roy Hodgson's England won against Estonia 1-0. They maintained their 100% record in Euro 2016 qualifying with a 3-1 defeat of Slovenia on Friday - and Butcher is in optimistic mood.
"I've liked what I've seen of England since the World Cup," he says.
"England should be looking to be undefeated in their group, even win every game. They've been handed the group with that draw. It's not their fault.
"Everybody's striving to beat England because we're still a big scalp in international football, but they have got to set their own standards and I think they're doing it very well now with Roy and coaches Gary Neville and Ray Lewington.
"I think this team is maturing. There are some very good young players like Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley, and Wayne Rooney keeps scoring goals. I think friendlies like the one in Scotland will help them gain experience because you have got to stick together when it comes to these games.
"When you get into the nitty gritty of a European Championship you may look back on this Scotland game and say: 'We did it then it that atmosphere. We stuck together and now we can do it again.'
"I'm not sure the old legs would carry me now but I know one thing - when this game kicks off on Tuesday I'd love to be out there."
