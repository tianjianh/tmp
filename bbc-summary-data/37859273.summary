Nottinghamshire Police: Budget 'errors' led to officer cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police force cut front-line officers because it mismanaged its finances, according to a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The report concluded Nottinghamshire Police's finances were "at serious risk" after it missed a significant Â£9.4m hole in its budget.
HMIC said the reduction in officers and staff could lead to "a poorer service".
But Chief Constable Sue Fish said the report was "absolutely misleading" and challenged the findings.
According to the report, Nottinghamshire Police "failed to notice substantial costs had been left out of its budgets".
These shortfalls in 2015/16 centred around the force failing to account for IT support costs and a failure to reduce costs as planned.
The force's cash reserves are at the "lowest level that might be considered prudent", the report added.
But Ms Fish said she did not believe HMIC's criticisms were fair.
"It [the report] is absolutely misleading. I was absolutely livid when I discovered some fairly fundamental accounting errors.
"We identified those very early last year, we reported them to the Police and Crime Commissioner, the Police and Crime Panel and HMIC.
"So it feels somewhat rich, to be fair, as we put in place plans and the level of grip you'd expect for proper financial management very, very quickly.
"The people who are responsible are no longer with the organisation."
HMIC has recommended Nottinghamshire Police overhauls its financial management and has suitable expertise within its accounting team.
It also said the force should have a plan to align revenue, capital spending and assumptions about income and should have a "credible and achievable" plan in place for its "police operating model", taking into account where staff can be cut.
