The latest stage of American tycoon Donald Trump's plans for the "world's greatest" golf course in Aberdeenshire have been approved by councillors.

Members of the Formartine area committee met in Ellon and approved plans for Menie by nine votes to two.
They were considering 30 conditions for the project laid down by the Scottish government, but more will have to be approved before work can begin.
The Trump Organisation welcomed the vote.
Mr Trump wants to create a championship course as well as a hotel and hundreds of holiday homes.
Scottish ministers earlier approved the application but with many conditions.
Mr Trump last month vowed to cut the ribbon on his golf resort within 18 months.
He said the total cost of the project was likely to be about Â£750m.
