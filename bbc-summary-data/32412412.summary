An inquest into the death of a man who died after stealing and crashing a private ambulance has opened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael South, 40, from York, hit a double-decker bus on the A64 near York, on 10 April.
Mr South, who the BBC understands was being treated for mental health problems, was being transferred between hospitals at the time of the crash.
North Yorkshire's assistant coroner, John Broadbridge, adjourned the inquest until 30 July.
Mr Broadbridge said investigations into what had happened were "at an early stage".
The theft of the ambulance was reported to police about 20 minutes before the crash at Flaxton, near York, at 20:30 BST.
Mr South was the only person in the vehicle and was pronounced dead at the scene.
The bus driver suffered serious leg injuries and five passengers received minor injuries.
