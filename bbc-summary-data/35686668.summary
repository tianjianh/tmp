Huddersfield back-row forward Oliver Roberts has signed a new four-year deal with the Super League side.

Roberts, 21, joined the Giants from Bradford Bulls in October 2014 and made his debut for the club in the opening game of the 2016 season.
"We have always been a club that has given chances to young British players who are hungry to succeed," head coach Paul Anderson told the club website.
"His challenge is to keep his place when our experienced guys return."
The Giants are second from bottom of the Super League, having failed to win any of their first three games.
They have also lost several key players to injury, including full-back Scott Grix and club captain Danny Brough, leaving Anderson reliant on inexperienced squad members.
"You can't always accept getting beat, but I think our attitude was very poor," Anderson told BBC Radio Leeds following Sunday's 36-18 defeat by Widnes Vikings.
"Consistency is something that we're always striving for, but that collective inexperience and collective poor attitude has cost us.
"We have so many people out in key positions that have been our strengths, and now our strengths have become our downfalls."
