An upcoming TV interview with the Australian man acquitted of the murder of a New Zealand woman during a Tinder date has met with an online backlash.

Gable Tostee, 30, was charged after Warriena Wright, 26, fell in 2014 from his balcony in Queensland's Gold Coast.
After a high-profile, week-long trial last month, a jury found him not guilty of murder and manslaughter.
The Nine Network's 60 Minutes programme has arranged the exclusive interview which will air on 13 November.
"I restrained her to stop her from attacking me," Mr Tostee said in a preview of the interview. "I don't know what else to do. I wanted it to stop."
The preview also features audio recordings of Ms Wright pleading to be allowed to leave the 14th storey apartment, which was a key piece of evidence.
When questioned by a reporter about the fact Ms Wright screamed "no" 33 times in the audio recording, Mr Tostee replied: "Yeah, she was certainly trying to make a lot of noise."
It has been reported by local media that the TV programme is paying Mr Tostee a six-figure sum for the interview.
The deal has angered police, including officers that investigated the case.
"It's disgusting," an unnamed detective told the The Courier-Mail newspaper.
"We respect the court's decision to find him not guilty but for him to now do a paid interview, after everything this poor girl's family has been through, is horrific.
"It might be legally OK but for Tostee to profit from Warriena's death is morally repugnant."
The controversial interview has also prompted an online backlash after a promotional clip was released.
"Stayin' classy 60 Minutes," Carry-ann Mudford said on Facebook. "I am sure that Warriena Wright's family are disgusted at your lack of sensitivity."
Travis Megale commented: "The door to the hallway was as close as the balcony door. He chose the option with no escape."
Natalie Anne said: "I don't believe he is legally guilty of murder. But I do find it disgusting that you are reopening this story. The court case is over. Let the public move on. Tabloid journalism at its worst."
Ms Wright connected with Mr Tostee on the popular dating app Tinder during a short holiday in Australia in August 2014.
Hours later Ms Wright plunged to her death from his balcony.
Jurors rejected the prosecution's case that Mr Tostee intimidated the tourist so much that it caused her to scale his balcony to escape.
