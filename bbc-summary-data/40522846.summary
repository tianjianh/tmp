Mane, 25, needed surgery and missed the final eight games of last season after picking up the injury during a 3-1 win over Everton on 1 April.
He is set to miss Liverpool's opening pre-season friendlies.
"He will continue to be monitored and assessed by the club's medical staff to ensure he returns in the best shape," said a Liverpool statement.
Senegal international Mane scored 13 goals in 27 Premier League games after signing from Southampton for Â£34m in June 2016.
He damaged cartilage in his left knee in a collision with Leighton Baines against Everton.
Mane is unlikely to be ready as Liverpool begin their pre-season programme at Tranmere on 12 July before travelling to Wigan two days later.
Liverpool start the 2017-18 Premier League campaign at home to Watford on 12 August (12:30 BST).
