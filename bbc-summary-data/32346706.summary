Two walkers sparked a rescue operation when they attempted to climb a cliff on a walk around the Isle of Wight.

The RNLI said the men in their 50s had tried to climb to a path near Gurnard, despite it being closed due to erosion.
They were forced to phone for help and were aided off the cliff by coastguard, fire and RNLI crews shortly before 19:00 BST on Thursday.
The men, from Surrey and Sussex, suffered cuts and were described as being "very embarrassed".
An RNLI spokesman said the men were experienced walkers but the earth and bush-covered cliff "proved just too much of a challenge".
They were taken to Cowes by lifeboat.
It is understood the pair intend to complete the final leg of their walk along the 67 mile (107km) Isle of Wight Coast Path.
