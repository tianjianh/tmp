'Unlicensed gangmaster' supplying Lincolnshire farms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A BBC investigation has found evidence of an agency that provides staff in the supermarket supply chain using an unlicensed gangmaster.

BBC Look North filmed undercover at a Lincolnshire farm after learning of claims of poor working methods in the vegetable picking industry.
It revealed Local Link Recruitment appeared to employ Rafal Czerwiak as an unlicensed gangmaster.
The firm said it was licensed and that Mr Czerwiak did not work for it.
A reporter posed as a worker on a farm understood to supply cabbages to three major supermarkets.
Following the 2004 cockle picking tragedy in Morecambe Bay, anyone who provides workers to farms should have a licence from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority.
Gangmasters and migrant workers: What you need to know
Local Link Recruitment does have a licence in the name of managing director Iwona Lebiedowicz but workers believe unlicensed Rafal Czerwiak is in charge.
"Rafal is the main boss in the business," one labourer said. "He gives instructions to supervisors and what they need to do. All people know Rafal talks to farmers. I have never seen any other boss from the company."
Secret filming showed Mr Czerwiak collecting people for work and getting them to sign their job sheets.
He was also recorded saying complaints about Local Link Recruitment workers should be made to him, not the farm.
Another worker said: "Everyone knows that Rafal is the boss. Supervisors work on orders directed from Rafal. He is the boss."
The BBC tried to contact Mr Czerwiak but he failed to respond.
Ms Lebiedowicz, via her solicitors, said he stopped working for the company in October 2014 and records show he resigned as company secretary in 2009.
But BBC filming clearly shows Mr Czerwiak working in September and October this year and he was photographed at an Institute of Directors awards ceremony with Ms Lebiedowicz in June.
The secret filming also revealed a high-pressure working environment and labourers complained of the repeated threat of losing their jobs.
The undercover reporter also witnessed Local Link Recruitment failing to provide health and safety equipment including gloves and waterproofs.
The accusations were strongly denied by Ms Lebiedowicz who said she employed a health and safety consultant.
Her solicitor's letter stated: "Our client strongly suspects the "information and complaints" that you have received, at least in respect of our client, have at least been instigated by competitors or others with a personal grievance against our client."
The British Retail Consortium, which represents the supermarkets, said any information should be passed to the Gangmasters Licensing Authority so it could take action if necessary.
Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said: "Ensuring the welfare of workers that work in our supply chains is a primary focus for retailers.
"We know this requires close work with suppliers, a strong licensing system and effective enforcement which is why we are so supportive of the GLA."
A spokesman for the GLA said it would "consider as a priority any information or evidence of labour exploitation the BBC may have".
The BBC spoke to workers employed by other agencies as part of its investigation.
It found labourers, who are unconnected to Local Link Recruitment, said they were regularly bullied and even sexually abused.
Yurga said some women would be told they could only work if they slept with the boss.
"Several times from in the morning to the afternoon my gang supervisor offered me money to sleep with him. He offered me Â£100 for my body," she said.
Another woman, too afraid to be named, said she was held with a knife to her throat. When she reported it to police she struggled to find work again.
