Paul Zanette's 15th-minute goal gave the Capitals a lead which they held until Brandon Benedict equalised with just over seven minutes remaining.
James Desmarais put Belfast ahead four minutes later with Chris Higgins adding another Giants goal within 60 seconds.
Belfast's 3-1 win came after Saturday's comprehensive 7-2 victory in Edinburgh.
