A cardiac unit in a Cardiff hospital has been rated among the best in the UK for surgery survival rates.

Figures from the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery showed the unit at University Hospital of Wales (UHW) had a survival rate of 98.67%.
It was placed with Southampton and Papworth as the three best-performing.
The figures, from April 2011 to March 2014, suggest Morriston Hospital, Swansea, was ranked sixth out of 39 units.
Its cardiac centre started work on a Â£6.6m upgrade earlier this month.
UHW's lead cardiac surgeon Indu Deglurkar said the NHS in Wales still had a "long way to go" to address waiting times for cardiac surgery.
Two years ago the Royal College of Surgeons highlighted "grave concerns" at the number of patients dying while on waiting lists for scheduled heart surgery at the hospital.
Miss Deglurkar said cardiac surgery services have since come a long way, but there is still room for improvement.
She added: "Cardiff has come out as one of the top three centres in terms of outcomes for patients. This demonstrates Cardiff results are top class and and the quality of care patients expect is very, very good.
"The issue has never been about the quality of care that was rendered. Its always been about the numbers. We have come a long way but still have a long way to go."
Health Minister Mark Drakeford praised cardiac surgery staff at UHW for their achievements.
"I'm pleased to see that the cardiac surgery team has been recognised as one of the best performing teams in the UK - this reflects the commitment of the staff who work there," he said.
The UK average surgery survival rate is 97.7%.
