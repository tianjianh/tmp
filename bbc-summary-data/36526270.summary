Commander Jean-Baptiste S, and his partner, police official Jessica S, died in the attack in Magnanville, blamed on Larossi Abballa.
Abballa, killed during the subsequent police operation, had spent time in jail over links to Pakistani jihadis.
On Tuesday, President Francois Hollande said it was "unquestionably a terrorist act".
