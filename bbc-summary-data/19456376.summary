Police searching a river for the parents of a 13-year-old girl found alone on a hired boat in the Norfolk Broads have recovered two bodies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bodies of a man and a woman were found between Salhouse Broad and Wroxham Broad after a search by divers.
The boat was found on Saturday tied to a tree, close to Salhouse Little Broad, after police were called because it had not been returned as arranged.
Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.
The woman's body was found just after 14:00 BST on Sunday while the man's body was found after 16:35 BST.
Police said the girl - who was found on the boat unharmed - had been told about the deaths and was being comforted by relatives.
Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out on Monday while formal identification of the bodies has yet to be carried out, police said.
Head of the investigation, Det Supt Pete Hornby, said officers were in the early stages of their inquiries "working to establish the sequence of events which led to this evening's tragic outcome".
"The motives surrounding the incident remain unclear but at this time we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths," he added.
Police said they were called at 17:00 BST on Saturday by a member of the public concerned about the whereabouts of the boat and that it was found shortly afterwards.
The girl, who was found on board alone but unharmed, spent Saturday night in protective custody.
The craft was taken to Le Boat boatyard in Horning where it continues to be examined by police.
A mile-long section of the River Bure between Salhouse and Wroxham broads - closed while police searched the area - has reopened to boating traffic.
