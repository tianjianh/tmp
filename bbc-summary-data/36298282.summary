Daley, who won mixed 3m synchronised gold and men's 10m synchro silver earlier in the week, was in second after two of six rounds at the European Aquatics Championships.
However, he then powered past Russia's Viktor Minibaev, who won silver.
"Winning feels great, but I feel in the best place ever which is a huge boost ahead of Rio," he told BBC Sport.
Russia's Nikita Shleikher finished third, with Britain's Matty Lee scoring a career-best 465.10 to finish fifth in the 10m final.
British Diving's 11th medal soon followed, in what has become their best showing in the history of the championships.
Rebecca Gallantree and Alicia Blagg scored 319.32 to win silver in the synchronised 3m springboard event.
Italy took home gold with a score of 327.81, while Russia came third on 304.20.
"This is a brilliant result for us and makes up for missing out on an individual medal," Gallantree told BBC Sport.
Daley won individual European titles in 2008 and 2012 and just months after his last success went on to claim bronze at the London Olympics.
Commonwealth gold in 2014 and world bronze followed last year, but he has struggled with injuries this season.
"I've had a few niggles I've had to overcome so to deliver that score today feels amazing," he said, after winning with 570.50 points.
"A total like that is what you'll need for an Olympic medal so that's a great sign ahead of Rio and I just need to keep pushing from here."
British divers will next compete at the GB national championships in Sheffield, from 10-12 May.
Results there will help determine the final line-up of divers for the Team GB Rio Olympic squad.
