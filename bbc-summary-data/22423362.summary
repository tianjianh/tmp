The 48-year-old man suffered a suspected heart attack five minutes into the second half of Kilmarnock's home match against Hibernian.
Paramedics and medical staff from both clubs treated the man until an ambulance arrived at Rugby Park stadium and he was taken to a nearby hospital.
Both managers agreed to abandon the match out of respect for the fan.
The stadium was hushed into silence when medical staff and club doctors attended the stricken fan in the west stand.
The referee then stopped the match with the teams drawing 1-1. Players left the pitch as the gravity of the situation became evident.
Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston said: "The length of time the players were off the park was a problem but the overriding factor was respect for the fan and his family.
"He collapsed and was tended to by medical staff of both clubs and was taken to Crosshouse Hospital by ambulance."
He added that he could not reveal any more information about the fan's identity other than to say he was a long-standing season-ticket holder
Later, a Police Scotland spokesman said the man died in hospital.
Kilmarnock manager Kenny Shiels pointed out that it was the third time he had been present at such an incident while manager at the Rugby Park side.
In March 2012, midfielder Liam Kelly's father died following the Ayrshire side's League Cup final win over Celtic.
A month later, an Inverness Caledonian Thistle fan died during that club's visit to Rugby Park.
