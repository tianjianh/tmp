At least 15 Britons were among 39 holidaymakers killed in the beach massacre.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Deputy First Minister John Swinney and other senior Scottish ministers took part.
A Tunisian student linked to Islamic State (IS) extremists carried out the gun attack in Sousse.
Tunisia's PM Habib Essid said the majority of the dead were British.
Speaking afterwards, Ms Sturgeon said the Government was preparing for the possibility that some of the victims could be Scottish, while it stands ready to offer assistance to holidaymakers arriving back from Tunisia in the coming days.
She said: "This has been a horrifying and senseless act of violence. The perpetrators of this atrocity do not speak for Muslims, and their actions in the name of Islam are a perversion of that faith.
"Our heartfelt condolences go to all of those who have lost loved ones in this horrific attack. My thoughts are also with any families who are worried about relatives they may not have been able to contact and with all those who have sustained injuries.
"We understand that a high number of those killed are likely to be UK citizens, and while there are not so far any confirmed victims from Scotland, we must prepare ourselves for that possibility."
