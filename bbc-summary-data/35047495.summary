[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US House of Representatives has passed a short-term budget bill, narrowly avoiding a government shutdown as the deadline quickly approaches.

House speaker Paul Ryan announced the bill, which will allow for more time to determine a long-term bill.
"We need to get it right," said Mr Ryan. "I don't want us to go home until we get this done."
Lawmakers are slowly discussing the long-term, $1.1 trillion (Â£732 billion) government spending bill.
The deadline is 11 December for funding the federal government.
Congress needs to resolve the bill before ending the Congressional session and breaking for the holidays to avoid a shutdown.
Democrats oppose some Republican policies in 12 spending bills which would make up one big long-term bill.
The policies tucked into the bills include ending a ban on crude oil exports, blocking new rules on power-plant emissions and stalling a new law about financial advisers.
Republicans "should focus on the budgetary priorities of the country and not try to advance ideological aspects of their agenda that have stalled elsewhere," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.
President Barack Obama has said he would sign a short-term spending bill but would not sign an extension with policy provisions.
The US government shut down for 16 days in 2013 for the first time in 17 years when Democrats and Republicans could not agree on a budget.
Republicans insisted on delaying President Barack Obama's healthcare reform as a condition for passing a bill.
