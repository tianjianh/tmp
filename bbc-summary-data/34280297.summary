[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers named the murder victim as Hidir Aksakal, who was known as Cetin.
His remains were found at Hollow Ponds in Epping Forest on 9 September, but police said his body may have been there for several weeks.
Officers said Mr Aksakal had a "criminal history" which they were exploring as one line of inquiry.
The partially buried body was found by a passer-by in undergrowth off Whipps Cross Road in Leytonstone, in a wooded area close to Whipps Cross University Hospital.
A post-mortem examination carried out at Walthamstow Mortuary on 11 September gave Mr Aksakal's cause of death as gunshot wounds.
Mr Aksakal, a Turkish national, who lived in Margate, Kent, was also known as Musa Yakut, but was more commonly known by his nickname Boxer Cetin.
His last known sighting was in the early hours of 17 August in Green Lanes, north London.
Appealing for witnesses, Det Ch Insp Jamie Piscopo said: "We are building a picture of Cetin's movements up to that evening and someone may have vital information.
"We are working on the basis that Cetin was murdered shortly after the last sighting of him.
"Cetin did have a criminal history, including links to other criminals, and as part of our investigation we are exploring this."
