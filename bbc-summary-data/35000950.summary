Scott Allan says he is now ready to make his first starting appearance for Celtic against Hamilton this weekend.

The 24 year-old midfielder has made only five substitute appearances due to injury since his move from Hibernian in August.
And after coming off the bench in the club's last three fixtures he feels the time is now right for him to start.
"Obviously the gaffer has to give me the chance and hopefully if he does, I can repay him," said Allan.
The talented midfielder made two appearances not long after joining at the end of August.
However, it was the 21 November, in the goalless draw against Kilmarnock at Celtic Park, before he was seen on the pitch again in a first team match.
With Scott Brown and Charlie Mulgrew injured, Allan now has an opportunity to push for a place in manager Ronny Deila's starting line-up.
"I knew when I was coming here I needed to be patient," said Allan. "I said that time and time again that I need to work hard and improve my game.
"I said it would be probably around this time that I would start making an impact if I added things to my game. Obviously I got on in the last three games so I can try and get a start soon."
Allan was speaking as he joined his team mates at Glasgow's new Royal Hospital for Children handing out gifts from the club and a donation of Â£3,000 to assist the work of the Yorkhill Children's Charity.
"I obviously got a setback with the six week injury - so that wasn't ideal at the time," he said.
"But I've come back worked hard on the training pitch and been given the chance to try and prove what I can give in a Celtic shirt.
"Obviously with a few players out with injuries there are a few spaces available, so given the chance I just need to try and make it my own.
"I'm just happy to be getting on the park and hopefully I can turn that into some starts.
"I'm feeling good fitness wise considering I hadn't played as much, but the intensity in training gives me a good fitness level to go in and play.
"When I came here I knew I would have to improve defensively which I've tried to add to my game. That means getting a really good work ethic about my game when we lose the ball, but for me I like to go out and try to create chances so hopefully I can do that."
Allan was used as a substitute in the match against Ajax last week which killed off Celtic's chances of progressing to the knock out stages of the Europa League.
However, he could make his first European start in the final group match against Fenerbahce on Thursday.
He said: "I'd just take the Hamilton game as the first game and if I do well then we'll see what happens if given the chance."
