The 30-year-old, who had a spell with Bath between 2006 and 2010, has made seven appearances this season.
Director of rugby Todd Blackadder said: "We're really pleased to have been able to bring someone who has as much experience as Chris in."

Van Vuuren, 25, joined from Leicester in 2016 and has signed a new two-year deal.
