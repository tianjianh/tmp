The boy reportedly got into difficulties while swimming with friends at Greenbooth Reservoir in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.
Police were called to the moorland beauty spot on Monday. An underwater search team examined the area and later discovered the boy's body.
His details have not been released and police said they did not believe his death was suspicious.
Friends have been laying flowers at the scene all day.
One told the BBC: "I'm speechless, he was really well liked."
David Gillard, who lives nearby, said the reservoir was popular with teenagers.
"We get a lot of teenagers coming up to cool off and what they tend to do is jump off the rocks," he added.
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the boy's family was being supported by specially-trained officers.
Det Ch Insp John Harris said: "My sincerest condolences are with the boy's family at hearing this heart-wrenching news."
David Walker, leisure safety manager at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: "We understand the temptation to want to go swimming at open water sites, especially during the hot weather.
"Things to consider when open water swimming, even on a hot day, is that the water might be a lot colder or deeper than you were expecting and there may be strong currents and underwater debris that you cannot see from the bank.
"Consider how you are going to get out of the water before you get in, and be honest about your swimming ability."
