Most of the 21 contracts in England and Wales have gone to those named six weeks ago as "preferred bidders".
The government hopes the partnerships between companies and charities will turn more offenders away from crime.
But probation union Napo is challenging the arrangements and a judicial review will be heard on Wednesday.

"Following further negotiations with Preferred Bidders, I have today announced that I am awarding contracts to the successful bidders for the 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies. All bidders are receiving formal notification today."

Earlier this week Napo said changes to the way offenders were supervised may have contributed to two murders.
The Ministry of Justice said it would "robustly" contest the allegations.
