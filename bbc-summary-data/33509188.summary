[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three LS Lowry works commissioned more than 60 years ago are to be shown together at York Art Gallery for the first time.

The oil paintings - Clifford's Tower,  Wilson's Terrace and A View of York (From Tang Hall Bridge) - were commissioned by the gallery in 1952.
The gallery kept Clifford's Tower while the other two scenes of York were bought by private collectors.
They will be on show when the gallery reopens next month an Â£8m revamp.
A preliminary sketch of the tower will also join the trio of paintings.
Lorna Frost, curatorial assistant at York Museums Trust, said:  "We are delighted that the private collectors have given us permission to show the other two works and the sketch of the tower to mark the reopening of the gallery.
"Both of the oil paintings show scenes of the city which have since drastically changed.
"They remain true to Lowry's iconic style and will be a highlight for visitors coming to see the newly-reopened gallery this summer."
"Lowry was already a well-known and established artist when he came to York in 1952.
"Leading figures in York suggested to Lowry scenes which would blend gothic and industry, but he instead chose to depict the iconic Clifford's Tower.
"This has become one of the gallery's most famous and well-loved works and if you look closely you can pick out York's industrial buildings in the background of the ancient stone tower."
Lowry, who died in 1976 at the age of 88, worked as a rent collector in Salford and painted in his spare time until his retirement.
He was appointed official artist at the Queen's Coronation in 1953 and, in 1967, the General Post Office issued a stamp reproducing one of his paintings.
Much of his art, which often sells for millions at auction, is characterised by matchstick figures and industrial landscapes.
York Art Gallery will reopen on 1 August.
