An open-top bus carrying the team left Albyn Place at 13:00, and went along Union Street to the Town House.
It followed Aberdeen beating Inverness 4-2 in a penalty shoot out in Glasgow last weekend.
Aberdeen Lord Provost George Adam said the parade gave the whole city the chance to celebrate the team's first major silverware in 19 years.
Union Street became a sea of red and white as thousands of fans watched.
Club chairman Stewart Milne said the turnout was "beyond our expectations".
One fan said: "I have never seen so many people in my life - a great atmosphere."
Alongside the cheering and applause, a loud chant of "Peter Pawlett Baby" echoed along the city's main thoroughfare.
Fans have been singing the alternative lyrics to the Human League song Don't You Want Me at game
A social media campaign around the song swelled following the League Cup victory last Sunday.
Campaigns on Facebook and Twitter to get the single to the top of the charts have snowballed since the club won the trophy.
As a result, the song reached the top of the Scottish singles chart and number 19 in the UK chart on Sunday.
Aberdeen City Council made Â£25,000 from the city's Common Good Fund available to fund the parade.
