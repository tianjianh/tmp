The 24-year-old heptathlete was ruled out of last month's Birmingham Indoor event with a minor hamstring strain.
Johnson-Thompson was due to compete in the long jump in Belgrade.
"I'm healthy/happy and in full training. I just want to concentrate on the outdoor season, as originally planned," she wrote on Instagram.
"Shame I won't be there, as I have such fond memories of last time! But playing the long game."
A British Athletics spokesman added: "The injury is fine but she didn't want to go there and not win, so she is making up for the training she missed."
Multi-eventer Ashley Bryant will captain the British team in Serbia.
