Managerless Swindon Town dropped into the relegation zone as Danny Philliskirk's late goal sealed Oldham's first victory since 15 August.

Chairman Lee Power took charge of Swindon for the first time after Mark Cooper's sacking on Saturday.
Mike Jones gave the Latics a first-half lead with a curling 25-yard strike but Nicky Ajose lifted over David Cornell to level with five minutes left.
Two minutes later, Oldham's Philliskirk netted from a tight angle to win it.
The result saw Oldham move above Swindon in League One, with the victory their first under new boss David Dunn and also their first away from home this term.
Power watched the second half from the Swindon dugout, but along with coach Luke Williams, was powerless to prevent another defeat.
In fact had it not been for keeper Lawrence Vigouroux, defeat could have been heavier at the County Ground.
His double save in the first half from Carl Winchester and Michael Higdon was a particular highlight for Swindon, who only managed their first shot on target after 56 minutes.
Swindon chairman/interim manager Lee Power told BBC Sport: "I don't want to look at the table.
"You don't want to lose anywhere. People get upset, of course they do, it's their football team. They aren't used to seeing their team lose. I don't want them to get used to it either.
"Things really started afresh on Sunday, we have had one training session and as work goes in over the next couple of weeks we will be more fluid and start climbing the table.
"We've got four or five people we want to speak to and it won't be any longer than the Wigan game. That will be the last game and we will have someone in place."
