But Kelly Brook's engagement to David McIntosh is off.
The 34-year-old tweeted: "It's a sad day but I wanted to share with you that David and I are no longer engaged. I love and respect him and wish him all the best".
Kelly met the former Gladiator on New Year's Eve 2013.
They were engaged within months and he recently appeared on Celebrity Big Brother.
Only on Wednesday he tweeted: "Missing you IAMKELLYBROOK far too much".
According to the Sun, Kelly recently said about the relationship: "Sometimes I just get a bit cynical and go, 'Oh, is this really The One? I don't know'".
The model, turned TV-presenter, who's currently working on a sitcom in America has had several high profile relationships.
She recently told the Daily Mail Weekend magazine she'd wasted too much time with "stupid boys and doing stupid things".
Her exes include rugby stars Danny Cipriani and Thom Evans, and actors Jason Statham and Billy Zane.
Earlier this month, speaking to Grimmy about her new autobiography, she said: "There's stuff about boyfriends. Nice boyfriends, horrible boyfriends, but I was fair.
"I thought everyone who's in there is pretty fair game to be honest."
