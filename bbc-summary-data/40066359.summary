The firm, which allows users to book a car on a smartphone app, was granted a five-year private hire licence to operate in the capital in 2012.
Transport for London (TfL) said the four-month licence renewal "will allow us to conclude our consideration of a five-year licence".
The taxi driver union has demanded to know the reasons for the decision.
Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, said it was "time politicians banned this tax-dodging, driver-exploiting, parasitic company".
Uber's previous licence was due to expire on 30 May.
A spokesperson for the company said it "looks forward to continuing to help keep London moving".
