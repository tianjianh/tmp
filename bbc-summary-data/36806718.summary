Ambulance workers called officers to an address in Station Road, Herne Bay, early on 7 May following the death of the 38-year-old.
A 41-year-old man from Herne Bay who was arrested on suspicion of murder a week later, and later bailed, was released without charge on Thursday.
A police spokeswoman said a report was being prepared for the coroner.
