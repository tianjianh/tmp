A charity has launched a search to re-home a dog that was found trapped in a six-inch gap in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bracken the lurcher was found in a garden in Wentloog, "starving, bleeding and close to death".
The one-year-old was whimpering when a passerby heard him and called the dog wardens.
Cardiff Dogs Home said: "He is such a calm, affectionate dog and would make an ideal family pet."
Dog warden Kathryn Hubery said: "When we got there we were unable to get him out so we called the fire service."
Dan Pullen, crew manager at Cardiff Central Fire Station, said: "I actually thought he was a dark dog from the amount of blood - I wouldn't recognise him at all from what he looks like today.
"The vets have done an amazing job."
Bracken is now recovering from infected wounds, dehydration, hypothermia and low blood levels at Summerhill Veterinary Practice in Newport.
He is now being looked after at Cardiff Dogs Home until a new owner can be found.
