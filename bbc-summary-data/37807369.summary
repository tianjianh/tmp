First-half goals from Mat Sadler and Ajay Leitch-Smith set the Shrews on their way before Jack Grimmer added a third after half-time.
Barnet carried an early threat from set-pieces, and central defender Bira Dembele twice went close in quick succession, forcing a save from goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler at his near post before heading another Curtis Weston corner just wide.
Shrewsbury took the lead in the 27th minute when defender Sadler reacted quickest to turn in the rebound after Jim O'Brien's 20-yard free-kick came back off the crossbar.
The League One side doubled their advantage five minutes later as Leitch-Smith headed in a left-wing cross from strike partner Ivan Toney.
Leitch-Smith was then denied by a sharp save low to his left from goalkeeper Jamie Stephens, but Grimmer made the game safe.
Shrewsbury boss Paul Hurst: "A clean sheet is something we've not had and a win at home - and just a win generally.
"I thought they started off a little nervous in truth, but particularly when we went 2-0 up I thought suddenly you saw a different set of players, or some of them certainly, and looked a threat."
"When you're a team that hasn't won for so long, I think we have to be very pleased.
"We're not getting carried away but enjoy today and hopefully we'll have more of those feelings as we move forward."
Barnet manager Martin Allen: "We started very well and had several good chances to take the lead but they didn't get converted and then on their first attack they score, so that was particularly disappointing.
"It looked like every time they went forward they did score, whereas we dominated the game without keeping too much possession.
"The game was played more often than not in their half but we weren't able to convert chances.
"I thought the players had a good committed performance but we certainly were lacking in the final third."
