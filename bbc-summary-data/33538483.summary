Angela Cockburn, 49, her husband David, 48, his two daughters Carley Ann, 21, and Bethany, 18, and Bethany's one-year-old daughter Lacie were killed on the A18 in Laceby near Grimsby in 2013.
The family, from Ouston, were going to a dance competition.
The Crown Prosecution Service had "considered the circumstances of the collision", Humberside Police said.
Det Ch Insp Matthew Baldwin said: "No criminal charges will be brought in connection with the incident. The family and the coroner have been notified."
The Grimsby stretch of the A18 featured in a BBC television programme, Britain's Killer Roads, in 2011.
The programme claimed it was 25 times more dangerous than the average British motorway, with 20 crashes in the preceding three years.
North Lincolnshire Council said after the crash that the speed limit on the road would be cut from 60mph to 50mph.
The lorry driver had minor injuries.
