Hundreds of workers at Glasgow and Aberdeen airports are to be balloted on strike action in a row over pensions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Unite union said around 480 of its members will vote before 13 July on whether to launch a campaign of industrial action.
Unite said members had rejected proposed changes to the pension schemes operated by airport owners AGS, who say they are "committed" to further talks.
Staff involved include security, airfield operations and firefighters.
Unite regional officer Pat McIlvogue said: "Unite has continually tried to negotiate a remedy with AGS over the proposed pensions schemes changes that avoids the need for industrial action and disruption at the two airports.
"Unite put forward a proposal, which would save the company Â£3.5m-a-year, but despite our repeated attempts to reach an amicable solution our efforts have been met with intransigence.
"Unite has no option but to ballot members for industrial action to protect pension provisions that are deferred wages and to strongly oppose AGS's proposed imposition."
A spokesman for AGS Airports Limited said: "Discussions have been ongoing between the company and union representatives regarding changes to the existing final salary (defined benefit) pension scheme since October 2015.
"We remain committed to holding further discussions with union representatives in order to reach a solution that is acceptable to all parties."
