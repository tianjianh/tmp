Wales' squad, which contains 12 uncapped players, play Tonga on 17 June and Samoa on 24 June.
"It's going to be a huge test for us and I don't think that fact has been lost on the boys," McBryde said.
"They're pretty switched on and they've been exceptional in the way they've gone about their work."
Wales warmed up for the summer tour with a 88-14 win over Welsh Premiership side RGC 1404 in Colwyn Bay at the end of week-long training camp in north Wales.
"It's quite incremental with regards the intensity. We experienced North Wales, which would have been a step up for a lot of the new faces," McBryde added.
"It's a step up again for the stage that's going to be set up in Auckland at Eden Park against a Tongan team that's going to be fired up.
"And then there's obviously Samoa on their home patch.
"Samoa are playing the All Blacks the week before they face us. They're going to be coming into that game on the back of having played in a Test match at the highest level.
"We've got to be ready for that. Hopefully that game against Tonga will give them a little bit of a taste of it and they'll know what to expect.
"I'm sure that it will be the case that the more experienced members in the squad will keep everybody else on their toes."
Exeter full-back Phil Dollman and Scarlets prop Samson Lee have pulled out of Wales' tour with knee injuries.
Scarlets fly-half or full-back Rhys Patchell and Ospreys prop Rhodri Jones have been added to the squad.
