Real Madrid and Wales forward Gareth Bale has extended his contract with the Spanish giants until 2022.

The 27-year-old arrived at the Bernabeu from Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur on a six-year deal in 2013 for a then world record fee of £85m.
He has helped Real win five trophies in the past three seasons, including the Champions League twice, and scored 62 goals in 135 appearances.
Midfielders Luka Modric and Toni Kroos have also signed new deals this month.
Bale's contract is reportedly worth £600,000 per week, £350,000 after tax.
The former Southampton player, who has formed an impressive attacking partnership with Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo and France striker Karim Benzema, is due to speak to the media on Monday.
Bale scored the crucial second goal as Real ended a 12-year wait for their 10th European Cup with a 4-1 victory against Atletico Madrid in his debut season.
That came after his stunning solo goal clinched victory in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona in the previous month.
But his second season was not as successful from both a personal and team perspective.
He struggled with calf injuries, was jeered by some Real supporters and faced heavy criticism from sections of the Spanish media as Carlo Ancelotti's side failed to win a trophy.
However, he flourished under new manager Zinedine Zidane last season and has been rewarded with a place on the 30-man shortlist for this year's Ballon d'Or.
