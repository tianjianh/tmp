[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ayr United stuttered their way into the Scottish Challenge Cup quarter-finals after Gary Harkins' extra-time goal settled an uninspiring encounter.

Luke Leahy missed a penalty for Falkirk in the second half, rattling the left post after Lee Miller was up-ended.
It took 115 minutes to provide a breakthrough with a scrambled effort from the outstanding Harkins.
Ayr keeper Greg Fleming then produced a wonderful save to allow the hosts to hang on and avoid a penalty shootout.
Reduced prices tempted just 1,247 souls to Somerset Park, and they witnessed a first half short on thrills.
Scott Shepherd's low shot for Falkirk was straight at keeper Fleming, while United came closest with a fiery effort from Harkins.
It was little better after the break, despite a turn and shot from Allan Forrest which produced a fine save from Falkirk goalkeeper Deniz Dogan Mehmet.
After Leahy's penalty miss, a shootout appeared inevitable before Harkins struck five minutes from the end of extra time.
