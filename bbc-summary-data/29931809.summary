A 15-month-old girl was held at knife-point before burglars stole cash and jewellery from a west London house.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burglars posing as meter readers entered the home of a 31-year-old woman in Uxbridge, at about 17:00 GMT on Friday.
The woman saw the man holding a knife to her baby before saying: "Where is the gold?"
An e-fit of one of the suspects, who pretended to be from a water company, has been released by Scotland Yard.
The man bound the mother's wrists and ankles and put her and her daughter in the bathroom during the raid.
He was then joined by a female accomplice and they began to search the house, eventually making off with some jewellery.
The mother and daughter were found by neighbours about 50 minutes later, when police were called.
The suspect was wearing a lanyard around his neck and a high-visibility jacket which made the victim believe he was a genuine meter reader, police said.
Emergency services attended the scene and the mother and daughter did not need to go to hospital.
Det Con Anji Dawson said: "This incident happened on Halloween at about 17:00 GMT so we believe there may have been many people in the area that may have seen the suspect."
The male suspect is in his early 30s, about 5ft10in  (1.78m) tall, had a goatee beard and a neck tattoo.
He spoke with a London accent and wore a blue-coloured fleece with a short sleeved high-visibility jacket, dark trousers, black shoes and a woolly hat.
There is no description of the female accomplice, who was heard, but not seen by the victim.
