[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 11,000 patients will have to register with a new GP practice after it was announced four Lincolnshire surgeries are to close in under six weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Arboretum and Burton Road surgeries in Lincoln, Metheringham Surgery, and Pottergate Surgery in Gainsborough are to close.
Universal Health Ltd said it could no longer run them after getting into financial difficulties.
The practices will close on 7 January.
West Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it had received a number of applications from other providers but none met the minimum criteria.
Sarah-Jane Mills,  for the CCG, said: "In these regrettable circumstances, we have no alternative but to close the practices."
There would be 13 other practices nearby for patients to join, said the CCG.
