The band reclaimed the title after a Scottish band, Shotts & Dykehead Caledonia, triumphed last year.
Before that the Northern Irish band had won the title four times in a row between 2011 and 2014.
More than 800 pipers and drummers from 235 bands took part in the competition in Glasgow which came at the end of the week-long Piping Live! festival.
This year, competition came from bands from as far away as the US, Australia and South Africa.
Organisers said 200 events took place as part of the festival with performances around the city.
Inverary and District finished second in the grade one event, followed by St Laurence O'Toole from the Republic of Ireland in third.
This year was the 30th in a row that Glasgow has hosted the World Pipe Band Championships, or The Worlds as they are known.
Ian Embelton, chief executive of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association, said: "We have enjoyed an incredible two days of thrilling competition from pipe bands who have committed so much time, energy and talent in pursuit of the ultimate prize.
"The planning for next year is already under way and I am looking forward to seeing what we can do to build further on this fantastic occasion."
The Lord Provost of Glasgow and chieftain of the world pipe band championships, Sadie Docherty, said: "There is nothing like the sights and sounds of Glasgow Green during the world pipe band championships and the city remains proud to welcome the event and so many pipers and drummers to the city every summer.
"It has been a wonderful championships full of outstanding performances and more than a little drama. Congratulations to everyone who took part."
