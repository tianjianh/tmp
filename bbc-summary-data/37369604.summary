Moores, from Trowbridge in Wiltshire, trains in Swansea and is funded by Disability Sport Wales.
"I can't believe it, I'm so glad about moving to Swansea," he said.
"The whole team down there have just picked me up and moved me forward."
His gold came on a day when Paralympics GB overtook their medal haul from London 2012 - making Rio their most successful games.
