William Miller, 62, from Balfron, Stirling, was last seen in Jamestown, Alexandria at about 00:20.
Police are investigating two unconfirmed sightings in the Bonhill and Balloch areas but do not believe there is any criminality involved.
His niece, Eva McGregor, 30, told a news conference on Monday her family wanted "Uncle Billy" to get in touch.
The news conference at Dumbarton Police Office was attended by Ms McGregor and her parents, Eva, 61, who is Mr Miller's sister, and her 62-year-old husband James.
In a statement, Ms McGregor said: "It is very out of character for him not to return home and for us not to have heard from him for this length of time.
"We are asking for anyone who has any information or thinks they have seen him to get in touch with the police by phoning 101.
"We also ask you to share the Argyll and West Dunbartonshire Police Facebook posts to try to raise further awareness on social media. Please help us find my Uncle Billy."
In an appeal directly to Mr Miller, Ms McGregor said: "Uncle Billy, if you see this, we need you to know that me, my mum and dad, nana, Logan, and Ben all love and miss you, we need to know that you are safe and we want you to come home. Thank you."
Mr Miller's family said he grew up in Alexandria and has friends in the area but had not made contact with anyone.
They said he was "a keen and active walker and enjoys country and forestry trails", adding it may be "possible that he may have tried to walk home to Balfron".
Police said that the last confirmed sighting of Mr Miller had been at the BP Garage in Main Street, Jamestown, Alexandria, at about 00:20 hours on Thursday 7 January.
He had spent most of the evening in Fenton's Bar, which is located on the same road.
Earlier on 6 January, Mr Miller was spotted on CCTV within Tesco in Milngavie at about 13:15.
During the new conference, Ch Insp Graeme MacDiarmid revealed that officers had received two further unconfirmed sightings of Mr Miller in the Bonhill and Balloch areas.
The Balloch sighting was on the evening of 8 January in the Balloch Road area.
The Bonhill sighting was around lunchtime on the Sunday 10 January by a dog walker at the back of Bonhill, near to Knoblestone Wood.
Mr Miller is described as 5ft 10in to 6ft tall and of medium build.
He was last wearing blue jeans, a blue and grey t-shirt, black hooded water-proof jacket with a Douglas Park logo on the left breast.
He was carrying a distinctive small black rucksack with light blue panels.
Mr Miller usually wears a white-faced analogue watch with a brown leather strap.
