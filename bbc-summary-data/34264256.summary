Mickey Harte to remain as Red Hands manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mickey Harte has been re-appointed as Tyrone manager for another two years, ending speculation over his future.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision to keep Harte at the helm was ratified at a county executive meeting in Garvaghey on Tuesday night.
A few thorny issues threatened to bring an end to his 13-year tenure, which has seen him guide the Red Hands to three All-Ireland titles.
Harte has made it clear since All-Ireland semi-final defeat by Kerry that he wanted to stay in the job.
Last week, Harte met a three-person delegation from the county executive, led by chairperson Roisin Jordan.
The trio reported back to Tuesday's meeting, and it was agreed and confirmed that Harte will once again take charge of the Tyrone senior team in 2016.
Harte's one-year term ended on the day of the Kerry game and for the first time since his appointment in late 2002, he did not have an agreed extension in place with the county board.
The Errigal Ciaran man is by far the longest serving football boss in the county, and the most successful manager in the history of Tyrone GAA.
The only man to guide the county to an All-Ireland title, he has done so on three occasions.
After winning the Sam Maguire Cup for the first time in 2003, the Red Hands claimed the coveted trophy again in 2005 and 2008.
The All-Ireland U21 winning management team of Feargal Logan, Brian Dooher and Peter Canavan was also returned on a two year term.
