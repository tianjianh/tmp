Bawsey Pits drowning: Carers cleared over teenager's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two support workers who faced charges after a teenager drowned while swimming at a former quarry have been cleared.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Umar Balogun died while swimming at Bawsey Pits, Norfolk, in July 2013.
The 16-year-old had been taken to the beauty spot by carers Vanda Cawley and Kevin Roweth from Castle Homes centre, in Cambridgeshire.
The pair had denied failing to take reasonable care of the boy's safety. A jury at King's Lynn Crown Court found them not guilty.
Updates on this story and other Norfolk news
Swimming is banned at the pits, but many ignored warning signs.
Umar disappeared after diving under the surface of the water in the body of the former quarry, near King's Lynn.
He was at the lake with another boy and the two care workers, who had not seen a document which said Umar was a "high risk" for swimming, Norfolk Coroner's Court was told in 2015.
The inquest heard Umar had been tagged under a court order and was being cared for at the centre.
Umar's death was accidental, an inquest jury ruled.
Ryan Pettengell, 41, of King's Lynn, Norfolk, had swum out to look for Umar but he got into difficulties and also drowned.
An inquest concluded in 2014 Mr Pettengell's death was accidental.
Ms Cawley, 51, of Hazel Croft, Werrington, and Mr Roweth, 29, of Edinburgh Drive, Wisbech, had denied failing to take reasonable care of Umar's safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act.
