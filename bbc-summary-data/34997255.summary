The ex-MPs who died in 2015 - part one

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This year saw the loss of one of the most memorable figures in post-war British politics, Labour peer Lord Healey. Another formidable political character, ex-Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, died in June. But they weren't the only former MPs to pass away in 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Conservative MP began his political life in his early 20s - in the Liberal Party, serving as a councillor and seeking election to Parliament twice in 1974.
But a few years later, in 1979, he changed his political allegiance, and was elected as the Conservative MP for Kingswood.
According to the Daily Telegraph's obituary, Aspinwall's selection from a field of 90 as the Conservative candidate triggered a number of resignations from the Kingswood association. But he repaid his backers by defeating Labour's Terry Walker by 303 votes to win the seat, it adds.
Aspinwall represented the Kingswood seat until 1983 and, after a boundary change, the-then Wansdyke constituency between 1983 and 1997.
He worked his constituency hard - particularly on behalf of its aircraft workers - and was popular in the Commons, wrote the Telegraph. But the MP, who it describes as stocky and grey-haired, failed to make much of an impact in Parliament beyond promoting a bill in 1982 empowering councils to introduce dog warden schemes, it adds.
During his time in Parliament, Aspinwall moved steadily to the right, U-turning on his opposition to capital punishment, and opposing abortion and the lowering of the homosexual age of consent, wrote the Telegraph.
The MP hit the national headlines in 1980 after a parachute jump for charity went wrong and left him paralysed from the waist down for some time. According to the Bath Chronicle, an entertaining book of after-dinner stories he put together during his recovery raised about Â£40,000 for worth causes, such as the Airey Neave Memorial Trust.
Jack Aspinwall was born in Bootle, Liverpool and educated at Prescot Grammar School and Marconi College, Chelmsford. After leaving school, he joined the RAF, until 1956.
He married Brenda Squires in 1954 and had a son and two daughters, reported the Telegraph.
David Bellotti was the first person to be elected as a Liberal Democrat MP after the party was formed by the merger of the Liberal Party and the SDP.
He secured a surprise victory in a  1990 by-election - prompted by the killing of Conservative MP Ian Gow by an IRA bomb placed under his car - in Eastbourne, which was, until then, a largely safe Conservative seat.
But his tenure in Parliament would be relatively short-lived, as Bellotti lost the seat to the Conservatives two years later in the 1992 general election.
According to the Liberal Democrats, he was an active campaigner and a committed liberal who championed the cause of the Liberal Democrats throughout his life.
Following his short stint as an MP, he became a councillor for East Sussex and Bath, and chief executive of Brighton and Hove Albion football club.
The Telegraph's obituary reported that he had a "torrid" time at the football club.
Bellotti was nicknamed David Baloney by fans after a series of public relations gaffes and was ousted from the job in September 1997, wrote The Argus.
First elected in 1974, Lord Brittan was a key figure in Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s, serving as her home secretary from 1983 to 1985.
He later became trade and industry secretary, resigning in 1986 during the row over control of British helicopter manufacturer Westland, which became known as the Westland affair.
He quit when he was revealed as having authorised the leaking of a letter from the solicitor general criticising former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had also resigned a few weeks earlier.
As an MP, Lord Brittan represented the constituencies of Cleveland and Whitby and Richmond in Yorkshire. He stood down from the Commons when he became a European commissioner in 1989.
Raised in London, he studied at Cambridge University and worked as a barrister after graduating.
The former Conservative MP spent a decade in Brussels from 1989 to 1999 as one of the UK's European commissioners, and as vice-president of the Commission from 1989 to 1993.
Lord Brittan recently faced questions over his handling of child abuse allegations during his time in office.
The controversy centred on a dossier on alleged high-profile paedophiles handed to the then home secretary by former Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens. Lord Brittan insisted the proper procedures had been followed.
Lord Brittan is survived by his widow and two stepdaughters.

Denis Coe was the Labour MP for Middleton and Prestwich, from 1966 to 1970.
He was awarded the Scout Silver Cross for Gallantry in 1943, after he saved an eight-year-old girl from drowning off Whitley Bay, wrote former Labour MP Roy Roebuck in the Independent.
Mr Roebuck says that although Coe's stint in Parliament was quite brief, he made a significant contribution to the life of the nation, including by founding the British Youth Opera.
Before embarking on his parliamentary career, he served in the RAF and, afterwards, taught in schools and polytechnics.
After losing his Commons seat, he returned to teaching, sang in choirs and founded the National Bureau for Handicapped Students and the British Youth Opera, said the Independent.
Coe's father, James was Labour mayor of Tynemouth and a magistrate, while his mother, Lily, was mayoress, he said.
He married in 1953, to Margaret Chambers and the couple had one daughter and three sons. They divorced in 1979 and and he remarried that year, to Diane Barr, who died in 2014.
As an MP, Sir Peter Fry represented Wellingborough and Rushden constituency in Northamptonshire for 28 years, from 1969 until his defeat by Labour in 1997.
He served on numerous parliamentary committees, but was particularly notable as an expert on transport issues.
The Guardian's obituary describes Sir Peter as a rightwing, populist Conservative MP who puzzled party whips with his unpredictable behaviour in the voting lobbies.
He was a union-basher, the paper added, but someone who was also socially sensitive, having fought against payments for dental and eye tests, cuts in housing benefit and VAT on children's shoes. He was also one of two Conservative MPs to oppose curbs on mortgage assistance to the newly unemployed, the Guardian said.
The paper described him as a fervent Eurosceptic who believed that a federal Europe would enable Germany to have, in his words, "a finger on the nuclear trigger".
According to Peter Bone, the current MP for Wellingborough, Sir Peter proposed a private member's bill on cruelty in animal testing.
He was also put forward as a member of the Council of Europe by John Major, serving as a rapporteur on the Committee of Legal Affairs, Mr Bone said.
Sir Peter started his career as an insurance broker, joining the Wycombe Young Conservatives in 1949 and the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1951.
He went on to become a Conservative councillor on Buckinghamshire County Council between 1961 and 1967, and was knighted in 1994.
Also a keen rugby fan, he captained the Old Wycombiensians and often played rugby for the county, said the Guardian.
Sir Peter is survived by his wife, Lady Fry, and a son and daughter from his first marriage, according to the North Hants Telegraph.
The Times' obituary summed up Sir Philip Goodhart as a Conservative politician who defied ideological labels, infuriated party whips and fell out with prime ministers.
He was elected to Parliament in 1957 as the MP for Beckenham - a constituency he served for 25 years.
The Guardian said his highly developed sense of public service, unquenchable curiosity and devotion to his constituency meant that he was popular both in the House of Commons and his constituency but, it added, his independent spirit meant he would serve only briefly on his party's frontbench.
He was initially viewed as a right-winger within the Conservative Party - supporting the restoration of capital punishment and sceptical about race relations legislation, the paper's obituary said.
But he was a member of the party's One Nation group and regarded as among Tory liberal mainstream thinking on employment and the environment - leading many to think of him as a "wet", the Independent's obituary reported.
For a record 19 years, Sir Philip was joint secretary of the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs and published a book on its history, said the Telegraph. But the Guardian said his loyalty was such that the book was characteristically discreet about the group.
He was a strong advocate of referendums, holding one in his own constituency over Europe and writing two books about them, said the Guardian.
His other main interests were defence and foreign affairs.
The Guardian and Telegraph reported that he was a council member of the Consumers' Association, campaigning against "inertia selling". He also helped to end the maximum wage for footballers and championed pay TV which he saw as as a way of empowering professional sport.
After he left Parliament he remained an assiduous campaigner, notably for road humps, according to the Telegraph.
Born to American parents, Sir Philip was educated in the United States at Hotchkiss School, then at Trinity College, Cambridge.
Prior to entering Parliament he worked as a journalist - for the Telegraph and Sunday Times - and a foreign correspondent. He also served in the Armed Forces, as a lieutenant in the Rifle Corps and the Parachute Regiment.
Sir Philip is survived by four daughters and three sons.
Teresa Gorman, Conservative MP for Billericay between 1987 and 2001, was a prominent figure in the rebellions over Europe that nearly brought down John Major's government.
A leading rebel over the Maastricht Treaty in the 1990s, she believed the treaty gave away too many powers to Europe.
After refusing to back the EC Finance Bill in 1994, she had the Conservative whip withdrawn.
Ms Gorman was a leading supporter of John Redwood in his leadership challenge to Mr Major in 1995. But she said none of the party's leadership contenders in 1997 was worthy of being prime minister; at the time calling William Hague "a prepubescent political marshmallow".
The Telegraph's obituary described Ms Gorman as stridently feminist, and said she personified her belief that women were "active, productive and seductive members of society".
She campaigned for tax relief for working mothers' child care costs, and her speech in April 1990 opposing a bill to curb abortions was rated by some a parliamentary classic, it said.
Regarded as a talented but maverick politician, she was also known for her public enthusiasm for hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
Ms Gorman first stood for Parliament in 1974 as an Anti-Heath Independent, and was a councillor for Westminster City Council from 1982 to 1986.
Prior to her election in 1987, she trained as a teacher.
In recent years, she shifted her allegiance to UKIP, and voted for the party at the general election in May.
