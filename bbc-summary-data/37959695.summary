[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 0-2 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe suffered a seventh successive home defeat as they were beaten by Luton Town, who climbed to fourth in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Danny Hylton and Isaac Vassell gave Nathan Jones's side victory over Jim Bentley's strugglers, who had defender Alex Whitmore sent off for a straight red card five minutes from time.
Striker Hylton gave the Hatters the lead in the 26th minute with a superb goal, collecting the ball on the edge of the area before a fine, curling shot that gave Barry Roche no chance, beating the home keeper low to his left-hand side.
Vassell doubled the advantage just before the hour with a close-range header, as Morecambe pushed forward looking for a leveller.
Right-back James Justin took advantage to drill in a shot that Roche could only parry onto the crossbar and Vassell bundled the loose ball home from three yards out.
Luton created the majority of the chances on offer and Hylton could have had a hat-trick had it not been for a string of fine saves by Roche and a goal-line clearance from Dean Winnard.
Morecambe, who were aggrieved that two first-half penalty claims were waved away, came close when Cole Stockton forced Hatters keeper Christian Walton into a fine save with a low shot on the turn that was heading for the bottom right-hand corner.
