[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Official notification of the UK's intention to leave the EU should be sent to Brussels as soon as possible, First Minister Carwyn Jones has said.

The move - known as Article 50 - is important as it starts a strict two-year timetable for withdrawal.
David Cameron, who announced his resignation after the referendum, has said his successor should trigger the formal process to leave the union.
On Tuesday Mr Jones told AMs a delayed process was not in Wales' interest.
In other developments on Tuesday:
"My view is that Article 50 should be triggered sooner rather than later," Mr Jones said.
"I think waiting months and months and months for it just adds to that uncertainty.
"Better that people know where they stand rather than not knowing what's going to happen for many months and many years."
Uncertainty was "never going to be helpful" to investment, Mr Jones added, saying that Brexit process should conclude "as quickly as possible".

Neil Hamilton, UKIP's leader in the assembly, said "in the spirit of cooperation" both he and Welsh Conservative leader, Andrew RT Davies, should be involved in the Welsh Government's Brexit talks with UK ministers.
Mr Hamilton said "making the case for Wales" would be "strengthened with the added voices of those who were actually in favour of the result which the people of Wales voted for".
Mr Jones said he had written to the prime minister and was waiting for a reply but that "the people of Wales have voted for a Welsh Government to take forward that response".
He added there would be involvement with all parties as discussions continued.
On Tuesday evening, there was a pro-EU rally held in Cardiff city centre, which attracted almost 1,000 people.
One of the organisers, Sioned James, said: "This is not a protest against the results. This is an opportunity to show our appreciation of the European Union and everything it has offered Wales."
Cardiff was one of five Welsh local authority areas which voted to Remain in last week's referendum.
Among those addressing the crowd were Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Gruff Rhys, the frontman of Welsh rock band Super Furry Animals.
Remain campaigner Shazia Awan told the crowd that she had been the victim of "shocking" racist messages since the vote.
