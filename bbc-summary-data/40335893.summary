The visitors added a further 44 to the overnight score before being dismissed, leaving South African Kyle Abbott just three short of a maiden century.
Lancashire then fell to 69-3 but opener Davies made 115 to steady the innings, helped by 76 not out from Dane Vilas.
Seamer Gareth Berg took 2-51 for Hampshire, while Abbott, Brad Taylor and James Vince claimed a wicket each.
In the morning session, England's all-time record wicket-taker James Anderson claimed a second scalp of the match, dismissing Taylor before Ryan McLaren wrapped up the Hampshire innings with the wicket of Matt Salisbury.
Rob Jones, Luke Procter and skipper Steven Croft all failed to reach double figures at the top of the order for Lancashire.
But, despite two dropped catches and a missed run-out opportunity, Davies reached his century from 152 balls before he was caught at deep square leg by Michael Carberry off James Vince.
Davies had help from Shivnarine Chanderpaul, neatly stumped by Lewis McManus for 33, in a stand of 74 in 16 overs before Vilas then put on 55 with McLaren (23 not out) to help the hosts close 117 runs behind.
Lancashire batsman Alex Davies told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"It feels really nice to get another hundred. It kind of feels I've left some runs out there, but I was getting really tired towards the end of the day and it was a lack of concentration.
"I'm pleased with the innings and pleased with the position we're in but you always want a few more runs as I haven't got any runs in the last couple of games.
"I've always felt like a natural opener but it's a question of where the team wants me to bat.
"The pitch is good. Typical Old Trafford. It's just a question of whether it goes on day four."
Hampshire pace bowler Kyle Abbott told BBC Radio Solent:
"I was close to my first hundred but it just wasn't meant to happen. It isn't the end of the world.
"My game plan is to be positive and I find I defend better when I adopt that approach. I'm just pushing my limits and seeing what I am capable of.
"I'd absolutely like to get a first-class hundred. I thought it was there today. At least I now know the process and what it takes to get there.
"The scoring's been quick so it's difficult to know what a good score is. The wicket is good but it's just staring to get a bit variable and I'm sure that will become important as the game progresses."
