[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United moved up to second in the Championship table with a comfortable victory at Derby County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yoan Gouffran gave the visitors the lead when he thundered in a volley from Jonjo Shelvey's corner.
Craig Bryson had the Rams' best chance after the break, but his powerful shot from the edge of the box was parried away by goalkeeper Matz Sels.
The Magpies sealed the win in injury time, Ayoze Perez finding DeAndre Yedlin to scuff a shot home.
Derby's goal-scoring difficulties continue, having scored just once in their first six league games despite handing debuts to an attacking trio of Matej Vydra, James Wilson and Ikechi Anya, who were signed before the transfer window closed.
By contrast, Rafael Benitez's Newcastle have now recovered from their wobbly start to the campaign to pick up four straight wins in the second tier, with keeper Sels barely tested.
That was in no small part down to the defensive effort throughout the side, typified by wingers Matt Ritchie and Gouffran doubling up with their full-backs to deny Derby the opportunity to bring their attacking additions into the game.
They were also ruthless enough to take their chances, soaking up Derby's second-half resurgence and then releasing the pressure with a late sucker-punch second goal.
