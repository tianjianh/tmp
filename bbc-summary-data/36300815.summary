The band were due to appear at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in California on Saturday, but pulled out due to Kiedis suffering "complications from the intestinal flu", a band spokesman said.
He said the band had also cancelled their show in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
Kiedis "is expected to make a full recovery soon", the spokesman added.
Following the cancellation on Saturday, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith wrote on Twitter: "No one's more disappointed than us that we couldn't perform tonight.
"Sending love and a speedy recovery to my brother Anthony."
The band, who have sold more than 60 million albums worldwide and won six Grammy Awards, release their first record in five years, The Getaway, in June.
They are due to headline a number of festivals across the summer, including T In The Park in Perthshire, Belfast's Vital and Reading and Leeds.
