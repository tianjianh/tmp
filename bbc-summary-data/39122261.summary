[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inspector Keith Boots 'knew nothing' of drugs stash at home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police inspector responsible for disposing of seized drugs had nothing to do with drugs found in his home, jurors have heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Yorkshire officer Keith Boots, 55, is accused of stealing drugs from police stores to supply others.
Giving evidence at Leeds Crown Court, he said he had no knowledge of a Â£700,000 drugs haul found at his home.
Officers found cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, ecstasy and cannabis during a raid in December 2014.
The search was prompted after a colleague noticed cocaine missing from an evidence store at Trafalgar House police station in Bradford.
When asked by his lawyer, David Mason QC, whether he had "ever stolen any drugs from the police property store at Trafalgar House", Mr Boots replied: "Never."
Mr Boots further denied any knowledge of, or connection to, the stash which was found at his house in Norman Lane, Bradford.
The senior police officer told the jury missing property was a "constant battle", but when he raised it with members of senior management he was reprimanded for contacting them directly.
The court heard he had installed CCTV cameras in the property store at the station.
He told the jury work "kept him sane" while he was waiting for a liver transplant and in constant pain from the symptoms of polycystic liver disease.
Mr Boots, who had been at the force since the 1990s, denies theft, possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply, possessing ammunition, conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
Ashley Boots, 29, of Weatherhouse Terrace, Halifax, denies possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply, possessing ammunition, conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
Ian Mitchell, 27, of no fixed address, denies conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
The trial continues.
