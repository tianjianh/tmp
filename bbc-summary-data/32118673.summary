'Ignored' Family Mosaic tenant hurt in ceiling collapse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tenant who repeatedly complained about a crack in the ceiling has said she was injured when it collapsed on her while she slept.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fareena Ali's family rents a flat in Stamford Hill, north London, from housing provider Family Mosaic.
The family said the crack in Ms Ali's bedroom was reported and inspected in September but it was not repaired.
Ms Ali said she sustained leg injuries when the ceiling fell on her on Sunday. Family Mosaic has apologised.
Ms Ali, 23, works in a tuition centre and lives with her mother Farida and father Tariq, as well as a sister 21, and brother, aged 11.
She said she felt very "frustrated and angry" because the family had reported the problem to Family Mosaic on numerous occasions and also wrote to their MP about it.
"Many times we were told it would be fixed and were given times that the builders would arrive but no-one turned up."
Ms Ali said she had been left with a massive bruise and swelling on her leg which she was told at accident and emergency was caused by internal bleeding and would take months to heal.
"It is painful every time I walk," she said.
In a statement Family Mosaic said it was aware of the repairs needed at the property, following a full survey. It said some of its properties were very old and the work had been classified as routine repairs and not emergency work.
"Even though the ceiling had been made temporarily safe by our contractor, the ceiling has obviously collapsed in the meantime before the work could be completed," it said.
Family Mosaic said it would undertake a full investigation and added: "We would like to apologise to the family affected for any distress caused."
