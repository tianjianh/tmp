The 25-year-old was part of the Great Britain squad which won a silver medal in the rugby sevens at the Olympic Games this month.
Lindsay-Hague scored 10 tries in 61 games for Quins after making his senior debut for the Premiership club in 2009.
"Having returned from the Olympics, I'm going to take some time to think about the next step in my career," he said.
Lindsay-Hague had spent most of this year playing for England on the Sevens World Series in preparation for the Olympics.
Newcastle winger Marcus Watson was also part of the 12-man GB squad which lost 43-7 to Fiji in the final of the inaugural Olympic sevens competition in Rio de Janeiro.
"Ollie has been a dependable and loyal member of the Harlequins squad for many years," Quins director of rugby John Kingston said.
"I have no doubt he will make a huge impact wherever he continues his career."
