Blackburn Rovers 1-1 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers came from behind to earn a crucial draw against fellow Championship strugglers Bristol City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Gallagher's powerful header back across goal ensured Rovers, who remain in the relegation zone, are still two points from safety with three to play.
Tammy Abraham's 22nd goal of the season, an exquisite finish past David Raya, had earlier put City in front.
Abraham, Matty Taylor and Josh Brownhill all wasted chances to make it 2-0 before Rovers rescued a point.
On-loan Chelsea striker Abraham, 19, was arguably most guilty, shooting straight at the goalkeeper when through on goal as the Robins created a host of great opportunities prior to Gallagher's equaliser.
Bristol City remain four points above the relegation zone, with fixtures against Barnsley, Brighton and Birmingham remaining.
They could have all but sealed their Championship survival during a dominant first 70 minutes at Ewood Park, but were unable to hold on for a third successive win.
Blackburn face Wolves, Aston Villa and Brentford in their final three matches of the season.
Blackburn manager Tony Mowbray:
"The frustration was the goal we let in really. We ultimately tried to play offside and it was a really sloppy decision from us.
"And yet the story of the game was the changes we made, the way the team clawed their way back into the game and then, for us, ultimately a penalty decision that wasn't given, that having watched it back looks a clear penalty kick.
"In an ideal world it would have been a day where we didn't play particularly well, but came away with three points. Ultimately we've come away with one. On a day that (Nottingham) Forest lost and Birmingham lost, it's a point we have to put in the bag."
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson:
"I thought it was outstanding, our performance today. My only criticism really is we should have put it to bed. We have to make sure we're more clinical with our chances because we created numerous ones.
"I thought the goal was outstanding, I think it was 31 passes that led to the goal, so my analyst tells me. It shows that we have a bright young side that has to do a job this year and then we can kick on."
