An eight-year-old girl who has had two kidney transplants has taken part in a race to raise funds for the hospital she was treated at in Manchester.

Ella Chadwick, of Whitworth, Rochdale, was born with a rare kidney disease and had 40 operations before she was six.
It was the second time she has taken part in the 1km (0.62 miles) Mini Great Manchester Run but the first time she has crossed the finishing line unaided.
Her mother Karen Hughes said it was "a huge step in her recovery".
Ella - who has congenital nephrotic syndrome - was running for the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.
Ms Hughes said crossing the finishing line without the use of a walking frame was a "fantastic moment and another huge step in her recovery".
Hannah Thomas, from the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital charity, said  she was "thrilled" and "so proud" Ella finished the race without her walker.
"Ella is such an inspirational and cheerful little girl who never fails to put a smile on our faces," she said.
"Ella and her family are long-term fundraisers for our charity and we are very grateful for all of their continued support."
