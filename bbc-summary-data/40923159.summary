The A47, which connects East Anglia to the Midlands, will see three sections of the 115-mile stretch between Great Yarmouth and Peterborough dualled.
Highways England said improvements would also be made to several junctions and roundabouts.
It said the project, to start in March 2020, would "improve users journey times and safety".
Local politicians and users have called for the road, which is a strategic route for the East of England, to be widened at key points.
Philip Davie, of Highways England, said: "We have listened to the publics' views and these have helped shape and inform our approach to our proposed schemes.
"Work now continues, adding detail to the design for each of the dualling and junction improvements, and on planning how we will deliver them in a way that keeps traffic moving," he added.
The first completion date of the six projects is expected from March 2021, the Highways Agency said.
Martin Wilby, chairman of the A47 Alliance, said the work needed to start as soon as possible.
He added: "They will make a massive difference, making journey times more consistent along the A47."
