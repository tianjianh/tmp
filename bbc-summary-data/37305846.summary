Eddie Howe: Bournemouth have to manage Jack Wilshere workload

Jack Wilshere is trying to stay fit by not taking part in full training, Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe says.

The 24-year-old, on loan from Arsenal, played 45 minutes of Saturday's testimonial match against AC Milan.
But Howe admits he has had to manage the workload of the England midfielder, who only played three matches for the Gunners in the 2015-16 campaign after fracturing his leg last August.
"He has not completed all of the training," Howe told BBC Radio Solent.
"We have had to manage his training time on the pitch to make sure we get the balance right between getting him fitter and making sure he does not break down.
"There are certain players who have had serious injuries in their careers that we have to manage. We have to fine-tune the workload that they get."
Bournemouth are seeking their first Premier League win of the season as they host West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, with Wilshere expected to feature.
Howe said the midfielder had brought more to the club than his ability on the pitch.
"He's been really good in the dressing room and I'm really enthused to see him in a Bournemouth shirt," Howe added. "It's been a really good experience so far."
