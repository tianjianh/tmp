Two men have been jailed for fatally stabbing a scrapyard owner in a "callous attack".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Woodhouse, 30, died after being attacked at his yard in Park Lane, Westcliff, Essex, on 2 June.
Bradley Johnson, 48, formerly of Old School Court, Wraysbury, Staines, and Paul Sultana, 46, of Green Lane, Ilford, were both convicted of murder and robbery at Chelmsford Crown Court.
Johnson was jailed for 28 years and Sultana for 25 years.
"The evidence has demonstrated that Johnson and Sultana intended to murder him," said Det Ch Insp Simon Werrett from Essex Police.
"This was not a drugs robbery gone wrong, but a callous attack on a family man, who had everything to look forward to."
During the trial, the court heard Mr Woodhouse had staggered from his scrapyard to his home on nearby Park Road, where he collapsed in front of his pregnant girlfriend.
He was given treatment at the scene but later died in hospital.
In a statement, Mr Woodhouse's family said there was "no justice" for his sons "knowing they will never see their father again".
They added there would be "no justice for his family who had to sit through court watching the CCTV of Steven taking his last steps before collapsing or listening to the 999 calls of Steven uttering his last words."
