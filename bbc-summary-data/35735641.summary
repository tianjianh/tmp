The Crues will face Glenavon in the last four at Windsor Park on 2 April.
Heatley found the net with a looping header over debutant goalkeeper Ryan Morrell and then O'Carroll tapped home from six yards out for the second.
Heatley's cool second-half right-foot finish made it 3-0, then Carrick had Aaron Smyth and Brian McCaul dismissed.
Smyth received a straight red card for fouling Heatley, who was denied a clear goalscoring opportunity to complete his hat-trick.
Midfielder McCaul was shown a second yellow card to compound a disappointing day for the struggling Premiership side.
Heatley opened the scoring after the ball was deflected into his path from Jordan Forsythe's left-foot cross in the 16th minute.
He then turned provider with the low cross from the right, from which O'Carroll extended his side's advantage on 33.
Eight minutes after the break, Heatley slid the ball past Morrell and the ball went in off the post.
Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter: "The last time we met Glenavon in a semi-final, we lost, so we will hope to reverse that this time around.
"They are a fabulous team who defend well and have goal threats all over the park. It will be a great occasion for everyone, played on a beautiful surface."
