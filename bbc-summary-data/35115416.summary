More than 130,000 people have signed a petition calling for the boxer to be removed over comments he made about women and gay people.
Lord Hall told the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee the list was decided by an independent panel.
"He's been put on that list because of his sporting prowess," he said.
"It's now up to the people to judge whether he should become Sports Personality of the Year."
He said newspaper reports claiming the boxer's name had been "imposed by the BBC" were "wrong".
"The decision was made by the entire panel - I'm assured that's the case," he said, adding he had faith in the programme.
"I believe in the process of Sports Personality of the Year. The panel have made their judgement, it is now up for the people to judge and vote as to whether he should be Sports Personality of the Year.
Fury, 27, won the WBA, IBF and WBO titles on 28 November from Wladimir Klitschko, who had reigned as world champion for 11 years.
He came under fire when he was quoted as saying a woman's "best place is on her back" and criticised homosexuality and abortion.
The BBC said Fury's inclusion did not mean Sports Personality of the Year endorsed his personal views.
But a petition was started calling for him to be removed claiming that by including Fury, the BBC "are putting him up as a role model to young people all over the UK and the world".
Lord Hall denied Fury's inclusion in the shortlist gave the boxer power over the BBC.
"He has no power over us whatsoever - we are independent," he said.
"I trust our viewers, listeners and voters to make sense of what is going on and in the end I'm certain their views will hold out."
Lord Hall added he felt the debate over Fury's comments was useful: "The fact that we are having a debate about what is proper or improper behaviour is good actually, there's a lot to learn from that.
"I trust the British public to make their views on this known."
