[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Problems were identified at Drumpellier Lodge, at Bargeddie in North Lanarkshire, by the Care Inspectorate.
Its owners, Clancare Limited, have been ordered to improve staffing levels and the standard of care to residents.
The Care Inspectorate said it would "not hesitate to take further action" if further checks found no progress on the problems identified.
A Care Inspectorate spokesman said: "We have clearly set out the areas which require swift improvement at Drumpellier Lodge so that the care provided to residents reaches a standard that they have a right to expect.
"We will inspect this service again soon to check on progress and to ensure that improvements have been made.
"If we are not satisfied that sufficient progress is being made quickly, we will not hesitate to take further action."
The Care Inspectorate said it had served a formal improvement notice on Drumpellier Lodge.
The notice states that it must demonstrate that it is making "proper provision for the health, welfare and safety of service users".
It calls for "a written personal plan for each resident" which is reviewed "at least every six months".
Residents must have access to "sufficient meaningful activities" and have "access to outdoor space and events".
The care home has also been told to review staffing levels to make sure residents are properly cared for and make sure that the staffing schedule is followed.
The Care Inspectorate previously called for improvements at Drumpellier Lodge after finding failings in 2014.
