[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police believe a wanted man whose remains were found earlier this month in West Lothian was murdered soon after he was last seen in Glasgow in April.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Hamilton's body was found near West Calder on 17 December. He suffered serious injuries before he died.
Police want to speak to anyone who saw the 53-year-old in Great Western Road in Glasgow on Thursday 16 April.
Officers also want to speak to anyone who saw suspicious activity near the West Calder site soon afterwards.
Hamilton's remains were discovered by a dog walker in a remote area of woodland near West Calder.
Police said that inquiries carried out so far indicated that he may have died a short time after he was last seen in Glasgow.
Det Supt Kenny Graham, who is leading the inquiry, said officers wanted to speak to "two specific sets of people".
"Firstly, we are working to establish his movements on 16th April and shortly thereafter," he said.
"He was last sighted in the west end of Glasgow, and I'm keen to hear from anyone who may have seen him or has information about where he went after this.
"The area where his remains were found are fairly remote but can be accessed from the B7015 near to the Five Sisters Business Park.
"I also want to speak to anyone who may have been in this area on, or shortly after, 16th April who may remember seeing any vehicles or persons out of the ordinary."
Det Supt Graham added: "Any information, however insignificant it may seem, may be extremely important to our investigation."
Hamilton, from Glasgow, was previously one of Scotland's most wanted men.
He was released from prison in September 2014 but was sought by police in April for breaching the terms of his licence.
At the time, police described him as "potentially dangerous".
In October, an appeal was made on the BBC's Crimewatch programme and the Crimestoppers charity also offered a reward of Â£2,000 for information leading to his arrest.
Hamilton was nicknamed the Blackhill Butcher, after the Glasgow housing estate from which he operated.
He had been on the police's most-wanted list before he was jailed in 2000 over a string of charges including drug dealing, torture, abduction and sodomy.
Hamilton was sentenced to a minimum of nine years in prison after being found guilty at the High Court in Inverness.
The case was moved 200 miles from Glasgow amid fears that witnesses could be intimidated.
Hamilton had evaded justice on 12 previous occasions when witnesses were too terrified to testify.
