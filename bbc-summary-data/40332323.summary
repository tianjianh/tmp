Kerr, 21, has also been made vice-captain at Dens Park, with central defender Darren O'Dea taking the armband for the next campaign.
Kerr has been a regular starter since returning from a second loan spell at Peterhead in January 2016.
He scored once in 41 appearances for the Dark Blues last season under Paul Hartley then Neil McCann.
O'Dea takes on the captaincy from James McPake, who continues his rehabilitation from a long-term knee injury.
"It's a great honour for me, one of the highlights of my career," said the former Celtic and Blackpool defender, 30.
"My role won't change too much as I've always had responsibility in the team anyway. We already have a couple of leaders in the dressing room and part of my role will be to bring out more leaders while also helping Cammy and the other younger players."
