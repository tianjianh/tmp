Sir Mike Tomlinson, 72, will assume the role, created after a probe into the anonymous "Trojan Horse" letter.
He will work with the city council to oversee improvements in standards, the Department for Education (DfE) said.
The post was created in response to Peter Clarke's report which found evidence of an "aggressive Islamist ethos" in some city schools.
Council chief executive Mark Rogers said the appointment was a "good decision for Birmingham".
Sir Mike, a former government adviser who first entered the education profession in 1965, will assume the role for 12 months.
He said he would make "rapid improvements" in the coming weeks and months.

At 72, Sir Mike Tomlinson remains a very busy man.
He "retired" in 2002 as chief inspector of schools, but since then has led a government review into exam marking; headed the private trust responsible for education in Hackney; and, barely six months ago, was appointed as the chair of a panel to help improve schools in Basildon.
His toughest task yet will be repairing the damage done to the reputation of schools in Birmingham during the so-called Trojan Horse affair.
Although new head teachers and governors are in place, the divisions within the Muslim community remain.
Sir Mike's job will be to enforce government recommendations, but at the same time negotiate a path between those who wish schools to remain secular in outlook, and others who believe a greater emphasis on religion is necessary to reflect the pupils' heritage.
"It is vital that children in Birmingham receive the highest standards of education and I will be working hard towards that goal," he said.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said Sir Mike was a man of "calibre and experience" with a "strong track record" in education.
Sir Mike will report to Ms Morgan and council chief executive Mr Rogers, the DfE said.
The department said his main responsibilities would be ensuring the council "drives immediate improvements" in those schools highlighted in recent reports and improve council structures so that schools were better supported.
Ms Morgan said she was "pleased" with Sir Mike's appointment.
"He is the right person to ensure all children in Birmingham receive the education they deserve, so they can reach their potential and go on to build a better future," she said.
The DfE said Sir Mike's work would also feed into Sir Bob Kerslake's wider review of Birmingham's governance, due to be published in December.
The city's troubled children's services department also asked a commissioner - Lord Norman Warner - to oversee its operations in March.
Mr Rogers said the council was looking forward to working with Sir Mike on addressing criticisms of its governance.
"His experience and reputation give us confidence that we will be constructively supported and challenged in our efforts to move forward at pace from the recent controversies," he said.
