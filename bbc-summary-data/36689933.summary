Joe Riley: Bury defender joins Shrewsbury Town on two-year deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town have made their eighth addition of the summer after signing defender Joe Riley from Bury for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old right-back moves to Shropshire on a two-year deal.
Riley began his career with Bolton Wanderers in 2011 when the Trotters were still in the Premier League.
He went on to have a loan spell at Oxford in the 2014-15 season before joining Bury in January 2015, scoring twice in 57 appearances.
Riley follows defenders Oliver Lancashire and Ryan McGivern, midfielders Gary Deegan and Jim O'Brien and strikers Louis Dodds, AJ Leitch-Smith and Antoni Sarcevic at Greenhous Meadow as boss Micky Mellon looks to improve on last term's 20th place finish in League One.
