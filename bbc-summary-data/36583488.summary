The chief of a village in China which staged a high-profile revolt in 2011 over local corruption has appeared on TV saying he accepted bribes.

Lin Zuluan, the democratically elected leader of Wukan in southern Guangdong province, was arrested on Saturday.
He was seen on Tuesday reading a statement on state television, but some residents say it was forced.
The so-called "rebel village" made headlines in 2011 for an uprising against illegal land grabs.
Since Mr Lin's arrest there have again been protests in the village while hundreds of heavily armed riot police have been deployed.

Mr Lin was arrested days after calling for renewed mass protests over the alleged land seizures which residents say remain unresolved.
In Tuesday's video he is seen dressed scruffily in a checked shirt and sitting in front of two unidentified people in a padded room.
He says he took money in exchange for government contracts, calling it his "biggest criminal activity".
Mr Lin's wife, Yang Zhen, said she believed the confession was forced, according to Reuters news agency.
"This is to deceive people," she said. "He is innocent."
Chinese authorities often release videos on state television of suspects admitting to crimes, in what rights activists say are forced confessions.
Wukan became a symbol of democracy after villagers banded together in 2011 to protest against what they said were corrupt officials selling their land to developers and failing to compensate them properly.
After months of unrest the central government agreed to allow democratic elections in Wukan to end the protests. In 2012 Wukan elected Lin Zuluan, one of the leaders of the protest movement, as the village chief.
