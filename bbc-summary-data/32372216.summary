Tributes have been paid to schoolgirl Rachelle Owen, from West Kirby, Wirral, Merseyside, following the incident at Hoylake station on Friday evening.
British Transport Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious.
Rachelle's mother, Kay Diamond, 44, was found dead in a flat in Toxteth, Liverpool, on 28 February.
A post-mortem examination found Ms Diamond died as a result of "blunt force trauma" to the head.
Anthony Blye, 52, of Greenhey Gardens, Toxteth, has been charged with her murder.
Friends are being asked to light a candle at 20:00 BST in Rachelle's memory.
A family statement said: "Rachelle was a beautiful, vibrant, loved daughter, granddaughter, sister and niece, who attended Hilbre High School Humanities College.
"This is a double tragedy to our family following the recent death and funeral of her mum, Kay Diamond."
Floral bouquets and messages have been laid at the site where the schoolgirl died.
A tribute site on Facebook describes how the tragedy has left behind "many broken hearts".
One person said: "She just wanted to be with her mum."
