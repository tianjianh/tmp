County Championship: Derbyshire's Footitt takes four wickets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A four-wicket haul from England bowling hopeful Mark Footitt gave Derbyshire control against Kent on day two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Footitt (4-61), who has been named in Ashes squads but has not played, reached 60 Championship wickets for 2015 and helped bowl out Kent for just 159, a first-innings lead of 94.
He was aided by Ben Cotton (2-45) and Tony Palladino (2-21) as Rob Key (29) top-scored for Kent.
Billy Godleman's unbeaten 42 helped his side close on 73-1, a lead of 167.
The current situation appeared unlikely at the close on day one, when the hosts slipped from 178-2 to 253 all out.
But, even without Shiv Thakor, who was suffering from a concussion picked up while batting, Derbyshire look set for their fourth Division Two victory of the season.
