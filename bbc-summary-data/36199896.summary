Leicester City: Andy King on his rise from Champions League mascot to player

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy King is looking forward to playing in the Champions League with Leicester more than a decade after being a mascot in Europe's elite competition.

The Foxes clinched the Premier League title after Chelsea held Tottenham.
Wales international King and his side will go straight into the Champions League group stage.
"I'll be familiar with the music, I've walked out to that a few times," said King, who used to carry the flag when he was a youth player at Chelsea.
"I must have been between nine and 14 years old and you used to have to go around the side of the pitch, shake the flag and then quickly get it off before the kick-off.
"Hopefully I'll be on the pitch a bit longer this time. It will be nice."
King's part in Leicester's unlikely triumph has already earned him his own place in football history.
He is the first player in the Premier League era to win titles in the top three divisions - a fact he says gives him a different perspective to some other players.
"Having seen it in the lower divisions and not going so well, it probably does mean a little bit more to me," he said.
"But that's not taking anything away from anyone else who's here because everyone else in this squad has given nothing less than 100% and that's ultimately why we've ended up winning the league."
Leicester started the campaign as 5,000-1 outsiders for the title after almost being relegated last season.
But they have lost just three league games in what has been described as the "most unlikely triumph in the history of team sport," and one which manager Claudio Ranieri doubts could be repeated.
The rise of players such as striker Jamie Vardy - a non-league footballer four years ago - has added to the romance of Leicester's rise.
"That's a story people like," said King, who made his Leicester debut as an 18-year-old in 2007.
"Not just me but with Vards coming from non-league as well.
"Other players getting released by so-called bigger clubs and everyone coming together and working their way up."
Leicester can now look forward to Champions League football for the first time in the club's history next season.
