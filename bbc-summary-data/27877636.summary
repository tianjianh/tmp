Campaigners call for equal access to cancer drugs in Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The charity, Cancer Focus, is calling on the public to get behind a campaign to secure equal access to drugs for patients in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are currently 38 cancer drugs available to patients elsewhere in the UK that are not readily available to critically ill people in Northern Ireland.
This is despite the fact that research and clinical trials for some of the drugs have been carried out at Queen's University, Belfast.
Una Crudden, who has ovarian cancer, said getting treatment should not be a postcode lottery.
"There is no point in having a top research centre if the use of it is not going out to the people in Northern Ireland," she said.
