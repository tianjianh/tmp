Britt Assombalonga put the hosts ahead by coolly rounding Alex Smithies after midfielder Karl Henry had been sent off for two early bookings.
Hildeberto Pereira's third red card of the season - also after two yellows - gave Rangers fresh hope.
And with time running out, Sylla stole in to head home a left-wing cross from fellow replacement Nasser El Khayati.
Forest showed the greater attacking intent in the early stages and Assombalonga had the ball in the net, only to be ruled offside.
But the recalled striker found the net from a tight angle just four minutes later following a through ball from Pajtim Kasami.
Forest were made to pay for not pressing home their advantage early in the second half as Pereira pulled back his man to receive his second caution.
His departure was the spark for Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's men to push forward as Olamide Shodipo fired over and Grant Hall headed just wide before Sylla's late effort denied Forest only a second victory in 11 attempts - and a first clean sheet in 14 games.
QPR have still never won at the City Ground in 33 attempts.
There are now only three longer unbeaten home runs in all competitions in English football history than Forest's in this fixture - Liverpool v West Ham (44), Liverpool v Spurs (43) and Liverpool v Stoke (36).
Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier: "I'm frustrated and a little angry. I like my players and I always defend them, but when we lead 1-0 and it's 11 against 10 you have to make sure you don't give your opponents a chance.
"We didn't control the game very well in that situation, making a lot of technical mistakes and  conceding a lot of free-kicks and corners.
"This is the first time I've been angry since I've been here and hopefully it's the last time. We had to continue like we were playing in the first half and we didn't do that in the second.
"I think we've given a point to Queens Park Rangers, and it's a game we should have won. We just had to keep the ball and find a solution to score the second goal and close out the game."
QPR boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink:  "Because of the manner we played, we deserved to get a goal. That is why I was celebrating. That was my emotion at the time.
"We have some young players we are trying to develop. We have foreign players we are trying to bed into the team They will get better. All these things take time.
"It was a harsh sending off, because the first booking was not a yellow card.
"I do not want to talk too much about the referee, I do not want to concentrate on that."
