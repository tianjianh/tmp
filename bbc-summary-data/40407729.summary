Where does Tory-DUP deal leave power-sharing talks?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland will receive an extra £1bn over the next two years as part of the deal that will see the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs back Theresa May's minority government in Commons votes.

DUP leader Arlene Foster said the "wide-ranging" pact was "good for Northern Ireland and the UK" -  but where does it leave talks to restore power-sharing in Belfast?
Arlene Foster made a point of finishing her comments outside Number 10 by announcing she was returning immediately to Stormont to try to re-establish the power sharing executive.
Theresa May's deputy, Damian Green, also defended the financial largesse as an attempt to help Stormont politicians to overcome their differences.
After her Westminster election success, the DUP leader is going nowhere.
Her party argues that Sinn Féin should abandon its red line of refusing to share power with Mrs Foster until an inquiry into the controversial RHI heating scheme is over.
According to this logic, republicans should not look Theresa May's gift horse in the mouth, but concentrate on resuming their ministerial duties and help to hand out the extra cash.
Gerry Adams's initial response treats the DUP-Conservative deal like a "curate's egg" - that is "good in parts".
The Sinn Féin president acknowledged that the extra cash would "help to ease the enormous pressure" on Northern Ireland's public services.

But he added that "the devil is in the detail" - and attacked the agreement as providing a "blank cheque for a Tory Brexit".
With the deadline for the Stormont talks on Thursday, there is not much time for the politicians to ponder their options.
Sinn Fein will want to make more progress on their other objectives, like greater legal recognition for the Irish language.
It is uncertain whether republicans will erase their red line, but the DUP-Tory deal has given them something to think about.
