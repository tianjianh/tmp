Woking 1-1 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York dropped into the National League relegation zone with just one game to go despite Jon Parkin's goal helping them secure a point at Woking, who just need a draw in their final match to guarantee safety.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Woking nearly took a second-minute lead when they sprang the offside trap but Scott Loach dashed out of goal to save from Gozie Ogwu, whose second effort was cleared off the line by Hamza Bencherif at the expense of a corner.
York had survived two penalty appeals when the referee finally awarded one midway through the second half, Sean Newton penalised for tugging the shirt of Delano Sam-Yorke. Ugwu side-footed the spot-kick down the middle, with Loach diving left.
The Minstermen equalised with a quarter of an hour left when a long throw from the halfway line by substitute Sam Muggleton saw Parkin compete for a high ball which fell to his feet and he fired home from 10 yards.
Vadaine Oliver nearly snatched a win for the visitors a minute from time but his low shot was saved at the near post by Michael Poke.
