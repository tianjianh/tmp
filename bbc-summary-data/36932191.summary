The attack on a 32-year-old woman took place at about 01:30 on St Valentine's Day, 14 February, in the St Vincent Bar on St Vincent Street.

The man being sought by police is white, aged between 20 and 24, 5'7" in height, of slim build and with brown hair.

Det Con Vikki Reid said: "No-one should be subjected to a vicious attack when merely out enjoying themselves within a city centre establishment.
"I urge anyone who has information or anyone who recognises the man in the image to contact officers of Greater Glasgow CID based at City Centre Police Office via telephone 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers."
