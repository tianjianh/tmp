Ugen, 24, equalled the indoor British record of 6.93m to finish third in the long jump, but world outdoor silver medallist Shara Proctor was eighth.
Porter was third in the 60m hurdles but James Dasaolu was disqualified after a false start in his 60m semi-final.
American Trayvon Bromell beat fastest qualifier Asafa Powell to win gold.
Jamaica's Powell ran 6.44 seconds in his heat and semi-final -  the quickest in the world this year and fifth fastest ever - but his quest for a first individual global title goes on after he clocked 6.50secs in the final, three-hundredths behind Bromell.

"I had it in me. I just didn't come out in the finals," said the 33-year-old.
His mood was matched by Londoner Dasaolu, who won the British Indoor 60m title last month, clocking 6.53secs in the final. "Words can't describe how disappointed I am. It's extremely frustrating," he said.
Ugen, however, was "ecstatic" as she held on to third place by four centimetres.
The Texas-based jumper, who finished fifth at the World Championships in Beijing last summer, said: "This is my first time getting on a podium, so it was fantastic to finally get some silverware."

In contrast, Proctor described her performance, which featured a best leap of 6.57m, as "horrible" and blamed a hamstring problem which surfaced in the first round of jumping.
Porter's bronze was her third World Indoors medal after second and third-placed finishes in the previous two editions.
She said: "I was listening to the long jump and I'm just so happy to follow Lorraine with a bronze."
Morgan Lake, 18, finished seventh in the pentathlon with 4,499 points as Canadian Brianne Theisen-Eaton, snatched gold in the final of the five events.
Theisen-Eaton trailed Anastasiya Mokhnyuk of Ukraine by 150 points going into the 800m but beat her rival by more than 13 seconds to win by 34 points on 4,881.
