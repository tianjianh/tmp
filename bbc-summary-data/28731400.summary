The 63-year-old was airlifted to Glasgow's Southern General after the aircraft came down near the airstrip at Kingarth at about 15:45 on Saturday. He died on Sunday morning.
The other person on board, a 52-year-old man, was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital and remains in a critical condition.
The cause of the crash is being probed.
It is believed the plane came down about 1km from the airstrip, in the south of the island.
Police Scotland said it was working closely with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. It has asked for any video or mobile phone footage which may help with the inquiry.
The 63-year-old's relatives have been informed of his death and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.
