Uber: US-based taxi company launches operations in Belfast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Uber taxi service has begun operating in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been granted a taxi operator licence by the Department of the Environment (DOE).
Part of the licence requirement means Uber drivers must have roof signs, something the firm has generally not been required to do in other cities.
The company already operates in more than 300 cities worldwide, including Dublin and London.
Drivers for the firm will have to hold the same taxi licence as drivers at conventional taxi companies.
Uber customers use an app that pinpoints their location and alerts drivers to a pick-up request.
Customers have to register credit or debit details with Uber and payment is taken automatically.
Kieran Harte, Uber's general manager in Belfast, said: "Over 10,000 people in Belfast have already downloaded and opened the Uber app in the last six months alone, so we know there is demand for the service in the city."
Uber has proven controversial in several locations and has often been accused of riding roughshod over local rules and regulations when it enters new markets.
The company said it "will comply with all necessary regulation."
