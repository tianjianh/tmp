When asked to design a community project to promote the restoration of the Ashton Gatehouse, Vicky Harrison was puzzled not to find it on a map.
Together with a team of volunteers aged 15 to 70 she set about changing that.
The embroidered map, that took 600 hours to complete, will be on display at the gatehouse from Wednesday.
The original entrance to the Ashton Court Estate is being renovated with the help of a Â£550,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Artist Ms Harrison said: "After searching for it online, I quickly realised that it was not on Google maps and so the idea to put it back on the map was born.
"The map takes in the local sights of Long Ashton, Bower Ashton, Ashton Vale, Southville and Bedminster.
"There will be a nod to the key roads but scattered all over it are landmarks and points of interest such as peregrine falcons in the gorge, deer in the park and hot air balloons floating above Ashton Court."
Hundreds of stitches were used, including cretan stitch, woven wheel stitch, zigzag chain stitch and Roumanian couching.
