Nicola Cross murder inquiry: Marcin Porczynski trial date set for 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of a man accused of murdering a woman at her Hertfordshire home and kidnapping her children is due to take place next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Nicola Cross, 37, was found at her home in Dunlin Road, Hemel Hempstead, on Monday night.
Marcin Porczynski, 23, of Claymore Avenue in the town, appeared via video link at Luton Crown Court. He was remanded in custody.
A plea hearing is set for 4 December, with a trial date set for March.
The court heard the mother-of-two was killed in front of her six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter while her husband Dan was out.
Prosecutors allege the defendant then kidnapped the children but was arrested by police who heard a disturbance while responding to a separate call at a neighbouring home.
Mr Porczynski is charged with murder, two counts of kidnap and one of trespass with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
The next court appearance is due to take place at St Albans Crown Court.
Ms Cross's family issued a tribute to her via Hertfordshire Police earlier this week.
A 19-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle after Mrs Cross's body was found has been released without charge, police said.
Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent said he played "no part in the tragic events... and no further action will be taken".
