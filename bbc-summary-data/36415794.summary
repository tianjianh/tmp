Kompany, who has 70 caps, has been ruled out of the tournament with a thigh injury but will provide expert analysis from the Paris studio.
The 30-year-old joins a BBC studio line-up led by Gary Lineker that also includes Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, Thierry Henry and Gianluca Vialli.
"I am disappointed not to be in France with the Belgium team," Kompany said.
"But to be there with the BBC will be the next best thing.
"There is a huge amount of anticipation for the tournament and I'm really looking forward to working alongside Gary and the team."
The BBC team will also feature Martin Keown, Jermaine Jenas, Danny Murphy, Robbie Savage, John Hartson, Dean Saunders, Chris Brunt, Neil Lennon, Gerry Armstrong, Mark Lawrenson, Kevin Kilbane and Jens Lehmann.
Kompany will be in the BBC studio on 12 June to see world champions Germany start their campaign against Ukraine and 14 June when Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal face Austria.
Belgium are in Group E alongside Italy, Republic of Ireland and Sweden.
