The results of the National Student Survey (NSS) were released on Tuesday.
It showed that  93% of respondents in Northern Ireland declare themselves to be "satisfied with the quality of their course".
John D'Arcy, director of The Open University in Northern Ireland, said they were thrilled.
"As experts in the delivery of flexible, part-time higher education we are proud to be able to offer quality courses, support and access to education to people in Northern Ireland," he said.
"It's our mission to continue to provide students here with the best study opportunities and experience possible.
"I'd like to pay tribute to our staff across the Open University who have helped achieve this endorsement from our students."
The Open University (OU) is the largest academic institution in the UK.
Since it began in 1969, the OU has taught almost 1.9m students.
In 2013, The Open University officially became one of three universities in Northern Ireland, as it is now funded by the Northern Ireland Executive through the Department for Employment and Learning.
In Northern Ireland, there are more than 4,000 part-time students.
The National Student Survey (NSS) is led by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, but funded by the four UK HE funding bodies, along with the National College of Teaching & Leadership and Health Education England.
