The 24-year-old victim was attacked on Mark Lane, off New Briggate, in Leeds city centre, shortly after 05:00 BST on 14 August, West Yorkshire Police said.
A police spokesman said the footage "clearly makes for disturbing viewing".
The suspect is described as a tall black man, aged between 30 and 40, with a shaved head, a long black overcoat and black trousers.
The woman was walking to get a taxi home after a night out when she was approached by the man in Kirkgate, officers said.
"He spoke to her and walked alongside her along Briggate before they reached Dortmund Square where he picked her up in his arms and carried her to the scene of the attack a short distance away," the force said.
Detectives said the "shocking" CCTV footage showed the man "loitering in a car park at the rear of the Malmaison hotel in Swinegate at about 04:40" and also walking along Briggate.
Det Supt Pat Twiggs said they released the video after receiving permission from the victim, who had been left "traumatised".
"I think the CCTV gives a really stark illustration of the very serious nature of this offence and we hope it will focus the public's minds on helping us to identify and trace the man responsible."
He believes the man may have been "looking for someone to attack before he focuses on the victim".
He was seen approaching another woman who was wearing a skirt in Swinegate at about 04:45 BST and police have appealed for her to come forward.
Det Supt Twiggs said: "I am appealing for that woman to contact us. A man can be seen walking in the opposite direction shortly before and a taxi can be seen parked nearby.
"We would also like to trace those people as potential witnesses."
He said the smartly-dressed man may have been a doorman and police were talking to bars and clubs. However, he added there could be other reasons for why he was dressed in that way.
The officer added :"He may have been staying at a hotel in the city centre and we would like to hear from anyone who has information about that."
