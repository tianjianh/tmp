Hegeler, 28, joins from Hertha Berlin after making 51 appearances for the Bundesliga side since 2014.
The German has also played in the Champions League for Bayer Leverkusen.
Djuric, 26, who has scored seven goals in 14 international appearances, signs from Italian club Cesena and has the option of a further year on his deal.
"Jens has a fantastic pedigree and boasts more than 150 Bundesliga appearances," said Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson.
"Milan is someone we've been monitoring for the past nine months and has always been in our thoughts. He can play up front on his own or alongside another striker.
"The fact he is a current Bosnian international shows the calibre of player we're getting, for whom he has scored one in every two games he's played."
