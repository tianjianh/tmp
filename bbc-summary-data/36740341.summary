The brother of a footballer who lost his legs after a hit-and-run crash says it is "very hard" to accept he was "left on the side of the road to die".

Shaun Whiter, 27, was struck by what police believe was a Ford Focus while helping his friend change a flat tyre in Newmarket last Friday.
Luke Whiter said his brother has spoken a "couple of times" about the driver.
"He doesn't quite understand how someone could leave him in that position," he said.
Police believe the car that hit the Newmarket Town player and his friend Joey Abbs, who was left with a "serious" leg injury, is about 10 years old.
"We just want a bit of closure for him," Luke Whiter said. "We'd just like whoever this person is to gain a bit of courage and hand themselves in.
"He's my brother and he has been left on the side of the road to die - it's very hard to take in."
Shaun Whiter works as an estate agent in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex.
His mother, Pauline, has thanked staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for the "truly amazing" care they have been providing her son.
She has also appealed for the driver of the car to come forward.
"We hope they're a good human being and now they know what's happened, they will come forward, or someone they shared a confidence with will," she said.
"This is a secret that shouldn't be kept."
