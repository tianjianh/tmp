[SN]TITLE[SN]
Regeneration powers transfer to Northern Ireland councils halted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to transfer regeneration powers from Stormont to local councils have been put on hold indefinitely.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sources in local government have said they are very disappointed by the move.
Earlier this year, there was a huge change in local government. The old 26 local authorities were replaced by 11 so-called super-councils.
The councils got some new powers, including planning and economic development.
They were also supposed to get responsibility for regeneration schemes in April next year.
But now Social Development Minister Mervyn Storey has said that is not going to happen.
Mr Storey said a number of fundamental policy issues have been raised, which have made the timetable for legislation extremely challenging.
His department is to be absorbed into a new communities department next year.
Mr Storey said after that, the executive will be in a better position to decide if and when the powers should be given to councils.
Declan Boyle, chairman of Belfast City Council's strategic policy and resources committee, said: "We will be seeking an urgent meeting with the minister to ensure that this is not shelved indefinitely, that this decision is urgently reviewed and that a decision to transfer these powers on an agreed date is confirmed.
"We wish to express our disappointment and frustration and seek assurances from the minister in relation to our major investment, development and regeneration plans for Belfast.
