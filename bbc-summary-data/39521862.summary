Sloan clocked 1:47.41 to take 0.53 off Harrison's mark as he moved into the top 10 in this year's world rankings.
The Bangor man, 23, set the time in the morning heats before winning the evening final in 1:47.77.
That left him ahead of Bangor team-mate Jack Millan [1:51.03].
Sloan's time puts him in line to compete at both the World Championships in Budapest and the World University Games in Taiwan.
Sloan and Millan were also part of the Bangor relay team which took almost five seconds off the Irish 400m freestyle club record.
The Bangor quartet downed UCD's 2016 record of 3:28.07 to set a new time of 3:23.38.
Conor Ferguson retained his Irish 100m backstroke title in 54.61 seconds.
His time was well under the European and World Junior Championships consideration times.
Larne star Danielle Hill won the women's event in 1:02.32 touching ahead of Stirling's Natasha Hofton [1:02.68].
Lisburn's Daniel Wiffen swam under the European Youth Olympics consideration time to take gold in the 1500m freestyle in 16:12.99 while his team-mate Rachel Bethel won 800m freestyle gold in 9:00.19.
Bethel then returned to win the Irish national title in the women's 200m Freestyle, in 2:03.37, finishing behind Paralympic Great Britain gold medallist Bethany Firth from Newtownards.
Sligo woman Mona McSharry broke Sycerika McMahon's Irish junior 50m breaststroke record set in 2011 by 0.15 as she took the title in 31.34.
