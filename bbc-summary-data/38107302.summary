The 23-year-old joined the Nethermoor Park side on a three-month loan deal in September and has made 12 appearances for the National League strugglers.
The Lions are bottom of the table, four points adrift of safety.
"We've been really impressed with Jon while he's been with us so we were keen to get him under permanent contract," football secretary Adie Towers said.
