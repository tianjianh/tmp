Duffy is the only nominee from outside the Premiership, having led the Ton to the play-offs and the League Cup semis.
Rodgers is targeting the domestic treble in his first season in Scotland.
McInnes's Dons have reached two cup finals and are second in the league, while Thistle achieved a top-six spot.
Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths praised Rodgers for his "exceptional" man-management skills, adding: "he's different to what I've had before.
"He's very straight down the line. He tells you why you're not playing. His attention to detail in everything we do [was evident] from the first day he came in.
"We have progressed as a team and grown in stature and we're showing everyone what we're all about now. The only way we're going to go is forward."
Griffiths added: "If I had to choose one of the other three, I'd go for Alan Archibald.
"His Thistle team came here a few weeks ago and played really well to get a point. With the chances they had, they could maybe have won the game.
"With the budget they have and the way they are playing, they deserve to be in the top six."
The winner will be announced at PFA Scotland's annual awards dinner in Glasgow on Sunday.
