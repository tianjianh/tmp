Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service warned flood water can pose a "serious threat" to people, as well as causing serious damage to cars.
Firefighters had to attend 14 flooding incidents and four rescues last week.
Meanwhile, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said a band of heavy rain could bring further flooding to parts of Wales on Monday night.
Chris Margett, the fire service's corporate head of protection and prevention, said: "In the event where there is no road closure sign, don't drive through deep water.
"If you are unsure of the water depth just don't do it, you are putting yourself and others at unnecessary risk.
"Flood water can be deceptively powerful - it can literally rip up the road surface and dislodge manhole covers and kerbstones - and its depth and flow rate can quickly change with the weather."
NRW issued nine flood warnings and 22 alerts on the weekend, with two flood warnings remaining in place for the Lower Dee Valley from Llangollen to Wrexham and Tenby, Pembrokeshire.
Resident Maria Eales, from Llechryd, Ceredigion, has described how she became marooned in her home after the River Teifi burst its banks on Sunday.
Ms Eales only moved to the area in July and said this is their "first experience of this kind of weather".
"We can't get through to Cardigan and the rain continues. Fortunately all our Christmas food is in the freezer. We're pretty self sufficient so we'll be okay," she said.
NRW has warned people to prepare for possible flooding, with more warnings expected to be issued on Monday.
The highest rainfall is likely on high ground in the Cambrian Mountains, Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons.
A spokesman said drains may struggle to cope with the volume of water and roads could be closed, while swollen rivers could also cause disruption in the south Wales valleys.
