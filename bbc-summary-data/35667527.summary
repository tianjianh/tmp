Children's pole dancing classes defended as 'not sexual'

Pole dancing classes for children have been defended by a sports governing body following claims that it sexualises youngsters.

The Pole Intentions classes in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire were criticised after three girls did a demonstration on ITV's This Morning.
But instructor Zoe Hardy said they were about sport, and not sexual.
The International Pole Sports Federation has said classes like this help train future athletes.
"Children are our future pole sports athletes and just like any sport we need to train our athletes from a young age," a spokesperson said.
The federation has included children in the World Pole Sports Championships for the last three years, and has its own Youth Pole Sports Coaching course.
"In order for us to be a recognised sport we have to have the same as other sports, so having children included is what any sport would have and we are no different," said the spokesperson.
Similarly, Pole Sports UK said the participation of children should be "celebrated", not criticised.
"We are actively trying to encourage people outside of the industry to see past the immediate connotations surrounding the term 'pole dancing' to recognise that pole sports is so much more," it said in a statement.
Psychologist Kerry Nixon is among people to have criticised the classes.
"Pole dancing is inextricably linked to sexuality," she said.
"The whole notion of pole dancing historically goes hand in hand with a sexual aspect of dance so therefore it is linked and we can't get away from that."
But Miss Hardy said if adults perceive the activity as being a sexual thing it is "in their own head".
"Now we are moving on and away from the strip clubs to a different kind of pole performance, which is a sport," she said.
Lorraine Handbury, whose 11-year-old daughter goes to the Nottinghamshire classes, said there is no "provocative dancing" involved.
"She used to compete in gymnastics so to me it's no different to that, it's just the bar is a different way," she said.
"They have to wear shorts because you have to be able to hold on with your skin."
