[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mid and West Wales Fire Service used Fairview, near Llandrindod Wells to carry out exercises and try out their breathing equipment.
Work is due to start on the £1.1m renovation to turn the Victorian property into 13 flats this month.
Phil Morris, of the fire service, said its use had been "extremely beneficial".
Powys council, which owns the property, said it was good that firefighters had been able to use it for training while it was empty.
