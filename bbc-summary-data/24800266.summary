Rebels belonging to the Garo National Liberation Army opened fire on migrant workers who were playing cards late on Sunday in Goalpara district.
Nine workers were also injured in the attack, police said.
Assam has been plagued by ethnic clashes and separatist violence in recent years.
Goalpara has witnessed violence between the Rabha and Garo tribes.
Reports say that Sunday night's violence happened after Garo militants from neighbouring Meghalaya state fired at a group of Hindi-speaking migrant workers who were playing cards and gambling to celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights.
"These militants in army dress came and fired indiscriminately... after the attack, they retreated to Meghalaya," AP Raut, a senior Assam police official, told the NDTV news channel.
Correspondents say many tribespeople resent the presence of outsiders, who they believe are taking their jobs and marrying local women.
