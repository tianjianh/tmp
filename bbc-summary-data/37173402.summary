[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 ducks have been stolen from a farm in Aberdeenshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said 230 of the birds - worth more than Â£1,000 - were taken from a shed near Laurencekirk.
The theft is thought to have happened in the early hours of Friday.
Investigating officer PC Marc Camus, of Police Scotland, said: "Due to the number of ducks taken it is believed that a vehicle similar in size to a pick-up truck or a transit van would have been sufficient."
He added: "The breeds of ducks taken are not common and are difficult to source. The ducks may therefore be offered for sale to other poultry farmers.
"If anyone has any information about this incident they are asked to call Police Scotland on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
