His professional career started at Cardiff City in 1957 and ended in 1974 after spells with Northampton Town, Charlton Athletic and Doncaster Rovers.
He made 21 senior international appearances for Wales, scoring a late headed equaliser on his debut in a 1-1 draw against England in October 1959.
Moore was voted BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year in 1959.

He later played 13 games in Northampton's only top-flight league season in 1965-66.
