Renwick, 28, has represented Scotland and Great Britain at every major event.
"I'm incredibly proud and privileged to have raced for my country and for the career I have been afforded through sport," he said.
"Swimming will always be close to my heart and this is merely just a new chapter starting."
Renwick competed at the Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics and was a member of Team Scotland for three Commonwealth Games.
He won silver at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in the 4x200m freestyle, and repeated that achievement at the next two Commonwealth Games, also winning individual gold in the 200m freestyle in Delhi.
The Scot also achieved gold at the 2015 World Championships in Kazan as part of the men's 4x200m freestyle relay.
"This is one of my favourite memories as it marked a return to form despite part of me believing I was past my best," Renwick said.
"It is difficult to do justice to that feeling; it was like standing on top of the world."
Renwick bows out of the sport after winning Olympic silver in the 4x200m freestyle relay in August, collecting a medal after swimming in the semi-final.
"To start with, it was a bittersweet moment for me," he said. "I was initially devastated not to perform well enough to be part of the final, but I've had time to reflect and I'm incredibly proud of my contribution.
"I've been lucky enough to share the pool with many talented swimmers over the years, but to be part of Team GB at our most successful Games ever is priceless and a perfect way to close such an incredible chapter in my life.
"Despite moving on from competitive swimming I will stay involved and I am looking forward to focusing my efforts on the development and business side of the sport.
Scottish Swimming's Performance Director, Ally Whike, paid tribute to Renwick.
"There are not many athletes that complete the 'grand slam' of medals across the major international championships and winning a silver medal in Rio was a fitting end to a distinguished career.
"Robbie's dedication and commitment has rewarded him with a long and productive career and I'm sure he will use these qualities in the next chapter of his life."
