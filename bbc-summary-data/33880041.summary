Croick Decanter used to feed babies gifted to museum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wine decanter taken from a church during the Highland Clearances and used by evicted families to feed milk to babies has been gifted to a museum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tenants cleared from Glancalvie Estate set up a camp in Croick Churchyard, near Ardgay, 170 years ago.
Some who camped scratched their names into the glass of the church windows. The names are still visible today.
A descendant of one of the infants fed from the decanter has handed it into the care of Inverness Museum.
Donald MacMillan's grandmother Christina Ross was the daughter of John Ross, a shepherd who with his family and others was cleared from the estate.
They set up a temporary camp at Croick Church in Sutherland in May 1845. The families later left to settle in other parts of the Highlands.
With help from High Life Highland, which runs Inverness Museum, Mr MacMillan researched his family's history and was able to add new details to what he already knew about his grandmother.
She and various members of her family went on to settle in and around Kilmorack, near Beauly, and Achnagart in Glen Shiel.
Those who worked with Mr MacMillan in the research were Anne Fraser, family historian at the Highland Archive Centre, and Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum.
Jim Hunter, emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an author of books on the clearances, also assisted in researching the significance of the Croick Decanter.
To mark the relic's donation an event will be held at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery on 27 August.
Prof Hunter will deliver a talk called Indelible Characters: Relics and remnants of Highland Clearance times.
Starting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer.
Landowners were seeking to "improve" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming.
In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished.
The clearances have influenced the stories of two new films.
Slow West, a Western starring Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee and written and directed by Scotsman John Maclean, opened in UK cinemas in June.
Its plot features a clearance based on forced evictions in Wester Ross.
The second film, a new short, will tell the story of Kate McPherson, who was among 80 people cleared off land in Sutherland and emigrated to Canada where they were settled in the Red River colony.
Once in Canada, they had to walk 100 mile (161km) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes.
Sutherland-born composer Robert Aitken is in the process of making the short film, Last Footsteps of Home.
It will be free of dialogue.
