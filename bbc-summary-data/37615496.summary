As the South Korean company scrambles to contain the crisis, we look back at the developments so far:
2 August: Samsung unveils its latest flagship model Galaxy Note 7 amid great fanfare in New York. The phone is packed with new features like an iris scanner.
The initial response is good and expectations high. It's seen as Samsung's big rival to the upcoming iPhone 7.
19 August: Sales start in 10 markets, including South Korea and the United States. European markets are scheduled for October.
