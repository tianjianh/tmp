Newport County will become the latest club to show support for the Welsh steel industry at Tuesday's home game.

The club said threat of closure at Tata Steel would have a significant impact on workers, their families and south Wales.
Steelworkers will be welcomed on to the pitch to unveil a Save our Steel banner, to be placed on the north terrace during the Oxford United game.
The Ospreys and Swansea City have already shown their support.
Indian owner Tata Steel is selling its entire loss-making UK business. Port Talbot is its biggest UK plant with about 4,000 workers and it also has a site at Llanwern in Newport.
Newport County director Gavin Foxall said: "Given the club's origins there is a long history between the club and the local steel industry.
"We hope that leading the team out onto the pitch will help raise the profile of their plight and we know everyone in attendance at Rodney Parade on Tuesday night will show their support."
Mark Turner, a steelworker and Newport County fan said: "Newport is a city built on its industrial heritage with steel for many years being, and continuing to be, a major part."
