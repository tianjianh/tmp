David Lees was hit by a car driving between 60 and 70mph following a disturbance in Manchester on 28 October 2006, police said.
The 23-year-old was standing in Middleton Road, Prestwich, when he was thrown nearly 30 feet (9m).
The arrested men, aged 30 and 34, are the first to be held on suspicion of his murder after new details emerged.
They have been bailed until 26 April.
In August 2007, a man was jailed for two-and-a-half years after admitting perverting the course of justice in relation to fabricating the sale of the car used in the incident.
Det Ch Insp Jamie Daniels said "it's time that the wall of silence around those responsible was broken".
Mr Lees and his friends became involved in a disturbance in Prestwich.
A man wearing a hooded top was seen getting into a car, which was driven directly at Mr Lees who was standing in Middleton Road.
He died after suffering massive head injuries, police said.
The car was then driven to the gates of nearby Heaton Park where the driver met with friends in other cars before heading off.
A reward of Â£50,000 was offered to anyone who could provide information leading to the conviction of those responsible and still remains in place, Det Ch Insp Daniels said.
Mr Lees' mother, Ann said: "The fact that his murderer has been free to live their life, having so cruelly stolen my son's life, has only added to the mental burden I have carried ever since."
