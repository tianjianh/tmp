[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A series of adverts which promote Skegness by showing unflattering images of rival resorts have been described as "embarrassing" by the town's mayor.

The campaign, which started last month, features photographs of graffiti close to Blackpool Tower and Brighton beach.
Mark Anderson said he was ashamed of the adverts, and felt East Lindsey District Council should have consulted him before launching them.
The district council said the campaign had helped to raise Skegness's profile.
Mr Anderson said that the adverts reflected badly on the resort.
He said: "I believe East Lindsey has over-stretched itself in its conduct. The way they feel they can control my town and its townspeople brings itself into question."
The adverts also drew criticism from Stay Blackpool which described it as a "dirty tricks" campaign.
East Lindsey District Council said the adverts were "a bit of friendly rivalry" and estimated they had created media exposure worth more than Â£300,000 to the resort.
