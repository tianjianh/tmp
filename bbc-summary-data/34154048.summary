Christopher Goodman, who worked for Surrey Police at the time of his arrest in 2013, admitted eight counts of making a total of 92 indecent images of children, at a hearing last month.
Goodman, 43, from Guildford, was given a nine-month jail term, suspended for two years, at Lewes Crown Court.
He was sacked by Surrey Police in 2014.
Goodman, of Frobisher Gardens, was an inspector in Reigate when he was arrested following a Sussex Police investigation.
The force said the indecent material included 72 category C images, which is the least serious level, 16 category B, and four category A images, which is the most serious level.
Goodman was given a two-year supervision order and a sexual harm prevention order to last until further notice, severely restricting his access to computer and related communications equipment.
He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for 10 years.
Sussex Police said its Paedophile Online Investigation Team carried out the inquiry at the request of Surrey Police.
A spokesman said there was no evidence of contact offending either online or in person, and the images were not believed to be of local children.
In a statement, Surrey Police said the vast majority of its officers and staff were professional and hard-working and the public rightly trusted them to act with integrity and uphold the ethics code.
"As soon as the allegations against Christopher Goodman came to light he was arrested and suspended from duty and Surrey Police immediately requested that an investigation be carried out," it said.
A lengthy and complex case ended in Goodman's convictions, the statement added.
Goodman subsequently went through the Surrey Police disciplinary procedure and was dismissed from the force in August 2014.
