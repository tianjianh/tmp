[SN]TITLE[SN]
HMP Peterborough drug support nurse suspended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse supporting inmates with addiction issues took drugs from the jail for personal use, it has emerged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Catherine Gronkowski was dismissed from the 840-capacity HMP Peterborough in September 2013.
She had been taken on six months earlier as part of the prison's recovery team to help prisoners with alcohol and drug issues.
Miss Gronkowski, who admitted stealing diazepam, has been suspended by The Nursing and Midwifery Council.
Miss Gronkowski will be struck off if no appeal against the order is lodged within 28 days.
A conduct panel heard Miss Gronkowski, who did not attend the hearing because of "work commitments", had also been a user of mephedrone, ketamine and ecstasy.
In suspending her, the panel said: "This case involves persistent misuse of illicit drugs over a period of time and there is nothing before this panel to confirm that this is no longer the case.
"Miss Gronkowski put patients at unwarranted risk of harm and acted dishonestly, thereby negatively affecting the reputation of the profession."
Sodexo, which runs the prison, has not yet commented on the case.
