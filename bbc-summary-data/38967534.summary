Thieves have stolen money and other items from vehicles that were left unlocked across Inverness.

Last month, police investigated thefts from six vehicles in the Castle Heather area of the city after they were left unlocked overnight.
Since then, Police Scotland said there had been similar incidents in the Westhill and Hilton areas.
Also, overnight on Thursday and Friday last week, thieves stole from vehicles in Scorguie and Dalneigh.
Police said belongings were also thrown out from the vehicles.
Ch Imps Ian Graham, Police Scotland's Inverness area commander, said: "People don't think it will happen to them, but the sad truth is that you are far more likely to become a victim if you don't take basic steps to ensure your valuables are secure.
"We've received reports of thefts from right across Inverness so there is no safe place from opportunistic criminals.
"Generally we live in a very safe part of the country, but I would urge people not to be complacent and lock their cars whenever they're left unattended - even for short periods of time."
