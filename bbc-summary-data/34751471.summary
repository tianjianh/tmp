[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn's head of policy Andrew Fisher has been suspended from the Labour Party pending a report by its ruling National Executive Committee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He has faced calls for his expulsion after suggesting people should back a Class War candidate in May's election, not Labour's official candidate.
Mr Fisher apologised but critics accused him of showing "contempt".
Mr Corbyn has said he still has "full confidence" in Mr Fisher amid reports the aide was still working for him.
Channel 4 News said Mr Fisher had been suspended for "administrative" reasons.
Mr Fisher appointment is one of a number to Mr Corbyn's close circle that have proved controversial among Labour MPs.
He posted a tweet in August 2014, which has since been deleted, saying "if you live in Croydon South, vote with dignity, vote @campaignbeard" - the Twitter name of the Class War party candidate.
Class War, an anarchist group, has suggested that there is "no difference" between any of the Westminster parties.
Labour's official candidate in Croydon South, Emily Benn, granddaughter of Mr Corbyn's political mentor Tony Benn, lodged a formal complaint about the tweet.
Mr Fisher, who has deleted his Twitter account, also reportedly posted messages attacking former leader Ed Miliband's front bench and celebrating ex-shadow chancellor Ed Balls losing his seat at the general election.
Mr Fisher apologised "unreservedly" for the Class War tweet but some MPs have called on him to be disciplined, saying it was out of step with Mr Corbyn's call for a "new politics" free from personal insults.
Under Labour Party rules, a member who "joins and/or supports a political organisation other than an official Labour group or other unit of the party, or supports any candidate who stands against an official Labour candidate... shall automatically be ineligible to be or remain a party member".
