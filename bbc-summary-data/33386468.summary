Ms Price's car was caught on camera near her home in West Sussex on 20 August.
The 37-year-old ex-model and former Big Brother contestant had pleaded not guilty in April, but changed her plea at Horsham Magistrates' Court.
She was also given three penalty points for the offence on the A24 at Buck Barn, West Grinstead
Prosecutors offered no evidence to a second charge of failing to provide information.
Julian Dale, defending, said the offence took place not long after she had given birth by emergency Caesarean section to her fifth child, Bunny.
Price's daughter was still in hospital in Chichester, she and her husband were making frequent visits there, and she had "no recollection" of the offence, Mr Dale said.
"There was a lot on her plate," he told the court.
"It looks like she has decided to keep going as the lights have turned red."
Price was fined £700 and ordered to pay costs of £450 and a victim surcharge of £70.
After being told she had 14 days to settle the fines and costs, Price said: "I'll do it when I get home."
She thanked magistrates as she left the courtroom.
