A safety poster featuring a picture of a woman's bottom has been pulled from railway stations across London amid accusations of "sexism".

Train operator Southeastern was forced to remove the advert from 70 sites after it sparked complaints from two Labour politicians.
MPs Teresa Pearce and Sadiq Khan described the use of the image as "appalling" and "ridiculous".
Southeastern said it now recognised how it "may cause offence".
The poster reads: "Good for sitting, squeezing, and shaking, don't bruise it. Please take extra care in wet weather conditions. Love every bit of you."
Tooting MP Mr Khan said the advert had "no place" on London's transport network.
Meanwhile Ms Pearce, who represents Erith and Thamesmead, demanded an investigation into how it was approved.
"Women face sexual abuse and harassment every day on public transport and it was appalling to see that Southeastern think that it is OK to trivialise it in this way," she said.
The firm said the poster was approved by an independent panel, but it had taken "appropriate action" to take it down.
"The poster was used as it was intended to be a harmless, but impactful way of drawing attention to safety issues at stations, particularly trips and falls during wet weather," a spokesman added.
