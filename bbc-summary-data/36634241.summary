Eilidh Doyle vowed to "fight" for an Olympic medal after a comfortable 400m hurdles victory at the British Championships in Birmingham.

The 29-year-old Scot guaranteed her place in Rio as she eased away from the rest of the field in 54.93 seconds.
"I'm confident," the European champion told BBC Sport. "The hurdles is very open, so I'll just keep plugging away.
"They don't give away Olympic medals easily, but I'm going to try to fight for one."
With Jessica Turner a distant second in 57.34, Doyle added: "It was all about remaining focused and putting on a show.
"When you do hurdles, it's all about your stride pattern and running the right race. Sometimes competition can be irrelevant. It's all about your own performance."
Laura Muir defended her 1500m title in style, a long way clear in a time of four minutes, 10.14 seconds.
"I just wanted to get to Rio and I've done that," said the 23-year-old.
"I was fifth at the World Championships last year, so I want to stay in that top five and five is close to three."
Scots finished in the top three places in the 5,000m, with Steph Twell and Eilish McColgan booking their Olympic spots ahead of Laura Whittle.
"It's been such a tense week, I ran that race in my head a thousand times," said Twell, 26, who competed at 2008 Games in Beijing.
Like Twell, McColgan has battled back from serious injury, with the 25-year-old switching from the steeplechase following foot surgery.
"I can't explain how happy I am," she said. "This is something I've thought about for so long.
"I didn't even think I'd be running this year, so I'm over the moon to be going to my second Olympics in a different event."
Lennie Waite was a disappointing second in the 3,000m steeplechase, behind Rosie Clarke, but, unlike the winner, will definitely be going to Rio thanks to a top-two finish since she has twice run inside the qualifying time this season.
Waite, 30, said: "I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders for those last two laps.
"I was not in a great place, just not wanting to mess anything up and get to that finish line.
"I'm so happy to book my ticket but very disappointed that I wasn't able to win today."
In the 800m, Lynsey Sharp led the last lap from the front but was caught close to the line by Shelayna Oskan-Clarke.
"Obviously, I would have liked to have defended my title but it's nice to get that box ticked. I tied up a little and that's something I need to work on," said the European and Commonwealth silver medallist from 2014.
Chris O'Hare also clinched his Olympic place, finishing second in a slow and scrappy 1500m, passing fellow Scot Jake Wightman on the home straight.
With four Scottish athletes already selected for the marathon and the 10,000m, Andrew Butchart made if five on Saturday with his 5,000m win in Birmingham.
