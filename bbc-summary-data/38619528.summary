[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 0-1 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Forrester scored the only goal to lead Peterborough to victory over Swindon in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forrester struck a minute into the second half to settle a tight and tense game in Posh's favour as Swindon's unbeaten start to 2017 came to an end.
Home goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux stopped Peterborough taking the lead after only five minutes, diverting Ryan Tafazolli's header past a post.
Islam Feruz came closest to giving Swindon a half-time lead when he narrowly failed to connect with captain Nathan Thompson's low cross.
Peterborough took the lead within 60 seconds of the restart as Swindon were caught napping.
Marcus Maddison crossed from the left and Forrester turned neatly before firing past the despairing Vigouroux, who got a hand to the ball but could not keep it out.
The defeat leaves Swindon just three points above the relegation zone.
Defender Tafazolli should have made the win even more commanding but put a free header wide from Maddison's free-kick.
