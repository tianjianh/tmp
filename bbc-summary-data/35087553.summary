Kieran Chapman's car was found parked in Harwood Dale, within the park, near Scarborough on 2 December.
North Yorkshire Police have issued a fresh appeal for information.
Mr Chapman's brother Steven, said: "Kieran is a lovely, intelligent and adventurous young man who is a very experienced and passionate hiker."
"His disappearance is totally out of character and we are extremely anxious about his failure to contact his family."
The Scarborough and Ryedale Mountain Rescue were called in to assist police officers in the search for Mr Chapman on 3 December.
Nothing was found and the search was stood down after three days.
Steven Chapman said: "If you are a hiker who goes walking in the moors and think you might have seen Kieran, or have any information that could assist us in finding him,  then please report it to the police".
Police said the 38-year-old's car - a red Volkswagen Polo - may have been parked at Harwood Dale in the last few days of November or very early December.
