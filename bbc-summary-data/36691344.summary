American world champion Gwen Jorgensen took Olympic gold ahead of Swiss defending champion Nicola Spirig.
"I think the first thing I said to her was 'I'm so sorry'," Holland said.
"I knew it would come down to me and Non, which was the worst thing ever because I wanted it to be us together."
The 30-year-old became the first British woman to win an Olympic triathlon medal.
And her bronze was Britain's third triathlon medal in Rio after Alistair Brownlee won gold in the men's race and brother Jonny took silver.

Jorgensen and Spirig broke clear of the pack on the early stages of the 10km run, which followed a 1,500m open-water swim from Copacabana Beach and a 40km bike stage.
The American - world champion in 2014 and 2015 - moved out on her own to win in a time of one hour 56 minutes 16 seconds.
Spirig faded to finish 40 seconds back and claim her second Olympic medal after gold in London four years ago.
Welsh triathlete Stanford, the 2013 world champion, looked on course to win bronze, but was overtaken by Holland in the charge for the line and lost out by three seconds.
The third Briton, Helen Jenkins, came 19th, with the Republic of Ireland's Aileen Reed 21st.
Fabienne St Louis of Mauritius competed despite being diagnosed with cancer in December, but pulled out after the swim.

Holland said: "I've had a rollercoaster 24 hours. I've been a bit sick and didn't know how I would feel today.
"I had to put out of my mind that we're best mates and housemates.
"Non is a huge part of what I do. Half of this medal is hers. I wouldn't be the athlete I am if it wasn't for her. I moved in with Non at the end of 2013 and I've become an exponentially better athlete for it."

Stanford said: "I feel a bit mixed. I'm delighted Vicky got the medal we came as a team to get.
"I don't think I could ask much more of myself. Fourth is probably the worst place to come but it's still fourth at the Olympics. We have one medal in the home now and we can put it on display."
Jenkins said: "I haven't been 100% the last couple of days. I thought I was fine but when we got to the hill I didn't really have that top end power.
"I don't want to make excuses; I wasn't good enough. It isn't anything too serious, on this kind of course if you are a per cent off it is not going to happen.
"I gave it everything, I finished and I know I couldn't have done any more."
