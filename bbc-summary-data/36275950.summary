County Championship: Woakes leads Warwickshire revival against Notts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Woakes and Keith Barker both made centuries to ensure Warwickshire recovered from a collapse against Nottinghamshire to finish the opening day at Trent Bridge on 372-9.

Stand-in skipper Woakes' 121, his first century of the season, came three days after being overlooked for England's first Test against Sri Lanka.
Notts bowlers Luke Fletcher and Jackson Bird had Warwickshire at 17-4.
But Woakes and Barker (113) put on 167 for the seventh wicket.
Woakes, who was twice dropped in the slips, was leading Warwickshire for the first time in the absence of captain Ian Bell, who failed to recover in time from a hamstring injury.
The all-rounder arrived at the crease with Warwickshire on 60-5 to join former England Test batsman Jonathan Trott.
They put on 57 before Trott, the only top-five batsman to reach double figures, fell for 68, Brett Hutton taking a fine one-handed catch off Bird.
Fletcher - recalled from a loan spell at Derbyshire early as Notts were without England trio Jake Ball, Alex Hales and Stuart Broad - was particularly damaging in his first spell back at Trent Bridge, with 3-6 from 11 overs.
Ian Westwood, Laurie Evans and Sam Hain were all caught off Fletcher's bowling, as he got good movement in the morning session.
However, he failed to claim any more victims, finishing the day 3-70, while Bird ended with 3-81 after Woakes was caught behind by Chris Read.
Nottinghamshire fast bowler Luke Fletcher:
"It was a weird sort of day. We were on top in the first session and convincingly won that but Warwickshire fought back strongly.
"They've been renowned for their strong tail and all credit to the way Keith Barker and Chris Woakes played in that last session.
"They were outstanding but we did drop Woakes twice in the slips and that was costly."
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown:
"I'm feeling slightly different now to the way I was at 17-4 but Notts showed how you need to bowl on that wicket.
"Credit to Trotty for getting through a tough session and then the partnership between and Chris Woakes and Keith Barker.
"It's changed the course of the game in our favour at the moment but until Notts bat you don't really know what sort of wicket it is."
