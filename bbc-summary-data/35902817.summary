Teenager Matt Butcher opened the scoring with a fine drive from outside the box, before doubling the lead - and his personal tally - with a left-footed effort early in the second half.
Jonathon Margetts pulled one back for the hosts to set up a tense finale.
Craig Westcarr equalised from six yards out, finding the top corner to leave both sides with a point.
Woking have not won a league game since they beat Wrexham 3-1 on 9 January.
Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"Jake Cole has made some good saves today and when they scored with 10 minutes to go it gave them a big incentive where we are low in confidence. Everyone was expecting the equaliser.
"From being 2-0 up we are disappointed that we haven't won the game but what do we look at? Do we say to ourselves is it 'we haven't had a win in 12 games?' or do we say to ourselves 'that's two results out of the last three games?'
"I know they might be draws but we've got to take the positives. We've got a squad in there which is very mixed in confidence and age."
