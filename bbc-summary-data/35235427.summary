Merseyside Police said the 19-year-old fled from a Ford Fiesta after it was in collision with a parked car in Liverpool at about 15:00 GMT.
The man was then hit by the police vehicle and taken to hospital.
He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of burglary, aggravated unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle and driving while banned.
Merseyside Police said following normal protocol its professional standards department had been notified of the incident.
They have appealed for witnesses, saying a second man also left the scene of the first collision at the junction of Buckingham Road and Ellerslie Road in Tuebrook.
