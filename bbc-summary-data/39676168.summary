Rovers will go down if they lose, Birmingham win and Nottingham Forest draw, or if they draw while Birmingham and Forest both win.
Aston Villa have 19-goal top scorer Jonathan Kodjia available again after a one-match suspension.
Gabby Agbonlahor, hero of Sunday's derby win against Birmingham City, is again likely to start on the bench.
Villa's Wales international defender Neil Taylor is likely to be involved again after coming through last weekend too.

Every match day seems to be the biggest of the season for Blackburn Rovers, the biggest game in years. This is no different.
For the first time all season, Rovers' status as a Championship club could be over, depending on the fortunes of Birmingham City and Nottingham Forest.
To be more positive, a win and a Birmingham defeat would see them move out of the bottom three with a game remaining.
Relegation was viewed as unthinkable for the club earlier this season. It could turn in to a reality if they fail to produce in front of the biggest home crowd at Ewood in the league this season.
