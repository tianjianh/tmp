The estranged husband of former DJ Suzie McGuire has been given a community sentence for assaulting her.

Derek Mitchell, 35, from East Kilbride, was previously found guilty of three assaults on the former Radio Clyde DJ between May and December 2011.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard how the 45-year-old had tried to take her own life in a bid to escape a "life of terror" at the hands of her husband.
Mitchell was ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work as punishment.
He must also go for alcohol counselling and conform to a non-harassment order for the next six months, not to approach or contact or attempt to approach or contact Ms McGuire.
Passing sentence, Sheriff Susan Sinclair told Mitchell: "You now accept you have a serious issue with the abuse of alcohol and have started taking steps to deal with it.
"Nevertheless, your conduct during 2011, in particular May 20 2011, was reprehensible.
"Your actions were those of a spoiled, jealous, possessive man with a serious alcohol problem and a predilection for violence."
The sheriff added: "You have been convicted of a serious assault in the presence of two small children and two further minor assaults on the complainer, all during 2011."
At a previous hearing, accountant Mitchell was convicted of three assault charges in 2011 and of a breach of the peace in November 2009.
The first assault charge related to an attack in May 2011 after the Eaglesham Fair.
Mitchell drunkenly pulled his wife's wedding finger back - breaking it, in front of her terrified daughters.
The second attack happened in September 2011 at a military event that Ms McGuire was hosting.
The court heard how Mitchell grabbed his wife and pulled her away.
Former Pop Idol winner and singer Michelle McManus told the jury that she and the DJ had their pictures taken with people at the function.
She said: "I kind of stepped aside to make a phone call or send a text message myself. At that point I noticed Derek coming towards where we had been standing and he looked angry.
"He grabbed Suzie by the arm and said 'You're really embarrassing me'."
The third assault took place in December 2011, after a Cash for Kids event at the Hilton Hotel in Glasgow.
Ms McGuire and Mitchell went to 29 at Royal Exchange Square in the city centre for an after party.
The court was told that drunken Mitchell flew into a rage when his wife was cuddled by businessman Mike Ashley.
Ms McGuire told the court: "Derek lost it, really really turned very vicious and very nasty at that point. He slapped me across the face and bit me on the shoulder in front of company, in front of quite a lot of people."
She added: "Mike Ashley was standing right beside me - Derek actually tried to hit him."
Ms McGuire also told the court about an attempt to take her own life in March last year after she had been left "broken" by the abuse.
She said: "I don't recognise that person now because I would have left my children with no mum."
During her evidence, she told defence lawyer Billy Lavelle: "I was actually a woman pushed to the limit.
"Beaten up, berated daily, I had nothing left to give."
She added: "I was absolutely hanging by a thread and that thread was gone."
After their relationship came to an end in July 2013, Ms McGuire went to the police and reported her ordeal.
During the trial, Mitchell lodged a special defence of self-defence in relation to the broken finger, claiming he was trying to stop his wife attacking him, but the jury rejected this version of events.
