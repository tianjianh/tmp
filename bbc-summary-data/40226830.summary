[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Remmay Williams, 24, of Blount Road, Leicester, had thousands of pounds of cocaine, crack and heroin in her cupboard - along with a semi-automatic pistol wrapped in a tea towel.
She was found guilty of intent to supply Class A drugs, possession of a self-loading pistol, machine pistol and ammunition.
She had denied knowledge of the items.
Leicester Crown Court heard how Williams, who has a four-year-old child, had her home raided by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit in March 2016.
This followed the arrest of her "close friend" James Orme who had been seen leaving her house and whose car was found to contain crack cocaine and heroin and a Skorpion sub-machine gun.
Last year, Orme, 29, of Kashmir Road, Leicester, was jailed for nine years after pleading guilty to possession of the handgun, the machine gun and possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin.
The drugs recovered from the car and the kitchen were worth around Â£24,000 wholesale, police said.
Investigator Emily Sharpe, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said: "Throughout the investigation Williams maintained she had no knowledge of the drugs and gun being in her kitchen cupboard, which also contained everyday items.
"She was close friends with Orme, whom she knew to be a drug dealer, and had little regard for the safety of others living in her house, putting them at risk."
