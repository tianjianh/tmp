[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 1-1 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Collins' late penalty denied Hartlepool their first League Two home win of the season as Crawley earned a draw at the Northern Gas & Power Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Collins thundered home his spot-kick with 16 minutes remaining to ensure the spoils were shared after Lewis Alessandra's first goal for the club put Pools ahead.
Hartlepool did not look like a side with such a poor home record in the opening exchanges, taking the lead in the 12th minute.
Having been hauled over by Andre Blackman, Nathan Thomas failed to make it seven goals in as many games from the spot - yet Alessandra was on hand to head home the rebound.
Crawley were unfortunate not to level immediately as Enzio Boldewijn and Jimmy Smith rattled the woodwork in quick succession.
The Red Devils took control thereafter and equalised in the 74th minute, Collins netting having been pushed to the floor by Jake Carroll.
And Crawley were only denied a last-ditch winner by some brilliance from Hartlepool defender Scott Harrison, who somehow stopped Collins from tapping into an empty net after Billy Clifford's curler hit the crossbar.
