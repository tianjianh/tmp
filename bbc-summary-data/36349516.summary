McEwens of Perth department store closes for last time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Department store McEwens of Perth has closed its doors for the last time, having gone into administration earlier this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company's Ballater and Oban branches were shut in March but the flagship Perth store continued trading while a closing down sale was held.
More than 100 jobs have been lost as a result of the collapse.
The company had been trading at its St John Street site in Perth since March 1868.
The closures came after McEwens suffered ongoing trading losses.
A sign was posted at the Perth store on Friday announcing the closure.
It read: "The management and staff wish to thank customers for your custom and support over many years."
The family-run store chain specialised in fashion, cosmetics and homeware.
Meanwhile, administrators have set a deadline of 1 June for interested parties to make an offer for the company's intellectual property (IP) rights.
Assets include trade mark rights protecting the McEwens of Perth brand, as well as rights over a selection of branded websites, domain names and databases from the company's e-commerce side.
IP consulting firm Metis Partners, which is handling the sale on behalf of KPMG, said the brand had "significant cachet value as the name to trust for high end and bespoke fashion in Scotland".
Head of corporate recovery Nat Baldwin said: "The McEwens of Perth IP asset sale has attracted interest from parties both from the UK and overseas so the marketing process continues with best and final offers above a minimum offer level of Â£25,000 being invited by noon on Wednesday, 1 June.
"We believe that the IP assets, and particularly the McEwens of Perth brand, would offer considerable opportunities for a purchaser to stand out amongst its competitors by preserving the brand for business."
