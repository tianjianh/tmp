[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ebbsfleet salvaged a late draw at Maidenhead to extend their unbeaten run to 31 league games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dave Tarpey was a constant threat to the visitors early on, narrowly missing the target a few times as he looked to add to his seven goals from the first four games.
But it was Harry Pritchard who instead got the breakthrough the hosts deserved, curling home delightfully from 25 yards out after 26 minutes.
Luke Coulson equalised for Ebbsfleet after 50 minutes to score his third goal in five games and it was enough to keep his side's long unbeaten run going.
