[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pensioner has been banned from keeping animals for five years after "one of the worst cases" of dog neglect witnessed by inspectors.

James McLelland, 67, of Eyemouth, allowed his pet to be covered in fleas, skin conditions, sores and suffer a loss of hair over a six-month period.
The Scottish SPCA was alerted by someone who spotted terrier Trixie constantly scratching itself.
As well as the five-year ban, McLelland was also fined Â£300.
At Jedburgh Sheriff Court, he admitted a charge of causing the dog unnecessary suffering between February and August.
Scottish SPCA Insp Stephanie McCrossan said the dog had been in a lot of pain due to a long-standing and untreated skin condition and was also suffering from hair loss due to fleas.
"We would expect any animal owner to have sought immediate veterinary treatment for a condition that could have been easily prevented," she said.
"We welcome the fact that McLelland has been dealt with by the court and the sentence handed down. We hope he will give serious consideration about his suitability to care for other animals in the future.
"Trixie has now received the proper medication and treatment and has made a full recovery. She will be joining her new family this weekend."
