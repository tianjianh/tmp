The USA international, and former national team captain, played Super 14s in South Africa with the Lions and at North Harbour in New Zealand.
"He is a physical defender and a powerful attacker," director of rugby Dean Richards said.
Despite featuring in three World Cups, Clever was omitted from the 2015 squad.
He said: "The club is expecting big things in the next few years and I'm looking forward to it.
"It's good to be in the situation as a new player coming in where people expect big things."
