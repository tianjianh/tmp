The research was carried out by Common Sense Media, a non-profit organisation that aims to help parents and children successfully navigate the world of technology and media.
It surveyed almost 3,000 young people between eight and 18 years old. Here's what they found out about how teenagers use and engage with different types of media.
Average time spent with media
9 hours
Average amount spent with media per day for US teens
Includes watching TV, movies, and online videos, playing games, using social media and the internet and listening to music
Doesn't include time spent with media at school or for homework.
While nine hours is the average time teenagers spend with technology, 6% of those surveyed said they don't use screen media at all on any given day.
Social media use
45%
of teens in the US use social media every day
66% listen to music
58% watch television
Teenage girls spend about 40 minutes more a day on social media than boys. In comparison, boys are more likely to spend time gaming.
Multi-tasking while doing homework?
2/3rds of teens say using media while doing homework doesn't affect their work
50% think that listening to music actually helps.
More than half of teens say they text, watch TV, use social media or listen to music while studying.
TV on traditional screens
50%
of viewing time by US teens is spent watching TV as it is broadcast
22% is spent watching online videos on platforms such as YouTube
14% is spent watching TV shows or movies on another mobile device.
Mobile phones are the most popular way to watch TV and videos online. They account for 43% of time spent watching online media.
Social is not the favourite
10%
said social media was their "favourite" media-related activity
Almost 1/3rd said listening to music was their favourite
While social media has become an integral part of most teenagers' lives, very few say it is their favourite.
Differences in income level
2 hours, 45 minutes
How much more time, on average, teens from lower-income homes spend with media than those in higher-income homes
Teens from lower-income families are no more likely to watch, listen or engage with media than those from higher income families but when they do, they tend to spend more time.
Black teenagers also report spending more time on average than white or Hispanic teens.
