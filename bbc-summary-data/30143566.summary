The presenter has been away from the BBC1 show since her eight-year-old daughter suffered burns at Halloween.
The exact nature of the accident isn't known but the star later released a statement warning of the dangers of fireworks.
London Ambulance Service said "a child was taken to hospital after being called to a London address" and treated "as a priority".
In a series of tweets the 42-year-old thanked her followers for their "lovely messages" but added that her daughter is on "a long road to recovery".
For the past couple of weeks, Zoe Ball has stepped in to present Strictly alongside Tess Daly.
