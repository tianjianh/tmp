Essex Police said it was issuing court summonses to motorists following a three-lorry collision at Thurrock at 04:40 BST on Thursday.
Officers said drivers were slowing down on the opposite carriageway to look at the crash scene - known as 'rubber-necking'.
Charges will include careless driving or using a mobile phone while driving.
One of the lorry drivers involved in the crash was trapped in his cabin but his injuries were "not serious", police said.
There were tailbacks of up to 12 miles on the anti-clockwise carriageway, which was closed until 14:00.
Adam Pipe, casualty reduction manager for Essex Police, said officers dealing with the crash were "shocked and disappointed" by the behaviour of other drivers.
"Although vehicles were passing slowly, the offending drivers were distracted and could easily have caused further crashes that could have caused injury or added to delays," he said.
"This shows no respect for the casualties and the emergency services working to free the injured driver and to clear the damaged vehicles.
"Filming crashes and putting images straight on to social media can also lead to the families of crash victims finding out what has happened to their loved ones before they can be traced and contacted by police officers."
