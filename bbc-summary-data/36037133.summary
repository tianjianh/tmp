A "despicable" child abuser has been jailed for a string of sex offences committed against a girl under 13.

John Stephen MacPherson, 61, was told by Judge John Pini QC at Lincoln Crown Court that his defence was one of the "most odious and repellent" he had heard in 35 years in the legal system.
The abuse came to light in October when the girl's mother took her to hospital.
The judge told MacPherson he would not be automatically released after serving half of his 26-year sentence.
Speaking after sentencing, Det Con Scott Miller said MacPherson's "depravity and truly horrible attitude" had left him "lost for words".
Det Con Miller said: "I'm so proud of the victim and her family for having the courage to come and give evidence at court. Justice has been served.
"This despicable, calculating person isn't going to be able to cause any more harm. This has been the worst case I have investigated in my entire career."
MacPherson, of Long Road, Tydd Gote, near Wisbech, had denied three charges of assault by penetration of a child under the age of 13 and seven charges of sexual assault between July and October 2015, along with offences of taking an indecent photograph of a child, causing a child to watch a sexual act and causing a child to engage in sexual activity.
Det Supt Richard Hatton said MacPherson had carried out "horrible offending against an innocent child".
He said: "The perpetrator has been put in the place he deserves to be and will not be able to offend against children again."
