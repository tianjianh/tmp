The owners of an acclaimed bookshop that could fall down say they have had a "phenomenal response" to an appeal to fund urgent structural repairs.

Four steel columns were required at Scarthin Books, in Cromford, Derbyshire, to support the weight of about 100,000 books.
Thousands of pounds were raised within days of the appeal starting and it is now close to hitting a £10,000 target.
Manager David Booker said the fund had had donations from all over the world.
The shop, which has four floors and a vegetarian cafe, was dubbed one of the best in the world by The Guardian, in 2008.
"We've been blown away by the phenomenal response, it's very heart-warming," Mr Booker said.
"[The appeal] brought out people's memories and touched a nerve."
Initially, the aim was to raise 50% of the cost of the building work but the public's generosity has meant there is now enough money to carry out roofing and internal repairs.
Work has begun on safeguarding the building's future with four steel posts being installed on the ground floor.
Mr Booker said the builders had agreed to wait for payment until the crowd funding appeal ends on 26 April, with £9,042 raised so far.
