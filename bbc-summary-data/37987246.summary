[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of London Underground staff have voted to go on strike over two separate disputes, the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union said.

The union said 85% of station workers had voted to walk out in a dispute over staffing and safety.
Drivers on the Piccadilly line also backed action over a "wholesale breakdown" in industrial relations.
London Underground (LU) said the RMT should "work with us constructively... rather than threaten strikes".
About 3,400 workers are involved in the two disputes which could affect services in the run-up to Christmas.
General secretary Mick Cash said a "toxic impact of the job cuts programme" had made working on the Tube "horrific".
"Our dispute is about taking action to haul back the cuts machine and put safety back at the top of the agenda," he said.
The RMT executive is to consider the ballot results before deciding the next move.
Transport for London (TfL) said both ballots had low turnouts, with 33% voting in the ballot over staffing and safety and 49% voting in the Piccadilly line dispute.
Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, said "an independent review was being conducted" into the closure of ticket offices and talks had been planned "to discuss the RMT's concerns on the Piccadilly line".
The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) union has also announced it will ballot hundreds of members for strikes over the closure of ticket offices.
