Young Conway Volunteers: Band members overturn 'sectarian song' convictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thirteen members of a loyalist band have successfully appealed convictions for provocatively playing a sectarian tune outside a Catholic church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Young Conway Volunteers members were prosecuted over their conduct outside St Patrick's Chapel on Donegall Street, north Belfast, on 12 July 2012.
They had denied playing the Famine Song as they marched in circles at the site.
Prosecutors did not oppose their appeal, but only because they agreed to being bound over to keep the peace.
The events outside the church that day marked the start of series of flashpoint incidents when subsequent parades passed Donegall Street.
During the three-year prosecution, the band members were accused of a provocative act likely to cause public disorder or a breach of the peace.
The Famine Song, which includes the line 'The famine's over, why don't you go home?',  has been declared racist by senior judges in Scotland.
However, the defendants claimed they were performing the Beach Boys hit 'Sloop John B', which has a similar tune but different lyrics.
The 10 adult defendants were:
Charges were also brought against three others who were juveniles at the time of the incident.
During the original contested hearing at Belfast Magistrates' Court, defence lawyers played songs by a Swedish folk singer, a Star Trek enthusiast and football fan chants - all to the same tune - in a bid to have their clients cleared.
Paul Shaw, band leader on the day of the parade, was the only one of the accused to give evidence.
He said they had been forced to stop outside the church due to a break in the parade and started up the Beach Boys tune to ward off lethargy among members tired from the previous night's celebrations.
In April, the 13 defendants were all convicted, with three of them receiving five-month suspended prison sentences.
Fines of Â£300 were imposed on all but two of the youngest accused, while binding over orders were also handed down as part of the sentencing process.
A challenge to the convictions was due to be heard at Belfast County Court on Tuesday, but the case did not proceed when it was confirmed that the Public Prosecution Service would not be resisting the appeals.
On that basis the appeals were allowed.
The outcome was reached after each of the defendants agreed to being bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for two years.
Any default could see them jailed for up to seven days.
Outside court Mr Shaw said: "Justice has been done - we fought this for three years and we wouldn't have if we didn't believe it was a just cause."
A defence solicitor who represented 12 of the accused, said: "No offence was ever intended to the residents and parishioners of the church.
"Common sense has prevailed and my clients want to put the matter behind them."
In a statement, The County Grand Orange Lodge of Belfast welcomed the successful appeal.
"We are glad that justice has finally been achieved for these band members who had been wrongly vilified by the media and nationalism," it said.
"There never was an intent to cause offence."
