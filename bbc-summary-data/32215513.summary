Ballot Monkeys will be set on campaign buses and written in real-time.
The writers will leave gaps in the script to allow for updates as the campaign hots up.
Miranda star Sarah Hadland also appears as a TV presenter-turned UKIP official and Hugh Dennis as a Tory campaigner.
The creators are Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin, the brains behind hit newsroom comedy Drop the Dead Donkey which ran for six series from 1990, and current BBC family sitcom Outnumbered, in which Dennis stars as the bemused dad.
Drop the Dead Donkey was also put together with gaps in the initial scripts to allow for up-to-date true-life events to be incorporated into the show.
Commenting on their latest project, Hamilton and Jenkin said: "We're very excited about this. We don't think anyone's done anything like this before, although we may find out why,"
'Brave or bonkers'
The series will be made up of five 30-minute episodes and will follow the ups and downs of the politicians, advisors, journalists and staff on board the battle buses of the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and UKIP campaigns.
"We haven't yet decided whether we're brave or bonkers," Fiona McDermott, Channel 4's commissioning editor for comedy, said.
"But a real-time satirical sitcom like Ballot Monkeys could only be handled by the remarkable Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin."
She added: "We are thrilled to have them and such an amazing cast on board our buses."
Ballot Monkeys is the latest in a line of politically-inspired shows made by Channel 4.
Previous programmes have included UKIP: The First 100 Days, imagining life under a UKIP government, and Coalition - which recreated the talks which led to the formation of the last government.
