[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 2-0 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boreham Wood pushed up into the top eight of the National League with what eventually turned out to be a convincing 2-0 home win over Southport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sandgrounders started the brighter at Meadow Park, but it was the hosts who took the lead on the half-hour mark. Kenny Davis drilled low past Magnus Norman, and it changed the match.
Boreham reasserted control. The home side had not lost two league games in a row all season, and went about rectifying last week's 1-0 reverse at Bromley with determination and commitment.
Substitute Jamie Lucas clinched the win with 15 minutes remaining, beating Norman all ends up to spark home jubilation.
