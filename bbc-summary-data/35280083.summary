Up to 160 jobs could go as part of a restructuring at oil company Petrofac.

Petrofac - which employs 1,900 people in the UK - said it was integrating its services into a single business to ensure it remained "competitive and sustainable against a challenging industry backdrop".
The company has not made clear where the bulk of the jobs at risk could ultimately go.
A consultation with the workforce is expected to end later this month.
A Petrofac spokesperson said: "We're constantly looking for ways to make our business as cost efficient and delivery-focused as possible.
"Integration of our UK services will deliver a streamlined and effective business which is designed to ensure we remain competitive and sustainable against a challenging industry backdrop.
"We're making every effort to minimise the impact on our 1,900 UK employees.
"Under our current proposals the positions potentially at risk represent less than 10% of our entire UK population and will be spread across our operating centres."
