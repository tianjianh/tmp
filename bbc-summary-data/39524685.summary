The UK government says it "fully supports" the US missile strike against an air base in Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack.

A No 10 spokeswoman said: "We believe [it] was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime, and is intended to deter further attacks."
Dozens of civilians, including children died in the attack on Tuesday.
The Pentagon said 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired overnight.
The No 10 spokeswoman said: "Overnight, the US has taken military action against the Syrian regime, targeting the airfield in Shayrut which was used to launch the chemical weapons attack earlier this week."
US President Donald Trump explained in a televised address that the base had been the launch point for the chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province.
He called on "all civilised nations" to help end the conflict in Syria.
The UK government has made renewed calls this week for diplomatic action in response to the chemical attack.
The US, UK and France had brought a resolution before the United Nations Security Council, demanding an investigation.
But on Wednesday, Downing Street had played down the prospect of military action, insisting "nobody is talking" about an armed response to the atrocity.
