Three adults and a four-year-old girl were killed when the truck careered out of control on Lansdown Lane on Monday.
On Friday it emerged the driver of the tipper truck, 19, had recently passed a test to drive more advanced vehicles.
Rector Patrick Whitworth from All Saints Church said: "There's a lot of tenderness around in the community and that comes as a result of the tragedy."
A minute's silence was also held ahead of Bath's game at Saracens earlier.
Match commentator Nick Mullins said: "I'm sure Bath as a club would want to pay their own respects to those who died this week when they play Northampton at the Rec next weekend but they were thrilled that Saracens wanted to do something themselves this weekend."
On Tuesday the church held a special hour-long service attended by more than 400 people.
The tipper truck driver, Phillip Potter, was transporting aggregate when the crash happened.
Although Mr Potter had recently passed a licence to drive heavier vehicles, he had been licensed to drive the tipper truck for some months.
Police accident investigators are still trying to establish what caused the truck to crash.
They are looking at the load it was carrying as well as any potential mechanical faults.
Four-year-old Mitzi Steady died when she was walking with her grandmother, who remains critically ill in hospital.
Phil Allen, 52, and Robert Parker, 59, of Cwmbran, and Stephen Vaughan, 34, from Swansea, also died when their car was hit by the 30-tonne truck.
Books of condolence have been opened at All Saints, Bath Abbey and Weston library for people to pay their respects.
