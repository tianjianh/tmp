Celebrity Big Brother host Rylan Clark has defended the show against claims that it's unfairly edited.

Rylan was speaking to Newsbeat after two of this year's contestants were removed for breaking the show's rules.
He told Newsbeat: "Unless you've said it or unless you've done it, we can't show it."
Ken Morley, who was thrown out after making racist and sexist comments, claimed footage had been deliberately edited out.
The former Coronation Street star left the Celebrity Big Brother house after just five days.
The 71-year-old used racist language whilst telling a story about former British boxing champion Frank Bruno.
In an interview with ITV's Loose Women he apologised for using the word "negro" but refused to backtrack on comments that some people claimed were sexist.
Ken Morley told the Loose Women presenters: "It was banter in an odd situation, but I understand entirely I've upset a lot of people from everywhere in the world. I am not a racist. Never have been."
The actor however claimed that the on-screen footage shown to viewers was not an accurate reflection of his time in the house.
"Some of the stuff which is about to come out is very, very, nasty. It's not what you think."
However Rylan Clark, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother before landing a job hosting the show, denied that it's unfairly edited.
"At the end of the day, they've said it. We don't force drink down housemates' throats. We don't force them into situations," Rylan said.
He added: 'You can't really edit anything that has happened over the past few days in a certain way. We've shown you the stream. You saw the incidents surrounding Ken and Jeremy Jackson from start to finish."
Ken Morley was the second housemate asked to leave the Big Brother house this series with the TV regulator, Ofcom, receiving more than 250 complaints about his behaviour.
Just two days into his Big Brother adventure ex-Baywatch star Jeremy Jackson was removed for opening the dressing gown of a female contestant.
The American actor received a police caution for his actions.
In an interview after leaving the show Jeremy said he had apologised to model Chloe Goodman about the incident.
Rylan told Newsbeat that each contestant has to be accountable for their behaviour while they're on the show.
"Each one is a human being and they take their own actions into consideration when they have a drink.
"We're not going to show someone sitting in the garden having a cigarette for half an hour and not talking.
"We follow the stories that happen in the house whether it be a love triangle or an argument that's going on for a number of days," Rylan continued.
"Big Brother has never edited in a way that's not a true reflection.
"You don't see everything because we're not on for 24 hours a day."
Rylan, 26, who's also appeared on the X Factor says he still loved being part of the show despite the current controversy surrounding it.
"I will hold my hands up. I've watched the last few episodes and episodes over the weekend and it is uncomfortable viewing as is expressed by the viewing public.
"I love this show and love being part of it. It is a social experiment. It's a real life show.
"Sometimes viewing will be uncomfortable and we do have warnings. People know what they're letting themselves in for."
