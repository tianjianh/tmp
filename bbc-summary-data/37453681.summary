A military prison disciplinary board has sentenced US whistleblower Chelsea Manning to 14 days in solitary confinement, her lawyer has said.

She will serve seven days, with another seven suspended, for charges relating to her attempt to kill herself in July.
She ended a hunger strike last week, after the military agreed to provide her with gender dysphoria treatment.
The army private, born as Bradley Manning, is serving a 35-year sentence for espionage.
Last July, the former intelligence analyst attempted to take her own life, after what lawyers said was the Army's refusal to provide appropriate health care.
She was found guilty on Thursday by prison officials in Leavenworth, Kansas, of "conduct which threatens" for her suicide attempt. She also was convicted of having "prohibited property" - the book "Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy" by Gabriella Coleman.

"My punishment is 14 days in solitary confinement. 7 of those days are 'suspended.' If I get in trouble in the next six months, those seven days will come back," Manning wrote in a statement released by her supporters.
"I am feeling hurt. I am feeling lonely. I am embarrassed by the decision. I don't know how to explain it," she added.
Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, after being found guilty of espionage for her role in leaking diplomatic cables and battlefield reports to Wikileaks, the anti-secrecy group.
The leak of more than 700,000 documents and videos was one of the largest breaches of classified material in American history.
