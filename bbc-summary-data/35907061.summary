Five people have been arrested on suspicion of murdering a Tyneside man.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James 'Jimmy' Prout, of Percy Main, has not been seen since the start of February and police believe the 43-year-old has been killed.
A body, which officers say is likely to be that of Mr Prout, was found "in an area of open land" close to his home at 15:30 BST.
Two men, aged 26 and 42, and three women, aged 55, 49 and 25, are in police custody.
Mr Prout's ex-partner, Anne Corbett, 25, was also reported missing but has now been located.
Supt Peter Bent, of Northumbria Police, said: "We only became aware that James was missing when we received a call on Good Friday which identified concerns for his welfare.
"An investigation was immediately launched and our enquiries established that he had not been seen by friends or family for a number of weeks.
"As a result of searches police have found a body a short distance from his home address. Formal identification is yet to take place but we are fairly certain that it is James Prout."
