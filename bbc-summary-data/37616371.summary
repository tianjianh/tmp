50 Cent shared a video of teacher Christian Foley with the 37.9m people who like his Facebook page.
In the video pupils whoop and cheer as he shows off his verbal gymnastics in the educational rap, rhyming words like angles and ratio.
Mr Foley, who goes by the rap name Just Muz, said: "It's been absolutely crazy, I mean 50 Cent!"

In one rhyme he says he wields his "board marker like a microphone" to the obvious delight of the Year 8 class at Cardinal Pole School in Hackney.
Mr Foley, who grew up and went to school in Jersey, is a poet in residence at a number of schools where he now lives in London.
He posted the video on his Facebook page and said it was "inside footage of the greatest job in the world".
50 Cent shot to fame in 2003 with his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin' and has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.
