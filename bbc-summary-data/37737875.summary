[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 2-1 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Yemi Odubade scored a late winner to give Maidstone a 2-1 victory over Macclesfield at the Gallagher Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After five without a win, the last thing the Stones needed was to concede an early goal. But visiting striker Chris Holroyd was given two early chances, one of which he chested into the net after eight minutes.
However, Liam Enver-Marum turned the ball in to level for the hosts eight minutes later.
Macclesfield could easily have gone back in front, but Danny Whitaker saw his penalty saved by Lee Worgan. The Silkmen also came went when David Fitzpatrick hit the post.
Odubade was to have the final say with a tidy finish past Craig Ross with a minute remaining.
