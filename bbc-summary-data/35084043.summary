Mountain rescue teams helped 608 people who got into difficulties in 2014, with 12 fatalities.
Safety experts have issued life-saving advice in a bid to avoid further tragedies.
The Scottish government said it will provide a total of £1.81m towards mountain safety this year.
The tips for winter safety include:
Mark Diggins, from Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service, said: "Many thousands of enthusiasts enjoy the Scottish mountains every winter.
"However, the fast changing weather, with its snowfall, avalanche hazard, strong winds and poor visibility, requires us to be much more prepared when going into the mountains in the winter.
"Good clothing, navigational ability, appropriate equipment, movement skills on steep terrain, and use of ice axe and crampons are a necessary requirement for our enjoyment and safety."
Sport Minister Jamie Hepburn added: "Scotland's wild places can be at their most beautiful during the winter months, and we want people to be able to enjoy them right through the year.
"There's no doubt that the weather conditions make this more challenging, and while this challenge is part of the appeal for many, it must be treated with the utmost respect.
"Simple precautions and basic common sense can greatly reduce the risk of getting into trouble."
The Scottish government funding includes a £312,000 annual grant for mountain rescue teams and £1,041,000 for the Sportscotland national outdoor training centre at Glenmore Lodge, near Aviemore.
