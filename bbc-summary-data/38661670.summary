Albion Rovers player-manager Darren Young says his squad will take Sunday's Scottish Cup tie against Celtic "in their stride".

The League One club host the Premiership leaders in a fourth-round tie at Airdrie's Excelsior Stadium, with a crowd of 10,000 expected.
"The atmosphere will be electric," Young told BBC Scotland.
"These games don't come along very often, so when they do you've got to make the most of it."
Rovers have already caused a shock in this season's competition, knocking out Championship side Queen of the South with a 2-1 victory.
But former Aberdeen midfielder Young, 38, knows the challenge will ramp up against Brendan Rodgers' men.
"There's no other team in Scottish football that's beaten them this season and I think there's only one team [Inverness CT] that have drawn with them," he said.
"That shows you the kind of task we've got. Even if they rest a couple of players, it will be quality international players that replace them.
"They went away there and signed a player [Kouassi Eboue] for Â£2.8m and there's a chance he won't even start, so that's the quality we're up against.
"But we'll have a game plan and stick to it and hopefully get a few wee opportunities. If you take your chances at the right time, a wee bit of luck could help get us a victory or a draw."
