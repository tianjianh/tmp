Trees more resistant to fire have been planted as part of a redesign of Swinley Forest near Ascot, Berkshire.
More than 100,000 trees were destroyed in the 2011 blaze which lasted for about a week.
Five years after the event, the Forestry Commission say they have changed their practice guidance on wild fire resistance.
