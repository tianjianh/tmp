Holly Hagan and Charlotte Crosby have told Newsbeat that some of the reporting has been "irresponsible".
The girls say they have lost weight over the past few years and deny they put on weight on purpose in order to put out a fitness DVD.
Earlier this year Charlotte Crosby had the fastest-selling DVD ever, according to the Official Charts Company.
Holly Hagan has also had success with her autobiography, Not Quite A Geordie.
She said: "What really annoys me is when I read articles and it's like, 'Holly lost three stone in one month' and that is giving such a wrong impression to the girls out there reading that and thinking, 'Oh yeah I can loose three stone in one month'.
"They just pluck these figures out of thin air, and it shouldn't be allowed to happen because that could have really damaging effects."
She said every time she goes back into the Geordie Shore house she puts on half a stone and then has to lose it "and it is a battle".
She said that she has even had to tell her fans on Twitter: "In every interview I state CLEARLY that I lost weight slowly over a long period of time. I didn't drop three stone in a month like some articles claim."
The 22-year-old says she can now fit into a size eight but was nearly 13 stone at one point.
"People who have actually watched my journey have seen that it's actually taken such a long time over each series.
"But you can't just lose it overnight and I that they (the media) shouldn't be allowed to do that, it is very irresponsible.
"I'm on Twitter, they can ask me facts, I am there, my agent's email is there.
"If you have any queries ask rather than putting wrong facts out. People believe what they read and it will cause something really damaging.
"I know that when I was younger I read all these diets and I believed every word that they said."
Charlotte Crosby also denies claims that she purposefully put weight on to release a fitness DVD.
"No, sadly I just put weight on through loads of partying, drinking, having a boyfriend and eating takeaways every night," she said.
"I don't know why I would ever want to put weight on and look that fat and ugly. Why would anyone ever want to do that? It's so stupid that people even say that.
"It's obvious why I put weight on, you've seen us on telly what I do? Like, for years, for four years now. If I did start that four years ago I had a pretty good plan."

The new series of Geordie Shore starts on Tuesday night on MTV at 22:00 BST
