[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MPs have called on Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley to end the company's ties with one of the agencies used to supply workers to its warehouse in Derbyshire.

A Commons committee has written to Transline Group, stating the agency "lacked credibility" in its evidence to the Sports Direct inquiry.
MPs also raised concerns about working conditions for agency staff at the company's headquarters in Shirebrook.
Transline said they were "astounded" by the findings.

The group, who are under investigation by the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, also suggested the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Committee were being "biased" against them.
However, BIS committee chairman Iain Wright MP said Mr Ashley needed to address "poor contractual terms" set out by agencies.
He said: "[Mr Ashley] could start by cutting his ties with Transline Group, who have not been candid or credible in their evidence to the BIS and, as we heard in our evidence sessions, have deducted money from low-paid workers without proper explanation or justification."
He added that the Newcastle United owner needed to fix poor contractual terms and make "a real improvement" to the working conditions of warehouse staff.
At the company's annual meeting last week, Sports Direct executives, including the billionaire owner, faced calls for widespread changes to the way the company is run.
Mr Ashley said he would walk away from the company if he failed to rectify it over the next 12 months.
In July, MPs accused the retailer of not treating its workers like humans and claimed its working practices were similar to those of a Victorian workhouse.
