Macclesfield boy, 13, died after tripping under runaway car, inquest hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 13-year-old boy was crushed after he tripped and fell beneath a runaway car after he released the handbrake, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kaden Gowers and his friend had been sitting in the front seats of the vehicle on St Austell Avenue, Macclesfield on 16 September last year.
Both boys jumped out but Kaden became "entangled" in the car's wheels.
Coroner Jean Harkin concluded he died through "misadventure" after releasing the handbrake.
His cause of death was recorded as acute asphyxia and acute chest compression.
The coroner praised the families for their strength.
A forensic police investigator told the hearing Kaden's friend may have tried to push him out of the way, but he tripped and fell under the moving car.
Paramedics were unable to revive him.
A vehicle inspector found the car and brakes were "serviceable".
