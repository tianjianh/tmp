England's Melissa Reid overcame illness to secure her card for next season's LPGA Tour by finishing joint eighth at Q-School at Daytona Beach in Florida.

The European Solheim Cup player, 29, missed out on the qualifying tournament in 2015 when her management team missed the application deadline.
Needing to finish in the top 20, Reid, whose mother died in a car crash in 2012, finished on eight under.
Suffering from a heavy cold, Reid said: "I'm just super, super relieved."
A five-time winner on the Ladies European Tour, she said she would have considered her future in golf had she failed to earn her card.
The world number 140, who carded rounds of 69, 64, 75, 72 and 72, is now expected to relocate to the United States and begin playing a full schedule on the LPGA Tour.
She added: "I'm hoping my life now is going to run a little bit smoother. Nothing worth having comes easy, does it?"
American Jaye Marie Green, 22, won the five-day qualifying event on 13 under.
