She was speaking after taking a boat ride across Valletta Harbour to the spot where George VI landed in 1943 to present the George Cross.
The Queen said any visit to Malta, where she lived with the Duke of Edinburgh for two years shortly after they married, is "always very special for me".
BBC's Nicholas Witchell reports.
