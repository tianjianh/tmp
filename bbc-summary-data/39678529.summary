Gareth Berg's brilliant all-round performance helped put Hampshire on top on day two against Yorkshire.

The all-rounder scored an unbeaten 99 to help the hosts post 455 before taking 4-32 to reduce Yorkshire to 128-6 at the close of play.
James Vince (147) was dismissed by Ben Coad (4-71), but Berg counter-attacked to extend the score from 302-7.
Berg then helped reduce Yorkshire to 46-5 - with new England Test captain Joe Root (8) among those removed.
Only Tykes skipper Gary Ballance (63 not out) provided resistance with the bat.
It was truly Berg's day, despite the 36-year-old ending Hampshire's innings stranded on 99 - one run short of only his third first-class hundred - and his first since 2011.
After Yorkshire's David Willey (2-86) had used the new ball to get rid of Lewis McManus and Liam Dawson in the space of three overs, Berg began to pick up his scoring with the tail.
He added 44 runs alongside Kyle Abbott (22) before Reece Topley and Brad Wheal frustrated the visiting attack, while Berg launched England leg spinner Adil Rashid for two sixes and eight fours to give his side a commanding first-innings total.
However, it was his efforts with the ball on a wicket that had previously looked flat that stood out, as he found enough movement on a nagging length to pin Alex Lees lbw, bowl Adam Lyth and have Root caught behind.
Abbott and Wheal then pinned Peter Handscomb and the returning Jonny Bairstow lbw, before Berg returned after Ballance had advanced the score to dismiss Tim Bresnan (21) caught behind.
Ballance and Rashid (16 not out) came together to stop the slide and reach the close without further damage but, with all their England stars in action, the 2014 and 2015 champions still endured a torrid day
Hampshire all-rounder Gareth Berg told BBC Radio Solent:
"We started the day wanting 500 and didn't get there but the last three partnerships amassed 153 runs, which is crucial in First Division cricket.
"I'm not bothered about my runs personally but to get those lower order runs puts other teams under pressure. I am still searching for that century but, if it comes, it comes.
"I had never bowled to Joe Root before but it was nice to bowl at him. He looked like he was scratching around and not sure what to do with me .
"So I just stuck to my guns and put it on the same spot every ball and hoped one would find the edge. It was great to see him walk back to the pavilion."
Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We started well to get the four wickets and then we let them off the hook. But fair play to Berg, He played well.
"Then this afternoon a couple of decisions didn't go our way but generally we were poor. It is definitely not a 128-6 pitch.
"The lads need to knuckle down and settle in and get the shine off the new ball and get some partnerships. Gary Ballance's form has been outstanding at the start of the season, since he took the captaincy,. He has shown he is a true leader on the field.
"Hampshire bowled well but we need to stand up and be better than that. We still back ourselves to get something from the game. We have been in similar positions and got something."
