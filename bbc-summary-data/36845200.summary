The 21-year-old has made 42 appearances for Saints since his debut in 2014 and will not be able to play against them in the Super 8s.
He will replace Danny Tickle in the Tigers squad following the back-row's switch to Leigh Centurions.
Savelio could make his Castleford debut in Sunday's all-Yorkshire game against Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.
"Andre has always caused us trouble when we have played against him in the past and I'm sure he will fit neatly into the way that we play," head coach Daryl Powell told the club website.
