A six-year-old girl who was murdered at her home on the Isle of Wight was a "precious child full of happiness", her mother has said.

Keziah Flux-Edmonds died in hospital after she was found unconscious near her father's body at a house in Cromwell Avenue, East Cowes on 1 June.
In a statement, her mother Nikki said: "Keziah was my entire world and losing her has made my world darker".
A post-mortem examination failed to establish a cause of death.
"She loved school and had many friends. It was said she was constantly smiling and was always busy, which earned her the nickname Bumblebee", Mrs Flux-Edmonds said.
"Her greatest desire was to sing Katy Perry's song, Roar, on Britain's Got Talent and she would practice every day so she would be perfect and wouldn't be buzzed off."
A post-mortem examination showed Keziah's father Darren Flux-Edmonds hanged himself.
Mrs Flux-Edmonds said she felt "truly blessed" to have had such a "special, beautiful girl" call her 'Mum'.
"Keziah was my entire world and losing her has made my world a darker place and has left a void that can never be filled", she said.
