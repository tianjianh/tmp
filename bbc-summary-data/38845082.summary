[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They are used to generate electricity but this wind turbine at Ballynahinch, County Down, sparked interest from a sharp-eyed snapper after appearing to keel over.

The cause of the damage to the turbine near Begny Hill Road is still to be established.
But the eagle-eyed photographer was at the scene to capture what happened.
It is understood the turbine had only been installed in the last few days, but was not in operation.
The NIdirect government website says it is best to position a turbine "high on a mast or tower, as wind speed increases with height".
It adds that the "ideal site is a hill with a flat, clear exposure, free from strong turbulence and obstructions like large trees, houses or other buildings".
