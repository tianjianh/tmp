Stuart Broad: England bowler tops ICC rankings for the first time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stuart Broad has become the first England player for 11 years to top the International Cricket Council's Test bowling rankings.

The 29-year-old took 6-17 in the second innings of the series-clinching third Test win over South Africa on Saturday.
The fast bowler climbs above India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and South Africa paceman Dale Steyn.
Steve Harmison, in 2004, was the last England bowler to top the ICC rankings, keeping top spot for 120 days.
Before that, Sir Ian Botham was ranked number one in 1980.
Listen to Jonathan Agnew and Michael Vaughan discuss Broad's six-wicket haul on BBC Radio 5 live.
Broad's new-ball partner James Anderson remains fifth, while Joe Root moves back up to second in the batting rankings after his first-innings century in Johannesburg.
Meanwhile, in the ICC Test Championship rankings, previous leaders South Africa will definitely surrender top spot to India, regardless of the result of the fourth Test against England at Centurion Park.
However, even if England win that match and seal a 3-0 series victory - their best result in South Africa for more than 100 years - they can not climb higher than their current fifth spot.
The team rankings will be updated at the end of the South Africa-England series.
