[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of historic images of south west Scotland have been made available online through a new website.

Dumfries and Galloway's Library and Archive Service has officially launched the service this week.
It contains images from amateur enthusiasts, local newspapers, aerial photographers, glass negatives and historical collections.
The site also contains video and audio clips and will be expanded in the weeks and months to come.
The View Dumfries and Galloway website hosts images of school classes, local farming life, street scenes and landscapes of the region.
Collection highlights include a postcard of the German air ship the Hindenberg over Drummore, the Lusitania off the coast of Galloway, the Queen Mother at Park Farm in Dumfries, JM Barrie with the cast of the Duke of Christmas Daisies and the Burns Statue inauguration in Dumfries in 1882.
The collection currently includes more than 3,500 images with photographs regularly added.
The library service hopes to encourage users to contact them via the website, with additional details on any of the images.
It said it would also welcome "any donations of photographs, cine or video with local content".
