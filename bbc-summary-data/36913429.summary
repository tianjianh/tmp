Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, with many rescued from rising waters and housed in shelters.
Nepal has suffered the highest death toll with over 75 people killed this week in floods and landslides.
Hundreds die every year across the region during the monsoon season between June and September.
In Nepal the army has been evacuating hundreds of people from villages submerged by rising flood waters, with western parts of the country worst hit.
Interior ministry officials say they fear the death toll could rise as information comes in from remote areas.
A spokesman, Yadav Prasad Koirala, told BBC Nepali that at least 12 people were missing as search and rescue efforts continued.
Across the border in India's Bihar state, 22 people have died in heavy flooding and over 1.5 million people have been directly affected, with disaster response teams shifting many to safer places.
In the north-eastern tea growing state of Assam a further 1.6 million people have been affected with at least 16 people losing their lives and over 100,000 sheltering in  472 relief camps.
Vast areas of farmland and roads have been submerged along with several of the states' wild life sanctuaries where animals have sought safety on higher ground.
Several rivers, including the Brahmaputra, are flowing dangerously above their normal level or have burst their banks.
Downstream across the border in Bangladesh, the Kurigram and Jamalpur districts have taken the worst hit from the flooding.
The Bangladesh Disaster Management Bureau says that around 1.5 million people have been affected, more than a third of that number in Kurigram district alone.
The authorities have set up 70 shelter areas for those evacuated or fleeing.  Eleven people have died in the last few days, the bureau says.
In Pakistan heavy rain and flash floods have killed at least 22 people in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces, the county's Dawn newspaper reported.
At least 58 people died in northern Pakistan and India as a result of flash floods and landslides at the beginning of this month with Pakistan's Chitral district worst hit alongside India's Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh states.
