[SN]TITLE[SN]
Methodist minister John Price denies hypnotising boys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Methodist minister accused of indecently assaulting four boys has denied hypnotising them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Price, 82, of Ash Tree Close, Bedale, North Yorkshire is alleged to have tried to put the boys into a trance before molesting them.
The defendant denies 13 charges dating from the 1970s and 80s when he worked in York and Pocklington, East Yorkshire.
Mr Price told Teesside Crown Court he had done nothing to be ashamed of.

The court earlier heard the alleged victims, then aged between 11 and 17, would be offered hypnosis to help with stress and pain before being assaulted.
Giving evidence, Mr Price said he did not know how to hypnotise anybody and denied ever saying he had the ability.
He added he "only very vaguely" remembered the boys and denied any of the alleged abuse had taken place.
During cross-examination the defendant was asked about a conviction from 1999 involving a 14-year-old boy.
Paul Newcombe, prosecuting, read extracts from a newspaper article on the case but Mr Price insisted it was not true.
Mr Newcombe said: "So, the jury in the case that we are reading about got it wrong?"
Mr Price replied: "That is my belief."
Later, Mr Price would say of the alleged victims: "I did nothing to them for which I would be ashamed."
Mr Newcome replied: "Probably the reason you felt no shame is because you were, and remain, a paedophile."
Mr Price replied: "That's your opinion but it's not true."
The trial continues.
