The 28-year-old, who was a free agent after leaving the Seasiders this summer, has signed a one-year contract.
The former Spain Under-21 international scored one goal in 73 appearances during three years with Blackpool.
Martinez, who has had spells with Espanyol and Girona, is reunited with Millwall manager Ian Holloway, whom he played under at Bloomfield Road.
"I have stayed in touch with Ian Holloway since he left Blackpool, and for me he is a special manager," Martinez told the Millwall website.
"We had a great season there when we reached the Championship play-off final at Wembley [in 2011-12] and I hope we can have success here too."
