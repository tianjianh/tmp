Gloucestershire's Police and Crime Commissioner has announced the biggest re-organisation of policing in the county in 40 years.

Martin Surl said the force would look smaller in the future with changes being brought in ahead of expected budget cuts.
A single neighbourhood command is to replace six existing policing areas.
PCSOs will start to be deployed beyond their own neighbourhood policing area if they are the nearest resource.
Mr Surl, who unveiled the changes, said: "I have to say that when I took office some aspects of the constabulary were not in a great shape in Gloucestershire.
"Now, the organisation is far more stable than it was. Even though the financial picture is tricky, we know where we are and our books balance.
"I'm not worried about it unduly. So I think we have managed to consolidate some of the gains we've made and can look forward to the future".
Chief Constable Suzette Davenport said: "We need to improve public satisfaction and confidence in our force and ensure we can deliver the quality service we aspire to provide.
"A new way of working is a crucial means for us to deliver this aspiration."
The first changes, which were announced following a two-year review of the force's operating methods, are expected to take place early in the new year.
