Aldershot Town 1-1 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot's National League play-off hopes were put back in the balance after a disappointing draw at home to relegation-threatened Torquay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aman Verma missed a good early chance to put the away side one up, slicing wide from a good position.
Ruairi Keating, however, did break the deadlock for the Gulls. His slide-rule finish in the 33rd minute came after a fortuitous build-up in which a through ball deflected into his path.
In the second half, Kevin Nicholson's men dropped deeper and deeper and paid the price when Kundai Benyu bent in a fine 76th-minute equaliser from a free-kick.
Two injuries saw the match staggered into 13 minutes of stoppage time, but at 17:05 BST honours were finally shared as Aldershot saw their four-match winning streak ended.
