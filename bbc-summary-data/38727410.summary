The Bully Wee's chances of progressing to a fifth-round tie away to Ayr United looked slim when Blair Henderson scored an early penalty for the Binos.
But Gormley levelled with a 20-yard beauty, tapped in a second and smashed a third into the roof of the net.
Clyde goalkeeper John Gibson was sent off after conceding a second penalty late on, which Henderson scored.
It led to a frantic ending with a few goalmouth scrambles that almost brought a Stirling equaliser, but Gormley's haul proved enough.
It was a 35-minute hat-trick for the striker who is now up to nine goals this season, he nearly added a fourth but for a good save by Stirling's Chris Smith early in the second half.
Albion got their penalty when Gibson felled Liam Caddis and it was calmly despatched by Henderson for his ninth of the campaign, with the keeper booked.
Stirling are managed by 2014 Scottish Cup winner Dave Mackay, whose team-mate at St Johnstone that day, Frazer Wright, is now at the heart of the Binos' defence.
He could do nothing about the lethal right-footed strike by Gormley that went in off the underside of the bar to equalise.
The former Ayr striker's second was completely the opposite, being in the right place to finish off Peter MacDonald's effort that came off the inside of the post and trickled along the line.
MacDonald also created Gormley's third, finding the forward who then faked a left-foot shot before turning on to his right and smashing high into the net.
Gibson received a second yellow for bringing down Darren Smith, which allowed Henderson to score another from the spot.
Clyde manager Barry Ferguson: "Just getting the win was the important thing. I thought we were magnificent in the first half. We thoroughly deserve to go through.
"I'm delighted for [David Gormley]. He was different class. He was great. Everybody, to a man, they were great.
"They [Ayr] are a Championship team. They'll be overwhelming favourites. We'll go down and have a go at them."
