Yellow car owners have rallied in support of a vehicle blamed for ruining tourists' photographs in a picturesque Cotswold village.

A convoy of 100 cars has driven through Bibury in an act of solidarity towards Vauxhall Corsa owner Peter Maddox, 84.
Mr Maddox has come under fire for parking his car outside his cottage in Arlington Row.
Tourists have complained that it "ruins" the view and, earlier this year, the vehicle was vandalised.
Hundreds of yellow car owners applied to join the drive-through, which had a set limit of 100 cars for safety.
Organiser Matty Bee, from Coventry, said it was "a celebration of anything yellow".
He added: "The response has been amazing and overwhelming; people from all over the country and all over the world have applied to join the group.
"We've had everything here from a three-wheeler and a Mini to a Lamborghini super car...I've never seen so many yellow coloured cars in one place."
Mr Maddox, who watched the convoy as it drove past his cottage, said he was "overwhelmed" by the show of support for his yellow car.
Bibury, near Cirencester, was once described by William Morris as "the most beautiful village in England".
The National Trust owns the 17th Century cottages of Arlington Row, which are featured on the inside cover of the British passport and are some of the most photographed dwellings in the country.
Complaints about Mr Maddox's car began in 2015 after Lee McCallum posted a picture of the car with the comment: "Picture postcard street photobombed by ugly little yellow car."
Numerous visitors then took to Twitter claiming it "ruins" the view and is a "shot spoiler".
In February, vandals scratched the word 'move' into the car's bonnet, damaged panels and smashed its windows - causing approximately Â£6,000 of damage.
At the time, a defiant Mr Maddox said that if it was too expensive to repair the car he would buy a replacement - in lime green.
