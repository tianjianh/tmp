Future of subsidised Cardiff-Anglesey flight under review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Subsidised flights between Cardiff and Anglesey could be under threat after a review into the route's viability was ordered by the Welsh Government.

The controversial service was launched in 2007 and has received about Â£1m of public money annually.
It was found to be underperforming in a 2014 report, and operator LinksAir had its safety licence revoked last year.
Welsh Tories said the service, which has lost passengers, should end if the review finds it is not cost-effective.
Figures obtained by the party have suggested the number of passengers on the service have fallen in recent months.
Some 8,937 passengers used it from September 2015 to August 2016, compared to 11,111 in September 2014 to August 2015, according to information provided by Economy Minister Ken Skates to Tory AM Darren Millar.
The Clwyd West AM said: "If the Welsh Government's review of this service can't prove that the route can be cost-effective in the long run then it should be scrapped.
"Right now it seems that the only people who benefit from it are civil servants and politicians.
"Perhaps the millions which have been spent on the air link would be better spent improving the road and rail network in north Wales."
Van Air has operated the service since being awarded the contract in February following the Civil Aviation Authority's decision to revoke LinksAir's safety licence in October 2015.
A spokeswoman for the Welsh Government, which owns Cardiff Airport, said: "Once that review has been completed, the cabinet secretary [Mr Skates] will consider its findings."
She added: "The study commissioned with external aviation specialists will consider the future viability of the air service.
"It will consider the impact/assessment of ceasing all provision; reducing frequency of flights; using alternative airports; and maintaining the status quo.
"It will include passenger forecast data for all options and will build upon the external review of the PSO [public service obligation] undertaken in 2014."
