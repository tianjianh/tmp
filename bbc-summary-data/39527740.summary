The Glasgow-based owner of outdoor clothing brand Trespass has reported an increase in sales and profits.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacobs & Turner said turnover grew by 8.2% to £95.1m in the 12 months to last June, following expansion of its retail operations in the UK and Europe.
Pre-tax profit was also up, from about £1.9m in 2015 to more than £4.6m.
In accounts filed with Companies House, the firm said investment it had undertaken in the last two years was "now bearing fruit".
It added: "Despite the uncertainty surrounding the UK's decision to leave the EU, and the weakening of sterling which will have a direct impact on the group's purchasing power, the directors remain positive and are satisfied that with continued investment in our staff and systems, the group can look forward to a healthy future with increased profitability in the coming years."
