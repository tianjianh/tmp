Investigation after Glasgow bin lorry 'breaks rules'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation has been launched after a Glasgow bin lorry was driven up a steep road in the city centre, in contravention of a weight restriction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-tonne vehicle went up Garnet Street on Friday, which has a weight limit of 3.5 tonnes, while collecting rubbish in the Garnethill area.
Glasgow City Council has apologised for the incident.
The scene was about one mile from where a council bin lorry crashed on 22 December 2014, killing six people.
