When Private James McLaughlin lost his life during World War One there was no funeral, no memorial service and it is not even known where his body is.

He was killed in action on 9 January 1917 fighting Turkish soldiers in Mesopotamia, in what is now known as Iraq.
He left behind a baby daughter who never knew him.
His grandchildren were determined that the sacrifice of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment soldier should not be forgotten, so held a remembrance service at Preston Minster 100 years after his death.
