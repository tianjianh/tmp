Wild boar numbers in the Forest of Dean have nearly doubled since 2013 despite an increase in the number culled, according to the Forestry Commission.

Results of an annual thermal imaging survey estimate the population is now more than 1,000 animals.
The commission carries out a yearly cull in a bid to limit numbers to an agreed population of 400 animals.
In 2012 the cull was suspended over concerns the numbers were too low and the species could be eradicated.
The Forestry Commission said there were an estimated 535 animals in spring 2013, 819 in spring 2014 and 1,018 in spring 2015.
This is despite 135 animals being shot in 2013/14 and 361 in 2014/15.
Deputy surveyor for the Forest of Dean, Kevin Stannard, said: "Our long-term aim of managing the population of boar to maintain a thriving population of around 400 animals on the forest has not changed.
"The most recent survey results are disappointing in so far as they show a further population growth at a time when we also achieved a significant increase in the cull.
"It remains our intention in the short-term to stop the population from increasing, and then to bring that population back to a level where the boar can live in harmony with our community and in balance with our rich woodland ecology."
