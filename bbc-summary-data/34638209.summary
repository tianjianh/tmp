Hamilton won his third championship with victory at Sunday's US Grand Prix to draw level with racing greats Sir Jackie Stewart and Ayrton Senna.
Mansell believes that fellow Briton Hamilton, 30, is "untouchable".
"Lewis is hot favourite for the 2016 and even the 2017 championship," Mansell told BBC Radio 5 live.
German driver Schumacher's record title haul included five back-to-back titles between 2000 and 2004.

Mansell added: "In the present day, no one can touch Lewis. He deserves every accolade. There will be jealousy that he is in the best team.
"It is the start of even bigger and better things to come. I would say [to Hamilton]: Focus on Michael Schumacher's record.
