"Scotland have not lost for six games and are a strong team with a fighting spirit," said the forward.
"They close down spaces quickly and so we will need patience and to be much better than against Argentina."
The Borussia Dortmund star is back in the national side after missing the World Cup through injury and played the full game as Germany crashed to an emphatic defeat in Dusseldorf - their first match since becoming world champions.
Scotland go into the match having won four and drawn two of their last six internationals.
"We need to be more effective in front of goal," Reus added.
"Scotland are strong, they have a leader in Darren Fletcher, they are very quick in attack. What is needed from us is patience and we are fully aware of that."
Joachim Low's side were woeful in defence against Argentina but Jerome Boateng is back in time for Sunday's clash, assistant boss Andreas Kopke revealed.
"These last two days will show what changes or if any there will be in defence," Kopke told Reuters.
"Jerome will return and some things will change but who will be on the left or on the right is something I cannot say just now."
