Snooker's governing body, the WPBSA, opened an investigation after Fernandez lost 10-4 to Gary Wilson in qualifying for this year's World Championship.
Fernandez first turned professional in 1995 and has one non-ranking title win.
Meanwhile, England's Matthew Selt has been banned for two tournaments after he was ruled to have brought the game into disrepute on social media.
Selt, the world number 25, was reported by a member of the public after he "posted messages on social media that were offensive", according to a WPBSA statement.
The 31-year-old has been banned from the Riga Masters in Latvia in June and August's Paul Hunter Classic in Furth, Germany, although he has until 10 June to appeal.
"Matthew Selt put forward a defence that was not accepted by the committee," the statement added.
"The committee took into account that he had been previously warned about his posts on social media and reminded of the social media guidelines."
Regarding the suspension of 39-year-old Fernandez, the WPBSA said suspicious betting patterns were reported following his match against Wilson at the World Championship Qualifiers at Ponds Forge on 6 April.
Fernandez faces a formal hearing in front of a WPBSA disciplinary committee on a date to be determined. Wilson is not under investigation.
"The available evidence has been considered and in accordance with the disciplinary rules, [it has been] decided that there is a case for Leo Fernandez to answer in relation to a breach of the WPBSA members' rules, betting rules," a statement read.
Fernandez has been an intermittent presence on the professional tour over the years. He returned in 2015 to compete at Q School but failed to regain a tour place.
