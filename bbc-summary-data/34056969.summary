St Johnstone have signed Celtic right-back Darnell Fisher on loan for the rest of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Englishman, 21, has made 19 first-team appearances since making his Celtic debut in 2013.
Fisher started his youth career with Farnborough before joining Celtic in 2011.
"Everyone at Celtic wishes Darnell all the best for the season ahead with St Johnstone," Celtic said on their website.
He joins Saints after centre-half Frazer Wright, 35 left the Perth club, bringing to an end his four-year spell at McDiarmid Park.
