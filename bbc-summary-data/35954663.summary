Chelsea were only 1-0 up at the break, but scored three goals in the final five minutes for a 6-0 victory.
Katie McCabe scored the winning penalty for the Gunners after their 2-2 draw.
Sunderland beat Reading and Manchester City saw off third-tier side Sporting Club Albion to reach the last four.
Chelsea had to be patient against Aston Villa before a late flurry gave the cup holders a resounding win at Wheatsheaf Park.
The Blues hit the woodwork three times in the opening 22 minutes, twice through Ji and once through Karen Carney.
Drew Spence's fine turn and half-volley finally rewarded the home pressure and Ji, the scorer of last season's winner in the Wembley final against Notts County, made it 2-0 in the second half after some great build-up play by England forwards Fran Kirby and Gemma Davison.
Kirby slotted a third with just under 25 minutes left and a double from Ji and Eni Aluko's chipped finish sealed the win.
Nikita Parris scored one goal and helped create the other as early WSL 1 leaders Manchester City got past Sporting Club Albion, who were the lowest-ranked side left in the competition.
An attempted clearance from Natalie Poole was deflected in off Parris for the opener and, after the striker had a shot saved on 22 minutes, Jane Ross pounced on the rebound for City's second.
Parris, Lucy Bronze and Steph Houghton had efforts cleared off the line, while Trina Greaves went closest for the visitors, hitting the crossbar with nine minutes remaining.
Arsenal needed penalties to beat Notts County's 10 players and reach the last four after a thrilling draw.
Former England striker Kelly Smith put the home side ahead with a superb half-volley, but Notts levelled when Sophie Bradley-Auckland glanced in Dani Buet's free-kick.
Buet's cross led to Aivi Luik bundling in the visitors' second as Arsenal appealed for a foul on Sari van Veenendaal.
Notts had England forward Ellen White sent off for a second caution for kicking the ball away and the Gunners, who had two strong penalty claims waved away, made it 2-2 through Natalia Pablos Sanchon's header.
A goalless 30 minutes of extra-time led to penalties, with McCabe's strike proving decisive after goalkeepers Van Veenendaal and Carly Telford had both saved two spot-kicks.
Last season's leading WSL 1 scorer Beth Mead helped send Sunderland through to the last four, with the opening goal against fellow top-flight side Reading.
Close-range finishes from Mead and Victoria Williams put the hosts 2-0 up at the break.
While Nia Jones and Helen Ward threatened for the Royals, Brooke Chaplen added a late third to complete a comfortable win.
