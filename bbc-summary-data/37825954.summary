Severn Valley Railway launches £2.5m share scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A heritage railway has launched a £2.5m share scheme to help fund a revamp.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bosses at the Severn Valley Railway, which runs between Shropshire and Worcestershire, are offering shares in the attraction for £1 each.
Money raised will be used to restore and conserve the station at Bridgnorth, which dates back to 1862.
A similar scheme in 2012 raised more than £2m and enabled the attraction to buy extra land, improve carriages and update track.
The shares will be available for one year.
None of the shares pay dividends but people who buy them receive travel benefits on the railway depending on how many they have.
As well as the station restoration, the project will include a new 1900-style toilet building, changes to the pub, the relocation of a shop and the installation of a turntable in a locomotive yard.
Attraction manager Nick Ralls said: "The £2.5m target is ambitious but we understand appetite for the Bridgnorth development is extremely strong among existing supporters and we expect this offer to reach new audiences too."
Major ground works are due to begin later this month with building due to start in 2017.
