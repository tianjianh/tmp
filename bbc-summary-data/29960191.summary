[SN]TITLE[SN]
NW Bicester homes plans submitted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning applications for a 3,500-home development in Bicester have been submitted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A2Dominion proposes to build on 509 acres (205 hectares).
A spokesman said all the feedback from the public about the scheme had been "received and considered".
The housing developer wants to build the properties north of Lords Lane and Howes Lane in the Oxfordshire town. Of the new homes, 30% will be affordable housing.
About 200 people attended two public exhibitions of the plans in Pioneer Square over the summer, but only 28 responses were received. The developer said more than half supported the proposals.
Louise Caves, strategic partnership manager, said: "Respondents prioritised the delivery of a health centre followed by a primary school as the most important facilities to be delivered first in a new community.
"A2Dominion is taking these responses into consideration when developing its detailed planning applications."
The firm is also working with Cherwell District Council and Oxfordshire County Council on a separate planning application for Howes Lane to create a north-west Bicester link road.
The district council is expected to make a decision on the applications in January.
