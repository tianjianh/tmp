Former Swansea City manager John Toshack has been impressed by the club's progress under Garry Monk.

In Monk's first full season since succeeding Michael Laudrup, the Swans claimed a club Premier League record 56 points and highest finish of eighth.
Toshack, 66, who led Swansea out of the old Fourth Division to the top of the First Division in four seasons, has been taken aback by Monk's impact.
"It surprised me to be honest with you," said Toshack.
Former club captain Monk, 36, had no previous managerial experience when he replaced Dane Laudrup in February 2014.
The former Southampton defender secured Premier League safety within months of taking over and was appointed on a permanent basis in May 2014.
Swansea achieved their highest ever number of points in the Premier League in Monk's first full season as a manager.
Toshack, who coached Real Madrid in two separate periods and also managed Wales twice, says Monk has exceeded expectations.
"At the moment Garry's done everything right and I've been impressed with him," Toshack added.
"He obviously knows the club very well from being in it for 10 years.
"He's done better than probably than anybody could have thought."
