Police closed roads around the North and South Bays over the weekend because of high tides and waves on the road.
North Yorkshire Police tweeted: "Stay away from the sea! A wave caused damage to this vehicle and an injury to the 3 y/o child! Thanks to @YorksAmbulance & @RNLIScarborough".
The girl was treated in hospital for minor facial cuts.
Police were called to the incident in Marine Drive at 16:24 GMT.
Flood warnings were issued for Marine Drive, Royal Albert Drive and the Spa in Scarborough, and in Bridlington for the North Pier and Harbour, because of "overtopping and spray expected due to strong winds and large waves".
