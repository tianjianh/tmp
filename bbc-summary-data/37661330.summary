Tomlinson's Dairies' Minera expansion given green light

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a multi-million pound expansion to a Wrexham dairy, creating 60 new jobs, have been given the go ahead by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A council report said the Â£14m expansion was needed as Tomlinson's Dairies at Minera had outgrown its facilities.
The company plans to double its production to 195 million litres of milk a year.
Wrexham councillors approved the plans on Friday.
The dairy business currently employs about 170 staff and uses milk from 71 farms across the area.
The business was established in 1983 by brothers Philip and John Tomlinson, expanding from a doorstep round using milk from the family dairy farm at Minera.
Wrexham councillors held a site visit to consider concerns about the scale of the development and its effect on local roads, before making a final decision.
Three planning applications for a three-phase development were approved during the meeting at the Guildhall.
