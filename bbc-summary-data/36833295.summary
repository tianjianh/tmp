Ascensos, which was set up in Motherwell in 2013 and already employs 400 staff, is opening a new facility in Clydebank.
The move will allow it to raise its workforce to 750 initially and next year to 1,000.
The contract involves providing telephone, email and web services.
This work will begin from October 2016. Ascensos already provides support to Kingfisher Group-owned B&Q's social media activity.
John Devlin, managing director of Ascensos, said: "We have established a great relationship with Kingfisher Group and we look forward to building on this and creating a world-class facility for B&Q, their customers and our team in Clydebank.
"Ascensos has grown quickly in the last two years and this expansion in Clydebank starts another key chapter in our success story."
Tibor Szabo, head of customer services at B&Q, said: "The warmth and positive spirit of Glaswegians has been an important consideration in choosing Ascensos and the location to take our customer call centre forward.
"We are delighted to be expanding the work Ascensos is already doing to support our social media channels."
Ascensos also has contracts with Karen Millen, Argos, Oasis and Scottish Power.
