Paris Cowan-Hall gave Wycombe a deserved first-half lead but a failure to convert their other chances threatened to haunt them when Gareth Evans levelled for Pompey on 47 minutes.
But the Chairboys' burly striker, nicknamed 'The Beast', booked their place in the second-round draw with a looping late header.
Wycombe were good value for their half-time lead and fired a couple of warning shots across Pompey's bows before Cowan-Hall gave them the lead.
On 16 minutes, Matt Bloomfield cleverly allowed the ball to run across his body and created space to crack a left-footed shot against the post from 20 yards and four minutes later Cowan-Hall broke clear on the left and his angled shot was kept out by keeper David Forde's legs.
But Forde was found wanting on 26 minutes when he miscued his punch as a free-kick was fired into a crowded goalmouth and the ball broke to Cowan-Hall, who nodded into the unguarded net against the club where he began his career.
Pompey failed to get a shot on target in a lukewarm first-half performance and Chairboys keeper Jamal Blackman was only called into action to dive at Noel Hunt's feet as he chased a through ball from Milan Lalkovic.
Within two minutes of the restart Pompey were level when Enda Stevens broke down the left and his inviting cross was met with a crisp first-time finish by Gareth Evans.
Pompey pressed to settle the tie at the first time of asking and substitute Carl Baker's powerful effort produced a stunning save from Blackman, while at the other end Forde arched up to tip Wycombe sub Myles Weston's chip over the bar.
