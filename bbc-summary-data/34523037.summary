Former British number one Laura Robson will not play again this year as she continues her recovery from injury.

The world number 547 returned to competition at Eastbourne in June after 17 months out with a wrist injury.
She has played just 10 matches, winning three, since then and last featured at an ITF event in Monterrey a month ago.
"Laura's team decided it was most effective for her to spend her time training for the rest of the year," the 21-year-old's management company said.
Robson received a wildcard entry to Wimbledon after her return but lost 6-4 6-4 to Evgeniya Rodina in the first round.
Her first win in almost two years came at a Challenger event - a level below the WTA tour - in Canada the following month.
She went on to suffer a first-round exit at the US Open last month, losing 3-6 6-3 7-5 to Russian Elena Vesnina.
Robson will be able to use her protected ranking of 58 to enter January's Australian Open.
Protected rankings are given to players suffering long-term injuries - 58 was Robson's position after the 2014 Australian Open.
