Kevin Bollaert of San Diego created the UGotPosted.com website that let people post explicit pictures of their former partners.
Pictures were posted without victims' consent and Bollaert charged up to $350 (Â£235) to get photos removed.
Bollaert was convicted in February on 21 counts of ID theft and six of extortion.
Eight women testified in court in San Diego about the harassment they had suffered as a result of images being uploaded to Bollaert's website by their former partners.
One victim said she suffered a "daily struggle" to re-build her life after pictures of her were put on the site. Others needed counselling to recover or were forced to leave college or work. About 10,000 images were put on the site while it was operating between December 2012 and September 2013.
As well as receiving a lengthy jail term, Bollaert must pay $15,000 in restitution to victims and also pay a $10,000 fine. Bollaert is believed to have made at least $30,000 from people who paid to have pictures removed.
"Sitting behind a computer, committing what is essentially a cowardly and criminal act, will not shield predators from the law or jail," California Attorney General Kamala Harris said in a statement.
Another operator of a revenge porn site is also due to be sentenced shortly. Hunter Moore, who created the IsAnyoneUp website, pleaded guilty in February to charges of hacking and identity theft. When sentenced, he will face a jail term of between two and seven years and will have to pay a hefty fine.
