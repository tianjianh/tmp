West Midlands: Three things you wanted to know

You wanted to know how Battlefield Lane in Wombourne, Staffordshire got its name.
You asked if the missing train track on the Honeybourne line in Warwickshire would be reinstated.
And you wondered why 'duck' is used as a greeting in Stoke-on-Trent. Here is a look at how we got on answering your questions.
Hilary Moore, clerk to Wombourne Parish Council, sent us an excerpt from the Black Country Bugle in which various theories are considered.
She said: "A number of sites have been put forward for the Battle of Tettenhall, including Wednesfield and Wombourne.
"It is generally believed that a battle took place in Wombourne as part of the 910 AD campaign, hence the local names of Battlefield Terrace, Battlefield Hill."
The six miles of missing track would link Stratford-upon-Avon with Long Marston which, campaigners say, could help ease congestion and improve links to London and Birmingham.
Fraser Pithie, from the Shakespeare Line Promotion Group  said a consultation on Stratford's future transport needs, which ends today, ignores the potential benefits of reinstating the line.
The councillor in charge of transport in Warwickshire, Peter Butlin, said the re-opening of the line would cost around Â£100m and isn't something they could consider without the support of central government and Network Rail.
We posed this question back in 2005 when we spoke to Steve Birks, a chronicler of the city.
He said firstly the word "duck" - a term of greeting, for man or woman - has nothing at all to do with the winged bird of the same name.
According to Mr Birks, it is said to find its origin in the Saxon word 'ducas' which was meant as a term of respect; similar to the Middle English 'duc' or 'duk' which denotes a leader or commander.
From those origins we also get the title 'Duke' and the Old French word 'ducheÃ©' - the territory ruled by a Duke - as well as the Stokie greeting.
