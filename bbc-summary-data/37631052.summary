Detectives said it was "too early to say exactly what has happened".
Det Ch Insp Nicki Miller said: "[This] should serve as a timely reminder to people and I would encourage parents to remind their children that they should not talk to people they don't know.
"If they are approached by someone who they are unsure about they should alert their parents who in turn should contact the police if there are genuine concerns about them."
