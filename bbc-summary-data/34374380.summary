[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barbara Windsor herds sheep over London Bridge for charity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Actress Barbara Windsor has herded a flock of sheep across London Bridge - exercising her ancient 'right' as a Freeman of the City of London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Windsor, 78, was taking part in a tradition which is thought to date back to the 13th century.
Organisers hope the Great Sheep Drive of London Bridge will raise Â£40,000 for charity.
It will be split between the Lord Mayor's Appeal and the Worshipful Company of Woolmen.
The former EastEnders actress, who was made a freeman in 2010, said: "Everyone jokes about me exercising my right to drive sheep across London Bridge, but I never thought I would actually achieve it.
"As a London tradition, it's a spectacle in its own right.
"But more important than that is the generosity of those taking part in raising so much money for London's good causes."
The Freedom of the City of London is believed to have started in 1237 and enabled recipients to carry out their trade.
