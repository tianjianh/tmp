Ricky Miller's calm one-on-one finish seemed set to earn Dover a shock replay victory over their League Two visitors.
However, Mark Roberts shot home in the 90th minute to force the extra period.
A stunning Aswad Thomas volley restored the hosts' lead, but Leon Legge levelled and late goals by Medy Elito and Ben Williamson sealed victory.
Defender Legge converted a Roberts cross with 10 minutes remaining to make it 2-2 and, after Elito fired in a third away goal, Williamson's solo effort sealed a second-round tie against Coventry in the 121st minute of a pulsating match.
