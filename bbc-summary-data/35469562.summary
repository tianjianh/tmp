It can only be The Super Bowl.
Originally an opportunity for reporters to interview players and coaches, 'media day' has morphed into a prime-time money-spinner in America, aka 'Opening Night'.
And the build-up to Sunday's NFL showpiece between the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers started in surreal style as around 200 TV cameras from across the globe turned up in San Jose...
"It's all in preparation, folks," the Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton told a crowd of reporters at Monday's event.
Tipped as the new 'face' of the NFL, Newton added: "My father taught me proper preparation prevents poor performances. Those are the words that I live by, especially in big moments."
All lenses and microphones pointed to Peyton Manning when the Denver Broncos quarterback arrived.
Rumours have been circulating about the possibility of the five-time most valuable player retiring, but he remained coy on his future during interviews in San Jose.
"I haven't made up my mind, but I don't see myself knowing that until after the season," said the 39-year-old, who will be the oldest quarterback to play in a Super Bowl.
"Whatever cliche you want to use, I kind of stay in the moment and focus on the task at hand and just deal with this week. That's what I've done all season."
