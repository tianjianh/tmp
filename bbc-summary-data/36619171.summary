Joshua Webb and Jamie Cobain are added to Killie's defensive options, as are loan arrivals Jonathan Burn, Mark Waddington and William Boyle.
Jordan Jones and Martin Smith are midfielders, while goalkeeper Oliver Davies returns for a second loan spell.
Strikers Souleymane Coulibaly and Flo Bojaj have also been recruited.
Meanwhile, Kilmarnock have announced that Miles Addison, who joined on a short-term deal in March, will sign a new three-year contract next week.
Four of the 11 new signings are compatriots of the English defender.
Manager Lee Clark, who took charge of Kilmarnock in February, told BBC Scotland: "I knew what I wanted and I've been working since the day I came through the door.
"These boys have been on my radar for a long time and I got them into the club to look at them and let the other staff look at them as well.
"They've had interest from other clubs, but because we've had them in and around the club, they've wanted to be apart of it."
Clark has returned to his former club, Huddersfield Town, to loan Kosovo-born striker Bojaj and left-sided central defender Boyle, with the 20-year-old pair signed to be with the Scottish Premiership club initially until January.
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner told his club website: "This is a great opportunity for Flo and William to go and play regular senior football at a good level."
Bojaj made eight substitute appearances for the Championship club last season, while Boyle has previously been on loan to Macclesfield Town, Kidderminster Harriers and, last season, York City.
The 21-year-old Coulibaly, a star at the 2011 Under-17 World Cup for Ivory Coast, arrives from Peterborough United and ended last season on loan at Newport County, scoring once in six appearances.
McFadzean, the oldest of the signings at 22, has been capped by Scotland at under-21 level and spent four years with the Blades but only featured twice for them last season and last played on loan to Stevenage in January.
Cobain, 19, arrives from Newcastle United, with former England Under-18 right-back Webb, 20, released by Aston Villa.
Clark, a former Newcastle player, has picked up winger Jones, 21, who played once on loan to Cambridge United last season, and Smith, 20, who had spells with Gateshead and Carlisle United, from Middlesbrough and Sunderland, respectively.
Of the loan signings, Welshman Davies, 21, returns from Swansea City to provide back-up for Jamie MacDonald.
Davies did not feature for Killie last term, with a shoulder injury curtailing his stay at Rugby Park.
Burn, 20, arrives from Middlesbrough having been on loan at Oldham Athletic last season, and Waddington, 19, from Stoke City.
