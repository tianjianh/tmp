[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury's impressive start to the season continued as they beat Rochdale to make it three wins out of three in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stefan Payne grabbed the winner for Paul Hurst's side just a day after signing from Barnsley.
The hosts started brightly with Jon Nolan firing just wide early on, but Rochdale took the lead with a 17th-minute penalty confidently converted by Steve Davies after Toto Nsiala upended Bradden Inman.
Shrewsbury responded positively and referee Andy Haines pointed to the spot for a second time on the half-hour mark, Shaun Whalley picking himself up to slot home a penalty after being brought down by Oliver Rathbone.
Shrewsbury moved ahead three minutes later when Alex Rodman's fine run and cross from the left was volleyed in from close range by Norwich loanee Carlton Morris.
Rochdale keeper Brendan Moore also saved twice from Louis Dodds and Morris as Shrewsbury looked the more dangerous side, although Davies did go close at the other end.
Rochdale pulled level in the 63rd minute, Davies again scoring from the penalty spot after the referee spotted a handball.
But Shrewsbury were determined to maintain their 100% start and in the 74th minute substitute Payne burst through to fire high into the net.
