Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick as Real Madrid thrashed Espanyol to cut the gap between themselves and La Liga leaders Barcelona to four points.

Real scored three goals in the first 16 minutes, with Karim Benzema heading the first from a James Rodriguez cross.
Ronaldo then added a penalty before Rodriguez scored with a deflected shot.
Ronaldo made it 4-0 by half-time with a fizzing effort before completing his hat-trick with a header, which was followed by a Oscar Duarte own goal.
With Rodriguez filling in for the injured Gareth Bale in Real's front three, Espanyol were ripped apart.
Ronaldo was the star as he moved level with Barcelona's Luis Suarez - on 19 goals - in the race to be La Liga's leading scorer.
It was a testing debut for Espanyol's new goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis, signed on loan from Watford during the week.
The Lithuania international faced England in a Euro 2016 qualifier in October, but his only previous start at club level this season was for the Hornets in a Capital One Cup defeat at Preston in August.
Arlauskis saved well from Ronaldo's early free-kick and could not be blamed for Real's three quick goals.
He also got a hand to Ronaldo's shot for his second goal, but the Portugal international's dazzling footwork deserved reward as he bamboozled the visiting defence to create space to score.
The goal rout ended when Costa Rica international Duarte turned Jese's low cross into his own net.
Both teams are in La Liga action next Sunday, with Real Madrid visiting relegation-threatened Granada, while Espanyol host Real Sociedad.
