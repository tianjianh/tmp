The central midfielder, 27, who has 107 international caps, will join the Women's Super League One outfit from Norwegian club Avaldsnes on 1 January.
She reached the Women's Champions League semi-finals with German side Turbine Potsdam in 2013-14, before a spell with Swedish side Goteborg.
"To sign Maren is a real statement of intent from the club," manager Emma Hayes told Chelsea's club website.
"We have been looking for a player that brings leadership and experience to the group and she fits the bill perfectly."
Mjelde added: "The project that the club and Emma are working on is hugely exciting. This is an important stage of my career and I needed a new challenge after a successful season in Norway.
"I want to win trophies and improve as a player and believe I can do that at Chelsea."
Chelsea finished second in the English top flight in 2016 and reached the Women's FA Cup final, after winning the double in 2015.
