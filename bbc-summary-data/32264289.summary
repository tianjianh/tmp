[SN]TITLE[SN]
Consultation launched over Daventry 'no bag' dog poo fine proposals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public consultation over plans to fine dog walkers up to £1,000 if they are caught without a means of clearing up after their pets is to be launched.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daventry District Council is thought to be the first authority in the country to consider introducing the power.
If approved, the new rules would force owners to show how they will clean up dog mess if stopped by officials.
It has now agreed to put the proposals out for public consultation before deciding whether to introduce them.
The council, which admits its proposals will be "controversial", agreed on Thursday to begin the consultation in mid-May.
Daventry District Council already uses three dog control orders (DCOs) targeting dog foul, dogs in play areas and dogs on leads.
Owners caught without a bag or other means of collecting dog mess could be issued with a £100 penalty notice, with the potential of a £1,000 court fine if left unpaid.
Maria Taylor, the council's community manager, said: "We receive more than 120 complaints about dog fouling each year but despite regular patrols it is difficult to catch offenders in the act.
"If agreed, the new order would give our officers greater powers to catch the irresponsible minority of dog owners who go out with no intention of picking up after their pets.
"We believe we are the first council in the country to consider the introduction of such an offence."
