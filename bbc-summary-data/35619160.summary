Yanic Wildschut crossed for Will Grigg to head home, before Ryan Colclough lashed in a fine effort in a breathless opening 10 minutes.
Grigg completed the scoring on 21 minutes from the penalty spot, after being tripped in the box by Bury keeper Ian Lawlor.
Grigg was denied his hat-trick by the smallest of margins, as his 20-yard effort came back off the crossbar.
Second-placed Wigan are now just two points behind League One leaders Burton.

"I think we were incredible the first half.
"We thoroughly deserved to be 3-0 up, if not more at half time.
"At times we were a bit sloppy in our defending, but overall, I'm delighted with a magnificent display."
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"We've seen them (Wigan) progress this season and learn about the league and get better as the season's gone on.
"It's been a tough afternoon but one that we've got to shake ourselves down quickly.
"We have been looking for a centre-half for four or five weeks now and have been unable to recruit one."
