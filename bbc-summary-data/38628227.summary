Bangor-based Cor Glanaethwy will be part of an international choir presenting the US premiere of Welsh composer Sir Karl Jenkins' Cantata Memoria.
It was written to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster, in which 144 people, including 116 children, died.
Choir members Catrin Elis Williams and Celyn Llwyd Cartwright said it is an affecting piece of work.
