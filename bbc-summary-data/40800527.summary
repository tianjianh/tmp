"This is undoubtedly the most exceptional excavation of a Roman site in 40 or 50 years," team leader Benjamin ClÃ©ment told AFP news agency.
The site in Vienne, near Lyon, was abandoned after fires, leaving a "real little Pompeii", he said.
Vienne, on the River Rhone, is already famous for a Roman theatre and temple.
The city, which became a Roman colony in about 47 BC, flourished under the Caesars.
The new site in modern-day Vienne was discovered during preliminary work to build new housing in the suburb of Sainte-Colombe, on the right bank of the river, but remains have now been uncovered on both banks.
What is so astonishing is the extent of the site, which covers 7,000 sq m (75,000 sq ft), and the diversity and state of preservation of the ruins, ClÃ©ment says.
Among the ruins are:
Excavations began in April and are due to continue into December.
