Vuelta a Espana: Chris Froome's victory hopes dented by Nairo Quintana

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Froome's hopes of winning a first Vuelta a Espana suffered a blow when he finished two minutes and 40 seconds behind leader Nairo Quintana.

The Team Sky rider missed the day's breakaway, which featured Quintana, and the Colombian went on to finish second on the 118km 15th stage to Formigal.
Froome now trails Quintana by three minutes 37 seconds, although one of the remaining six stages is a time trial which will suit the Briton more.
Gianluca Brambilla won Sunday's stage.
The Italian was part of the early break and was content to be paced to the finish by Quintana - with the Colombian looking to put as much time into Froome as he could - before emerging from the overall leader's slipstream in the final 100m to snatch the mountain-top victory.
Quintana had suggested he would need a lead of more than three minutes over Tour de France champion Froome before stage 19's 37km individual time trial to stand any chance of winning his first Vuelta and second Grand Tour title.
And he set about achieving that aim inside the opening 10km of the stage, following an attack by three-time Vuelta winner Alberto Contador and his Tinkoff team which caught out Froome and Team Sky.
Both Contador and Quintana emerged with two team-mates each in the break and the rest of the Colombian's Movistar team-mates then separately attacked Froome to isolate him from the majority of his Team Sky squad.
Only David Lopez was able to keep pace with Froome and the Team Sky duo had to rely on riders from Astana and Orica BikeExchange to help stop the breakaway riders moving more than three minutes clear.
Any hopes Froome may have had of clawing back some time on the final ascent were quickly extinguished by Quintana who led the break at such a pace that he managed to drop everyone, bar Brambilla.
"It went much better than we imagined," said Quintana. "The final climb was a race against the clock to leave Froome behind.
"It happened like this because Alberto is also a great strategist, we united and took advantage."
Contador faded slightly on the final climb, crossing the line in sixth, 34 seconds behind Brambilla, but the Spaniard jumped to fourth overall, five seconds behind Colombia's Esteban Chaves, who is in turn 20 seconds adrift of Froome.
Monday's 156.4km 16th stage from Alcaniz to Peniscola is expected to end in a bunch sprint. A rest day follows on Tuesday.
Wednesday and Thursday's stages are not expected to shake up the general classification standings meaning Olympic time trial bronze medallist Froome has Friday's race against the clock and Saturday's mountain-top finish to eat into Quintana's lead.
Sunday's final stage is largely processional and should end in a bunch sprint in Madrid.
