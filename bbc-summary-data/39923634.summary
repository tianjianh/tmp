It will be Wales' first appearance in the prestigious Under-20 competition, which starts on 29 May in France.
Forward Woodburn, 17, and 20-year-old winger Wilson could be in Wales' senior squad which will travel to Serbia for a World Cup qualifier on 11 June.
"These are the players available to me," manager Robert Page told BBC Wales Sport.
The Liverpool youngsters were both on the bench for Wales' most recent qualifier, a 0-0 draw with Ireland, in Dublin.
Manchester United defender Regan Poole and Chelsea's Cole Dasilva are included in the Under-20 squad for Toulon.
Full-back Dasilva scored for Chelsea's youth team in their 5-1 second-leg win over Manchester City last month to clinch the Blues' fourth successive FA Youth Cup.
West Bromwich Albion striker Tyler Roberts and Swansea City's Daniel James and Joe Rodon have also been selected.
But Exeter's 16-year-old defender and defensive midfielder Ethan Ampadu is too young for the tournament.
Rhys Norrington-Davies, Mitchell Clark and David Brooks have withdrawn from the squad having been selected initially. The Football Association of Wales says "replacement call-ups will follow in due course".
Wales will face hosts France, Ivory Coast and Bahrain in their group.
This will be the 45th edition of Toulon with 12 teams taking part in three groups of four, and the group winners as well as the best second-placed team will qualify for the semi-finals.
England won the competition last year and will return to defend their title, while Scotland will also participate from the home nations.
Meanwhile former Wales defender Paul Bodin has joined the international coaching staff as Page's full time assistant, with ex-Watford goalkeeper Alec Chamberlin named goalkeeper coach.
Ex-Wales defender Bodin, capped 23 times for his country, rejoins fellow Welshman Page, having assisted him at Port Vale.
