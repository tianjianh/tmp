Maria Boncza-Tomaszewska, Geoff Collier, Ken Crellin, Julie Maddrell and Mike Murley took an oath of allegiance and justice on Thursday.
A government spokesman said the community volunteers were now ready to hear cases at Douglas court house.
Deemster Doyle said they would play a "vital role" within the justice system.
He added: "They all bring with them their individual strengths, experiences of life and their sense of justice and fairness. The justice system will be stronger for that.
"The justices play a vital role at the sharp end of the administration of justice in this wonderful island.  It is very healthy that members of the community are willing to actively engage in the administration of justice within the community."
