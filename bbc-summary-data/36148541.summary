Former Sunderland player Cabral denies rape charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Sunderland footballer Cabral has denied raping a woman he met in a Tyneside nightclub.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder, real name Adilson Tavares Varela, is accused of raping the 21-year-old at his flat in Gateshead in January 2015.
Hull Crown Court heard the woman, who cannot be named, tried to call for help as she was pinned down on his bed.
The 27-year-old, who is now signed to Swiss club FC Zurich, denies two counts of rape.
The jury heard she met the footballer in a nightclub in Newcastle and went back to his flat with friends.
Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman sobbed uncontrollably as she denied she was attracted to the player and was expecting a sexual relationship.
She said she went into his bedroom with him to fetch socks for herself and her friends because their feet were cold.
She said the player then pushed her down on to his bed and raped her as she told him to stop and tried to push him away.
The woman denied they had earlier danced and kissed in the nightclub and said she did not know that he was a footballer.
The trial continues.
Cabral only made one Premier League appearance for Sunderland in 2013-14.
Sunderland AFC announced on 2 February 2015 that the player had left the club by mutual consent.
