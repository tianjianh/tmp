Shropshire Fire Service was called to The Mill Hotel in Alveley, near Bridgnorth, shortly after 05:00 BST.
Area manager John Das-Gupta said the blaze had "compromised the integrity of the building".
The service said it received numerous calls alerting it to the fire "due to smoke being visible from a number of miles away".
The Shropshire service sent 11 fire engines and was supported by firefighters from across the region, including from Staffordshire, the West Midlands and Hereford and Worcester.
An investigation has begun into the cause of the blaze.
Earlier, area manager Andy Johnson said the fire involved "the whole of the building", which covers three floors.
Because of the scale of the blaze crews were expected to remain at the site through Monday night.
Neil Griffiths from the fire service said crews were unable to get into the building itself because of its fragile state. A structural engineer is on site.
The Mill Hotel, which was a popular wedding venue, closed unexpectedly last September as a result of the financial problems of its owner, Elysian Care..
The building dated back to the 16th Century and was once a working flour mill, according to Visit Heart of England.
The 41-bedroom hotel had been "carefully restored and extended" with many of the original features maintained, the tourist information website said.
