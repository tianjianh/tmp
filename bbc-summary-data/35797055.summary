Jones criticised Robshaw, 29, during the 2015 World Cup and appointed Dylan Hartley to replace him as captain.
But the flanker has played in each of England's four Six Nations victories as they close in on a Grand Slam.
"To come back and play such a pivotal role in the resurrection of the team, I think it is just outstanding," Jones told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek.
Robshaw won his 47th cap in Saturday's 25-21 win over Wales.
Jones said the Harlequins player had gone through "an enormous amount of hurt" after England went out of their home World Cup at the group stage.
He added: "To be splashed on the papers, basically the villain of English rugby, and have to endure the captaincy debate, which I didn't help but was necessary.
"It would have been easy for him to go back to Harlequins and ply his trade there and have a nice easy life but he really wanted to continue playing for England."
Jones, who coached Japan at the World Cup and succeeded Stuart Lancaster as England coach in November, said Robshaw had been "absolutely fantastic".
He added: "He's done it himself. I've just given him a little bit of guidance. The guidance I've given him is what can his new goals be - he can be the best number six in European rugby.
"If you were picking a Six Nations team now, he would definitely get in a best 15 at number six."
