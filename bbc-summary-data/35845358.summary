The 23-year-old, who joined the Potters in January 2013, was already committed to Stoke until 2019 but has extended his deal for another two years.
Butland has made 99 saves this season, the most in the Premier League, and kept 10 clean sheets.
He is in the England squad for their pre-Euro 2016 friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands.
Butland became England's youngest goalkeeper when he made his debut against Italy in August 2012 aged 19.
He has had to wait until this season to add to his England appearances, starting the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania, which they won 3-0.
Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said Butland had "exceeded expectations".
He added: "As a club we feel it's important that we tie down our talented young players on lengthy contracts and Jack's new deal is a fitting reward for his progress this season."
