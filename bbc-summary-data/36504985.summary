The 24-year-old returns to Plainmoor after being released by the Cod Army last week.
Moore kept five clean sheets in 12 appearances to help the Gulls avoid relegation from the National League.
"I'm very, very happy that Brendan has agreed to come back," Torquay boss Kevin Nicholson told the club website.
"He plays like a very experienced goalkeeper. His ability to come for crosses, the way he distributes the ball, the confidence he gives to the backline, is something you rarely see at this level.
"I don't think we'll have Brendan for long. If he plays to the level he can, he has the potential to play in a higher league."
