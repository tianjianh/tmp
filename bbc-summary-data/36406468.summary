Bedene, 26, who had never won a match at Roland Garros until this year, played well but was outclassed by Serbia's world number one.
Djokovic, seeking his first French Open title, won just before play would have been suspended because of bad light.
The 29-year-old will face Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut next.
With the match only starting at 19:25 in France (18:25 in UK) because of rain earlier on, Djokovic faced a race against time to finish the match on Saturday.
The 11-time Grand Slam singles champion won the first set in 37 minutes, and despite dropping his serve, continued to dominate in the second.
British number two Bedene, bidding for his first victory over a top-10 opponent at the eighth attempt, kept plugging away, but in gloomy conditions Djokovic just managed to wrap up victory at 21:30 local time.
Second seed Murray, who beat Ivo Karlovic on Friday, faces American John Isner in the fourth round on Sunday.
His match is scheduled third on Court Suzanne Lenglen after a men's singles and a women's singles match, but rain could delay play.
Djokovic and Bedene's match was moved to Court Suzanne Lenglen after rain delayed play for more than two hours, but was switched back to Philippe Chatrier after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga retired hurt while leading 5-2 against Latvia's Ernests Gulbis.
The Frenchman, who reached the semi-finals last year, was leading 5-2 when a problem with his left leg forced him to quit in tears.
The sixth seed said: "I came on court feeling really good. The first game of the match I did a slide, and I just felt a pain.
"I continued a little bit and it was coming more and more painful. I knew it was over, because no chance I can play all match long like this."
Gulbis will play 12th seed David Goffin, who came through a five-setter against Nicolas Almagro 6-2 4-6 6-3 4-6 6-2.
Also through is seventh seed Tomas Berdych, who saw off Pablo Cuevas 4-6 6-3 6-2 7-5.
Britain's Jamie Murray and Brazilian partner Bruno Soares are safely through to the third round of the men's doubles.
The fourth seeds defeated French pair David Guez and Vincent Millot 6-2 7-6 (7-5) having twice recovered from a break down in the second set.
Murray is currently ranked third in the world but has the chance to move back to number one with a good run at Roland Garros.
Since reaching the third round in Paris last year, the Scot has made the final at every Grand Slam, winning his first title with Soares at the Australian Open in January.
Fellow Scot Colin Fleming and Israeli partner Jonathan Erlich lost their third-round match, as did British pair Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith in the women's doubles.
