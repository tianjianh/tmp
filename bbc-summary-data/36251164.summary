The 29-year-old from Swindon, who won the WBO European super-middleweight title last year, had a 26-week jail sentence overturned on appeal.
Cox's boxing licence is still suspended and he remains subject to suspended sentences for harassment, violence to secure entry and criminal damage.
"It'll good to be back in the gym, back to normality," he told BBC Wiltshire.
"It can work in my favour because, nobody wanted to fight me, but now they know I haven't been in the gym, they might want to fight me, thinking I'm a bit stale.
"This could have a positive effect. They might fight me now."
Former Commonwealth games gold medallist Cox has won all 20 of his professional fights so far, including 12 knockouts.
In February, he was handed a WBO title eliminator against an as yet undisclosed opponent.
"Hopefully in six months there'll be two more first-round knockouts and (I'll be) world champion," he said.
"It's not a time to celebrate. I'm happy to be home. Prison is not a good place to be. It's an experience I don't ever want to see again.
"I was thinking about my boxing career in there. Now hopefully it should be pretty straightforward to get back in (the ring) and win a world title."
