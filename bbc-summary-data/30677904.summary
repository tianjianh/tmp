After multiple delays to its launch last year, WWE Network has set a new date for its UK debut.

The entertainment organisation has tweeted that WWE Network will start in the UK and Ireland on 19 January.
The subscription video-on-demand service will be available just before the Royal Rumble 2015, which takes place in the US on 25 January.
"This time we really mean it," said WWE CEO Vince McMahon, confirming the news in a video statement.
"You've been waiting a long time for the WWE Network and we thank you for your patience."
In October, the company blamed delays to the launch of the UK branch of the service on ongoing "discussions with potential partners".
It promised an announcement of the new date by 1 November, but this was again delayed.
WWE is currently broadcast exclusively on Sky Sports with pay per view events such as WrestleMania and Royal Rumble sold for Â£15 on Sky Box Office.
Sky signed a new deal in 2014 with WWE to broadcast 12 pay per view events every year from January 2015 until 2019 exclusively in the UK and Ireland.
At the time managing director of Sky Sports, Barney Francis, said: "WWE is brilliant entertainment and I am delighted to once again extend our relationship with them.
"WWE is hugely popular with our viewers and now they can continue to watch all the big events and weekly programmes with us."
The WWE Network was launched in the US just before WrestleMania XXX in April 2014 and costs $9.99 (Â£6.16) a month with a minimum six-month contract.
Users get access to library matches and a daily live show as well as pre and post-match extras.
In the UK, subscriptions will be priced at Â£9.99 and there will be no minimum commitment.
