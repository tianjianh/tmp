[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 0-1 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull held on to claim a narrow victory over Bromley despite being reduced to 10 men late on.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shepherd Murombedzi caught the hosts cold to play in Harry White and the former Barnsley forward made no mistake to fire Solihull in front after nine minutes.
White could have made it comfortable for Solihull just before the break, but he was unable to hit the target after George Carline's neat flick put him through.
Bromley were left frustrated as Brandon Hanlan and Mark Goldberg squandered decent chances.
And Solihull were left clinging on when debutant Daniel Udoh picked up two yellow cards to be sent off with five minutes remaining - just eight minutes after coming off the bench.
