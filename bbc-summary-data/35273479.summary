Jean Francois Pinot told the BBC he saw the child in his pyjamas riding his cycle late at night on a rural road.
He said that French law required him to intervene under such circumstances.
The child told him that he had cycled 3km (1.8 miles) on his way to his mother's workplace to get her help.
The incident happened in Saint-Pierre-la-Cour, east of Brittany.
"It was raining and windy, very bad weather," Mr Pinot said.
"I wondered what a little boy was doing outside on a bike at that time, that's why I stopped to ask him and to help him.
"He told me he was going to find his mother who was at work because his father was dead. So I immediately took charge of him. I flashed my lights at another driver who also stopped and who helped me with the boy."
Police and the emergency services were able to find out where Kevin Djene's father lived from information the child provided.
They discovered that the father was not dead and were able to save his life. He is now recovering in hospital.
Mr Pinot said the child "did not have the reflex to use the phone or do anything else".
"His only reflex was get on his bike and go and get his mum at work. His mum works at night.
"He is a very brave and clear-thinking child," he said.
