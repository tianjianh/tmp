Jayden, 17, was strangled by Ben Blakeley, 22, from Reading, in December 2013, and buried in his uncle's grave.
Volunteers created the garden on donated land close to where Jayden's body was found in All Saints Church, Didcot.
It was opened by Mick Quinn, founding member of the band Supergrass, who were from Oxford.
The garden was built with the help of volunteers from employment charity Aspire Oxford and planted with some of Jayden's favourite flowers and shrubs.
Gez Porter, the charity's landscapes team leader who designed the garden, said: "This is a very important project for us as it raises awareness of what we can do, not only helping individuals from homelessness to employment, but for the wider community."
Blakeley was jailed for life in July last year for the murder of Jayden.
His brother Jake, 18, of Abbotts Road, Didcot, was jailed for three years for perverting the course of justice.
