Rocky Uzzell blamed 'ghost' for abusing daughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father who beat his baby daughter so severely she will never be able to walk or talk blamed a "ghost-like alter ego" for the attacks, a judge has revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rocky Uzzell, 29, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years for abusing Isabelle when she was about one month old.
His partner and Isabelle's mother Katherine Prigmore, 24, was jailed for 28 months.
Details of a previous family court hearing have now been revealed.
In that hearing at the family division of the High Court in May 2015, Mr Justice Keehan called Uzzell's descriptions of attacks on Isabelle "chilling".
Uzzell claimed a "ghost-like person" which had "taken over his body since he was a child" had tried to "get rid" of baby Isabelle.
The judge, who has released details of the private hearing after the conclusion of a criminal trial, had concluded Uzzell assaulted the baby on at least six occasions and that blaming an alter ego was a "ruse".
Mr Justice Keehan said Uzzell had mental health difficulties and had endured an abusive childhood.
He said he understood how Uzzell might have created an alter ego as an "imaginary protector".
But he said evidence showed that Uzzell had hurt Isabelle - not a ghost.
And he said there was a "sadistic element" to the abuse.
The family court hearing was held at the request of social workers who asked the judge to determine who had injured Isabelle to help them take decisions about who should care for her.
The judge also concluded that Prigmore, who he said also has mental health difficulties, had known that Uzzell had repeatedly harmed Isabelle and had lied to protect him.
Isabelle - who will be three in February - suffered serious brain damage and other multiple injuries in March 2014.
Specialists say she will need a wheelchair for the rest of her life and will always have to be fed by tube.
Police have previously said she is up for adoption outside the county.
