Police watchdogs have said Tasers should only be used as a "last resort" near flammable substances.

It follows the death of a petrol-soaked man who burst into flames after he was shot by a Taser in Plymouth.
An inquest jury decided that the stun gun was the most likely cause of the fire which engulfed and killed him.
The IPCC recommended that the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing (CoP) revise their Taser training.
Andrew Pimlott, 32, died five days after he was shot by a Taser in the back garden of his parents' home in Plymouth, Devon in April 2013.
Two officers went to the address after Mr Pimlott's father called 999 reporting his son was breaching a restraining order imposed by magistrates to stay away from the house.
After they arrived Mr Pimlott poured petrol over himself and lit a match.
PC Peter Hodgkinson fired a Taser at Mr Pimlott, telling the inquest he was trying to prevent Mr Pimlott from harming himself.
The IPCC said: "Tasers should only be considered for use in the presence of flammable substances as a last resort, and after every other available option has been considered and discounted."
Mr Pimlott's family said after the inquest they had concerns about the use of Tasers near flammable substances and "that the officers did not attempt to try to resolve the situation by communicating with Andrew instead".
In October prosecutors rejected a criminal prosecution for gross negligence manslaughter and misconduct for PC Hodgkinson.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found there was a case to answer for gross misconduct, but in March an internal misconduct panel cleared the constable.
