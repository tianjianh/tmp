Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan, experienced in running US sports teams, lead a consortium which has bought a controlling stake of 60% in the club.
They must pass the league's test for prospective owners to make it official.
"Both see the takeover of Swansea City as an exciting opportunity for long-term growth in the club in every area," the club said in a statement.
BBC Wales Sport revealed in April which of Swansea's directors would be selling all - or part - of their shares.
With the club now valued at about £100m, shares are believed to have increased tenfold in worth since the current board took charge in 2002.
Levien is the managing general partner of Major League Soccer side DC United, while Kaplan is principal of Oaktree Capital investment fund and vice-chairman of NBA franchise Memphis Grizzlies.
They are understood to be keen to buy Swansea's home ground, Liberty Stadium, which is owned by the local council, with a view to increasing its capacity.
Levien and Kaplan had initially been negotiating a deal which would have seen them acquire more than 75% of Swansea's shares, effectively giving the American consortium complete control, including the power to issue more shares.
However, the modified acquisition of 60% will see the trust retain its 21.1% stake and ensure continuity at board level with the retention of Jenkins and Dineen.
Swansea will be based in Washington DC, home of Levien's DC United, for their pre-season tour to the USA in July.
