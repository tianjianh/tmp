Figures showing a rise in UK wage growth also cheered investors.
The price of Brent Crude oil, which has been falling for weeks, recovered by almost 4% late on Wednesday, reaching $62.32 a barrel.

Meanwhile British Airways owner IAG fell by 4%.

All eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve later when it announces the results of its latest meeting.
