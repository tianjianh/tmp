Britain will have 11 crews competing for medals on Sunday's final day of the World Rowing Cup in Switzerland.

With six crews having qualified on Friday, Olympic champions Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were one of a further five to progress on Saturday.
The pair, who are unbeaten since 2011, won their semi-final by a boat length and a half ahead of the United States.
Both GB men's double sculls crews also progressed after an exciting finish to their repechage.
Jack Beaumont and Nick Middleton surged passed the Australian duo to grab second place.
They will be joined on Sunday by Alan Campbell in the men's single sculls, plus Will Fletcher and Richard Chambers in the lightweight men's doubles.
Britain sealed their first gold of the regatta later on Saturday when the non-Olympic lightweight men's pair of Sam Scrimgeour and Joel Cassells added to victory at the European Championships earlier this month.
Beaumont's return to form comes after a serious training accident last summer where a clash of boats led to months off with a back injury.
After narrowly finishing ahead of the Australians, Beaumont said: "We timed it perfectly and just wanted to make everyone excited."
They finished second behind the leading men's double sculls pair of Jonny Walton and John Collins.
The results mean that, with only 69 days until the Rio Olympics, only two of Britain's 14 crews have failed to make it to the final.
