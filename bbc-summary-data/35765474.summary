The 29-year-old made eight appearances for the Wildcats last season after joining them from Castleford Tigers.
Huddersfield have been hit by injury problems, with Scott Grix and Craig Huby both set for lengthy lay-offs.
"A new face will give us a great lift after the difficulties we have faced in this first month," director Richard Thewlis told the club website.
The Giants, who are currently bottom of the Super League table, have yet to win a game this season.
