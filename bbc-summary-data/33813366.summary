Mohamed Salah: Chelsea winger joins Roma on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah has joined Roma on a season-long loan, with the Italian club given an option to buy the player at any point in the season.

The Egypt international joined Chelsea from Swiss side Basel for Â£11m in January 2014.
However, he has played only 19 times for the Blues, scoring two goals.
The 23-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan at Roma's Serie A rivals Fiorentina, where he scored nine times in 26 games.
"Salah is regarded by many as the best Egyptian player in the world right now," Roma said in a statement on their website.
