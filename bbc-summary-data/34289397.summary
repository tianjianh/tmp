A North Yorkshire Police worker has been disciplined after a 10-month delay in dealing with child abuse details.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation came after details of DVDs including images of naked children were not acted on.
It led to an intelligence officer being disciplined for misconduct, although no details of the punishment were given.
Deputy Chief Constable Tim Madgwick said the force would "fully accept" the IPCC recommendations.
The report said the force should "ensure a more robust and formalised approach into supervising/monitoring the progression of intelligence".
The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre's operation Spade was looking into the supply of the DVDs to the UK from Canada.
It sent North Yorkshire Police intelligence from the operation in November 2013 but it was "not progressed" until the last week in September 2014.
The investigation found an officer in the Force Intelligence Bureau had failed to adequately deal with the material.
Operation Spade material had named 25 suspects, said the IPCC.
Kathryn Stone, IPCC Commissioner, said: "North Yorkshire Police have acted promptly to put in place new ways of working following our investigation."
Mr Madgwick said the force took its safeguarding responsibilities "extremely seriously".
