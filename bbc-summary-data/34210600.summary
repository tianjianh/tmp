Residents have described the harrowing moments when they thought billowing smoke from a blaze would engulf their homes.

An oil tank fire caused two houses on Seaview Drive, Ogmore-by-Sea, to be gutted by the fire on Wednesday.
Homeowners said smoke stretched as far as they could see, and it was "touch and go" if their homes would be hit.
An investigation is now under way into the cause of the blaze, which was tackled by 40 firefighters.
Alan East lives in one of the home, which have a sea view. Just one house separates his from two that were destroyed.
He first became aware of the blaze at around 14:00 BST, when the smell made him look outside.
"There was black smoke billowing. We weren't sure if it was coming this way or the other," he said.
"It was touch and go whether it would be our home or the ones on the other side."
Mr East sat on a chair on the roadside for two hours, and watched the sea breeze take the fire away from their home, which suffered damage to the guttering.
Residents said they are thankful nobody was hurt, with a family from the property next to those affected saying they are still in shock.
John Langley lives feet away from the fire-hit homes.
He said: "I thought at first someone was burning vinyl. But there was black smoke, it was dreadful, it stretched as far as I could see.
"I was frightened."
Firefighters were damping down on Thursday morning.
Rob Wilkins, who lives in a neighbouring street, said: "It was well alight, with flames out of the roof.
"The wind caught it and then set fire to the other house. It is a mess now."
Another neighbour, Len Williams, said the whole area was cordoned off for most of Wednesday.
No-one was injured and fire crews remained on site, damping down, until Thursday morning.
At the height of the fire there were five fire engines, two water carriers and an aerial appliance in use.
