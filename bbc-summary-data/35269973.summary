[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony McMahon's header from six yards was enough to secure the points for the promotion-chasing Bantams.
The Latics' hopes were dented before half-time as substitute Connor Brown was sent off for a bad foul.
The red card came moments after Oldham had nearly taken the lead through Jake Cassidy's close-range flick, while Liam Kelly's late header almost levelled it.
Bradford climb into the top 10 and are four points off the play-off places with two games in hand, while Oldham are five points from safety in 22nd.
Oldham manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"The sending off totally changed the game.
"I was well happy with the way we played. I thought we could have kept the ball in possession a bit better but I thought we looked comfortable.
"We dealt with everything that they threw at us, up until the sending off I was comfortable."
