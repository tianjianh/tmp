Routine inspections at Old Vienna in Eastwood Road, Leigh, revealed congealed dirt, broken glass, and cooked food left unrefrigerated.
The proprietor, Walter Haiser, 76, admitted food safety breaches at Southend Magistrates' Court.
Southend Borough Council said Mr Haiser had been "failing to comply" for some time.

The council said the business sold unfit food, failed to comply with improvement notices issued by environmental health officers and failed to provide essential information, despite repeated requests.
Officers said they gave advice on how to address the failings, but Mr Haiser, from Woodlands Park, Leigh, failed to take action.
The  Southend Echo also reported the restaurant's food safety rating sank to zero.
Executive councillor for housing, planning and public protection services, Mark Flewitt said: "We had to take this action to protect public health and make sure that the food hygiene regulations would be complied with in future.
"Friern Leasing Limited and Mr Haiser had been failing to do this for a long time."
The restaurant is yet to comment.
