The 32-year-old has scored one goal in 10 appearances for the League Two side in all competitions this season.
"He has been extremely unlucky with injuries and is going to be a big loss while he recovers," head coach Dermot Drummy told the club website.
"We just hope that when he comes back it he can play a full part for us in the last few months of the season."
