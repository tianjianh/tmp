The 29-year-old, from Birmingham, served with the Royal Logistic Corps.
He died in a blast in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province and is survived by his partner and parents.
Lt Col David Southall of the Royal Engineers told the MoD website: "Staff Sergeant Brett Linley was a man of courage and composure."
On 17 July, Staff Sgt Linley and his team were working in Nahr-e Saraj to clear improvised explosive devices from a major route when a bomb exploded, killing him.
Staff Sgt Linley enlisted into the Royal Logistic Corps in March 2001 and qualified as an ammunition technician in September 2002.
He completed three tours of duty in Northern Ireland, and was also deployed to the Falkland Islands and Canada.
Lt Col Southall, who is commanding officer of the Counter-Improvised Explosive Device Task Force, said: "His loss has shaken us all.
"He qualified earlier this year as a High Threat IED Operator, motivated by a simple desire to save life and play his part in Afghanistan.
"I will remember his calm, considered manner and, as one of life's grafters, his professionalism was meticulous; 'If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right' he'd tell his boys, both in training and on task."
Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said: "Despite the very real danger that he faced every day, Staff Sergeant Brett Linley carried out his role with courage, professionalism and composure.
"It's clear from the tributes to him that he was a selfless soldier who, without question, would do whatever was needed to protect those around him.
"It was while trying to keep his colleagues and the local Afghan people safe from IEDs that he was tragically killed. His sacrifice will not be forgotten and I offer my sincere condolences to his friends and family."
