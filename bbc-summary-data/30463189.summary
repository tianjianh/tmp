A City Link courier was making a house delivery in Sketty Park, Swansea, when the robber drove off in the green and yellow Transit van, but then panicked.
The vehicle was later found dumped in a lane a mile away, still with the packages destined for dozens of people.
South Wales Police are appealing for witnesses who saw the van being driven after it was taken from the courier.
