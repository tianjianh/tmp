Brussels attacks: Belgium charges third man over Paris plot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belgian authorities have charged a third suspect with terrorist offences linked to a plot to attack France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Belgian national named only as Y.A. joins two others charged in Belgium in relation to the foiled plot.
The charges come in the wake of the arrest of Frenchman Reda Kriket in a Paris suburb on 24 March.
The arrests all followed bomb attacks on the airport and a metro station in Brussels on 22 March that left 32 people dead.
Belgian federal prosecutors gave few details about the latest charges.
A statement named the suspect as Y.A, aged 33, who was arrested on Thursday and had appeared before a judge on Friday to have his detention extended.
He was charged with "participating in the activities of a terrorist group".
A man referred to officially as Facyal C was released on 28 March after being arrested on 24 March in Brussels and charged with "participation in the activities of a terrorist group, terrorist murders and attempted terrorist murders".
Others detained on suspicion of terrorist activity include
The charges come after an arsenal of weapons was found at the home of Reda Kriket, with the Paris prosecutor saying  an imminent act of "extreme violence" had probably been prevented.
The other two charged in Belgium are Abderamane A and Rabah N.
Another man has been detained in the Netherlands and is contesting extradition to France.
The recent spate of arrests was sparked by the detention in Brussels on 18 March of Salah Abdeslam, a key surviving suspect in the gun and bomb attacks on a concert hall, a stadium, restaurants and bars in Paris on 13 November 2015 killed 130 people.
The attacks in Brussels came four days after Abdeslam's arrest. Three suicide bombers are known to have died, while at least one other suspect, pictured on CCTV at the airport, is being sought.
Meanwhile Abdeslam's brother, Mohamed, says he has met him in his Belgian prison cell where he is awaiting extradition to France.
Mohamed said his brother had chosen not to blow himself up, to save lives.
He told France's BFMTV that Salah had told him: "There would have been more victims had I done it. Luckily, I couldn't go through with it."
So-called Islamic State said it carried out both the Paris and Brussels attacks.
