Wrexham crossbow murderers fail in sentence appeals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men jailed for murdering a Wrexham man with a crossbow have failed in a bid to have their sentences cut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sion Davies, 25, died after being shot with the weapon and falling from a third-floor balcony.
Anthony Munkley, 54, and Lee Roberts, 34, were each handed life terms at Mold Crown Court in June 2015 after being convicted of his murder.
An appeal court judge has now ruled their 28-year minimum jail terms reflected their "appalling" crimes.
The pair were found guilty of the "punishment murder" of Mr Davies, who was killed in Caia Park over a drugs debt.
Munkley lured Mr Davies to his home where he set in train an "orgy of violence", firing bolts from a crossbow, London's Appeal Court heard on Friday.
Roberts - Munkley's "muscle" - joined in the attack, repeatedly slashing at Mr Davies with a knife and inflicting seven deep wounds.
Mr Davies was pinned back to the balcony of the flat before toppling to the ground below, said Lord Justice Lloyd Jones.
He managed to crawl away from the scene but later died from head injuries he had suffered.
Lawyers for Munkley and Roberts argued their minimum jail terms were "unduly harsh".
They pointed out no firearms were used, also citing Roberts's fragile mental state, including paranoid personality traits.
But Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, who was sitting with Mr Justice Stewart, noted how Roberts had stopped taking his related medication around the time of the killing.
He also highlighted the violent nature of Roberts's knife assault, although Munkley had "instigated" the attack.
"The (sentencing) judge was entitled to treat the extreme ferocity and the sustained nature of the attack as aggravating factors," said Lord Justice Lloyd Jones.
"We have concluded that these severe sentences were no more severe than was necessary to reflect the appalling nature of these crimes."
