[SN]TITLE[SN]
The Top 10 albums of 2015

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jazz, hip-hop, chart pop, folk and literate punk all rub shoulders in a "poll of polls" to find the top 10 albums of 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BBC looked at 20 of the "best of 2015" lists in music's most influential publications - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Vice, Billboard and Q Magazine - to find the highest-ranked albums of the year.
Read about the Top 10, and what the critics had to say about each of them, below.
10) Miguel - Wildheart
Like Prince on Purple Rain, R&B star Miguel ventured into rock territory, splicing flame-throwing guitar riffs on to his tales of bedroom conquests, salvation and damnation.
9) Carly Rae Jepsen - E•MO•TION
Most people had written off Canadian Idol winner Carly Rae Jepsen as a one-hit wonder after Call Me Maybe, but she proved them wrong with this collection of world-class, 80s-referencing pop.
8) Grimes - Art Angels
Canadian artist Grimes, known to her parents as Clare Boucher, spent two-and-a-half years streamlining the sound of her fourth album, a futuristic collection of uncompromising pop. "The whole time I had this feeling like it might all blow up in my face and people might hate it," she told Billboard.
7) Sleater-Kinney - No Cities To Love
Emerging from a 10-year hiatus, US rock band Sleater-Kinney worked in secret on their eighth album, retaining the stabbing energy of their self-titled debut.
6) Sufjan Stevens - Carrie and Lowell
A long, intimate conversation with death, Carrie and Lowell is named after Sufjan Stevens' mother and stepfather - but is principally concerned with the former, who died of cancer in 2012. Over the record, he dissects their relationship - she abandoned him as a baby - and tries to reconcile his feelings of grief, loss and love.
5) Tame Impala - Currents
Tame Impala vocalist Kevin Parker is probably more familiar as a guest vocalist on Mark Ronson's Uptown Special, but his band's third album is an equally-accomplished expedition into trippy psych-pop with some of their strongest melodies to date.
4) Jamie xx - In Colour
Jamie Smith's first solo album pillages dance music's past to create something approaching a new genre - quiet rave.
3) Father John Misty - I Love You, Honeybear
Former Fleet Foxes drummer Josh Tillman penned his second album as a love letter to his wife, Emma. But don't be fooled by the title - the record is caustic, explicit and full of prickly putdowns, which focus as much on his own shortcomings as his passion for his bride.
2) Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit
With a title inspired by a poster in her grandmother's toilet, Courtney Barnett set the tone for her debut album - a selection of sloppy punk-pop grounded by her witty, conversational lyrics.
1) Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly
A hip-hop album built on visionary jazz and gritty funk, To Pimp A Butterfly is dizzying at first - as Lamar tackles race crime, faith, sex and his own hypocrisies, often in the space of a single track. But with repeated listens, it coalesces into a startling, compelling document of fame and fear in modern America.
The 20 best of lists surveyed appeared in: Amazon, AV Club, Billboard magazine, Consequence of Sound, Entertainment Weekly, The Guardian, Mashable, Mojo, NME, Paste, Q Magazine, Rolling Stone, Spin, Stereogum, The Sun, Time, Time Out London, Time Out New York, Uncut and Vice.
