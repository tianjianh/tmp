The fire started at the "A list" Cirque Le Soir venue on London's Ganton Street, just off Carnaby Street at about 04:55 GMT.
Station manager Nic Myatt said: "No-one was inside at the time and there were no injuries." The cause of the fire is under investigation.
Cirque le Soir, a basement venue, describes itself as "London's most A-list club and decadent circus".
Entertainers perform on four stages at the nightclub, a popular venue for celebrities, with minimum spends starting "from as little as Â£100 per head" for a party of 500.
London Fire Brigade said it managed to contain the fire so it did not travel to the restaurant and offices above it.
