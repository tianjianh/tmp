DTH van der Merwe: Scarlets wing to miss rest of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets wing DTH van der Merwe has been ruled out for the rest of the season because of a shoulder injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Van der Merwe, 29, suffered the injury during Scarlets' 46-10 defeat in the Pro12 against his former club Glasgow Warriors last Saturday.
The South African-born Canada back will see a specialist this week.
He has scored eight tries in 19 appearances for Scarlets in all competitions this season.
Van der Merwe, who joined Scarlets from Glasgow ahead of the 2015-16 season, became the first player representing a tier-two nation to score a try in four successive Rugby World Cup matches in last year's tournament.
