Some locals and historians were worried Rose Castle near Dalston would be bought by developers when it was put up for sale in 2009.
The Grade I-listed building has been home to 63 bishops from 1230 to 2009 but the Church Commissioners said it was too costly to run.
It has now been bought on behalf of the charity the Rose Castle Foundation.
Its bid to buy the castle was rejected in 2011, but it carried on fundraising.
Bishop James Newcome said: "We are thrilled that our plans for Rose Castle are reignited following very generous donations to enable the castle to be purchased.
"Our heartfelt thanks go to those who have invested in this historic building and in our vision.
"The Rose Castle Foundation addresses misunderstanding and builds bridges between individuals and communities experiencing conflict."
