Hart and winger Raheem Sterling were taken off during Manchester City's 1-0 derby defeat by United on Sunday.
Heaton, 29, will join the squad for the friendlies against Germany in Berlin on Saturday and the Dutch at Wembley on 29 March.
England boss Roy Hodgson will not be adding to his outfield players.
"Tom has been with us on several occasions and I am welcoming him back into the fold," said Hodgson.
"Obviously it's very disappointing for Joe and Raheem to suffer injuries which will rule them out of our games against Germany and Holland.
"They are important players in our squad and I wish them a speedy recovery."
The Burnley captain joins fellow goalkeepers Jack Butland and Fraser Forster in the squad at St George's Park, with England due to travel to Berlin on Friday.
Goalkeepers: Jack Butland (Stoke City), Fraser Forster (Southampton), Tom Heaton (Burnley).
Defenders: Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Nathaniel Clyne (Liverpool), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), John Stones (Everton), Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur).
Midfielders: Dele Alli (Tottenham Hotspur), Ross Barkley (Everton), Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur), Danny Drinkwater (Leicester City), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), James Milner (Liverpool).
Forwards: Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Jamie Vardy (Leicester City), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Danny Welbeck (Arsenal).
