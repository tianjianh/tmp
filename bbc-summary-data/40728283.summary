The 27-year-old, who emerged through the club's academy, scored 827 runs in County Championship Division Two last season, at an average of 48.64.
He has also been in good form in 2017, scoring five fifties and a century in four-day games and 234 runs in seven appearances in white-ball cricket.
"I've been here since I was 13 so it's great to be able to continue my career with Northants," Newton said.
