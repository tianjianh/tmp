Lyndsey Shipstone left her husband, Yasser Alromisse, to start a new life with their seven-year-old daughter, Mary, in Northiam, East Sussex.
But he tracked them down to their safe house last year and shot Mary twice in the head before taking his own life.
Ms Shipstone said more should be done to protect victims of domestic abuse.
She told BBC South East Today she had not known of her husband's history before the tragic events of 11 September last year.
"I would have liked to have known that he had been previously abusive to other partners... I like to think if he had been stopped sooner things might have been different," she said.
The results of a serious case review into the events surrounding the fatal shooting of Mary are expected to be released at the end of the year.
It is being carried out by East Sussex Local Safeguarding Children Board to find out whether mistakes were made, and what lessons can be learned.
Ms Shipstone said it was not clear how her estranged husband had found out where she and Mary were living.
They had been moved to Northiam for their own safety after she had been the victim of domestic violence at the hands of Alromisse.
"Information about us wasn't joined up and left us vulnerable," she said.
Ms Shipstone said she would like to see the authorities change their approach to the crime, and to give greater protection to victims.
"We still have this mentality that if you relocate a victim, then everything's going to be fine, and that's not true.
"Actually you're more at risk when you leave a perpetrator then actually when you're living with them.
"So we were always at risk from him - it was just trying to get other people to see that."
Ms Shipstone, who is expecting a baby in November with her fiance, Jason, said she was still taking one day at a time as the first anniversary of Mary's death approached.
"She'll live in my heart until the day I die, and even though the pain of losing her every day is unbearable, I still feel incredibly close to her.
"I love to remember her every day. So that keeps me going," she said.
