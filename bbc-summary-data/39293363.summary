Swansea boss Paul Clement will welcome back striker Fernando Llorente for the trip to Bournemouth.

The World Cup winning striker was considered a doubt after a dead leg forced him off in the 2-1 defeat at Hull and missed four days of training.
Defender Angel Rangel has been ruled out for the season with a broken foot however, while left back Martin Olsson has an ankle injury.
Kyle Naughton and Stephen Kingsley are likely to be recalled to the side.
Clement says Rangel is 'unlikely' to play again this season after an operation and admits they have also suffered a setback with January signing Olsson.
"We picked up a few injuries at Hull," he explained.
"Angel has had surgery on a broken bone in his foot. He tried to carry on thinking he had rolled his ankle, but the scan showed a crack in the bone. The surgery is to quicken the healing process and he will be out 8-12 weeks.
"Olsson has not returned to training, he is unlikely to be fit for this weekend. We are disappointed to have lost Martin."
Clement is expecting to be able to call on top scorer and World Cup winner Llorente, who was forced off against Hull with a dead leg.
"Llorente is okay, he is back training with the group as is Naughton (hamstring) who we lost against Burnley."
In the absence of Olsson, Clement confirmed Scotland U21 left back Stephen Kingsley will return, having not featured since mid-January when the Swans lost 4-0 against Arsenal.
Clement is confident the 22-year old will be ready to seize his chance however, and insists that is why the club allowed Wales defender Neil Taylor to leave for Aston Villa in January.
"Stephen Kingsley will play at left-back at Bournemouth, he is a good young player who has been involved with his national team and he has experience at this level and is a very good replacement," he said.
"We are more than confident in Stephen's ability. When we brought Martin in, it was always the case that one of the left backs would leave.
"We are very happy Stephen stayed here."
Clement felt defender Alfie Mawson was worthy of his inclusion after being named for the first time in the England Under-21 squad.
"It is very good news," Clement told BBC Wales Sport. "It is fantastic for him to be recognised. England are strong at Under-21 level but Alfie deserves the opportunity because he is playing regularly in the Premier League."
