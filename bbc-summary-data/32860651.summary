[SN]TITLE[SN]
Edinburgh University fossil fuel occupation ends

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A student occupation of an Edinburgh University building on Chambers Street has ended after 10 days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 30 people were protesting over the institution's "failure to commit" to divestment from fossil fuels.
Two men were arrested following an altercation between a security guard and a student on Thursday.
The students from the People and Planet society said they would be taking their campaign on to the streets because they no longer felt safe in the building.
