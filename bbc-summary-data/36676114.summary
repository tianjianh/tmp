Wimbledon 2016: Dominic Thiem and David Ferrer both beaten on day four

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Men's eighth seed Dominic Thiem was beaten in straight sets by Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic on an action-packed day four at Wimbledon.

Austrian Thiem lost three tie-breaks as he fell to a surprise 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-3) defeat on Court One.
Vesely is one of only two men to defeat Novak Djokovic in 2016 after beating him in April's Monte Carlo Masters.
Vesely, 64th in the world rankings, plays 31st seed Joao Sousa of Portugal in the third round.
It is only the second time Vesely has reached that stage at Wimbledon, after losing to Australia's Nick Kyrgios in that round two years ago.
Thiem, the highest-ranked seed to be eliminated from the men's singles competition, reached the semi-finals of the French Open earlier this year before being beaten by eventual winner Djokovic.

Serbia's Viktor Troicki was furious with the umpire during his second-round loss to Albert Ramos-Vinolas, calling him the "worst ever in the world".
The 25th seed, 30, insisted an ace that gave Ramos-Vinolas match point was out, grabbing the ball off a ball boy and presenting it to the umpire.
"Did you see the ball? You are so bad," Troicki shouted at Italian umpire Damiano Torella.
"Do you know what you did? You are horrible. What are you doing there? You are the worst umpire ever in the world."
Spaniard Ramos-Vinolas, 28, went on to win 3-6 6-3 6-3 2-6 6-3.
The world number 36 will next face the winner of the match between Richard Gasquet and Marcel Granollers.
Frenchman Gilles Simon, the 16th seed, was knocked out in slippery conditions on Court One by Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov.
Dimitrov, 25, won 6-3 7-6 (7-1) 4-6 6-4, but Simon was left feeling disgruntled about the weather conditions throughout their drawn out three hours and two minutes tie.
"I feel the day I'm going to get injured on slippery grass, I'm going to sue everyone in the stadium," the 31-year-old said.
"We try to understand what is happening in both parties, like tournaments and players - but in one point yesterday it was just ridiculous."
Spaniard David Ferrer suffered a shock second-round defeat, losing 6-1 6-4 6-3 to unseeded Frenchman Nicolas Mahut.
Thirteenth seed Ferrer, a two-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist, was beaten by world number 51 Mahut, who moved into the third round for only the second time.
He will play fellow Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in round three after he beat Damir Dzumhur of Bosnia-Herzegovina 3-6 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-0) 6-2.
There was another surprise exit as big-serving Croat Ivo Karlovic was knocked out by Slovakian qualifier Lukas Lacko.
Karlovic, the 23rd seed, hit 34 aces but could not prevent Lacko from winning  6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-4.

Meanwhile, sixth seed Milos Raonic secured his place in the last 32 with a straight-sets win over Andreas Seppi.
The Canadian won 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 6-2.
Ninth seed Marin Cilic joins Raonic in the next round after the Croat beat Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine 6-2 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 6-4.
Nottingham Open winner Steve Johnson is also through after the American beat Jeremy Chardy 6-1 7-6 (8-6) 6-3, while compatriot Jack Sock overcame Robin Haase.
