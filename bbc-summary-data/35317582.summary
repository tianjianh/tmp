West Yorkshire Police said officers had seized a number of vehicle components at both sites near Blackburn in Lancashire.
The force, working alongside Lancashire Constabulary, said six arrests had been made during the raids.
Police said van thefts accounted for 40% of all vehicles reported stolen in Yorkshire.
Almost 500 Ford Transit vans were reported stolen in West Yorkshire between January and December 2015, with an estimated value of Â£7.5m.
Officers said vehicles stolen from Leeds, Bradford, Kirklees, Calderdale and Wakefield had been traced to Lancashire.
The vans would then be broken up into component parts and sold on.
Ch Supt Pat Casserly, from West Yorkshire Police, said: "Whilst collectively these incidents result in high-value crime, we must remember that each theft has very human consequences.
"These types of vehicles are often owned and utilised by small businesses and for some the theft of a vehicle can result in the loss of contracts and future work."
