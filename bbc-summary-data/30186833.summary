Eve Muirhead's rink beat world champions Switzerland 7-5 but conceded to Russia after the minimum six ends at 8-2 down.
The men led by Dave Edwards succumbed 7-4 to Germany - who are newly promoted from the European second tier.
The women have won three games from five, the men have won two from five.
"That was a tough one but you get games like that where you're on the back foot for the whole match," Muirhead told BBC Sport after the Russia defeat.
"We know we can play better than that. We just struggled a little bit with our draw weight tonight.
"But we had a good win against Switzerland and at three wins and two losses we'll take that at this stage.
"But we know we can't drop any more so we'll be coming out sharp for Estonia and Germany next."
David Edwards's rink were leading Germany until their opponents scored four to take the lead in the ninth end.
That was their third defeat in a row after two opening wins and on Tuesday they will aim to get back on track against the Czech Republic and Russia.
Meanwhile, in the B Division, England'smen beat Estonia 7-5 to maintain a perfect record of played six, won six.
They are guaranteed a place in the B Division medals play-offs where, if they take gold or silver, they will be promoted to the top tier for next year's competition.
The gold medallist in the B Division also plays against the eighth-placed team in the A Division for the right to play at the World Championship next year.
England's women remain well placed to make the medals play-offs having beaten Hungary 10-6.
They complete their round-robin schedule on Wednesday against Poland and Italy.
Wales'smen were beaten 8-4 by Hungary and lie mid-table.
