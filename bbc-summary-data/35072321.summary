It is the first time such a fine has been issued to the company.
No details about the content in question were released by authorities, but the BBC understands the fine relates to material from a political protest account that is critical of the Turkish government.
Twitter did not provide a comment.
This is not the first time the microblogging site has run into problems with Turkish authorities.
Both Facebook and Twitter were blocked in Turkey in April after a court order was issued prohibiting people from sharing images of a prosecutor being held at gunpoint.
And in March last year, it was reported that the social network had been blocked in the country after then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to "wipe out Twitter" after allegations about his party were published on the site prior to local elections.
