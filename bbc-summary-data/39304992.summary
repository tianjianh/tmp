Officers, including armed police, contained the building and negotiators were sent to the scene as a cordon was put in place.
Samantha Lacey, 32, from Northfield, said she arrived at the bank to make a deposit but found the door was shut.
She said: "There were about six people outside. When I asked what happened they said a man walked in, pulled a gun out and told all customers to get out."
Ch Insp Shaun Phillips said: "Officers quickly surrounded the bank, set-up a street cordon and established phone contact with some staff members who were hiding in a back room.
"It's understood the man was with one female staff member, while other staff were lying low in another back room.
"No customers were caught up in the incident and no-one was hurt."
