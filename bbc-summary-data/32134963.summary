Barry McCarthy admits killing his wife Lorna but denies murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A husband has gone on trial for the murder of his estranged wife in the house they were sharing in Norfolk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry McCarthy, 50, admits killing Lorna McCarthy, also 50, at their home in Gorleston in September but denies murder.
Norwich Crown Court was told Mr McCarthy called the police telling them that in the early hours of the morning he had killed his wife.
Her body was found with several stab wounds including one through the heart.
The prosecution told the court Mr McCarthy had become jealous.
The couple had split up a few months earlier but were still living together in Sussex Road in the town.
Mrs McCarthy, who worked for a charity and was well known in the Great Yarmouth area, had been using dating websites.
The case continues.
