The exhibition, at St George's Hall in Liverpool, also includes a painting of former footballer Steven Gerrard, which will be put up for auction.
Funds will go to the charity Blind Veterans UK, which set up the display, titled Art - Life beyond Sight Loss.
Ex-soldier Matt Rhodes said painting gave him "a new lease of life".
His modern version of the John Singer Sargent painting "Gassed" showing a line of wounded soldiers following a mustard gas attack in World War One is also on display at the Liverpool exhibition.
The 42-year-old, from Preston, lost most of his sight after a motorcycle accident, which left him with a brain injury and paralysis down the right side of his body.
"I have half tunnel vision so when I'm working I can only see small sections of the painting like an eyebrow or an ear. I have to work my way around doing each bit on its own. It does mean that I can never see the whole finished work."
He added: "Unfortunately, my injuries have become worse over the last few months and I have had to stop painting conventionally."
He said he was "working with the instructors on finding new techniques using new technologies".
Blind Veterans UK, which was formed in 1915, said it believed art and craft skills was an "important element of rehabilitation" for former members of the military.
The exhibition runs until 29 January.
