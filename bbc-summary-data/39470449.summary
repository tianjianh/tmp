Morgan Schneiderlin could return from a calf problem but James McCarthy and Aaron Lennon are still unavailable, along with long-term absentees Seamus Coleman and Ramiro Funes Mori.
Leicester City remain without captain Wes Morgan and midfielder Papy Mendy because of injuries.
Manager Craig Shakespeare has hinted at making changes to prevent fatigue.
Steve Bower: "After their remarkable run of six straight wins under Craig Shakespeare, Leicester's form will face a stern test at Goodison Park.
"Everton have lost just once at home in the league under Ronald Koeman and have won all six so far in this calendar year.
"The Everton boss has given younger players opportunities and that has given them a freshness and energy that they hope will help them finish the season strongly.
"Leicester went into the weekend in their highest league position since September, a sign of the turnaround since Claudio Ranieri's departure.
"Another challenge will be to focus fully on a seventh win in a row with a Champions League quarter-final in Madrid on the horizon."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman: "We are fighting for European football. I expect if we get six points from our next two home games, we will fight for fifth and sixth place in the table.
"I don't understand the difference [in Leicester's form since Claudio Ranieri was sacked]. It's the same players. Maybe the manager is keeping the team the same as last season. We expect a tough opponent."
Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare: "There hasn't been any Champions League talk. It hasn't been banned, it's just all about keeping the run going against Everton.
"It'll be a tough game. They're a good side, strong at home, well organised and have a goal threat too."
This is not a good time to play Leicester, who look unstoppable at the moment. The Foxes have got their swagger back and I think they will win.
