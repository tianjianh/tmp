Former Wales and Cardiff scrum-half and captain Lloyd Williams has died at the age of 83.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Williams won 13 Wales caps from 1957-1962 and played 310 games for the Blue and Blacks after making his debut in 1952.
He was one of seven brothers from Taff's Well, a village near the city, to play for Cardiff.
Among them was famed centre Bleddyn, a legendary Wales and British and Irish Lions centre, who died in 2009 aged 86.
A Cardiff RFC statement said the club was "saddened" to hear of Lloyd Williams' passing.
"Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time," the statement added.
