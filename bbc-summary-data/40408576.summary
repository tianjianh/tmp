British Attitudes Survey: More Britons 'back higher taxes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly half of Britons think the government should raise taxes and increase spending, an annual survey of public opinion suggests.

At 48%, it is the highest proportion to support such measures since 2004, according to the British Social Attitudes survey.
The survey also found the public were becoming more sceptical of the EU.
And social liberalism was rising on issues such as same-sex relationships, pre-marital sex and abortion.
There was a more traditional attitude to national security, however, with more than half wanting strong powers on terror.
Roger Harding, head of public attitudes at the National Centre for Social Research, which carries out the survey, said: "People's tolerance for austerity is drying up, even if that means higher taxes.
"This leftwards tilt on tax and spend is matched by a long-running conservatism on national security and law and order. In all, people want a more active state that's firm but fairer."
Here are the key findings of the survey:
The survey found that Britain holds "traditionally conservative views" on national security, and the public favoured stronger state powers to tackle terrorism, even before the terror attacks in Manchester and London.
The research - carried out in the months after last year's EU referendum - suggested that views on immigration had become more polarised, with the young and highly educated more likely to believe that immigration was good for the economy, while older people and non-graduates were more likely to say it was bad.
The survey has been carried out every year since 1983, with questions repeated periodically to assess how opinions change over time.
A total of 2,942 people in England, Scotland and Wales were questioned between July and November last year by social research organisation NatCen.
