World sporting success for Wales is "fast becoming the norm", First Minister Carwyn Jones has said.

He was speaking as Wales face Australia in the Rugby World Cup and the football team play Bosnia-Herzegovina for a place in the European Championship.
For a decade Wales had attracted "premier sporting events", while its sportsmen and women had achieved "incredible success", Mr Jones said.
He said it had helped Wales to achieve an "unprecedented global profile".
Sporting events hosted in Wales have included the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Ashes, World Cups, the Champions League final, Rally GB, the Heineken Cup final, Ironman, the Volvo Ocean race and the Ryder Cup.
"What's even more remarkable is that this period has coincided with the incredible success of our sportsmen and women across a number of sports, watched by an ever increasing global audience," the first minister said.
He added that the combination of being "increasingly recognised as a dynamic, positive place to do business" and sporting success had ensured that the "view of Wales from abroad has never been better".
