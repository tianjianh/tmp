Former DUP adviser David McConaghie denies voyeurism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former church minister and adviser to DUP MP David Simpson allegedly secretly filmed female colleagues using the toilet in the constituency office, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David McConaghie, from Cottage Hill, Dollingstown, denies making recordings for his sexual gratification.
He appeared before Craigavon Magistrates Court on Monday.
A woman who worked with him said she had been uneasy about him for some time leading up to September 2012.
He suggested buying potpourri for the toilet and provided two filled boxes.
She said she continually pushed one of the boxes into a corner, only to repeatedly find it pushed back to a position nearer the toilet.
Eventually, she looked among the potpourri and found a small camera, she said.
When she examined some of the footage from this, she saw images of herself using the bathroom and shots of Mr McConaghie in which she said he appeared to be setting up the camera.
She told David Simpson, MP, who called the police.  He also gave evidence on Monday.
Mr McConaghie's defence will be heard at the end of July.
