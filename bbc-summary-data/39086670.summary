[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stoke City v Middlesbrough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke have just one injury concern, with Xherdan Shaqiri back in training but unlikely to play following six weeks out with a calf injury.

Jon Walters and Glen Johnson are fit again and in contention, while Saido Berahino is pushing for a first start.
Defenders George Friend and Antonio Barragan are set to be available for Middlesbrough after missing the whole of February with injuries.
Arsenal loanee Calum Chambers remains sidelined with a foot problem.
Conor McNamara: "Mark Hughes has never finished below the top half in any full season as a manager. To continue that record he will need improvement from Stoke's last performance.
"Still, the 4-0 defeat at Tottenham on their return from 'warm weather' training - in an uncharacteristically overcast United Arab Emirates - was food for thought on the age old conundrum: Whether Stoke can, in fact, do it on a cold wet evening in Dubai?
"Middlesbrough have only won four league games all season but have not yet spent a single night in the relegation zone."

Stoke City manager Mark Hughes on his striker options: "He (Bony) was away (at the African Cup of Nations) for a while and during that time Peter Crouch came into the side and did really well. It's been difficult for Wilf to get back in.
"We've bought (Saido) Berahino in the meantime, so that's an extra striker on the books. So he's just going to have to be patient, as all players have to be.
"He's (Berahino) doing extra work over and above the main group on sharpness and finishing. He's clearly very much in my thoughts."
Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka on his side's lack of goals: "When you can't do anymore to work harder and try to improve, you can't do more.
"I think we're doing a lot of things, we took a step forward in the games against West Brom and Everton and played well, but last week we had to change everything in the last minute.
"We have to keep working and I said after the game the only way to survive is to work harder every day."
I would have to back Stoke here. Boro have not won in the league since 17 December but I am not expecting Aitor Karanka to change his team around and go for it a little bit more.
