Lee Miller nodded a Myles Hippolyte cross beyond Jamie Langfield to put the Bairns ahead but Stephen Mallan's free-kick levelled matters.
Bob McHugh headed the Bairns back ahead but Mallan equalised a second time, firing past Danny Rogers.
But Blair Alston struck in the last minute to secure victory for Peter Houston's side.

And Falkirk, who have played two games more than Hib, travel to take on Alan Stubbs' men on Tuesday evening.
St Mirren remain seventh with manager Alex Rae now looking firmly towards next season.
The visitors started brightly and only a last-gasp challenge by Will Vaulks denied Rocco Quinn a clear sight of goal.
Falkirk responded quickly and took the lead. The impressive Hippolyte teased the visiting defence before delivering a cross that was flicked towards the back post where Miller was waiting to score.
John Baird should have doubled that advantage when he found space eight yards out but fluffed his effort.
The Buddies came out battling in the second period and deservedly equalised, Mallan converting a 22-yard set piece into the bottom corner.
The home side though were soon back in front.
Vaulks hit the post with a header before the St Mirren defence cleared but from the resulting corner McHugh nodded home.
Again the Paisley side came back and Mallan doubled his tally for the day by hammering in a cut-back from 12 yards out.
The drama though was far from over and Alston knocked home from eight yards out to secure what could prove to be a crucial win in the battle for second top spot.
