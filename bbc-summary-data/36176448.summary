Cameron McGeehan's deflected free-kick gave the hosts the lead, before two goals in less than three minutes from Marriott and Joe Pigott made it 3-0.
Jayden Stockley headed in Tom McCready's cross just after half-time to reduce the deficit for Exeter.
But Marriott fired in from the just inside the box to secure all three points for the Hatters.
Luton finished 11th, while the Grecians dropped to 14th after seeing their winless run extend to five games.
