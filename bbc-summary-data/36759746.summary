Noren carded a two-under-par 70 to finish on 14 under, while Hatton, who went round in 69, earned a place at next week's Open Championship.
Nicolas Colsaerts, Matteo Manassero and Danny Lee tied for third on 12 under.
Scotland's Richie Ramsay, whose closing round of 67 earned him a share of sixth with England's Andy Sullivan, will also compete at Royal Troon.
Compatriot Russell Knox also shot a 67 to finish 10th on nine under.
Four Open spots were available for players who had not yet qualified.
Noren, who turns 34 on Tuesday, led the field by two shots going into the final round and a birdie at the 15th hole on Sunday proved decisive.
Hatton birdied the last to put pressure on a short Noren putt, but he held his nerve to clinch his fifth European Tour title.
For the Swede, it erased bad memories of Castle Stuart.
"I had a really sour finish in 2012," he recalled. "I missed out from four feet to get in a play-off.
"Now it feels just so happy it is over. It feels amazing. It is by far the biggest win in my career against a great field of players. I probably can't believe it still.
"It was pretty tough out there to see those guys making a few birdies, so many players just behind me that is always tough.
"I doubted myself so many times through this round and, when you get on top, it doesn't feel real. Hopefully soon it does."
A brilliant 66 secured Belgian Colsaerts' Open place along with Italy's Manassero.
"It's a big deal for everyone, it's the Open," said Colsaerts. "I knew coming down the stretch, it was kind of looking like I needed a four on the last to make sure.
"I was able to do it today, which feels really, really good."
US-based Knox said: "I battled as hard as I could. This was really the only good putting round I had.
"Today was a great day, building confidence into next week."
Ramsay said: "I played to win today, which is a great feeling when you're in that position - home pride, great golf course, striking it well.
"I putted well, which helped, but to be honest I had a sea of chances out there.
"I feel like I could have been five under on the back nine."
