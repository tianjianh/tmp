Locks James Gaskell and Will Rowlands, as well as props Jake Cooper-Woolley, Alex Lundberg and Simon McIntyre, have agreed undisclosed-length extensions.
"We're delighted to extend the deals," said director of rugby Dai Young.
"They all deserve their new contracts after impressing again this season."
Young added: "It's been a couple of years of change at Wasps and, with the move of the training ground and playing staff to Coventry next season, we're really pleased another five players have bought into the vision and are enjoying the direction the club is moving in."
Wasps are due to complete their move to Coventry this summer, when they plan to move their current training base from west London, at the Twyford Avenue sports ground in Acton - to Binley Woods, currently the home of Broadstreet RFC.
They have so far continued to remain based in London since first making the Ricoh Arena their matchday home in December 2014.
Wasps backs coach Lee Blackett, who arrived from Rotherham last summer, has also signed a new contract, tying him to the club until at least 2019.
England Saxons tight-head prop Cooper-Woolley has made 68 appearances since signing from Cardiff Blues in 2013.
Gaskell, who has made 44 appearances since signing from Sale in 2014, missed the final few weeks of the season with a foot injury.
Loose-head prop McIntyre also moved from Sale in 2011, since when he has scored five tries in 105 appearances.
Under-20s prop Lundberg signs his first senior contract after spending this season on loan at Bedford, helping them to the Championship play-offs.
Wasps Academy graduate Rowlands spent the early part of the season on loan with Jersey, before returning to make seven Wasps appearances.
