Police divers have been searching the flooded River Dee in Aberdeen for a man they fear may have been swept away.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two bags containing the belongings of Terence Kilbride were washed up beside the river on Saturday.
The 48-year-old, originally from Warrington in Cheshire, was reported missing on Monday.
Police said he was known to go camping in the area and could have a bike with him but the horrendous recent weather meant they were gravely concerned.
Insp David Paterson, of Police Scotland, said: "Given the recent inclement weather we are extremely concerned to trace Mr Kilbride and confirm he is safe and well and we are treating this as a missing person inquiry.
"A photograph, which is a few years old, has been provided and we are asking people to see if they recognise him.
Mr Kilbride is described as 6ft tall with short dark greying hair. He has blue eyes.
