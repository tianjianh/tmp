Ireland's London 2012 gold medallist will fight at super-featherweight against 27-year-old Kopinska.
Taylor recently agreed promotional terms with Matchroom Boxing after concluding an amateur career that made her Ireland's most decorated fighter.
The 30-year-old is a five-time world champion, while Kopinska has lost 14 of her 24 fights, winning just seven.
The Pole also has the experience of having gone the distance against WBC super-featherweight champion Eva Wahlstrom of Finland.
Taylor, from Bray, decided to make the move into the professional ranks with Eddie Hearn's outfit after missing out on a medal at the Rio Olympic Games in August.
After her professional debut, she will fight on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's second defence of his IBF world heavyweight title at Manchester Arena on 10 December.
