Soft drinks-giant Coca-Cola has said feedback about traffic chaos around its festive truck stop in Cardiff will be taken into account when planning for next year.

The firm said it was "sorry" people experienced delays because of a crash near Asda Coryton where it was parked.
Five-mile (8km) tailbacks built up and motorists complained they had been delayed for hours on the M4 eastbound.
Asda apologised saying the event had proved extremely popular.
The lorry was parked at the store at junction 32 all day on Thursday and angry drivers took to social media to complain about the delays during evening rush hour traffic.
A Coca-Cola Great Britain spokesperson said: "We're sorry to hear that as a result of an earlier traffic incident in Cardiff near to where the Coca-Cola Christmas truck was visiting, people experienced delays to their journeys last night.
"When deciding on the route and stops for the truck tour we work closely with local authorities to minimalise any disruption to the surrounding area.
"We'll ensure that any feedback from this stop is reflected in the planning for next year."
But Cardiff council disputed the accident claims and said it would have advised not to hold the event near a major roundabout.
"Cardiff council had no involvement in the Coca-Cola truck event at Coryton yesterday," said a spokesman.
"The council does not believe the congestion was caused by the road traffic accident," he added.
Inspector Ian Randell, of South Wales Police, said the congestion was "caused mainly" by those heading to see the Coca-Cola truck but the situation was compounded by two crashes nearby and bad weather.
He added the force would speak to organisers to ensure planning for future events is reviewed.
