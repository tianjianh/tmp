[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sex attacker hid in an attic after subjecting a woman to a terrifying ordeal, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hugh Robertson, 33, of Thornhill, assaulted his victim in Dumfries in November 2014.
He had denied any sex crime but admitted physically attacking the woman, insisting he had initially acted in self-defence.
However, he was convicted of sexual assault at the High Court in Glasgow and will be sentenced next month.
The court heard the woman was also struck with a belt during the attack and was "crying and very upset" during her ordeal.
Robertson was said to have turned up at the house in an "angry and frustrated state".
Prosecutor Steven Borthwick said he had "used violence to overcome her resistance".
The woman suffered bruising and swelling.
The court heard Robertson tried to "barricade" himself in when police arrived and was eventually discovered in the attic.
He claimed in evidence he had been assaulted and that he lashed out in a bid to defend himself.
But Mr Borthwick told the court: "He is a cowardly liar who cannot accept the reality of what he has done."
Susan Duff, defending, said Robertson was "ashamed" at physically assaulting the woman, but that he denied any sex attack.
Robertson had faced an allegation that he raped the woman but the jury deleted that accusation from the charge he was convicted of.
Judge Lord Bannatyne put him on the sex offenders register and he was remanded in custody.
He is due to be sentenced on 12 July in Livingston.
