[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich dropped points for the first time this season as Cologne fought back to hold them 1-1 at Allianz Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joshua Kimmich's header gave Carlo Ancelotti's side the lead after 40 minutes but Anthony Modeste volleyed in a cross to level just after the hour.
The visitors could even have won it in the second half but Yuya Osako was adjudged offside with his late effort.
Bayern stay top of the Bundesliga, with Cologne four points behind in fourth.
The draw, which stretched Cologne's unbeaten league run to 11 games, came three days after Bayern lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League.
"We are disappointed, but have nothing to worry about," said Ancelotti, whose side came into the game having won their first five league matches this season.
"We must not forget that our start to the season was really good. The last two games were not good. But confidence in my players is great."
