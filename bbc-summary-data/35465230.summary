Six Nations: England's Hartley must play like Tarzan - Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New England captain Dylan Hartley has to "play like Tarzan" in the Six Nations, says head coach Eddie Jones.

Northampton hooker Hartley, 29, was a controversial appointment because of a chequered disciplinary record.
Jones said he turned to Hartley as he is a natural communicator who is good at "getting the best out of people".
But he added: "On the field he's got to be Tarzan. He's got to get out there and play with his heart and if he does that the players will follow him."
Jones, whose side start their Six Nations campaign away to Scotland on Saturday, said it was Hartley's "blokeiness" that first caught his eye.
"The first time I met him we came to the kitchen and he was speaking to people behind the counter, he was very polite and respectful," explained the former Australia and Japan boss.
"He gets around, talks to people, encourages people to be involved.
"Leadership is not about being in the front of the bus, beating your chest and saying 'do as I do'. It's about engaging people and finding out what qualities they have. I've been pleased how Dylan's done that."
With Hartley having only just returned from injury and hookers rarely completing the full 80 minutes in Test rugby, the new captain is unlikely to play the entire game at Murrayfield - and Jones revealed he will announce Hartley's deputy on Thursday when he names his team.
England will head to Edinburgh with either two or three uncapped players in their 23-man squad, with prop Paul Hill, back rower Jack Clifford and centre Ollie Devoto all in contention for a place.
But Jones has resisted the clamour for the likes of Saracens forward Maro Itoje and Wasps back Elliot Daly to be called up - so far, at least.
"Those two boys, I want them to be 60-Test players, at least, for England," Jones said.
"Now I've got to pick the right time to put them in. They'll play Test rugby for England - they'll definitely play in the Six Nations at some stage but I've got to pick the right opportunity for them to play. Their time will come."
Jones watched Itoje turn in a man of the match performance for his club on Saturday, and with second row Courtney Lawes not certain to be fit to face Scotland because of a hamstring injury - "we'll give him until Thursday - we're hopeful he'll be all right," said Jones - the Saracens youngster could yet feature at Murrayfield.
"I went to Saracens - I hid in the stands - and it was the best game I've seen Itoje play for them. It was really good, very impressive," added Jones.
"My gut feeling on Maro is that he's definitely progressing, but he needs just a little more time."
