The 56 year-old, named locally as Nigel Hill, was found on Monday after the boat Magica was seen going in circles close to Rosemullion Head.
He was pronounced dead in hospital after being airlifted. It is thought he had been in the water for some time.
A local fishermen's society said Mr Hill would be "badly missed".
Emergency services were called to the River Helford at about 12:45 BST on Monday after someone reported seeing the 20ft (6m) boat circling.
The RNLI said both lifeboats from Falmouth attended and Mr Hill was found in the water.
Crews performed CPR before he was airlifted to Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.
David Muirhead, chairman of Cadgwith, Helford and District Fishermen's Society, said: "He'd been fishing all his life, a very good and enthusiastic fisherman. He will be very badly missed by all his fellow fisherman."
Mr Hill was a traditional handline fisherman described by friend Phil Lockley as an "irreplaceable" character who used ancient fishing methods.
Fellow fisherman and friend James Nicholls said: "He had a heart of gold, he would give you his last pennies, he would go without himself to help others.
"He would help a beggar in the street, his love for birds, for sealife and dolphins was second to none."
Devon and Cornwall Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious and a file had been passed to the coroner.
