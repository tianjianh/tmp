Christopher Cullen repeated stabbed Victoria Comrie Cullen and cut her throat during an attack at Taren Point, Sydney, in January 2014.
The 39-year-old victim was originally from Bangor, County Down.
Her killer had denied the murder, claiming he acted in self-defence, but he was found guilty last month.
The sentencing judge described it as a frenzied and brutal attack and said it was difficult, if not impossible, to imagine the terror Ms Cullen had experienced in her final moments, according to the broadcaster, ABC Australia.
Cullen was given a 30-year sentence and was told he must serve a minimum of 22 years in jail before he becomes eligible for parole.
During the murder trial, the court heard that Ms Cullen had been a victim of domestic abuse and had taken out an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against her estranged husband.
A few months before her death, Cullen had threatened to kill her and ordered her out of their home after accusing of her of having an affair.
On the night of the murder, the victim's body was found kneeling face down on grass in the grounds of a fishing club.  Her ex-husband was arrested nearby.
Passing sentence, the judge said Cullen "callously decided to kill the deceased for his own selfish and personal reasons" and had shown no remorse.
"The death of the deceased is another example of the extremely prevalent violence perpetrated by men in our society against women to whom they are married or with whom they share a relationship of domestic intimacy.
"This malignant cycle of domestic violence is given publicity and media attention without corresponding or equivalent success in its prevention," he added.
Ms Cullen's friends and colleagues wept in court as the sentence was passed.
