Super League: Leeds Rhinos 10-30 Hull KR

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds slumped to their seventh defeat in nine games as two Shaun Lunt tries helped fellow Super League strugglers Hull KR beat the defending champions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite losing Terry Campese to injury, Lunt's brace on his return from a calf strain put Rovers 10-0 at half-time.
Kieran Dixon and Ben Cockayne then went in for the visitors before Jamie Jones-Buchanan and Carl Ablett responded.
Further tries from Mitch Allgood and Robbie Mulhern ensured Rovers moved above Leeds to 10th in the table.
Victory is Hull KR's second of the season following James Webster's appointment as interim head coach last month.
The defeat is Leeds' third in a row and leaves them second from bottom.

Brian McDermott's treble-winning side looked to have got off to a good start, but Kallum Watkins was adjudged to have knocked on when he went over inside five minutes.
While Danny McGuire gave Leeds an air of surety, Rovers hooker Lunt was clinical for his two first-half scores against his former team.
Dixon ran in from 80 metres to add to Rhinos' woes after the break before Lunt put Cockayne over.
Leeds' mounted a fightback with the next two tries, but Rovers ran away with it to secure a comfortable victory.
