Humberside Police said the arrests were for "unrelated matters" and were made following searches, linked to the shooting, of houses in west Hull.
Armed officers and a police helicopter went to the restaurant on St Andrews Quay at about 11:30 GMT on Saturday.
The windows of a blue Volkswagen Golf were shot out. Nobody was hurt in the incident.
Police said two men who were arrested at the scene have now been released from custody.
The force said it believed it was an isolated incident, with the offenders and victims known to one another. No shots were fired by police.
Darren Woodhead was in the McDonald's drive-through queue when the shooting took place.
He said: "I heard gunshots close to us and a car sped off out of the drive-through.
"Within minutes police had arrived with pistols, then three police vans arrived with more heavily armed officers."
Officers cordoned off the scene for forensic examination of the area.
