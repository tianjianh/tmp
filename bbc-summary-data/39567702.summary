[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town have extended midfielder Abu Ogogo's deal until 2018.

The 27-year-old joined the Town from Dagenham & Redbridge in June 2015 and has played 79 games for the club.
Ogogo has made 29 appearances this season - despite a serious knee injury - and that has triggered a clause in his contract which manager Paul Hurst was delighted to take up.
"He wears his heart on his sleeve. Everyone can see the effort and will to win," Hurst told BBC Radio Shropshire.
Ogogo has just returned to training after initially looking likely to miss the rest of the season.
Hurst added: "He's maintained a good attitude during his injury and he's always had a smile on his face. It's great to have him back out there."
