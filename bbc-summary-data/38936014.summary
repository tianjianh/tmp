Lyn Dexter was taken to St James's University Hospital in Leeds after falling seriously ill on Sunday.
The 68-year-old was asked on Wednesday by a ward sister if her bed could be wheeled into a shower room to free up space on the ward.
Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it was "very sorry this happened".
