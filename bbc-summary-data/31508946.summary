Alexandra Hospital resignations: Health secretary to meet campaigners

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The health secretary is to meet politicians and campaigners over A&E services in Worcestershire after five consultants quit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four consultants from the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch and one at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital resigned on Friday.
It is thought they were concerned at the "continuing uncertainty about the future of Redditch Hospital",
Campaigners want to replace the trust that runs the hospitals.
The future size and shape of the Alexandra Hospital has been uncertain for several years.
Neil Stote, from the Save the Alex campaign group, has described the resignations as a "damning indictment of the trust".
Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs both hospitals, has confirmed all five consultants had been offered posts at Warwick Hospital.
None of the doctors would leave their current positions before May, and job adverts have been placed to recruit their replacements.
An urgent transition plan will be put in place and emergency care would continue as normal, a spokeswoman said.
Mr Hunt will meet campaigners, local MPs and senior health officials next week to discuss A&E services.
