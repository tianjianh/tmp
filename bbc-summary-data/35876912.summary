Driver admits using car as weapon in Grangemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver has admitted using his car as a weapon in a violent assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Ballantyne suffered life-changing injuries when he was struck by a car driven by Akib Aslam in Tweed Street, Grangemouth, in October 2014 as he walked home with a friend.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard Aslam accelerated before swerving violently to throw his victim off the bonnet.
The 22-year-old, from Stenhousemuir, was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing next month.
He was originally charged with attempted murder following the attack.
The Crown accepted a guilty plea to a reduced charge of assault to severe injury.
He also admitted behaving in a threatening or abusive manner by following Mr Ballantyne and Dylan Money, revving his engine loudly, carrying out handbrake turns and driving close to them.
Mr Ballantyne suffered serious leg injuries in the attack and underwent surgery. He was housebound and unable to walk for three to four months after the attack.
