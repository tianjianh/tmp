[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County 4-2 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Nugent bagged a hat-trick and missed a penalty as Derby beat Fulham to dent the Cottagers' play-off bid and strengthen their own hopes.

Nugent lifted over keeper David Button to put the Rams in front, but Floyd Ayite swept the visitors level.
Seconds after Nugent saw his spot-kick well saved by Button, his spectacular volley gave the Rams a half-time lead.
He tapped in his third before Johnny Russell drilled in a fourth and Ayite scored a late Fulham consolation.
Fulham's defeat means they drop out of the top six at the expense of Sheffield Wednesday, who won at already-relegated Rotherham.
Derby never looked back once Marcus Olsson's pinpoint through ball was neatly converted by Nugent, and have now lost just once in eight against the Londoners on home soil.
Ayite's smart finish, after the Rams failed to clear Ryan Fredericks' cross, suggested briefly that Fulham could take control, especially as they bossed possession for long periods.
But Nugent's stunning second, as he hooked in over his shoulder just moments after his penalty miss, proved crucial.
The former Leicester City striker secured the match ball just before the hour mark when he charged down a Button clearance, and Russell's second goal of the season, that found the right-hand corner, confirmed the result prior to Ayite's late second.
Derby have now taken seven points from nine since Gary Rowett took charge, and have moved to within seven points of the final play-off spot.
Derby manager Gary Rowett: "Someone said to me before the game it was going to be quite open, and I think that was a bit of an understatement.
"Fulham make it very difficult for you to come out and put pressure on them, but when you win it, there is always lots of space to break and counter, which made it a very end-to-end game.
"After the penalty miss, we scored a second at the perfect time, and in the second half we pressed the ball better and were really clinical."
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "I believe my team played a very good football game. From another side, we missed a little bit of experience to make the right decision in the right moment.
"We must all stick together and be strong, fighting until the end of the season. I believe my team play the best football, but we haven't made enough good results.
"In these six games [left] we have to hit fifth gear and push hard to fight to be at the top of the table."
