Millie, eight, of Carmarthen, joined Wimbledon champion Andy Murray as he led out the team in the Maracana stadium on Friday.
She won a competition by recreating the moment Jessica Ennis-Hill won heptathlon gold in 2012.
Her father Chris Curtis said seeing her on TV was "unbelievable".
Millie won the right to be a mascot in the ceremony - broadcast to an estimated audience of three billion people - as well as a week's stay in Rio and tickets to some of the events, after entering a McDonald's competition.
She appeared in a photo which recreated the moment Ms Ennis-Hill crossed the finish line in the 800m event of the heptathlon at the London Olympics.
After flying out on Tuesday with her mother, Rhian, Millie was told she would be leading out three countries at the ceremony, but not her own.
"When we sat down to watch it and saw her with Andy Murray it was unbelievable," Mr Curtis said.
"She was beaming from ear to ear. We checked the online newspapers and media and the main picture they were all showing was of her and Andy Murray - we were screaming and shouting - [we were] so happy."
Mr Curtis said Millie's brothers, Luke, 13, and Elliot, 16, both went to the London Olympics four years ago after entering another competition.
"There was a bit of jealousy when Millie got to go to Rio for a week," he added.
