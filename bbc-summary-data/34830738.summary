James Chester fears lack of club games could affect Wales chances

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales defender James Chester admits his Euro 2016 ambitions are suffering by his lack of starts for West Brom.

Chester played in Wales' 3-2 defeat by Netherlands, but has started only once in the Premier League this season.
The 26-year-old does not understand why manager Tony Pulis has not played him more often.
"To be playing for Wales I have to start for my club. It's impossible to play at this level and not be playing week in, week out," he said.
"I know myself I need to be playing at my club to give me the best chance of going to France and playing when we get there.
"I don't think it's good enough to be playing for Wales when I'm not playing for West Brom."
Former Manchester United trainee Chester was promoted to the Premier League with Hull and had two seasons in the top flight before joining West Brom last summer in the wake of the Tigers' relegation.
The 26-year-old was part of a three-man central defence at Hull and also with Wales, playing a key role as Chris Coleman's side qualified for the European Championships next summer, but his rare Albion appearances under Welshman Pulis have come at right-back.
"[Wales manager] Chris Coleman has been brilliant to me and that's nice to hear, so it's up to me to go back to West Brom and play. But I'm finding it difficult," he added.
"When I signed [Pulis] said he knew I could play at centre-back but he wanted to use me at full-back.
"I think the disappointing part for me is I played the first game of the season and I think I showed enough, with hard work and playing there regularly, that is something I could become quite good at.
"But to only give me one opportunity there I find it quite difficult to understand."
Chester, the most expensive defender in Albion's history, revealed he spoke to Pulis in October to enquire what he had to do to get back in the first team at the Hawthorns.
"He said he understood it was a new club and a new position and we had some work to do," Chester said.
Asked if he would look elsewhere in the January transfer window, Chester replied: "I'm 12 games into a four-year contract, but I'm not one who likes to sit and watch.
"I want to play and I thought I was coming to West Brom to play in the Premier League.
"Hindsight's a wonderful thing and you see how Hull are doing at the start of the season, and I had other options which makes the situation a little more difficult."
