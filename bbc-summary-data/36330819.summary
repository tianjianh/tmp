The 18-year-old joined the National League side from Plymouth Argyle two years ago and made his first-team debut against Basingstoke in October.
"I'm delighted to sign my first pro contract, it's what I have lived for since being a young kid," Hancox said.
"I want to be more consistent and show what I'm good at - I've got to kick on and see what the season can bring."
Hancox is the third player to sign a new deal with the Gulls, joining Ben Gerring and Sam Chaney.
