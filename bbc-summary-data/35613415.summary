Wales had two top-flight clubs in the 2013-14 season when Cardiff enjoyed their only year in the Premier League.
But Guidolin admits he is "worried a little bit" for Swansea's top-flight survival as the Swans are just three points above the relegation zone.
"I know how important Swansea staying in the Premier League is to Wales," Swansea's manager told BBC Sport Wales.
"I think Swansea are the pride of Wales so I think it is very, very important for this country to have a team in the Premier League."
Welsh football is celebrating its national team qualifying for their first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup as Gareth Bale helped Chris Coleman's Welsh side reach Euro 2016.
Swansea have enjoyed 2013 League Cup success, a Europa League adventure and a memorable win at Spanish giants Valencia in their five years since being promoted to the Premier League.
The Swans finished eighth in last season's Premier League table but are in danger of relegation after a poor run of just three wins in 16 games.
Swansea face daunting trips to two Premier League title contenders next as Guidolin's men visit second-placed Tottenham Hotspur followed by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.
"We have three months of battles, match after match," acknowledged Guidolin.
"My job is a difficult. I have to have a good last part of the season because the table does not look good for us but I am confident.
"Yes we are worried a little bit but I think we have the characteristics and quality to survive."
