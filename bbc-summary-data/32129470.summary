LCC awarded power contracts for 10 Northern Ireland super councils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
LCC, the Cookstown-based energy firm, has won the contracts to supply power to 10 of the 11 new super councils.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The firm is better known as a distributor of liquid fuels and coal but also has supplied electricity to business and commercial customers since 2012.
It has a 15% market share among large energy users and 10% share among medium energy users.
It also entered the commercial gas supply market in 2014.
The value of the council contracts has not been disclosed.
Shauna Forbes of LCC said the company was developing a major portfolio of customers in a very short period of time.
"It's a source of real pride among the staff and management of LCC Power, that we have gone from a standing start, just two years ago, as an electricity supplier for business customers, to becoming one of the top suppliers in Northern Ireland."
LCC is owned by the Loughran family. In 2013 the business made a profit of Â£14m on a turnover of Â£579m.
