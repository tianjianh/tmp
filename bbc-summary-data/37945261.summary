Trump presidency: Where is the Michigan result?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner of New Hampshire six days after she lost the presidential election, but where's the Michigan result - the last of 50 US states to be called?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Associated Press (AP) news agency says it will not declare an outcome in the Midwestern state while a recount remains possible.
The Trump campaign had until Monday to seek a recount in New Hampshire, but did not do so.
So AP called the result for Mrs Clinton by about 2,700 votes, less than 1% of the 732,000 ballots cast.
Michigan's unofficial results show Mr Trump winning by over 13,000 votes.
AP, which gathers voting data from state and local officials, said it would soon declare a result if neither campaign called for a recount.

The Rust Belt state's outcome must be certified by the appointed members of the Board of State Canvassers.
In each of the state's 83 counties a four-person board (two Democrats and two Republicans) "canvass" elections by "carefully reviewing and authenticating various forms and certificates completed to document the vote cast at the polls", according to the board's charter.
The Trump campaign had raised the possibility it might send lawyers to New Hampshire to contest the results owing to the slim margin of victory there.
His first victory during the primary season was in New Hampshire, a state to which he returned 10 times after receiving the Republican party nomination.
But despite reappearing in the state on the eve of the election to say "you have never disappointed me", the Granite State was called by the Union Leader newspaper for Mrs Clinton one day after the vote.
Mr Trump is unlikely to be fazed by his New Hampshire loss.
His edge in the US electoral college - which ultimately determines the winner of the American presidency - now stands at 290 to 232.
