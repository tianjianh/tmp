The Orchard Centre, in Didcot, was evacuated following a report of a suspicious item at Sainsbury's.
The area remained cordoned off until lunchtime on Monday whilst police investigated the item.
Police confirmed it was "not a danger to the public" and a 35-year-old man, from Didcot, was arrested on suspicion of making a bomb hoax.
Insp Adrian Lewis, of Thames Valley Police, said: "I would like to thank the community for their patience while officers secured the immediate area."
In a tweet, the force said the item was "made safe" before investigators confirmed it was not dangerous.
Mayor of Didcot, Councillor Jackie Billington said: "All credit to our emergency services who put the cordon in place immediately."
Insp Lewis said: "I'd like to reassure people the incident is not being linked to recent terrorism events in Manchester."
He added people should continue to report anything suspicious: "Information from the public is always very important - you are also our eyes and ears."
Police said the 35-year-old man, who was arrested, has been released under investigation and enquires continue.
