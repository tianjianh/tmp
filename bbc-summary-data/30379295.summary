RNLI Bridlington plans new £3m lifeboat station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An East Yorkshire seaside town could get a £3m lifeboat station if plans are passed by a council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) wants to replace the lifeboat building on South Marine Drive in Bridlington with a new one 500m away on Spa Promenade.
The RNLI said the 1903 building was "cramped and outdated".
East Riding of Yorkshire Council will decide whether to pass the plans on 8 January.
The council had previously agreed the promenade south of Bridlington Spa could be widened by up to seven metres so the current lifeboat can be launched more safely and effectively.
Michael Oakes, of the RNLI, said the new site, which is between Bridlington Spa and the pumping station, would mean all the lifesaving equipment could be kept together in one place instead of the inshore lifeboat and equipment being kept a short walk away in a separate building on Princess Mary Promenade.
Mr Oakes said it would also mean quicker launch times because the lifeboat would not need to cross the road and the Shannon-class lifeboat, which is due to replace the current Mersey all-weather lifeboat by 2018, could be kept inside coupled with its launch vehicle.
Plans for the two-storey building include public viewing areas, a mechanic station and a shop, as well as improved changing and equipment facilities.
The RNLI has other lifeboat stations at Flamborough, Bridlington, Withernsea and Humber in East Yorkshire.
