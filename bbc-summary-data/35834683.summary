Shane McGuigan fired in the opening two goals at the Athletic Grounds before Francis Kearney and Paddy Quigg netted.
St Pat's led 4-4 to 0-5 at the break and St Paul's improved in the second half with Shea Loye hitting the net.
The gap was reduced to six points but St Pat's sealed victory with a late Conal Darragh penalty.
It was a third MacRory triumph for the Derry school in the four years and 15th in total.
McGuigan and Kearney produced a superb spell early in the match with the St Paul's defence unable to stop the big St Pat's duo.
St Paul's slotted over the opening two points of the second half followed by Loye's goal, but the Armagh teenagers failed to mount a serious fightback.
St Pat's forward and man-of-the match Patrick Kearney said: "At the start of the campaign we we written off but we knew we could go far.
"We moved the ball quickly at the start and they couldn't handle Shane McGuigan and Francis Kearney.
"We can definitely go on to win the Hogan Cup but we just want to want to enjoy this first."
