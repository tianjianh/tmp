[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dunfermline Athletic 4-3 Dumbarton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dunfermline won on their return to the Championship in a seven-goal thriller against Dumbarton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Thomson headed the visitors ahead after Michael Moffat's penalty hit the post for Dunfermline.
Joe Cardle then scored a hat-trick before substitute David Hopkirk made it 4-1.
There was late drama though when the visitors were awarded two penalties in injury time which were both despatched superbly by substitute Mark Docherty.
It was two terrific strikes in two minutes by Joe Cardle to give Alan Johnston's side a deserved half-time lead and then Cardle made the most of a mistake by Frazer Wright in the Dumbarton defence to complete his hat-trick from inside the box.
Hopkirk capitalised on another Sons defensive mistake to make it four, before Dumbarton launched their comeback.
Referee Barry Cook also ordered off Dunfermline centre back Lee Ashcroft for his part in the second penalty award when he tangled with Thomson to put a slight downer on what had been a strong start for the home side.
