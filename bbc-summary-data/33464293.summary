Football managers often moan they are not given enough time in the job so ex-Chelsea player Dan Petrescu perhaps thought he would turn the tables.
After signing a three-year contract with Targu Mures in June, the 47-year-old won the Romanian Super Cup in his only competitive game in charge and then decided to quit.
His former club's 1-0 win over Steaua Bucharest secured a first trophy in their history and Petrescu left a winner to join Chinese club Jiangsu Sainty on a lucrative deal.
His reign at Targu - who are in financial difficulty - lasted just 27 days.
Petrescu managed Dynamo Moscow and Kuban Krasnoadar in Russia but has now lasted 20 games or less in four of his nine managerial spells.
"It's very hard to leave the team in this moment," said Petrescu, who also played for Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton and Bradford. "I don't how it'll be in China, I hope it will be like in Russia."
Still, his spell at Targu looks long-term in comparison to the 10 minutes Leroy Rosenior spent as manager of Torquay United in 2007 before being ousted by a consortium who took charge of the club at the time of his appointment.
