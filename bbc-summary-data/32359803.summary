[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scale model of Chester Cathedral to be made in Lego

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester Cathedral has embarked on a four-year project to build a scale model of the landmark in Lego.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is looking for volunteer "bricklayers" to help construct the model, that will be 6ft 6in (2m) in height and 13ft (4m) in length.
The project is expected to use 350,000 pieces - each of which can be purchased for Â£1 to be included in the model.
Cathedral officer Helen Barber said it would "help us to reach new audiences".
Simon Warburton, cathedral director of operations, said: "The unique thing about Chester cathedral is that our architecture spans nearly 1000 years of history.
"The model will recreate each style and so is a really effective way of telling the story of our building."
It will be split in two so the cathedral's interior, including its organ, will also be replicated.
Durham Cathedral started its Lego replica, that is also expected to use 350,000 bricks, in 2013.
