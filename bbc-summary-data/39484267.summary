Brett Ferres: Leeds second row faces ban for 'crusher' tackle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds forward Brett Ferres is facing a ban of up to eight matches after he was charged for a 'crusher' tackle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The England second rower, 30, was sent to the sin bin for the tackle on Wigan centre Oliver Gildart during Friday's Super League win at Headingley.
The tackle, which places excessive pressure on the neck, was deemed dangerous by the Rugby Football League's match review panel.
The charge carries a suspension of four to eight matches.
Former Castleford and Huddersfield player Ferres will face an RFL tribunal on Tuesday and does not have the option of a early guilty plea.
Gildart was due to see a neurologist on Monday, with Wigan coach Shaun Wane expecting him to be sidelined for between two and three months with what he called "a serious back injury".
