Tim Peake aims to rekindle excitement of Moon missions

British astronaut Tim Peake says he hopes his mission to the space station will generate an Apollo-like fervour.

Mr Peake told BBC News that he is going to the orbiting lab primarily to do science, but that his priority will be to share his experiences.
He believes his mission will inspire more young people to become interested in science and engineering.
Mr Peake's six-month stint on the station begins in December when he leaves Earth on a Russian Soyuz rocket.
Friday will see him go in front of the media in his home country for the final time before his great adventure gets under way.
Asked whether he expects to re-ignite the enthusiasm the public felt during the Apollo Moon missions of the 60s and 70s, he said: "I hope it does have an effect like that to some degree."
Britain's astronaut is a modest man. He does not see himself as another Neil Armstrong - or even a Chris Hadfield, whose tweets from the space station caught the imagination of millions of people across the world.
Nonetheless, he wants to drive interest - especially among children - in science and space travel.
"I was really keen that we make the absolute most of this mission to encourage students and young people to get involved in technology and engineering, and to study STEM subjects that will set them up for future careers in those industries," he told me.
Many leading scientists who are now in their fifties or sixties were inspired by Nasa's Moon programme. The UK astronaut said that he was particularly keen to work with schools to reproduce that effect.
"I think it is really important to reach out to our younger generation and to try to encourage them to take up science, technology, engineering and mathematics as subjects. We have a skills shortage at the moment, and we desperately need more graduates with those backgrounds," he explained.

Britain's first "official" - government backed - astronaut thinks it is much more important to be seen as someone who people can relate to rather than a heroic but unapproachable figure.
"These days, we can interact much more easily. We have video, ham radio, we have Twitter, so it is making the space station more accessible... that is important for getting the messages across," he said.
During the working week, Tim will be preoccupied with scientific experiments and maintenance of the space station. But on Saturday afternoons, he told me will be devoted to interacting with the public.
"Hopefully, the mission will be fun and exciting for people to follow. There will be definite scientific principles coming out of it."
"I'll be doing real science onboard the space station and fun science at the weekend, and there will be outreach on all sorts of topics."
With the help of the UK Space Agency, he has already set up activities for children - such as a seed-growing experiment and designing a meal to eat in space. And he plans further activities and demonstrations for people to follow in orbit.
