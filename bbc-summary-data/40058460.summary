Sarah Hunter, who led the side to the Six Nations Grand Slam in March, will again captain the side as locks Emily Braund and Abbie Scott return.
The squad contains 15 of England's 2014 World Cup-winners, with no uncapped names in the squad.
England play Australia on 9 June, Canada on 13 June and New Zealand on 17 June.
All three matches will take place in New Zealand, and the final game in Rotorua will be a curtain-raiser for the British and Irish Lions' game against the Maori All Blacks.
Head coach Simon Middleton his players would have "an excellent opportunity to test themselves against some the leading teams in the world" before the World Cup in August.
"The tight turnaround of games replicates the World Cup schedule and we expect to encounter a great atmosphere which will provide players with the best possible preparation for Ireland," he said.
"The squad have been training together for the last six weeks and I am looking forward to seeing them translate their hard work into first-class performances on the pitch."
