A former Chelsea midfielder - who made £25 a week as a professional footballer in the 1950s - has scooped a £5.5m Lotto jackpot.

Terry Bradbury, 75, played alongside Jimmy Greaves and Terry Venables in the late 1950s.
Mr Bradbury, who also made appearances for Southend United, Leyton Orient and Wrexham, won £5,517,016 in Saturday's National Lottery draw.
He and his wife Eleanor said they planned to buy a family villa in Spain.
The pair, who live in Buxton, Derbyshire, told reporters they would use the winnings to provide security for their four sons and nine grandchildren.
Mrs Bradbury, also known as Ann, said: "The villa will be a place where our family can always go to for holidays.
"It is wonderful to think that none of our children will have a mortgage or any stress for the rest of their lives.
"This win provides our family with security and this is what pleases Terry and myself more than anything."
The couple, who used to run a pub in Tideswell, Derbyshire, said they bought their lucky dip ticket from a WH Smith in Buxton.
Mr Bradbury told reporters the most he earned during his professional football career was £25 each week, getting a £4 win bonus and £2 for a draw.
"I was getting about £20 for playing football but a tradesman was only getting £8 to £10, so it's all relative," he said.
He said Jimmy Greaves was "the greatest goal machine I ever saw" but "ruthless" Dave Mackay was the hardest player he came up against.
Asked about modern players, he said: "Good luck to them. You can't blame the sportsmen. If someone offered you another £1,000 a week you would go."
Mr Bradbury said: "I had a good time at Chelsea, enjoyed every minute - all through my playing career. This is just the icing on the cake for Ann and I."
