Dong Energy confirmed construction would begin in the first half of 2014, and expected the site to be fully operational a year later.
The Westermost Rough wind farm will be located east of Hull in the North Sea, five miles (8km) off the coast.
The government granted planning consent in 2011 for up to 80 turbines on the site.
Henrik Poulson, chief executive of Dong Energy, said: "The size and location of the project is very well suited as the first large scale project with the new Siemens 6 MW turbine.
"The UK offshore wind market is the biggest in the world."
The company said it would supply enough energy to power 210,000 homes.
Components of the turbines could be built in Hull after plans for a Â£210m factory were given the go ahead last year.
Another offshore wind farm containing 73 turbines, the Humber Gateway, is also due to be built close to Westermost Rough.
