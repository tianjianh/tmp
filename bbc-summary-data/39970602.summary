Griffiths, who had earlier scored a penalty, was replaced by Scott Sinclair during the second half at Firhill.
The visitors won 5-0 and Rodgers said of Griffiths: "He is a brilliant boy.
"All strikers will be the same so he just needed a wee reminder that it is not about him, or any individual, this is about the culture of the team."

With Moussa Dembele currently recovering from a hamstring injury, Griffiths has been leading the line for Celtic.
"For a minute he forgot himself," Rodgers said. "For a minute he thought about himself instead of the team.
"This is a team that is selfless. That's why I can change it about, the players know I trust them in their work.
"He was outstanding but he understood afterwards that I needed to protect him as the only fit striker at the moment. There is no drama."
