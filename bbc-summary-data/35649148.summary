Rufus Wainwright, Ben Folds and John Grant had already been announced for the Wales Millennium Centre, which is producing the festival.
Charlotte Church is to star in The Last Mermaid, a musical based on The Little Mermaid.
Other performers include Gwenno Saunders, Mbongwana Star, Ronnie Spector and Scritti Politti.
Full details of the festival, from 3-12 June, have now been announced.
It will be spread across 12 venues in Cardiff and range from classical music from Terfel in Llandaff Cathedral to hip hop in The Tramshed.
Terfel will also perform at a concert with Van Morrison.
One of the smallest events will be a 40-minute opera La Voix Humaine, co-produced with Welsh National Opera, which will be staged in a city apartment with an audience of no more than 36.
Other highlights include:
Graeme Farrow, festival director, said: "The inspiration came from Wales as the land of song and we wanted to take that and explode it across the horizon of  Cardiff.
"Our ambition is to put Wales on the map and reaffirm this accolade as being the greatest nation of singers on the planet and to develop the festival to be a rival of Manchester and Edinburgh and other great festivals."
The aim is to hold the festival every two years and to target audiences across Wales.
