England winger Jonny May says his injury lay-off has been "hell" but he hopes to return to action in October.

The 26-year-old Gloucester back has been out since he damaged his left knee against Harlequins in January.
"It's been really tough and I've worked so hard at this and its coming on the way I would have hoped," he told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"I'm pretty sure I'll be pretty much fully fit by October and then we start to think about getting back out there."
He continued: "I'm up to about 90% of my top speed prior to injury which is not bad considering where I'm at and I'm just thinking if I can go up a percentage a week then I'll be in a good place."
May has scored  seven tries in 19 appearances for England since his international debut in 2012, but his injury put him out of the Six Nations and the triumphant summer tour to Australia.
"Eddie Jones has been wanting updates throughout and he is keen to get me back in there [for England] as soon as possible," May added.
"I saw him at the weekend and he's just saying get fit as quick as you can I just assured him I'm doing everything I can."
