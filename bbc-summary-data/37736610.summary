Blackburn Rovers 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship strugglers Blackburn drew with managerless Wolves in a game marked by protests by home supporters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers fans showed their opposition to Indian owners Venky's by not taking their seats until the 18th minute and then walking out in the 75th minute.
Sam Gallagher's superb early volley put Blackburn ahead at the break.
Dave Edwards headed in Matt Doherty's cross to level but Wolves, who sacked Walter Zenga on Tuesday, are now without a win in their last six games.
Blackburn fans held a protest outside the ground before kick-off, while the timing of their late entry and early departure reflected the date of the club's founding in 1875.
Several banners criticising the club's owners were visible in the sparsely-populated stands at Ewood Park throughout the match.
After falling behind the visitors, with caretaker boss Rob Edwards in the dugout amid reports Nigel Pearson has been interviewed to replace Zenga, looked bright and could have levelled through Edwards or Conor Coady before the break.
Substitute goalkeeper Andy Lonergan denied Rovers striker Gallagher a second goal just after the hour mark and the hosts may have complaints about the equaliser, with Doherty narrowly offside when he picked up the ball after Blackburn keeper Jason Steele palmed away Joao Teixeira's shot.
Victory would have lifted Rovers out of the relegation zone, but they are now 23rd, while Wolves are three points above the bottom three in 17th.
