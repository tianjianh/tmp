The Care Inspectorate raised serious concerns about the Craigard home, near Rothesay, on Bute, in September.
The watchdog issued an improvement notice but later said standards of care were still "unacceptable".
It has now had the care home's registration suspended. The order, which was granted at Greenock Sheriff Court, comes into effect on 9 December.
A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said: "Our most recent inspection identified significant weaknesses in the way people are cared for at this care home which, despite support, have not improved.
"Our assessment is that the home is failing to provide even a satisfactory or safe level of care.
"That is why we sought the urgent closure of Craigard care home, at Greenock Sheriff Court on Monday."
The spokesman said it was "extremely rare" for the inspectorate to take this sort of action.
He added: "The sheriff made an order suspending the care home's registration, to take effect from 9 December. We strongly welcome that.
"This means the home cannot continue to operate after 9 December, which will help keep people safe where they would otherwise have been at significant risk.
"We continue to work closely with colleagues at Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership to ensure that residents' needs are met and that appropriate plans are in place to ensure continuity of care for all residents of Craigard ahead of 9 December."
