A former Malaysian diplomat in New Zealand has pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting a woman in Wellington last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prosecutors said Muhammad Rizalman bin Ismail entered a woman's flat, removed his trousers and underwear, and went into her bedroom.
The two engaged in a struggle and the woman eventually called the police.
He had earlier pleaded not guilty to more serious charges including assault with intent to rape.
He faces a maximum of seven years in prison.
Mr Muhammad Rizalman's lawyers have said that he was mentally unwell at the time.
The incident occurred in May last year when Mr Rizalman was a staff assistant for defence at the Malaysia High Commission.
He was arrested and charged at the time, but returned to Malaysia less than two weeks later under diplomatic immunity protection.
His departure sparked anger in Wellington and a disagreement with Malaysia on how he was able to exercise diplomatic immunity for his exit. Mr Rizalman was eventually extradited back to New Zealand to face trial.
A government inquiry was conducted on the diplomatic incident and the results will be made public after the trial, reported New Zealand Herald.
