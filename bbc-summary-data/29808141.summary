The 26-year-old was released by Rangers in the summer after six years and 104 appearances for the London club.
He started his career at West Ham and has had loan spells at Leeds, Charlton, Bristol City and Peterborough.
"Hogan is the type of player who can win a game with one moment of magic and I'm really excited to bring him here," said boss Gareth Ainsworth.
"The fact that we've signed a player of Hogan's quality shows that players are looking at Wycombe in a different light now.
"I want to add more goals to his game but the chances he creates will be a massive positive for us."
Ephraim, who can also play in midfield, said: "I want to be in an atmosphere where I can smile when I'm playing and that's when I'm at my best.
"The manager and the chairman have given me the opportunity to do that here and I'm looking forward to it."
