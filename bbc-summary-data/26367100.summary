Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis has confirmed that country star Dolly Parton will play this year's festival.

Speaking to BBC 6 Music at Wednesday night's NME Awards, Eavis said the singer had confirmed the "amazing news" earlier that day.
"We're really, really excited because it's been something we've been wanting to happen for a long time. And she finally said yes," said Eavis.
Parton later told her three million followers the news via Twitter.
"I'm incredibly excited to FINALLY announce that the #BlueSmokeWorldTour is coming to @GlastoFest on June 29th! ;) Stay tuned for more infoâ€¦" she wrote.
Parton will perform in Sunday afternoon's renowned "legend slot" on the Pyramid Stage, which last year featured fellow country star Kenny Rogers.
Festival-goers enjoyed a mass singalong of Islands in the Stream - his hit duet recorded with Parton.
"It's one of those rare things where someone like [Dolly] is in the country at the same time as Glastonbury, and we're really, really excited about this. Hopefully Kenny put in a good word," said Eavis.
In an interview with Radio 4's Front Row programme, Eavis added that she had made it her "life's mission" to get Parton to agree to perform at Glastonbury, after being told years ago that she did not do festivals.
"She stands totally alone, she's such a brilliant star and I think one of the greatest female stars of our generation," said Eavis, adding "And she doesn't tour very often."
She also appeared to rule out rumoured headline acts Prince, Stone Roses and Fleetwood Mac, telling BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz it was "unlikely" they would feature on the bill.
"I very much doubt any of them will be on this year," said Eavis.
However, she did admit timings were still a work in progress.
"At the moment we've got a napkin on our fridge and it's got a sort of rough sketch of who's going where," she revealed.
"And then every few days we'll be like 'maybe actually it would be better for him to go on the Friday, and then we'll move her down to third on the Sunday', or something. We're moving it around a lot because its all about balance," she said.
Arcade Fire have already confirmed they are 2014's Friday night headliners for the event.
The Canadian seven-piece revealed the news in December, tweeting a photo bearing the words "June 27 - Glastonbury".
Lily Allen is among the other acts who have already let slip they will be performing, but Eavis said the remaining headline acts would stay a closely guarded secret for now, and would "be with you in the spring."
Eavis was at Wednesday night's NME Awards to pick up the prize for best festival, which she said "means a lot to us".
"It's an important one, because it's the people that actually come to the festival that decide and make that decision that you're the best," she said.
