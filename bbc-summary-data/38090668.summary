[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A report has found festivals supported by a three-year council investment strategy have generated £17.6m for the Dumfries and Galloway economy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority has spent more than £750,000 on events since 2014.
In total, 18 different organisations have received support for 38 events which attracted combined attendances of more than 160,000 people.
The council report added that more than 43% of audiences had come from outside Dumfries and Galloway.
The study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the local authority's Major Festivals and Events Strategy (MFES).
Among the events it has supported are Wigtown Book Festival, Spring Fling and the Dumfries and Galloway Arts Festival.
A survey found there was good public awareness of the strategy, with 85% of respondents saying the events benefited their community.
The majority also said it had helped to provide a "favourable impression" of the council.
The review concluded that the strategy had "generally met its objectives" in terms of supporting the development of the events sector in Dumfries and Galloway.
"The region is increasingly recognised for the breadth and depth of events across a number of sectors staged within its borders each year," it said.
"These contribute significantly to the regional economy as well as to the quality of life of our population."
However, the study did flag up concerns about policing costs at some music festivals in the region.
A meeting is to be held at the end of the month to try to tackle the issue.
