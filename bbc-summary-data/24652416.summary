[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dunfermline to be merged with Nationwide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Dunfermline Building Society is to be merged into its parent company, the Nationwide, with the closure of 25 branches across Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has looked at duplication where branches are very near each other, and 19 are to be closed for that reason.
A further six branches without a nearby alternative will shut.
The lender said the change, by next summer, will mean about 90 fewer staff - about a third of the branch workforce.
It said it was seeking to avoid redundancies by redeployment.
Tony Prestedge, Nationwide's chief operating officer, said: "We have made considerable improvements to our range of products and services, and are now in a position to ensure our members under the Dunfermline brand can have full access to the benefits our other members already enjoy.
"It is a logical step to integrate our businesses under one unified, strong, and nationally recognisable brand.
"The strength of the Nationwide brand is increasingly compelling and we will offer customers of the Dunfermline a vastly improved proposition.
"As well as benefiting from access to our full suite of products and market leading customer service, more people will have access to our strong branch network than at present."
The rebranding will take place over one weekend, expected to be in Summer 2014.
From the following Monday morning, customers will be able to access their accounts from any Nationwide branded branch and Nationwide's online bank if they have already registered.
It has retained Caledonia House, the former headquarters of the Dunfermline Building Society, as a customer service administration and telephone channel centre, for customers across the Nationwide Group.
About 300 jobs are to be based at this site.
The Dunfermline branches that will be integrating with nearby Nationwide branches are: Ayr, Coatbridge, Dundee, East Kilbride, Falkirk, Glasgow (Hope St), Glenrothes, Inverness, Kirkcaldy, Leven, Livingston, Montrose, Paisley, Perth, Shawlands and Stirling.
The Nationwide branches that will integrate with nearby Dunfermline branches are: Cupar, Dunfermline and Hamilton.
The Dunfermline branches that will be rebranded Nationwide are: Aberdeen, Anniesland, Edinburgh, Kirkwall, Peebles, Petreavie and St Andrews.
The Dunfermline branches that will close are: Castle Douglas, Cowdenbeath, Johnstone, Largs, Rosyth and Tranent.
