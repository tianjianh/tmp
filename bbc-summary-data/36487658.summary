Robbie Keane, Jonathan Walters and Robbie Brady all took part in the squad's first training session in France on Thursday morning.
Martin O'Neill's squad arrived at their team base in Versailles on Wednesday.
Walters had not trained for a week because of minor Achilles problems while Keane (calf) and Brady (back) are also recovering from knocks.
Walters was reported to have sustained a bang to his calf on Wednesday but the Republic player of the year said on Saturday that it was an Achilles problem.
Although he did not take part in the inter-squad match, he trained individually with the fitness team.
The Republic face the Swedes in their Group E opener in Paris on 13 June before further games against Belgium and Italy.
