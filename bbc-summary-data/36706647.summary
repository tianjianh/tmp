Doctor's job termination in Jersey 'contrary to law'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The withdrawal of a doctor's contract was "contrary to law, unjust, oppressive", a government complaints panel has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eye consultant Amar Alwitry was due to start at Jersey's General Hospital in December 2012 but was told a week before by the States Employment Board (SEB) his contract had been terminated.
Mr Alwitry said he had queried the safety of certain practices.
SEB said it was considering future legal action over the findings.
The board said it had noted the report's observations and expressed "significant disappointment" regarding a number of conclusions which it said it would not comment on.
Mr Alwitry, who was born in Jersey, said he was "absolutely gutted" when his contract was withdrawn "completely out of the blue".
He said: "I didn't eat for a week.
"My plan was always to come home to serve the people and so I've tailored my entire career to that aim."
The glaucoma specialist said he was told by senior staff at the hospital to "put up or shut up" when he suggested it would be unsafe for him to operate on a Friday unless senior colleagues could provide emergency care over the weekend.
The States Complaints Panel found managers had terminated Mr Alwitry's contract based on their subjective beliefs he was a "trouble maker" and the decision making process was not sufficiently transparent.
It said this reflected "19th Century" practices and it criticised the HR directorate and the then Solicitor General Howard Sharp QC for failing to recognise those problems.
"On a personal level the decision to terminate Dr. Alwitry's contract of employment has destroyed his professional life", the panel said.
Mr Alwitry said he had not found a permanent NHS position since he had resigned as a substantive consultant in Derby to move to Jersey and is considering legal action.
