[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A son who laughed with his father as they walked into the Hillsborough stadium later found him lying dead with other victims, the inquests have heard.

The jury at the new inquests into the 96 deaths focused on the final movements of John Anderson, 62.
Supporters who were near him on the terraces described how he was "crushed" against a barrier as the pressure in the crowd grew.
One said he was shouting for help but eventually "he stopped shouting".
Mr Anderson, known as Jack, worked as a security officer and went to the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final with his son Brian and two friends.
The jury heard they had difficulty getting into the ground from the Leppings Lane end and went in through an opened exit gate, which was opposite a tunnel leading into fenced enclosures behind the goal.
The pair ended up standing in pen four when crushing began.
Spectator Karl Mullee said he was wedged against a barrier with Mr Anderson next to him "in distress".
He said: "His colour changed and he went down and people were screaming at me to do something.
"I managed to grab his hand but I couldn't do anything."
The jury heard how fans tried to resuscitate Mr Anderson on the terraces before carrying him out of the enclosure.
They were seen in footage timed at 15:12 BST carrying him near a gate in the front fence.
Mr Anderson Jr said fans lifted him out of pen four and into the West Stand above.
After leaving the stand he "saw bodies outside" and "realised some people were dead", the jury heard.
In a statement written on the night of the disaster, he said: "I was looking at the bodies to see if I could find my father and saw that he was in fact one of them.
"I realised that he was dead and I identified him there and then to a police constable Hogg."
In a recent statement, Mr Anderson has said his father was "almost the first person he saw" among the bodies at the back of the stand.
Part of a statement by PC David Hogg was read out. He said he saw Mr Anderson Jr beside one of the bodies "sat supporting his arm".
The statement added: "I went over to this man and advised him to seek medical attention, to which he replied 'I'm not going without my dad'."
Earlier the inquests heard about the final movements of 18-year-old John McBrien.
The inquests in Warrington, Cheshire resume on Friday.
