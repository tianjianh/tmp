Harris, 23, made 38 appearances for Cardiff last season and flourished under manager Neil Warnock.
However, he had been linked with a move away as his contract expired this summer.
"Last year I did finally get a chance to prove myself. There's a lot more to come from me and I'm glad that I can now show what I can do," Harris said.
"The manager has spoken to me personally and told me that he's expecting more goals from me in future.
"I'm definitely going to be working on that. I'm thankful that he's given me the chance and hopefully I can repay him.
"I'm delighted. I can officially say that I'm a Bluebird for a further two years."
Cardiff CEO Ken Choo added: "Kadeem is one of our brightest young talents and we're delighted to have secured his future at Cardiff City.
"He impressed last season and we're hoping to see him continue his development over the next two years."
