[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Wales Police said a special misconduct hearing was held on Friday after PC Iain Clarke was jailed for five years.
A court heard on Thursday that Clarke, 48, of Northop, Flintshire, had not shown "an ounce of remorse".
The force said Clarke did not contest that this was a breach of professional conduct and he was dismissed immediately without notice.
Clarke transferred from the Greater Manchester force in 2013 and was part of North Wales Police's major crime team.
