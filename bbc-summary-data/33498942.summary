The world's oldest abseiler, nicknamed "Daring Doris", has increased her record after descending almost 100m (328ft) aged 101.

Doris Long said she felt no fear as she came down Portsmouth's Spinnaker Tower.
The great-great-grandmother last performed the feat on her 100th birthday in May 2014.
The pensioner, who has previously abseiled alongside new Top Gear host Chris Evans, is raising money for the Rowans Hospice in Waterlooville.
Ms Long, who first abseiled aged 85, said: "I don't feel afraid and never have, I just have a placid nature."
Ms Long, who has a daughter, three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren, received cheers and applause from the crowd as she reached the bottom of the tower.
"It was very hard work, much harder than last year," she said. "It was so windy I swung about a bit but oh yes, I enjoyed it, I feel it's well worth it.
"My legs ache like anything and my right arm where I hold the rope and my hair is all sticking out."
"Daring Doris", who has raised more than Â£11,000 for the hospice, said she hopes to repeat the challenge next year aged 102.
Jennie Watson, 42, from Locks Heath, who completed the abseil earlier in the day, said: "You have to be quite agile to get the ropes down but it's the bravery more than anything. How she does it, I have no idea."
