Cardiff City: Hasselbaink urges fans to be patient with Paul Trollope

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has urged fans of his former club Cardiff City to give new boss Paul Trollope time to "impose his philosophy" on the Welsh side.

Trollope's Cardiff are without a win this season - without scoring a goal - and the Bluebirds face bottom club Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday.
Hasselbaink is now manager at QPR and had a similar transition after his arrival at the Championship leaders.
"It's understanding what the new coach is trying to do," said Hasselbaink.
Cardiff's head coach was on the receiving end of boos from a small section of fans at the Cardiff City Stadium following their 2-0 defeat to QPR on Sunday - where his team had just one shot on target - as the hosts continued their poor run of just one win in 10 games.
Trollope has bemoaned his opening "three frustrating games" as Cardiff boss and acknowledged the boos, admitting: "People are entitled to their opinion."
But the former Wales coach has found an ally in Hasselbaink, who as a player helped the Welsh club to the 2008 FA Cup final.
"He wants to impose his philosophy on the club," said the former Netherlands striker, who scored seven goals in 36 Cardiff games.
"If you are supporting the club, you need to give them the support and get behind your team through good and bad times, it will only help the players."
Trollope has now urged his players to "bounce back" against a Blackburn team that are bottom of the table after conceding seven goals in their opening two Championship matches.
"Everyone can appreciate what we are trying to do and where we are trying to go," said Trollope.
"On Wednesday, it is up to us to make sure there is a positive mentality about the team and get on the front foot."
