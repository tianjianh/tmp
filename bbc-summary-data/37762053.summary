Bengoa report analysis: Plenty of ideas but no indication of cost

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This is a report with recommendations. But they are broad in their ideas and their ambitions.

And certainly, at this stage, many are lacking in detail and questions remain on how they will be funded.
So, for example, the Bengoa report talks about addressing the problem of waiting lists, which are among the longest in the UK.
But, there are no targets and no costings here.
The issue of money is very important. Currently, the health service takes up almost half of Stormont's budget.
By 2026, an expert panel has warned that is likely to rise to 90% of the budget unless there is change.
Some of these ideas are not new- like treating more people as outpatients rather than hospital inpatients. And training more people to become GPs and nurses.
But some big, politically difficult decisions suggested by previous reports, such as closing some hospitals, are not dealt with. And everything suggested will take time.
By Health Minister Michelle O'Neill's own admission the health service in Northern Ireland is now at "breaking point".
She said it's something everyone working in the NHS is aware of.
To deal with that there will have to be short-term measures. Like more money to cut those waiting lists.
But, that is not addressed in these reports.
