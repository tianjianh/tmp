A football fan, left brain-damaged after an attack at an away match, received a two-minute standing ovation when he returned to his home club.

Cambridge United fan Simon Dobbin, 44, from Mildenhall, Suffolk, was attacked in Southend in March last year.
He returned to the Cambridge stadium to watch his first live match between the U's and Portsmouth on Saturday.
"It was so lovely to see the smile on his face. He was really lapping it up," his wife Nicole said.
Mr Dobbin was left with life-changing injuries and needs round-the-clock care after he and other supporters were assaulted outside a pub in Southend.
Speaking ahead of Saturday's game, his wife said the family had been "chanting songs to him with his name in them, and he's singing along".
Her husband could now say a few words and recognise people, she said.
He was brought on to the pitch to a lengthy standing ovation from the crowd and both teams.
"I think he thinks today is not about the football, it's all about him," Mrs Dobbin said.
Asked what she hoped his presence at the match would achieve, she said: "I think people will see he has disabilities, but we know Simon's still in there.
"He's trapped in his body, but if it [makes] one person - seeing what's happened to Simon - actually step back and think they don't want this to happen again, then hopefully some good will have come out of it."
The U's chief executive told the crowd: "No-one should ever sustain Simon's life-changing injuries as a result of going to a football match."
Twelve men appeared before magistrates last month charged with violent disorder. Eight pleaded not guilty, while four did not enter a plea.
The case was adjourned until a later date.
