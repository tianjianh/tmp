His mother Magdelena Luczak, 29, was found dead in a prison cell at HMP Foston Hall on Tuesday.
She and her partner Mariusz Krezolek were each jailed for at least 30 years for Daniel's murder. He died from a head injury in March 2012, but had been beaten and starved over several months.
About 10 people gathered at a memorial to Daniel in Coventry on Wednesday.
One of those paying tribute, Angela Sidlow, said it was to "keep Daniel's memory alive".
"Daniel's story really touched me, that someone his age could go through so much and actually survive as long as he did," she said.
"It's important that stories like his aren't just forgotten."
When he died, four-year-old Daniel weighed just over a stone and a half.
Luczak and Krezolek's trial in Birmingham Crown Court heard they had subjected the youngster to "incomprehensible brutality".
He was denied food, forced to perform punishment exercises, confined in a locked box room, poisoned with salt and subjected to water torture.
Mrs Sidlow said she and other members of the Justice For Daniel campaign group were backing calls for a new law to make the reporting of suspected child abuse mandatory - sometimes referred to as Daniel's Law.
"The moment they pass that, I'll be at Daniel's memorial putting up a flag," she said.
Mrs Sidlow said she visited Coventry's St Paul's cemetery every week, to maintain tributes surrounding a memorial stone, which was laid in November 2013.
The Home Office has said it will be consulting on the mandatory reporting of child abuse.
Derbyshire Police has said it will prepare a file for the coroner over Magdelena Luczak's death ahead of any inquest.
