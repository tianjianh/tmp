One of the main sellers of tickets for a Tom Jones concert that ended early after three power failures has told customers they will not be getting a refund.

Ticketmaster said the "majority" of the gig on 8 August went ahead.
Mr Jones performed for 50 minutes at Alnwick Castle before a third power cut ended the show.
Organisers Loose Cannon Events, which is based in Middlesbrough, has not responded to a request for comment.
But on 20 August on their Facebook page, the firm's director Neil Winterbottom said an investigation into the failure of two generators provided by another company was ongoing.
He said: "The facts need to be established and the legal involvement needs agreement between a number of parties before we can advise on any compensation."
In an email sent to a customer, Ticketmaster said ticket sales were no longer under their control and rest with Loose Cannon.
The email said: "We do understand that the main act started a little later than planned, and the end of the show was abrupt because of the power failure, so we've been liaising with Loose Cannon about this.
"However, on this occasion we wouldn't be in a position to offer a refund for tickets as the majority of the event did go ahead."
Ticketmaster ended by advising customers unhappy with other aspects of the event's organisation to contact Loose Cannon directly.
BBC employee Phil Mawson, who paid more than Â£200 for VIP tickets, said Ticketmaster had "failed to acknowledge the fiasco that was the Tom Jones concert".
He said: "They've passed the buck to organisers Loose Cannon, who have yet to come with a viable reason as to what actually happened.
"It was shambolic from start to abrupt finish, no-one seems to be taking responsibility for what turned out so bad for me and 8,000 others."
