With 624 studios, Hackney Wick claims to have one of the highest concentrations of artists in the world.
The Hackney WickED Art Festival is promoting the work of international and local artists through local galleries.
With the Olympics close by, many works will depict the impact and opportunities of the Games on artists.
About 25,000 people went to the three-day festival last year.
Artists have been given access to more than 20 buildings in the area to create "pop-up" galleries and studios, in addition to random events on the streets.
"The buildings probably lend themselves to artistic practice," said Laura-May Lewis, the artistic director and co-founder of the festival.
There was "lots of natural light and affordable rent" in an area which had previously been "quite cut off" by the canal, she added.
