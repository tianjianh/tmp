"We're dealing with an unknown hazard and have called the military who have more experience", a spokesman said.
The Army team is expected to detonate the devices before 20:30 GMT.
Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue said a large amount of smoke would be generated and people living in the immediate area should keep their windows and doors shut.
