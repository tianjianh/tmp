[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 1-2 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-Port Vale loanee Alex Jones returned to haunt his former club as his late goal gave Bradford victory at Vale Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jones' 74th-minute strike helped the Bantams, who were without a win in four matches, get their League One play-off push back on track after JJ Hooper had equalised for the home side following Romain Vincelot's opener.
The French midfielder gave his side the lead after 41 minutes when he beat his man to pop up at the back post and nod Tony McMahon's free-kick past Leonardo Fasan.
Vale levelled in the 58th minute after Anton Forrester crossed for Hooper to tap home from close range, despite Colin Doyle getting a hand to the ball.
But Jones, who scored 10 goals for the Valiants before joining Bradford in January, had the final say in the 74th minute when sliding the ball past Fasan from Alex Gilliead's cross.
The result takes the Bantams up to fifth in the table, while the Valiants - now without a win in eight games - slipped two points adrift of safety.
