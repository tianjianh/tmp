A man who confessed to being addicted to child pornography has been jailed for downloading and sharing thousands of illegal images.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Philip, 57, was caught after his flat was identified as the source of images uploaded to a filesharing site.
During a raid on the flat in Grantham, Lincolnshire Police seized computer equipment found to contain 10,990 indecent images of children.
He was jailed for three and a half years at Lincoln Crown Court.
Robert Sandford, prosecuting, told the court: "He was frank with what he said to the police.
"He was using GigaTribe to share images. He said he would upload images so others could have access to them. He believed he had allowed more than 30 people to access his folder.
"He said he would chat on the site to other like-minded people and they would discuss fantasies. He said he was an addict and needed help."
The court was told Philip had a previous conviction in 2012 for making indecent images and was given a suspended jail sentence.
Philip, 57, of Finkin Street, Grantham, admitted distributing child pornography, together with eight other related charges.
He also admitted breaching conditions of the sex offenders' register.
Judge Michael Heath told him: "You found these images exciting. The great tragedy is that to produce such gratification for people like you, youngsters are grievously abused.
"No one knows the incalculable harm which has been caused to those youngsters by perverted people like you, providing a market for this filth."
Michael Cranmer-Brown, defending, said "He recognises he has a problem and that he needs intensive help to try to prevent him from re-offending.
"His pleas reflect his acceptance of that problem and his remorse for his offending."
