The 30-year-old midfielder, who was born in France, was a free agent after a spell with Kuwaiti club Al-Arabi.
Matmour has spent most of his career in Germany, where he came to the attention of Huddersfield boss David Wagner.
The Terriers have received international clearance and he could make his debut at Brighton on Saturday.
"It is not normal that we would be able to get a player of his quality with no transfer fee," Wagner told the club website.
"He can play in all four attacking positions; on the right, on the left, as a number 10 or number nine.
"This strengthens our forwards and will help me make good decisions to keep them fresh."
Matmour played for four clubs in Germany and appeared in the Bundesliga for Borussia Moenchengladbach and Eintracht Frankfurt.
