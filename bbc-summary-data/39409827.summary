World Cup 2018: Ward says N Ireland can handle pressure

Quickfore goal hero Jamie Ward believes Northern Ireland's Euro 2016 exploits can help them get to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986.

Wards scored in the second minute of Sunday's 2-0 win over Norway which keeps them in contention for a play-off place for next year's finals in Russia.
Michael O'Neill's men are second in Group C with 10 points from five games.
"We have been in this position with the Euros and have the experience of pressurised games," said Ward.
"We are extremely confident going into every game and are not worrying about what the other teams in the group do.
"We have made a good start, we have 10 points and we just have to focus like we did in the Euros."
Germany, with a 100% record, appear destined to top the group - but O'Neill's men believe a play-off place is there to be grabbed.
O'Neill believes victory away to Azerbaijan in June would essentially make it a two-horse race with the Czech Republic for second place.
The Czechs, two points behind Northern Ireland, still need to travel to Belfast and that could be a huge game in the qualification shake-up.
Manager O'Neill said: "We're in a great position.
"Norway was a game that I was apprehensive about - just going up against such an experienced coach as Lars Lagerback.
"Norway came with nothing to lose, they had to win the game to keep themselves alive in the group and that made them a very dangerous opponent.
"We took care of the job and have given ourselves a substantial cushion over Norway.
"We play Azerbaijan now and we can put the distance between us and them to six points and then it starts to look very much like ourselves, the Czech Republic and Germany.
"Once you get to 10 points you start to look at the fixtures that are ahead and start to think of what you may need and we're in that position now.
"We have a difficult game in Baku, but we couldn't go into it in better shape."
