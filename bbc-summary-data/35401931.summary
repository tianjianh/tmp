About 450 properties across the country were affected on Tuesday morning another 700 later in south west Wales but most have had power restored.
Many flood alerts are also in place and the Met Office warned up to 10cm (4in) could fall on Tuesday and Wednesday.
A spokesman said rain would be "heavy and persistent" and accompanied by severe gales at times.
On Tuesday afternoon, Western Power Distribution was attempting to restore power to 300 homes in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, along with 250 in Ammanford and 120 in Llanelli, both in Carmarthenshire.
Earlier in Carmarthenshire, about 250 homes were without power in Newcastle Emlyn, while 124 properties in Tumble had supplies cut because of a fallen tree.
A smaller number of properties were affected in Llandeilo, Neath, Merthyr Tydfil, Cardiff and Porth.
Scottish Power also reported power cuts in Tycroes, on Anglesey, and in Bethesda, Gwynedd.
The poor weather has also had an impact on those travelling.
Speed restrictions are in place on the M48 Severn Bridge in Monmouthshire and on the A55 Britannia Bridge on Anglesey.
Arriva Trains Wales tweeted flooding had closed the line between Pwllheli and Criccieth in Gwynedd, but that has now reopened.
Network Rail warned passengers services would run at a reduced speed on the line from Chester to Holyhead when high winds hit.
