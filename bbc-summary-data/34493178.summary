[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leeds United 1-2 Brighton & Hove Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Bobby Zamora scored his first goal for Brighton since returning to the club to give the Championship leaders a late win at Leeds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The veteran striker showed a great touch to chip the ball past home goalkeeper Marco Silvestri in the 89th minute.
After a quiet opening, Solly March gave the visitors the lead in the 14th minute with a low finish.
Leeds levelled through Liam Cooper's glancing header from a free-kick.
Zamora's goal was his first for the Seagulls since May 2003 and helped them extend their lead at the top to four points and stretch their club-record unbeaten start to the season to 11 games.
In contrast, Uwe Rosler's men have now won just one of their last six matches and are winless in their last 11 home games - a new club record.

The hosts had started brightly before Beram Kayal played March through on goal and the 21-year-old kept his composure to score his first of the season inside the first 15 minutes.
Leeds responded well and got a deserved equaliser in the 23rd minute when Cooper flicked Alex Mowatt's free-kick beyond Seagulls keeper David Stockdale.
Mowatt came close to giving Leeds the advantage after the break when he charged down a Stockdale clearance and the ball hit the outside of the post.
March hit the bar and Tomer Hemed saw an effort saved by Silvestri before veteran Zamora won it with a lovely finish when the hosts were down to 10 men, with Cooper having gone off injured with all three substitutes used.
Leeds United head coach Uwe Rosler:
"Things are just not going for us at the moment. There were three key moments in the game. They scored from their first attack and I feared the worst but we showed terrific character and got a quick equaliser.
"The second key moment was when Chris Wood didn't take his unbelievable opportunity. The game looked like ending 1-1 so we brought on Mirco Antenucci and Will Buckley to try and win it but the third key moment was Liam Cooper's injury, leaving us with 10 men.
"Having said all that, we can't feel sorry for ourselves. There are a lot of people far worse off than us so we have to pick ourselves up and go again. I feel a bit sorry for the players, supporters and owner. When you invest as much as the players do in training and get so little back it's disappointing."
Brighton & Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton:
"We deserve to be where we are at the moment. We were probably not at our best today but we showed a willingness to fight to the end and get the right result. Bobby Zamora came on and scored about ten minutes later and I am delighted for him.
"We know what he gives us but it was a team effort at that stage of a game that seemed to be petering out into a draw. Bobby wasn't up to speed in pre-season, so we knew it would take time, but we have been able to use him at the right times.
"He gave us exactly what we needed when he came on. The players very much wanted to win the game and it showed."
