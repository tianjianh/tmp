Hundreds of protesters and Trump supporters were packed into the 9,500-seat auditorium at the University of Illinois in Chicago on Friday for hours before Mr Trump was due to talk.
Tempers flared as verbal abuse was shouted between the two sides, and Trump supporters held up their posters and placards in defiance.
Tussles and skirmishes ensued between the two sides.
At one point outside the arena, some protesters lay on the floor to prevent vehicles leaving the university car park.
Flags bearing Trump's name were also burned on the streets.
Back inside, Trump's supporters help placards reading: "The silent majority stands with Trump."
Mr Trump's campaign said he decided to postpone the event after meeting with police, although the Chicago Police Department said it did not advise Mr Trump to cancel the rally.
Trump described the cancellation of the rally as "an intelligent decision".
Police on horse back were drafted in to help control crowds outside the venue.
After hours of chaos, cleaners were left to collect the torn and discarded campaign posters.
