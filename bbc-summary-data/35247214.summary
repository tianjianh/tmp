The blast happened in the early hours of Monday at the Weston Road branch in Long Ashton, near Bristol.
Cash was stolen and three men were arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.
Two men, aged 22 and 24, from Southport near Liverpool have been held on suspicion of the same offence.
Villagers described the attack on the building as "shocking", "insane" and "a hideous act".
Owners David Andrews and Andrew Crabb said they hope to reopen "as soon as possible" after assessing the damage.
Many villagers posted their support on the store's Facebook page.
