[SN]TITLE[SN]
Murderer William Dunlop denies rape and assault claims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted murderer has gone on trial accused of historical sex offences against two teenage girls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Dunlop, of Billingham, Teesside, was jailed in 2006 over the 1989 killing of Julie Hogg.
It is now alleged he raped one girl and forced himself on to another with the offences said to have taken place in Billingham and at Mr Dunlop's home from the mid-1980s to the early-1990s.
He denies three counts of rape and two charges of indecent assault.
On the opening day of the trial, a jury at Teesside Crown Court heard from one of the complainants who said she was raped on several occasions.
She said she had been left disgusted by what had happened to her and had been unable to tell her parents.
The second alleged victim described having to fight off Mr Dunlop as he tried to kiss her.
Both girls were under the age of 16 at the time.
Mr Dunlop's legal team told the jury the claims had been fabricated and said there were inconsistencies in the timings and dates given.
The trial continues.
