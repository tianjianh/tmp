Mevagissey council rethink on Hitlers Walk sign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to reinstate the name Hitlers Walk at a park in Cornwall will be reconsidered after complaints.

Legend has it the park in Mevagissey was named Hitlers Walk after a dictatorial councillor in the 1930s.
Signs were taken down in 2005 by the now-defunct Restormel council after complaints the name was offensive.
But the parish council decided to reinstate the nameplate; a decision described by a Jewish group as "outrageous".
Kehillat Kernow, which represents the Jewish community in Cornwall, has called for a boycott of the town if the sign is reinstated.
Harvey Kurzfield, from Kehillat Kernow, said: "I think it's outrageous and completely unfeeling."
The parish council clerk said he had received a number of complaints about the sign.
Council chairman Mike Roberts confirmed the authority would be reviewing its decision but declined to comment further.
James Mustoe, Cornwall councillor for Mevagissey, said: "It's a difficult one. As a local person it has been known as Hitlers Walk.
"But I would advise the parish council to put an explanation as to why it's called that."
