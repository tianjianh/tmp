Daniel James' late penalty gave Wales a first win in the competition after an opening draw against hosts France.
Page's side face Ivory Coast in their final Group B game on Monday.
"It's always a good sign when you win games of football and you haven't been at your best," said former Wales defender Page.
"We probably played better against France and didn't win.
"If someone would have said before the tournament that we'd be two games in and with four points going into the third game I'd snap their hand off.
"It's our first time in this tournament and we've been up against excellent opposition against France and a different challenge against Bahrain."
Wales are second after their win over Bahrain with next opponents Ivory Coast top of Group B after they beat France.
