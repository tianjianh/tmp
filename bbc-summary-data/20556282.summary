[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 16-year-old who cannot be named, had denied a charge of murder at Birmingham Crown Court.
Saleem Hassan, 21, died in June from serious head injuries following the attack near the Noor-Ul-Uloom Mosque in Small Heath.
The boy was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on 11 January.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the attack happened after "a verbal altercation" between Mr Hassan and the defendant's brother inside the mosque.
Wendy Stevens, from the CPS, said the boy saw the altercation "and rather than avoid getting involved, ran home and picked up a baseball bat with which he returned to the scene and launched an attack on Saleem".
West Midlands Police said Mr Hassan was struck twice on the head , once when he was "motionless on the floor".
He died five days later in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, police said.
