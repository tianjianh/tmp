A crowdfunding campaign has been launched to complete Orson Welles' unfinished final film.

The Other Side of the Wind, which began filming 45 years ago and stars cinematic legends John Huston and Peter Bogdanovich, has never been seen.
A goal of $2m (Â£1.3m) has been set on crowdfunding Indiegogo, to fund the editing, score and post production.
This year the 100th anniversary of Welles' birth is being celebrated.
The movie has been described as "a scathing tale of friendship, betrayal, media and ambition in Hollywood".
Fans have until 14 June to donate, with perks including limited edition film prints and invitations to the movie's world premiere on offer for donations.
"Had crowdfunding been around in the 1970s, I believe Orson would have embraced it as a way of engaging filmgoers directly," said one of the movie's producers, Filip Jan Rymsza.
"Shot over five years in multiple formats, finishing the film is a huge technical undertaking."
Welles' daughter Beatrice has also put her name to the campaign.
"My father struggled his whole life to find funding to finish his pictures, but never as much as he did for this one," she said.
"He would truly be ecstatic to know that it was the people who really cared about his work who, in the end, brought his last dream to fruition."
