The Slide on Cancer in Londonderry's Shipquay Street was organised by Cancer Research UK as a fundraiser.
The custom-built slide is open from 10.00-17:00 BST on Saturday and Sunday.
Participants launch themselves onto the slide at the top of the street and finish at Shipquay Gate in a huge "splash zone."
