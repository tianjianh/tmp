Emergency services were called to the Albert Bar, in Clark Street, Airdrie, at 00:50 on Monday. No-one was injured.
Police said that the pub's CCTV filmed a man breaking a window and pouring a liquid inside which he set alight.
They  have asked for help in tracing the "reckless" individual, described as white, in his late 20s to early 30s, with a full beard and muscular build.
At the time of the fire attack he was wearing a white T-shirt which he had covered with a black bin liner.
Det Con Joe Peebles, of Police Scotland, said: "When this man started the fire the flames blew back on him and it's possible he could have been burned.
"If you know anyone fitting the description that may have scalding on his body, then please contact police.
"It was a totally reckless act and the man responsible has absolutely no regard for anyone's safety or the effect the damage will have on the owner's business."
Det Con Peebles said the damage caused by the fire ran to thousands of pounds and flats next to the pub had to be evacuated.
He added: "No one was injured but it could have been much worse, indeed, if it hadn't been for the actions of a passing taxi driver who put out the flames with his fire extinguisher, there is no doubt the pub would have burned to the ground and there would have been significant damage to the flats above."
