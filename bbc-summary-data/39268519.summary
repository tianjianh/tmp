Mayfair Lamborghini crash: Man admits lying to police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man whose friend crashed a hired supercar in Mayfair has pleaded guilty to lying about his actions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Talal Alkassab, 39, from west London, hired the Lamborghini Gallardo in July 2015 but, within hours, Diyaa Lababidi had smashed it into some shops.
Alkassab told police a stranger had taken his keys, unbeknown to him, and crashed the car while parking.
He admitted conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over the crash, which caused damage in excess of Â£100,000.
Lababidi, 33, of Peninsula Apartments, Praed Street, west London - who had no driving insurance - pleaded guilty on 22 December to the same offence.
Southwark Crown Court heard Lababidi crashed into the shop frontages in Woodstock Street, Mayfair, as he was accelerating and then walked away without reporting the crash.
Although the two men had claimed ignorance of the accident of 23 July, police found texts between them that led Alkassab, of Holland Park Road, to confess it was his friend who had been driving the car.
The pair are due to be sentenced on 11 April.
