[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff council has given developers reserved matters planning permission to redevelop two sites either side of Llantrisant Road in Llandaff.
House builder Taylor Wimpey will start on the 17-acre Llandaff Park scheme when BBC Wales moves to its new HQ at Cardiff's Central Square in 2019.
The sale helps fund BBC Wales' new centre next to Cardiff Central station.
The developers were given outline planning permission to develop the two BBC sites in 2015.
Taylor Wimpey propose to build 364 houses and flats on the split site.
Cardiff council say the permission allows the developer to focus on details like appearance, access, landscaping, layout and scale.
