Police Scotland said a 23-year-old man was driving a yellow Ford Transit on the A71 between Hermiston and Dalmahoy when he noticed a black car driving very closely behind.
When he pulled over, the car driver got out and attacked him, leaving him with a "puncture wound" in his chest.
Police are treating the attack at about 21:15 on Sunday as attempted murder.
The van driver was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where his condition was described as "stable".
The suspect was described a white man with a light brown beard.  He was wearing a black hooded top with the hood up and dark gloves.
Det Sgt Martin McKay of Corstorphine CID said:  "This was a brutal attack on a member of the public and we are eager to trace the man responsible as soon as possible.
"I would urge anyone who recognises the description of the man, or saw either a black car or a yellow Ford Transit on the A71 around 9.15pm on Sunday, 11 December, to get in touch with us immediately."
