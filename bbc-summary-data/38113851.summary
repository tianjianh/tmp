Stoke City 2-0 Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marc Muniesa scored his first Premier League goal to seal a deserved home win for Stoke over Burnley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Jonathan Walters put Stoke ahead with an exquisite finish, guiding home a volley from Mame Biram Diouf's teasing cross.
Spanish defender Muniesa made it 2-0 before half-time thanks to a crisp low volley following clever play on the left flank by Marko Arnautovic.
Burnley went close late on when Andre Gray's angled shot was parried by goalkeeper Lee Grant.
Stoke withdrew Arnautovic in the second half after he was on the receiving end of a strong tackle from on-loan Liverpool full-back Jon Flanagan.
Potters defender Bruno Martins Indi was also floored by an elbow from Ashley Barnes, although he recovered to complete the game.
Stoke's fifth win in seven games lifted them to ninth in the table, while Burnley slipped to 14th spot courtesy of a third successive defeat.
Eyebrows were raised when Stoke manager Mark Hughes decided not to recall Joe Allen to his starting line-up following suspension.
The former Liverpool midfielder has been one of Stoke's most influential performers this season and has scored four league goals.
Hughes, though, stuck with the same team which saw won 1-0 at Watford last weekend, and was rewarded with another determined and disciplined display.
The starting line-up might have lacked some of their star players - Wilfried Bony, Peter Crouch, and Bojan KrKic were also left on the bench - but Stoke proved the whole is greater than the sum of its parts to clinch a second win in a row.
Burnley's away record this season does not make pretty reading: one point, five defeats, one goal scored and 16 conceded.
Premier League survival will largely be determined by how many games they win in the familiar surroundings of Turf Moor.
However, it is essential the Clarets pick up points on the road sooner rather than later, especially against their fellow relegation contenders.
Two goals from Danny Ings gave Burnley a 2-1 win over Stoke in their previous meeting at the Potteries in November 2014.
Victory was Burnley's first away from home in the 2014-15 season, but there was no danger of a repeat on this occasion.

Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "We performed superbly well in the first half and then the second half was more about game management and making sure we defended well as a group, which we did.
"I get a lot of pleasure from us doing that because it shows all the elements and characteristics of a really strong-minded group of players, which is what I have here.
"We see ourselves as a top-10 club so we have to maintain these levels now and try to build on the fact that we have suffered just one defeat in nine."
Burnley boss Sean Dyche: "I know we have to change our away form. That's an important part of the Premier League and, even though that's difficult, there were clear signs today that was a team that went to win a game.
"We haven't shown that much away from home, but we did today and I thought the mentality was clear and some of the football was good.
"We just have to keep believing we will get our rewards if we keep performing like that."
