Clanmil Housing Group said the financing will underpin an eight-year build programme which will support up to 500 jobs in the construction sector.
It is the second recent major funding announcement involving social housing.
Earlier in the month, the European Investment Bank agreed £280m of loans with two other housing associations.
"These investments demonstrate the social housing sector is playing an important role in bolstering and growing our economy," said Steve Amos, the chair of Clanmil.
The loans are "on attractive terms" from three local banks.
Around 40,000 people in Northern Ireland are on the waiting list for low-rent social housing.
