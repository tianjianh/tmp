[SN]TITLE[SN]
Premier Division: Drogheda United 0-0 Derry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City had Gerard Doherty to thank as they extended their unbeaten run to nine games by drawing 0-0 in Friday's Premier Division game in Drogheda.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a game of few chances, keeper Doherty made two great saves to deny Marc Griffin early in the second half.
Doherty then denied Jake Hyland in the 88th minute although Derry substitute Rory Holden headed a great chance wide in injury-time.
Derry's Mikhail Kennedy tested Drogheda replacement keeper Robbie Coulter.
Coulter had to be introduced early in the contest after Stephen McGuinness was stretchered off because of a head injury.
Before Friday's match, Derry City boss Kenny Shiels had spoken about the importance of playing entertaining football but his players were unable to deliver that on Friday evening.
Derry had an early let-off as Sean Brennan fired wide after a mistake by Dean Jarvis.
After keeper McGuinness had been replaced, Derry had a penalty shout as Drogheda's Kevin Farragher fouled Kennedy but referee Keith Kennedy adjudged that the offence had happened just outside the box.
With Ronan Curtis providing Derry's only real attacking threat, the home defence were being asked few questions whereas Doherty had to react brilliantly to deny Griffin twice after the resumption.
Replacement keeper Coulter pushed away Kennedy's shot on 70 minutes but Doherty had to maintain his concentration right to the end as he pushed away Hyland's effort on 88.
Substitute Holden could have won in for Derry as he headed a corner wide but in truth a winner in this low-quality contest would have been an injustice.
Derry remain in fourth place, two points behind third-placed Bray, who drew 2-2 at home to Sligo Rovers on Friday night.
Leaders Cork City's 4-1 home win over Shamrock Rovers keeps them 15 points clear of defending champions Dundalk, who won 2-0 at St Patrick's Athletic.
