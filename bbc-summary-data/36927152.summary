Hamilton Accies: Georgios Sarris signs two-year contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greek centre-half Georgios Sarris has signed a two-year contract with Hamilton Academical after leaving Kayseri Erciyesspor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old joined the Turkish club from AEK Athens last summer, signing a one-year deal.
But the Blue Dragons were relegated from the top-flight after a season in which Sarris made 26 appearances.
Sarris could make his debut in Saturday's final Scottish League Cup group game against Livingston.
Accies are short of cover in central defence, with Jesus Garcia Tena having picked up a knee ligament injury that will rule him out for most of the season.
Player-manager Martin Canning is also ruled out of the Scottish Premiership side with a broken cheek bone.
Canning had attempted to sign Sarris last summer, but the Greek accepted the more lucrative offer from the Turkish club.
Sarris began his career with Ergotelis in his homeland but moved to AEK in 2014 and made nine appearances - eight of them starts - for the Greek top-flight club.
