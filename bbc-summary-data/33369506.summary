A video uploaded on Facebook showed Callum Clatworthy-Robins, 22, from Port Talbot, consuming a fish won at a fair in Bridgend county in March.
Clatworthy-Robins admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal at Swansea Magistrates' Court.
He was barred from owning animals for three years and ordered to pay Â£200 in fines and costs on Thursday.
RSPCA Cymru said the actions of Clatworthy-Robins, of no fixed abode, would have caused the animal "quite an unpleasant death".
