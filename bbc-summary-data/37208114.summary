The United Airlines pilots, aged 35 and 45, were held in the cockpit by police ahead of the 09:00 flight on Saturday.
Their jet, which was headed for Newark Airport, had started boarding its 141 passengers. It eventually took off at 19:15 with a new flight crew on board.
The men are expected to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court on Monday.
Police Scotland said the pilots were arrested in connection with alleged offences under the Railways and Transport/Safety Act 2003 (Section 93).
This covers "carrying out pilot function or activity while exceeding the prescribed limit of alcohol".
United Airlines said the pilots, both believed to be US citizens, had been removed from service and their flying duties pending an investigation.
A spokesman said the safety of customers and crew "is their highest priority".
Two Canadian pilots appeared in court earlier in July after being arrested at Glasgow Airport on suspicion of being impaired through alcohol.
Captain Jean-Francois Perreault, aged 39, and Imran Zafar Syed, who is 37, were due to fly an Air Transat plane with 345 passengers and nine crew on board.
They were released on bail and are due to return to court at a later date.
