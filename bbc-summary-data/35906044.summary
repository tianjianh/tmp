The Spaniard, seeded fifth, had called for the doctor twice before he pulled out trailing 3-0 in the deciding set against world number 94 Damir Dzumhur.
"Hopefully it's nothing, it's just the extreme conditions," said Nadal.
"I called the doctor a couple of times but I felt I was not safe there, so I decided to go."
Dzumhur, the world number 94 from Bosnia-Herzegovina, was leading 2-6 6-4 3-0 after one hour and 50 minutes when Nadal called it a day.
"Everything was fine until the end of the first set," added the 29-year-old.
"I started to feel not very good, it was getting worse and worse and worse. In the second set I realised that I was not able to keep playing. I tried to resist but I got a little bit scared to be too dizzy.
"I wanted to finish the match but I seriously couldn't."
The last match Nadal retired from was the 2010 Australian Open quarter-final against Britain's Andy Murray.
Fourth seed Stan Wawrinka was another leading name to make an early exit, the Swiss player going down 6-4 6-3 to Russia's Andrey Kuznetsov.
