Glamorgan players past and present are organising fund-raising efforts to support former coach John Derrick.

Derrick, 53, is still undergoing medical treatment after surgery for a brain tumour.
"John has been involved in cricket for more than 35 years so it is a very easy phone call for us to make asking people to support him" said ex Glamorgan player Mike Powell.
It is hoped the funds will help Derrick adapt his house.
Powell is working alongside county chief executive Hugh Morris,  Professional Cricketers' Association official Ian Thomas and current wicket-keeper Mark Wallace, the former chairman of the PCA.
The four are organising a major dinner at the SSE Swalec Stadium on December 8, with former England spinner and national selector Geoff Miller speaking free of charge.
The PCA has already started to help Derrick.
"John has been my coach since I was ten. He was a bit of father figure throughout my career," said Powell.
"If it wasn't for John I would definitely not have played first-class cricket, so I owe my career to him.
"We said that we would raise as much our end to marry up with what the PCA  Benevolent Fund was doing. We got our heads together and decided to do a dinner for John."
Derrick played for Glamorgan from 1983 to 1991 and coached them to National League titles in 2002 and 2004.
He is currently performance manager of the Cricket Board of Wales and has continued to play at club level, but was taken ill in August 2016.
He did stints on BBC Wales commentaries earlier in the summer.
A JustGiving page has also been set up so that those who cannot attend the dinner can donate.
"It's been very humbling to see Welsh cricket pulling in tight when we have needed it" added Powell.
"Cricket clubs around Glamorgan have been phenomenal. A lot of them have taken a table at the dinner, which shows how much John is loved in this part of the world."
