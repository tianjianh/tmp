They also found the north London facility was overcrowded, understaffed and had frequent staff sickness.
Their report said the majority of prisoners spent more than 18 hours a day locked up and others spent as little as one hour outside their cell.
The agency in charge - the National Offender Management Service - said a "robust recovery plan" was in place.
Pentonville Prison is a Category B jail run by the government.
Inspectors recorded 1,264 prisoners being accommodated when they visited in February but highlighted the capacity it should be aiming for was about 909 people.
Nick Hardwick, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: "The prison needs a firmer grip and a persuasive plan that will ensure immediate deliverable and sustained improvements, as well as a more considered medium-term plan that will determine whether the prison has a future."
The prison was deemed to have been performing badly during an inspection in 2013 and inspectors went back in February this year and found continuing problems.
These included:
Michael Spurr, Chief Executive Officer of the National Offender Management Service, said the prison was going through a "difficult time" when inspectors visited, as it was short-staffed and its standards of cleanliness were unacceptable.
He said: "Since the inspection a robust recovery plan has been put in place. The prison has an able governor, the management team has been strengthened, staffing numbers have increased, there has been a crack down on the illicit use of drugs and cleanliness has markedly improved."
