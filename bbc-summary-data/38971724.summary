The Chase School, in Malvern, confirmed Richard Jacobs was not currently working, but released no more details.
The Malvern Observer reported Mr Jacobs issued a letter warning teaching jobs were going to be made redundant due to a fall in pupil numbers.
The school has not explained his special leave but said the deputy head teacher would become acting head.

Matt May, chair of governors, said deputy head teacher Mike Fieldhouse was "highly respected" and the governors had "absolute confidence in the ability of his experienced leadership team to cover this difficult time".
The school "in common with schools across the country, continued to face a significant financial challenge," Mr May said.
