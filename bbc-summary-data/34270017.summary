Roastie from the postie: How a first class spud crossed Irish Sea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a food delivery to home with a difference after a first class spud made it from England to Londonderry in the post.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lone Maris Piper potato made it all the way across the Irish Sea, with nothing but a stamp on it.
It could have been a mash-up, but duly arrived in one piece at its destination on Saturday.
A postman called to the home of the Bradley family in Oakbridge Park telling them: "Parcel - take it or leave it".
Traditionally a staple of the Irish diet, the spud was sent by Dermot Bradley's sister, Edel, from Birmingham as a thank you for helping organise her potato-themed wedding.
Dermot said he was astonished when he saw the delivery with a difference.
"My 11-year-old son answered the door and he came in with his eyes as wide as saucers and he just stood there with the spud in his hands," said Dermot.
"We just erupted into laughter.
"The postie told me that in 14 years, that was the most unusual delivery he ever made."
After the hot potato pandemonium had died down, the Bradley family noticed a message on the back of the spud thanking Dermot for a wonderful wedding.
"Edel's been living in England for a long time and she decided to come back to Derry to get married," he said.
"Ireland being synonymous with the spud, she decided to have a spud-themed wedding.
"She's a good, practical Derry woman so she went and bought two stone of spuds to decorate the hotel."
Royal Mail do indeed get some very intriguing items sent through the post and are often surprised in the "sautÃ© office".
A spokeswoman said:  "We've had traffic lights, insects, lizards, live scorpions, fruit and even prosthetic limbs.
"However, unwrapped items of food that are perishable should not be sent in the post as they could damage other customers' mail and our own machinery.
"We strongly encourage customers not to post anything into the postal system which is not properly packaged or is on our restricted list.  Customers can obtain advice from any Post Office branch on packaging and restrictions."
