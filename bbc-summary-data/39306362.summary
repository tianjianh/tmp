Striker Zohore a 'revelation' says Cardiff boss Warnock

Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock says Kenneth Zohore is one of the best strikers in the Championship after being "not far away from being a waste of time" just a few months ago.

Zohore's double helped Cardiff to a 3-1 win over Ipswich Town as the Denmark U21 striker took his tally to nine goals in his last 10 league games.
"I wouldn't swap him for many in the Championship," said Warnock.
"He's got every attribute and you can't coach what he has got."
Warnock believes his management has been key in getting the best out of Zohore.
"There was not a player here like that when I came here," Warnock told BBC Wales Sport.
"He was not a waste of time, but he wasn't far away from being a waste of time.
"He walked about, wouldn't tackle, wouldn't chase back and he wore gloves everywhere.
"You name it really.
"But he's a good lad and the chat I had with him against Wolves at half-time (in December) was obviously vital, because he's been a revelation since then."
Warnock says the transformation in Zohore's game is comparable to that of some Premier League and international players he has worked with in his lengthy managerial career.
"Oh yeah, Victor Moses (now at Chelsea) was one, there have been a few players who surprised me," Warnock said.
"A few that didn't realise (how good they could be). Phil Jagielka (Everton and England) is another, when I first got hold of him.
"Some lads don't believe in themselves and need convincing.
"The minimum you should get out of a player is 100%. Then the ability goes on top.
"You need that work ethic at any level of the game.
"When you do that, you make your own luck, as Gary Player used to say."
However, Warnock is unconcerned that rival clubs might be looking at Zohore, who he has previously stated was not for sale, even at Â£20 million.
"He will not be going anywhere," added Warnock.
"I am happy with that. They won't sell him behind my back, I will tell you that.
"I think Vincent (Tan) is enjoying it as much as me."
Warnock also feels he has improved winger Kadeem Harris, whose direct running led to Cardiff's third goal.
"He's another one like Ken, I think he needs me more than I need him," he said.
"I thought he'd been here six months, but he's been here three or four years,"
"So he's been a waste of time, hasn't he? So hopefully the penny drops and he stays with us.
"I have talked to his dad a couple of times. Sometimes the grass looks greener on the other side, but if I was Kadeem, I would be looking to stay here.
"He has someone who believes in him and gives him a chance."
