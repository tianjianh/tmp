Theresa May urged to review Gurpal Virdi sex charge case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Home Secretary Theresa May is being urged to review the case of a retired Asian police officer investigated on a sex charge by the force that previously racially discriminated against him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Met Police sergeant Gurpal Virdi was cleared three weeks ago of sexually abusing a boy in a police van in 1986.
Mr Virdi and his supporters claim the inquiry was maliciously motivated. Scotland Yard has denied the claims.
Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley has written to Mrs May asking to discuss the case.
Sir Peter, who campaigns against race discrimination, said "malice" and "incompetence" may have played a part in the police investigation.
It took a jury less than an hour to clear Mr Virdi, 56, of Hounslow, west London, last month at Southwark Crown Court.
He had been accused of indecent assault and misconduct in a public office following an investigation by the Metropolitan Police.
Mr Virdi, who served in the Met for 30 years, claimed the force's investigation into the allegations was part of a "vendetta" against him.
He said: "The Met has continually campaigned to discredit me. It's twice they've tried to put me in prison and twice they've been criticised."
He also claimed there was "a culture within the Met which is racist and attacks people who tell the truth".
He was sacked in 2000 for allegedly sending racist hate mail, only to be reinstated and awarded Â£240,000 compensation after an employment tribunal ruled he had been the victim of racism.
During the trial, Mr Virdi accused the Met of bringing the criminal case against him as part of a 17-year campaign to "hound" him out of the force.
The retired detective claimed the police tried to discredit him after he gave evidence to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry about racism within the police force.
Mr Virdi retired from the Metropolitan Police in 2012 after 30 years of service.
