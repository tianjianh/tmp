Luke Jerram pixelated sculpture at Bristol Temple Meads

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sculpture of a girl which appears to fragment as the person looking at it moves closer has been installed at Temple Meads railway station.

Bristol-based artist Luke Jerram created the work called Maya using more than 5,000 photographs of his daughter.
Mr Jerram said he was inspired by the "billions of images uploaded to the internet every year".
The piece has been installed on platform three, where Mr Jerram's daughter saw it for the first time.
'Coloured stickers'
Mr Jerram, who is the artist behind Play Me I'm Yours, which has seen pianos appear on city streets around the world, said: "From a distance, people coming through the station may be almost concerned to see what looks like a young girl stood by herself, but as they move closer, she will pixelate just like a computer image does.
"There's a certain distance when standing in front of the sculpture that the pixels disappear and the image of the girl comes together.
"The sculpture goes ping - it's really fun."
The artwork was made by scanning Mr Jerram's daughter using an Xbox Kinect.
Her head was scanned at the Machine Vision Laboratory at the University of the West of England where Mr Jerram is a visiting Senior Research Fellow.
Both scans were then combined and pixelated into cubes, called voxels.
The model was then made from precision-cut sheets of aluminium.
Finally more than 5,000 coloured stickers were printed and fixed on to the aluminium.
The sculpture is part of a series of Bristol Temple Quarter Commissions, designed to engage people with the new Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone.
The aim is to encourage artists and audiences to explore the area, engage with its history and its future.
