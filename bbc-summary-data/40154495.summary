Team WNT's Archibald, 23, came from behind to beat Drops' Laura Massey and 2016 champion Nikki Juniper, riding for Team Ford Ecoboost, in a close sprint.
"It feels good. My first was 2014, and it feels just as fun," Scot Archibald told British Cycling.
Chanel Mason of Storey Racing leads the overall standings after four of the nine rounds.
