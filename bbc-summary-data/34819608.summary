More than 80 of those at the concert were killed when several gunmen stormed the Bataclan concert venue.
The band members were unhurt but Nick Alexander, a Briton selling merchandise at the gig, was among those killed.
On Friday, the group issued a short Facebook statement saying: "Our thoughts are with all of the people involved in this tragic situation."
Eagles of Death Metal were playing in the French capital as part of a European tour.
The band have now cut the tour short and have returned to the US.
The raucous rock 'n' roll band were formed by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme and his childhood friend Jesse Hughes. Homme was not on the tour.
Their support act Red Lemons posted a message saying: "Guys... I don't know what to say. We're more than lucky."
They added: "Thinking about those who passed away and who were having such a love (sic) time & happiness with all of us just a minute before."
Eagles of Death Metal released their first full LP in 2004 and have been described as "a mash-up of punk, rockabilly and Rolling Stones-style boogie".
The group's latest album Zipper Down, which came out last month, reached number 59 in the US Billboard chart and number 32 in the UK. Their songs have been used in advertisements for the likes of Nike, Acura and Microsoft.
Jesse Hughes is a hard-living frontman who is also an ordained minister and a former journalist and speechwriter for the Republican Party.
Meanwhile, U2 cancelled their concert in Paris on Saturday.
In a statement, the Irish band said: "We watched in disbelief and shock at the unfolding events in Paris and our hearts go out to all the victims and their families across the city tonight.
"We are devastated at the loss of life at the Eagles of Death Metal concert and our thoughts and prayers are with the band and their fans. And we hope and pray that all of our fans in Paris are safe."
Foo Fighters, who were due to perform in Paris on Monday, have also called off the remaining dates of their European tour.
"In light of this senseless violence, the closing of borders, and international mourning, we can't continue right now," the band said in a statement.
Motorhead have also announced the postponement of a Paris concert scheduled for Sunday.
