The man tried to drive through Walcot Lane ford, in Pershore, on Saturday morning, the ambulance service said.
"The elderly man driving had managed to get himself out of the vehicle and was treated at the scene by medics for being cold and wet," a spokesman said.
He said the man was "extremely fortunate" he escaped quickly and urged other drivers to avoid flooded roads.
Fire crews helped rescue the man and his vehicle.
Several flood alerts are in place in Worcestershire. But previous flood warnings, which urge for immediate action as flooding is expected, have been lifted.
