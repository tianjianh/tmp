The firm said it was cutting capacity at its Livingston plant in response to reduced demand, particularly in the oil and gas industry.
Plexus stressed it would maintain its rapid prototyping capabilities and design centre in the town's Pyramids Business Park.
It also said it remained committed to its presence in Scotland.
The job losses represent more than a third of company's workforce based at Livingston.
The reduction in manufacturing capacity in Livingston is expected be completed by February and save the company between about Â£830,000 and Â£1.1m annually.
Oliver Mihm, from Plexus, said: "We take this measure reluctantly as it will affect approximately 50 of our loyal and hardworking employees.
"However, changing end market dynamics, particularly within the oil and gas industry, have required us to reduce our UK capacity to match customer demand.
"Many of the customer programmes currently supported by the Livingston manufacturing operations will be transferred to our Kelso manufacturing facility."
He added: "Plexus remains committed to its presence in Scotland.
"Our Livingston design centre is a significant success story that is complimented by our European centre of excellence for rapid prototyping within the Livingston site.
"Having these capabilities in close proximity to one another will continue to enable our customers' to meet their product realization needs."
Plexus said it had a total of 543 employees in the UK, with 134 based at Livingston and about 400 based in Kelso in the Scottish Borders.
