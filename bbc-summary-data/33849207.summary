Steve Magoffin (5-73) took the final two Middlesex wickets quickly in the morning as they were bowled out for 331 - setting a target of 266.
Harris (4-57) ripped through Sussex's top order before Chris Nash (66) and Ben Brown guided them to 163-5.
But once Roland-Jones (3-78) removed Nash, the visitors fell to 245 all out with Brown last man to go for 68.
Sussex wicketkeeper Brown put on 30 with last man Chris Liddle to take his side close to a remarkable victory, but was caught by home skipper James Franklin off Tim Murtagh.
Earlier, Welsh seamer Harris had reduced the visitors to 44-3 and wickets continued to tumble throughout the afternoon as Middlesex looked like wrapping up a comfortable win.
But Brown, who struck 11 boundaries in his 129-ball knock, and Liddle batted for more than half an hour before Brown holed out to deep square leg.
Middlesex move up to second in the Division One table, 37 points behind Yorkshire.
Sussex are in eighth and two points adrift of seventh-placed Worcestershire.
