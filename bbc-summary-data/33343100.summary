The former Wycombe and Tranmere keeper was out of contract at the Minstermen.
The 6ft 9ins Northern Irishman will compete with Ross Etheridge for a starting place at Stanley for the upcoming season in League Two.
"There is no number one and number two keeper," manager John Coleman told the club website.
"It will be whoever is best on any given day and whichever one is chosen, the other will support them. It's down to them to battle it out."
Until 22, Mooney was working as a barman and playing non-league football before he joined Wycombe in 2011.
