John Higgins believes he has the ability and the form to win his fifth World Championship.

The 41-year-old reached the semi-final for the first time since he last lifted the trophy in 2011 with a 13-6 win over Kyren Wilson.
The world number six will now face the winner of Stephen Maguire's match against Barry Hawkins for a place in Sunday's final.
"I believe I can [win], and that's a great feeling to have," Higgins said.
"I was close last year, Alan [McManus] pipped me [in the quarter-final]," he added.
"A couple of years after 2011, I'd been losing, my form wasn't great and you don't think you're going to get back to that one-table set up.
"It's the best place in the world to get out and play and I can't wait to get into the arena tomorrow [Thursday]. I'm buzzing."
Higgins won all three sessions against Wilson, the world number 16, and believes his game has grown in strength over the course of the tournament.
The Scot considers reigning champion Mark Selby as the favourite for the title, while his pre-competition tip was Hawkins. Yet Higgins is in a good place mentally as he prepares for the semi-final.
"The nerves get more difficult, but I'm more relaxed this year," he said.

"I don't know if that's because I feel as if I'm playing OK. At this event, you need to have a few sessions when you have good, frame-winning breaks. I did that against Mark Allen and in the second session against Kyren.
"To win this event you need a couple of sessions when you're dominating the other player. I feel as if my game can be there to do that but I'm sure other players will say the same thing.
"There are some sessions, especially this year, when I couldn't have played any better. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better. You've just got to hope that comes out in the big matches."
Maguire was once tipped as a potential world champion by O'Sullivan, and Hawkins said the Scot is benefitting from curbing his socialising at tournaments.
Higgins would like to face his compatriot Maguire in the semi-final, because it would guarantee that a Scot will feature in Sunday's final.
"Everybody's got their own choices in life and us Scots, we maybe like a drink and there's nothing wrong with that," Higgins said. "Life's too short.
"Stephen is a great player and I hope [he] comes through. If he was to beat me, I would be the first one to cheer him to win his first world title.
"But I get on well with Barry as well and I know how difficult he is to beat. In the last few years he's grown into a great champion, because he always had the game and he's got the belief now."
