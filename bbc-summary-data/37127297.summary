[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Indian wrestler whose failed drugs tests were blamed on "sabotage" has been suspended for four years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).

Narsingh Yadav, 26, was due to compete in the men's freestyle -74kg at the Rio Olympic Games on Friday.
He had been cleared by India's anti-doping agency after claiming his food was spiked by two fellow wrestlers, and also made a police complaint.
But the World Anti-Doping Agency urgently appealed to Cas.
Yadav had been provisionally suspended from competing in Rio and replaced by Parveen Rana, before India's wrestling federation (WFI) called for him to be reinstated.
Navin Agarwal, the national anti-doping agency's director-general, said at the time: "There is no fault or negligence on the athlete's part and he is a victim of sabotage."
However, a Cas statement said: "The panel did not accept the argument of the athlete that he was the victim of sabotage and noted that there was no evidence that he bore no fault, nor that the anti-doping rule violation was not intentional."
