The 26-year-old Samoa international had spent four years with the Vikings, but was told he would be released at the end of this season.
Isa started his career in the NRL at Penrith Panthers and has also played for Melbourne Storm and Castleford.
"There were a few offers on the table but I simply couldn't turn down this chance when it came along," he said.
He joins Sam Tomkins as a new arrival at Wigan for the 2016 season.
