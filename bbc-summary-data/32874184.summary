The Surrey Hills Board will use the lottery  funds to rediscover the Tillingbourne Valley's heritage, chairwoman Christine Howard said.
She said the Tillingbourne used to have a gunpowder mill and was once one of the UK's most industrialised rivers.
Ms Howard said it was now home to dormice and a "sleepy little hollow".
"This is an opportunity for us to peel back and rediscover what the ancestors in this area got up to," she said.
The water power of the Tillingbourne river also used to support the leather, paper, iron and corn milling industries, and memories and knowledge of this history were fading fast, she added.
The valley includes the villages of Shalford, Chilworth, Albury, Shere, Gomshall, Abinger and Wotton.
Volunteers are being sought to help with the project, which will see a permanent exhibition created at Shere Museum.
