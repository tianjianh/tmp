Scrum-coach specialist Hatley, 46, a former England Saxons prop, has been with the Premiership club since 2012.
"Discussions are underway with the RFU," Bath managing director Tarquin McDonald told BBC Radio Bristol.
"Being on the coaching staff for England is one of the biggest jobs around so there is definitely appeal."
Since head coach Eddie Jones' appointment to the national team in November, Saracens' Paul Gustard has joined England as defence coach and Bristol's Steve Borthwick has arrived as forwards coach.
McDonald added: "Neal Hatley is a very experienced, good coach. A coach like Neal could definitely add enormous value. He's been an asset here at the club.
"In these types of situations, it's in everyone's instance that you conclude quickly so we can move from speculation to fact.
"Neal's very passionate about the club and we've got three games until the end of the season."
