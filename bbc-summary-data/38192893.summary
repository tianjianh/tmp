[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 0-5 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge romped to a simple win at Hartlepool, the result every bit as comprehensive as it seems.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four goals in 19 second-half minutes saw the U's take total command to record their third League Two win in a row.
For the hapless hosts this was their second heavy defeat in a week, after they lost 4-0 at Port Vale in the FA Cup to pile the pressure on boss Craig Hignett.
Home defender Toto Nsiala bundled over Luke Berry in the area, but his penalty was superbly saved by Trevor Carson on 43 minutes.
Carson made another fine save to deny Luke Berry, but Pools failed to clear and James Dunne smashed in a fine shot from 15 yards on 51 minutes.
Ten minutes later the lead was doubled as Berry knocked in from close range after being teed up from a powerful run by Uche Ikpeazu on the right.
On 67 minutes, a deep Berry corner was powerfully headed in at the far post by defender Leon Legge.
There was only a four-minute wait for the fourth, Ikpeazu getting a deserved goal with a tap-in.
And on 88 minutes substitute Max Clark's shot was deflected in.
