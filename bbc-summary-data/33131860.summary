Hypsosinga heri was about to be removed from a list of British species, according to wildlife charity RSPB.
But volunteers spotted two female spiders among flowers at Radipole Lake Nature Reserve in Weymouth, Dorset, during a butterfly survey.
The last recorded sightings of the species were in 1898 and 1912.
Both were made at Wicken Fen near Ely, Cambridgeshire.
The new sightings, which have since been verified, were made several months ago.
Volunteers were completing a butterfly survey at Radipole Lake when they spotted "a very small, brightly-coloured spider on flowers".
They took photographs, and the find was later identified by the British Arachnological Society.
Only females have been spotted so far.
RSPB volunteer Allan Neilson said more females had been seen at nearby Lodmoor reserve since the recorded sightings.
"Which begs the question, where are the males?" he said.
