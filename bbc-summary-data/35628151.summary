Melbourne-based political satirist Huw Parkinson has used clips of the US Republican presidential candidate in a new video for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Insiders show.
In it, real quotes and speeches made famous by Mr Trump have been spliced with scenes from the hit HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The two-and-a-half-minute long video has already been viewed close to 200,000 times on YouTube and attracted more than 1,000 comments.
"Dirty politics, tension between nations and the pursuit of power - Trump would totally fit in on Game of Thrones," commented YouTube user Meredith Don.
Another user Gillian Walsh said: "Trump's political rallies fit in perfectly on such a violent show. Am I the only one who finds that scary?"
"Donald Trump is Joffrey all grown up," said another user referencing one of the most infamous villains on the show.
The mash-up begins with Mr Trump turning away lead character Daenerys Targaryen, played by British actress Emilia Clarke, and her followers from the fictional city of Qarth.
"We have a tremendous problem and we can't be the stupid country any more," he tells the Mother of Dragons, when she pleads for him to open his kingdom's gates to allow her people in.
The real-life quote came from a Republican debate in January when Mr Trump was asked about Mexican and Muslim migrants entering the United States.
A heated exchange between Pope Francis and Mr Trump was also featured prominently in the video, where he was seen blasting his critics.
Last week, the Pope questioned the US Republican presidential candidate's Christianity and condemned his call to build a border wall with Mexico.
"The Pope was in Mexico and he said negative things about me. Donald Trump is a very nice person," he tells a council of appointed advisors in the clip.
Wall politics continue with another central plot of the show featured in the video.
A group of men known as the Night's Watch who guard a magnificent giant wall built to keep out a supernatural threat known as the White Walkers.
Mr Trump also makes an appearance here, expressing the merits of the wall in keeping intruders away.
"We have no border, we have no control. People are flooding across - we need to build a wall and it has to be built quickly," a recycled recording of Mr Trump reads.
"The greatest builder is me and I will build the greatest wall you have ever seen.
"And in that wall, we're going to have a big fat door where people can come into the country but they'll have to come in legally."
