[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kilmarnock 2-2 Hamilton Academical

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hamilton Academical came from two goals down to hold Kilmarnock to a draw in the Scottish Premiership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dom Thomas's free-kick was knocked into the net by Hamilton's Louis Longridge to give Killie an early lead.
Lee Erwin's stylish lob put the hosts two up but Giannis Skondras replied for Accies with a well-taken strike.
Steven Smith fouled Greg Docherty in the box and Ali Crawford restored parity by converting the resulting penalty.
Killie get their first point of the season but Lee McCulloch's side will be frustrated not to have taken all three.
There was a real desire to the home side's play and less than three minutes had been played when they opened the scoring.
Scott McMann fouled Kris Boyd just outside the box wide on the Killie right and Thomas's low left-foot delivery took a deflection off Longridge and flew past goalkeeper Gary Woods.
Boyd could have increased the home side's lead when played in behind the Accies defence by Thomas but the experienced striker toe-poked his effort just wide from eight yards as Woods advanced quickly to narrow the angle.
However, Killie were to lose Boyd to injury when he suffered a hamstring strain 10 minutes before the interval and had to be replaced by Erwin.
Jamie MacDonald produced an excellent save to deny Accies an equaliser when Gordon Greer's headed clearance landed at the foot of Longridge. The Accies frontman's half-volley from just inside the area was tipped over by the Killie keeper at full stretch.
There was an early scare for Accies in the second half when a powerful Thomas free-kick bounced back off Woods as he tried to save but fortunately for the keeper his defence helped him out.
At the other end, a clearance from MacDonald from outside his area fell to Crawford, who tried to score from near halfway but saw his effort sail over.
Killie increased their lead with Erwin's first league goal for the Rugby Park club. Adam Frizzell delivered the through ball and the big striker outpaced the Accies defence before superbly lobbing Woods.
But Hamilton got themselves back in the game by use of the wide areas. McMann sent in a fine cross that his fellow full-back Skondras struck into the corner of the net on the half-volley with his left foot.
And two minutes from the end Accies, who are now unbeaten on their last six visits to Rugby Park, equalised from the penalty spot. Smith was judged to have tripped Docherty and Crawford made no mistake, blasting the spot-kick past MacDonald.
Martin Canning's side go into the international break on seven points from four games and are unbeaten in their last three.
Kilmarnock manager Lee McCulloch: "That's two points dropped, again individual errors costing us the goals.
"It was a bit of a slow game but if you go 2-0 up in any game in world football you're expected to keep a bit of game management and just come in with three points, regardless of how you play.
"I thought after we scored the second goal we panicked for some reason. I don't know why.
"The home form is atrocious for the last seven years, I don't know why so it's something that needs to start getting addressed other than just looking at the stats, something needs to give.
"If you panic when you go 2-0 up you don't deserve the three points. First goal we conceded was bad defending, the second it looked like a penalty from where I was standing, so no real complaints about that, unless I feel different when I see it again."
Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning: "In the end delighted with a point, it's always a difficult place to come.
"We knew it was going to be a hard game. I thought in the first half we were the better team but we find ourselves 1-0 down.
"I thought their second goal was offside but I've watched it back and I think it's actually a really good decision from the linesman. He's probably a foot inside his own half when he starts his run which is a good spot and we've gone 2-0 down.
"But to have the fight to get back into the game was really pleasing. We made a wee change, Scott McMann put in a great cross and Giannis gets the first. The fighting spirit really pleased me."
