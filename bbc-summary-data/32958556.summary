A multi-million pound scheme to refurbish five 1960s tower blocks in Oxford has been delayed.

Work on Evenlode and Windrush towers in Blackbird Leys, Wood Farm's Foresters Tower, Cowley's Hockmore Tower, and Northway's Plowmans Tower, was due to begin this month.
It has been delayed until next year, increasing the cost from £18m to £20m.
The city council said the "complexity" of the Hockmore project was partly to blame.
The upgrade includes "enhancements" to the tower exteriors, as well as new roofs, windows and heating systems.
In a statement, Oxford City Council said: "The project has been slightly delayed for a range of reasons beyond our control, including the complexity of the Hockmore Tower project, and the contractors asking for more time to complete the tendering process and the knock-on effect of this on the council's planning and approval processes."
The authority said officers were also asking for £1.75m additional budget for the "large and complex project", and said time was needed "to ensure we engage our residents and get the works right".
The plans, which were approved by the council in November, are expected to extend the lifespan of the towers.
