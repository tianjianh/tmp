Congestion concern over Poole car parking charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to introduce car park charges at parks in a Dorset town could increase congestion in nearby streets, campaigners have claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Borough of Poole Council plans to start charging at Upton County Park and other parks, beaches and playing fields.
Whitecliff Residents Association said surrounding streets would be "flooded" by motorists looking for alternative free parking.
The council said the move could raise Â£0.5m a year.
The council is proposing on-street charges round Sandbanks, at Upton County Park and at open spaces including Whitecliff Park, Hamworthy Park, Lake Pier, Newfoundland Drive Skateboard park and Rockley Park.
Opponents claim charges will discourage people from visiting parks and taking part in sport and fitness activities.
A petition opposing the plans has attracted almost 2,000 signatures and members of Whitecliff Residents Association have written to the government to complain.
Association chairman Bob Lister said: "If they put in car parking charges, they will flood our road which is already congested."
The council's transport portfolio holder John Rampton insisted introducing charges was a "financial imperative".
"It's a very small ask - we don't believe people's behaviour will change that much."
"Councils are in such a difficult position - they have to make savings and make money and commercialise, where they can, if they are to survive and provide services to the most vulnerable people in our society."
If the plans are approved following public consultation, charges could be in place by Easter.
