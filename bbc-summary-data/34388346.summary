Three have been named as Alexandra Binns, 18, Brandon Brown, 20, and Terrie Kirby, 16. A fourth person has been named locally as Ryan Beal, 20.
The group died when a sports car collided with the bike they were on at 00:30 BST on Sunday on the A6201 between Upton and Hemsworth.
Upton Methodist Church said it wanted to offer support to the community.
Peter Finneran, from the church, said: "I think the main feeling is shock and disbelief that four young lives have been removed so terribly tragically.
"As the church in the community, we wanted to be involved, to be the hub where people could be here and just vent what they feel."
Mr Finneran said a book has been opened for each of the young people who died.
"Anybody can wander in, sign the books and sit around and just think. There will be a minister here if people want to talk or to pray," he said.
West Yorkshire Police said the quad bike was unregistered and believe a bronze-coloured Nissan sports car was travelling towards Hemsworth on the A6201 when it collided with the bike.
Three of the victims died at the scene, the fourth died later in hospital.
Two men who were in the car were questioned about the crash and bailed.
Messages of sympathy have been posted by friends and family of the four victims on social media and suggest the four had been celebrating Terrie Kirby's 16th birthday.
