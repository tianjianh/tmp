[SN]TITLE[SN]
Madagascar replace coach Rajaonarisamba with Auguste Raux

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Madagascar have sacked national coach Franck Rajaonarisamba after a 6-1 loss at home to DR Congo in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The football association have replaced him with Frenchman Auguste Raux.
He returns for a third spell after leading the side for two matches in 2003, and again from 2012 to 2015.
The loss leaves the island nation bottom Group B with just two points from five qualifiers so far and with no chance of reaching the finals in Gabon.
Raux's first task will be to lead Madagascar at the Southern African regional championship the Cosafa Cup which starts on Saturday.
His side face Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Seychelles in a preliminary pool, with only the group winners advancing to the quarter-finals.
Madagascar are also out of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, beaten 5-2 on aggregate by Senegal last November.
