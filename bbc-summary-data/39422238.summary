Stephen Port's dealer admits supplying killer with drugs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted supplying drugs to serial killer Stephen Port.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Port was given a whole life term for murdering four men he lured to his London flat and poisoned with lethal doses of the substance GHB.
Gerald Matovu pleaded guilty to selling the 41-year-old mephedrone and GHB in July and August 2015.
His crimes came to light during the investigation into Port but were not connected to the murders, Southwark Crown Court heard.
The 23-year-old, of Great Guildford Street, Southwark, has been bailed until sentencing in April.
Port bought the drugs from Matovu for use during consensual sex with his partner, the Met said.
Phone records showed the pair were in contact and Matovu had told Port he had "loads of G" - referring to GHB - and asked how much he wanted.
Judge Andrew Goymer said: "This case came to light following Port's arrest and interrogation of his mobile phone and who had been in contact with him.
"There is absolutely no suggestion that this defendant came into contact with those young men who were the unfortunate victims of Stephen Port's terrible crimes."
Port met his victims on dating websites, including Grindr, between August 2014 and September 2015 and coaxed them to his home in Barking for sex.
He gave them fatal doses of GHB and dumped their bodies in or near a graveyard within 500m of his house.
