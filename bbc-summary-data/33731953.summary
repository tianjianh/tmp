Harry Chivers pioneers golf ball-sized heart pump

A golf ball-sized heart pump could transform thousands of dying patients' lives after a County Down man became the first person in the world to have it fitted.

Harry Chivers, from Bangor, received the Â£80,000 miniaturized ventricular assist device (MVAD) at Newcastle upon Tyne's Freeman Hospital two weeks ago.
His health was failing after he suffered a heart attack in last August.
Experts have said the new pump is a "huge step forward" for heart patients.
Mr Chivers, 63, was waiting for a heart transplant when the possibility of pioneering the pump arose.
The retired father-of-three travelled to the Freeman Hospital for the treatment by Prof Stephan Schueler.
Since then he has made good progress and could be allowed home next week.
His consultant cardiac surgeon said the device, that is smaller than predecessors and with settings that allow it to adapt to the patient's lifestyle, sits on the tip of the heart and helps it to pump blood.
Prof Schueler said there were hundreds of thousands of people with advanced heart disease, but in the past treatment was limited to an "elite" few who could receive a transplant.
"They have now the choice to get these revolutionary devices. It is the fourth generation and they are tiny," he said.
The MVAD weighs 78g and is about the size of a golf ball, and is said to be about half as large as previous devices.
It is powered by a battery pack from a wire that passes out of the patient's abdomen.
The pack can be carried in a bag or around the waist.
Mr Chivers said he was "getting a lot better" after having the MVAD fitted.
"I feel great, it has really improved my breathing and the operation has gone really well," he said.
"I was quite happy to volunteer here because I have 100% confidence in the fantastic hospital.
"I'm eating a lot better, I'm getting around and working on my physio.
"There's a long way to go but I'm going to do it."
The Freeman's ventricular assist device co-ordinator Neil Wrightson said the new pump's size made it a huge step forward.
He said Mr Chivers was slumped in his chair and looked "appalling" when they first met in a Belfast hospital.
The pump's availability had come "in the nick of time" for him.
"He is not a dying man anymore," Mr Wrightson said.
Patients would need to be ill enough to require a heart transplant but well enough to recover from the treatment, he added.
He said because of its small size it could be suitable for children with heart disease, and it will now go through a lengthy trial process.
