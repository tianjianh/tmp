John McGuinness said he was "proud and humbled" to join Valentino Rossi as an honorary member of the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-time Isle of Man TT winner is only the second motorcycle racer to be offered membership after nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi in 2015.
A BRDC spokesman said the Morecambe man was recognised for his "outstanding achievements on two wheels".
McGuinness said it was a "great surprise" and he was "super proud".
The TT star received the honour at a ceremony in London last week in front of guests, which included recently-retired F1 champion Nico Rosberg.
McGuinness is the second-most successful rider in TT history and just three wins behind all-time record holder Joey Dunlop.
