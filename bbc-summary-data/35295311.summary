'Potentially violent' mental health patient on the run

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "potentially violent and dangerous" man has gone on the run after escaping from a mental health unit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Safdar Shah, 25, was on supervised leave when he ran away from a post office in Homerton High Street, east London, at around 11:30 GMT on Monday.
Mr Shah, who has paranoid schizophrenia, will become increasingly dangerous to the public without taking his medication, Met police have said.
He has his passport with him and police fear he may try to leave the country.
Detective Inspector Paul Ridley said: "The risk he poses to the public exacerbates the longer he is without his medication.
"I would again reiterate that Shah has a history of violence and should not be approached by the public."
Police described him as 5ft 7in, with dark hair and a full beard.
He was wearing a grey hooded top, a dark body warmer, blue jeans and dark trainers when last seen.
