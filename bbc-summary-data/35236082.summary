[SN]TITLE[SN]
Covert police 'foil Birmingham jihadi trio's Syria bid'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An undercover officer infiltrated a jihadi group and scuppered their plan to join so-called Islamic State in Syria, the Old Bailey heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anas Abdalla, Mahamuud Diini and Gabriel Rasmus from Birmingham wanted to join the group, a jury was told.
But they were arrested after being discovered hiding in the back of a lorry at Dover port in April 2015.
Mr Abdalla and Mr Diini, both 26, deny preparing for acts of terror. Rasmus, 29, admits the same charge.
Somalia-born Mr Abdalla and Mr Diini claim their covert bid to get out of the UK had nothing to do with terrorism.
In a defence statement, Mr Abdalla, an IT technician and former asylum seeker, said the secret services had made his life in Britain "intolerable".
He said his university career, job prospects and financial affairs in the UK had been "adversely affected".
Part-time labourer Mr Diini, a Dutch national, said in his defence statement he had rebuffed attempts by MI5 to recruit him.
He claimed his brother Ahmed had been arrested and tortured in Egypt and he was on his way to find him in Turkey after his release.
But prosecutor Sally Howes QC told jurors "The evidence you will hear during this trial will show that their intention was to join forces with Islamic State to offer their services, together with their lives if needs be, to engage in acts of terrorism."
She went on to say how undercover officer "Muhamed" had befriended the trio and secretly recorded their conversations.
Rasmus repeatedly referred to "being out there" in Syria and said: "September 11 was so good" she claimed.
Mr Abdalla said: "Paradise, paradise, I swear to God I cannot wait," the court heard.
On 2 April 2015, they returned to Birmingham following a first failed attempt to leave in the back of a lorry and they told Mr Muhamed they had paid Â£900 and needed the money back, the jury was told.
Mr Abdalla, of Fox Hollies Road, Acocks Gardens, Birmingham, and Mr Diini, of Coventry Road, Small Heath, Birmingham, deny the charge against them.
The trial continues.
