According to a statement released by the other two members of the band, the singer and guitarist had left "indefinitely".
In an interview with Rolling Stone, drummer Travis Barker and bassist Mark Hoppus described complications with writing and recording a new album.
However, DeLonge posted "to all the fans, I never quit the band" on Instagram.
He continued: "I was actually on a phone call about a Blink 182 event for New York City when all these weird press releases started coming in.
"Apparently those reports were 'sanctioned' from the band. Are we dysfunctional - yes. But, Christ. #Awkward."
A poster for an upcoming Blink 182 show at an event organised by Travis Barker suggests the guitarist would be replaced by Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba.
Many of DeLonge's recent posts on Twitter consist of promotion for his other band, Angels & Airwaves, with several links to their the latest album The Dream Walker.
Last summer he performed with Blink 182 in their headline set at Reading and Leeds Festivals.
According to his bandmates, the guitarist's manager sent an e-mail which said: "Tom. Is. Out."
Mark Hoppus claimed this is identical to a message they received in 2005 when DeLonge went on hiatus before reforming in 2009 ahead of the release of the band's sixth studio album Neighborhoods in 2011.
