[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven McIvor, 32, was one of two thieves who targeted the Letterbox Bistro in Balerno Main Street and stole Â£2,000 and 5,300 Euros on 26 February 2016.
McIvor, from Edinburgh, was found guilty after trial.
His co-accused Eddie Moffat, 27, was acquitted of the robbery charge on a not proven verdict.
The owner of the post office/bistro business Steven Carlyle, 55, said he was talking to his son when he became aware of two men entering the premises.
He told the court: "Then the language got worse and they demanded money. They were demanding all the money from the till and the Euros."
"The thieves had scarves over their mouths and each was armed with a knife.
Mr Carlyle said he pressed an alarm that was supposedly inaudible but turned out to be audible. He said: "That's when they started getting very agitated."
One of the intruders became very aggressive and a knife was thrust through a gap in a Perspex screen.
Mr Carlyle said: "They were swearing all the time, telling us to 'hurry up, get the money, get the cash'."
At the High Court in Glasgow Lord Kinclaven jailed McIvor and told him: "You assaulted Mr Carlyle, who was behind the counter. There was no physical injury, but it must have been a frightening and traumatic incident for those in the post office at the time."
The court was told McIvor, who has 17 pages of previous conviction, had a drug problem.
None of his previous convictions were for violence.
Det Insp Graham Grant, of Police Scotland, said: "Steven McIvor showed no regard for the welfare of the member of staff during this robbery.
"Thankfully a swift policing response involving uniformed officers, CID, road policing and specialist Police Scotland resources ensured that he was traced and detained quickly.
"Crimes of this nature will not be tolerated when they occur and we will use all resources at our disposal to bring those responsible to justice."
