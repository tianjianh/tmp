Six young stoats have been taken into care by an animal welfare charity after being found next to their dead mother.
The animals, which are thought to be five to six weeks old, were discovered on a road in North Kessock, near Inverness, late last month.
They are being cared for at the Scottish SPCA's National Wildlife Rescue Centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.
The stoats have been nicknamed after characters in the hit US sitcom Friends - Ross, Joey, Chandler, Rachel, Monica and Phoebe.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said: "They are all feeding themselves and we're going to move them to a large outdoor enclosure soon.
"We'll release them back into the wild as a group when they are fully independent.
"They look very cute and cuddly now, but when they're fully grown they will be a predator to other wildlife such as rabbits, mice and voles."
