Beerens, 28, netted twice against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday to add to a stunning strike in the previous home game against Bristol City.
"I'm happy for myself," the Dutchman told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"I know I can score more goals than I have so far, but as a team we're working on picking up more points."
Beerens, an August arrival from Hertha Berlin, has missed just the one Championship match for the Royals this campaign and knows maintaining momentum will be key.
"I'm happy I'm the one on the scoresheet for now," he added. "But we stick together as a team to get the job done.
"We travel to Leeds on Tuesday and that's going to be tough, but we have to keep going and we know if we do that, we can get a good result."
