[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Susie Gilbert's first half penalty-corner strike gave Great Britain a 1-0 win over Australia in the second match of their six-test series.

Gilbert reacted quickest to the rebound from a Crista Cullen flick in the 18th minute in Bunbury, Western Australia.
It was the 26-year-old Reading player's 15th international goal.
Despite late pressure from the hosts, the goal was enough for the win to level the series at 1-1 with the third game to come on Tuesday.
