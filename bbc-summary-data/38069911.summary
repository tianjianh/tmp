Storage Hunters star guilty of stalking market trader

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An antiques expert from reality TV show Storage Hunters has been found guilty of stalking a market trader whom she bombarded with emails and texts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Boudicca Scherazade, 47, was on trial at St Albans Magistrates' Court, where she had denied stalking furniture trader Laurence Roche for three years.
Earlier, she told the court she had sent him intimate pictures of herself.
Magistrates said they found the messages had been "one way traffic" from Scherazade to her victim.
Ms Scherazade, of Garrick Villa in Hampton, London, appeared in 2015 in the UK version of the American TV series Storage Hunters, in which she travelled the country with other dealers hoping to find a bargain.
She was found to sent hundreds of explicit emails, text messages and voicemails to Mr Roche between 2013 and May this year.
She told the court she became aware of Mr Roche in 2012 while working at a market in Wimbledon, describing him as a "larger than life character" who would stand at his stall bare-chested.
She said they spoke over the phone and exchanged text messages and emails with sexual contents.
Earlier, Mr Roche told the court he had never sent Ms Scherazade any emails and had made it clear he was not interested in her.
Chairman of the magistrates, Mr Alun Price-Davies, found him to be an "entirely creditable" witness.
Ms Scherazade admitted she had sent all the emails the court had been told about, including one that said: "Come over, make me yours. Own my soul. Say my name I will give everything I own, I love you Laurence Roche."
Sentencing was adjourned until next month and Ms Scherazade was granted bail with the conditions that she should not contact Mr Roche or his partner.
