The vase was made between 1722- 1735 during the Yongzheng period and has been glazed with celadon.
Auctioneer Robin Fisher said its "solid provenance" resulted in the vase fetching the highest price ever achieved at the auction house.
The sale took place at Mallams in Cheltenham.
The vase has been decorated with chrysanthemum petals and bamboo-shaped ribs at the neck.
When it was first bought by the collector Charles George in 1952 it was valued at £12.
The vase also appeared at an exhibition in 1947 by the Oriental Ceramic Society.
