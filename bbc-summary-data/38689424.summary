Howells, 25, scored 31 goals in 334 appearances for Luton where he played under Daggers manager John Still.
He moved on to Eastleigh last summer but his contract was terminated earlier this month.
Sheppard, 19, has arrived from Championship club Reading, where is yet to make his first-team debut.
The Scot signed a professional contract with the Royals in 2015 and has previously had loan spells at Hayes & Yeading and Eastbourne.
Meanwhile, the club has confirmed that a proposal by a consortium of existing directors to invest Â£1.3m in the club has been approved by members.
The new board will be led by Paul Gwinn as non-executive chairman and with the aim of achieving "the one main goal of a sustainable club, delivering success on and off the pitch".
