Chester: Lucas Dawson and Liam Davies sign new contracts with Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester midfielders Lucas Dawson and Liam Davies have both signed one-year deals with the National League club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Stoke City trainee Dawson, 23, who has also played for Carlisle United, Nuneaton Town and AFC Telford, made 10 appearances over the closing weeks of last season after signing in March.
Davies, 21, the elder brother of Everton midfielder Tom Davies, initially signed a six-month deal.
But he has had that extended after scoring once in three appearances.
Meanwhile, fellow Chester midfielder Evan Horwood, who returned to the club for a second time last August, has now had his contract terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.
The experienced Horwood, 31, signed a six-month contract extension at the end of last season in May, but he has now been offered a more long-term contract elsewhere.
