Earlier this year, Helen Carmichael became the first woman to be elected the city's provost in the 600-year history of the civic role.
She will attend the 400-year-old kirking on Sunday.
The annual event involves a procession through Inverness and a special service at the Old High Kirk.
Starting at 10:45, the procession of about 200 people will be led by the pipes and drums of the Royal British Legion Inverness Branch and City of Inverness Youth Pipe Band.
