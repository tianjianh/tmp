[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John MacIntosh, 46, of Dingwall, must serve at least 10 years in prison after being convicted by a jury of four serious sexual offences.
At the High Court in Aberdeen, judge Lord Uist said MacIntosh was a "sexual fiend" who targeted vulnerable females.
MacIntosh had previously been jailed for seven years for having sex with 13 and 14-year-old girls.
The offences heard at the High Court in Aberdeen happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004.
He sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the young girl and raped three women.
In his sentencing statement, Lord Uist said: "You targeted vulnerable females in order to gratify your carnal lust.
"You have called all these women liars and shown no remorse for what you did."
The judge added: "It is clear to me that you have no respect for women and are a sexual fiend."
Lord Uist said MacIntosh should not assume that he would be automatically released after having served 10 years in prison.
He said: "You will be released only when the Parole Board for Scotland is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you continue to be held in prison."
Police Scotland has welcomed the life sentence.
Det Insp Eddie Ross said the case was brought to the attention of police by the NHS.
He said: "During the investigation there was also significant involvement from the local authority in terms of housing and social work support for not only the victims but also their children.
"However, the most important people in all this are the victims and I must pay tribute to them in both coming forward to the police and staying with the prosecution process to conviction.
"I hope that this result will bring some comfort to the victims in this case and give confidence to anyone who has suffered similar experiences to come forward in the knowledge that their case will be sensitively and thoroughly investigated."
