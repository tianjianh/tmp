The venue, near Junction 32 of the M62 at Glasshoughton, will also include a 50-acre country park, shops and restaurants.
Developers Lateral Property Group have said the Â£135m scheme could create 2,000 jobs.
The plans still have to be approved by the secretary of state before building work can start.
Tigers chairman Jack Fulton previously said the new stadium would provide "the foundations of a bright new future for the club".
