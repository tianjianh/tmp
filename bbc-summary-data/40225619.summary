The 25-year-old will join the Women's Super League One club following this summer's European Championships, for which Belgium have qualified.
The former FC Twente forward has scored four goals in 26 international games.
"Yana was brought to my attention after recently playing against Scotland," head coach Willie Kirk told the club website. "Her style of play suits us and she is a big personality."
