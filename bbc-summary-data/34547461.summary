Radical plans for a leisure complex at Reading Football Club's Madesjki Stadium have gone on public display.

Proposals for Royal Elm Park include 600 homes, a park and an ice rink but parking spaces will be slashed by 1,000 to 800.
There will also be a "large public realm square" for "public displays and fun engagements", according to the club's chief executive Nigel Howe
The club hope to start building next year with completion in 2018 or 2019.
Currently, the site contains the stadium, a hotel and a conference centre.
Mr Howe said: "This is about engaging this part of Reading in more activities to give Reading itself a bigger brand."
An 800-space multi-storey car park would replace the 1,800 spaces that would be built on.
To offset this reduction, Mr Howe said there were plans to bring the completion date of nearby Green Park station forward, a "subsidised transport plan" and off-site car parking.
Richard Langley, vice chairman of Supporters Trust At Reading (STAR), said: "It sounds like a very big complex and it's good, in our opinion, if it's good for the club.
"We see this as a positive, providing they do go ahead with the improved transport links and the multi-storey."
Public exhibitions will run until 24 October.
