The ceremony was split over Saturday and Sunday evenings and featured categories such as best casting, sound and visual effects.
Thrones' success was followed by The People v. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story, which took five awards.
Making a Murderer and Grease Live! each landed four wins.
Thrones won in categories including prosthetic make-up, period/fantasy costumes and production design.
The drama based on the real-life murder trial of American football star OJ Simpson counted casting and picture editing awards among its haul.
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler shared a best guest actress in a comedy Emmy, for hosting last year's Saturday Night Live Christmas episode.
It was a ninth Emmy for Poehler but a first for Fey, and also the first time two women had shared the prize.
British star James Corden was honoured for The Late, Late Show with James Corden (interactive programme) and his Carpool Karaoke Primetime Special (outstanding variety special).
Other British interests included Downton Abbey, which took two awards for hairdressing and production design.
