A panel will be appointed to choose an artist and design for the tribute, which will be unveiled in summer 2017.
The public was asked to vote on a preferred site for the memorial.
A separate consultation will be held for a memorial for the victims of the Tunisian terrorist attacks in 2015.
Mr Cameron said: "These memorials will be places where the family and friends of people killed in terrorist attacks can reflect and remember.
"By building them we are underlining our pledge to never forget the victims of these atrocities."
The panel will be led by former overseas development minister Baroness Chalker.
