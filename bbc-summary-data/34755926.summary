John Higgins cool on chances of matching Stephen Hendry record

John Higgins thinks matching fellow Scot Stephen Hendry's record of 36 ranking tournament wins may be beyond him, but he will not stop trying.

The 40-year-old won the International Championship in Daqing, China, last weekend to take his tally to 28, matching the haul of Steve Davis.
"Another eight wins seems too far but you never know," he told BBC Scotland.
"The way I played [in China], if I could keep that up for a few years, I would love to try to match it."
The four-time world champion from Wishaw called it a "proud moment" to draw level with Davis's record.
And he added: "I think if I play my best I have another few wins in me, but you never know how long it can last.
"I have never been one to look at records and go for it; I just try my best. It would be a great achievement to even get closer to Stephen.
"I've had spells in my career when I haven't done too great for two or three years then I have a spell where I can win three or four tournaments in a burst. I don't know if this is what's happening."
The International Championship title was his third of the year, adding to the Welsh Open in February and the Australian Goldfields Open in July.
Higgins said his performance in Daqing was one of his "best ever". He beat Shaun Murphy and Mark Selby, among others, to set up a final against David Gilbert, whom he beat 10-5.
He said: "I haven't played much better than that throughout my whole career. It's harder to win tournaments now because we are playing more matches to actually win a tournament.
"It does give you great confidence."
