The New Walk Centre, the former city council's headquarters, was declared unsafe in 2010.
The city's mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said cracks had developed throughout the structure causing the building to slowly "pull itself apart".
It was destroyed in an explosion known as a "double blow-down", much to the delight of onlookers.
