Republican Clay Higgins said in the video that the horrors of the WW2 death camps were the reason why the US military should be "invincible".
At one point, he went inside a gas chamber and explained how the victims were killed.
Apologising, the Louisiana congressman said he had not intended to cause pain.
He said in a statement: "My intent was to offer a reverent homage to those who were murdered in Auschwitz and to remind the world that evil exists, that free nations must remember, and stand strong.
"However, my message has caused pain to some whom I love and respect. For that, my own heart feels sorrow. Out of respect to any who may feel that my video posting was wrong or caused pain, I have retracted my video."
The five-minute video had shown Mr Higgins in different parts of the museum, talking about the atrocities in the death camp.
Responding to it, the Auschwitz memorial and museum tweeted that the gas chamber was "not a stage" but a place for mournful silence.
Later it posted a picture of the entrance to the building showing a plaque asking for silence.
Some 1.1 million people, mainly Jews, died at the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
The Anti-Defamation League, an American-Jewish anti-discrimination organisation, said the video was "incredibly disrespectful to the hallowed ground" of the memorial and museum.
