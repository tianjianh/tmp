Essex are through to the T20 Blast quarter-finals and currently sit top of the South Group in the One-Day Cup.
"The team's in a great place, especially in white-ball cricket," 20-year-old Velani told BBC Essex.
"We've won five of our last seven T20 games and now won our first two one-dayers. Hopefully we keep this momentum going throughout the competition."
Essex's 152-run victory over Warwickshire on Wednesday was built on a 191-run opening partnership between Tom Westley and Mark Pettini, with both hitting centuries.
"Tom Westley and Mark Pettini batted fantastically; they set the platform for us," said Velani.
"With the strength of our batting, that's all we can ask for - to keep wickets at the end and then the lower order can come in and bat freely."
