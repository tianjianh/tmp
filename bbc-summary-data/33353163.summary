John Welch, 74, from Corsham and his partner Eileen Swannack, 73, from Biddestone, have been formally identified as victims of the attack.
The couple had been together for nearly a decade and had travelled to Tunisia twice a year for the past eight years.
They had been officially listed as missing since the attack in Sousse on 26 June.
Relatives of Ms Swannack and Mr Welch are getting family liaison officer support.
On Wednesday a book of condolence opened at St Nicholas' Church in Biddestone to remember the couple.
The first bodies of those killed have arrived back in the UK but the process of identifying victims continues in Sousse.
Thirty of the 38 victims are thought to have been British.
