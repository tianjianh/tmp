Clint McKay added 65 with the bat as the visitors posted 427 in Cardiff, and then took 2-38 as he and Ben Raine (3-48) pressed home the Foxes' advantage.
Aneurin Donald top-scored with 57 for the hosts but his stand of 60 with Jacques Rudolph (39) was the only real resistance from Glamorgan.
At 172-8, Glamorgan lead by just 93 runs going into day four.
Glamorgan's Aneurin Donald told BBC Wales Sport: "It was a disappointing batting performance though they bowled really well.
"We had a couple of good balls, a couple of poor shots and I was involved in a run-out (with David Lloyd) and played a poor shot.
"I was pleased with the way I got myself in but disappointed to get out when I was set and really needed to kick on.
"But we showed a bit of fight at the end with Waggy (Graham Wagg) and Hoges (Michael Hogan), so if we can scrape together a lead of 120 to 150 plus, we're in the game.
"They're going to play their shots and if they get in, they'll get a few quickly and they'll be dangerous in the morning."
Leicestershire all-rounder Wayne White told BBC Radio Leicester: "We batted 130 overs, the last four wickets added 180, we put some overs on their legs, and you can usually see the difference when you're bowling at a tired line-up.
"The bowlers were fresh, we went hard at it, and we created a lot of chances.
"We made things happen. We hit a good length, and the energy in the field was great to see.
"There's plenty to do though, batting last on a day four pitch is never easy but we have put ourselves in a good position."
