Army bomb disposal experts removed the device from Barnardos in Malpas after police cordoned off the area around it.
The discovery was made in a black bag of children's gifts on Thursday afternoon.
Shop manager Sue Humphreys said it had been in the shop for "several weeks", adding "we didn't panic" after finding it.
She said the pin was still intact and after doing research online, staff realised it was a grenade.
Gwent Police said it was "deemed as low risk and has been safely removed".
