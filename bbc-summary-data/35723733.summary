At least 14 others, including several civilians, have been injured by the blast in Nusaybin town near the Syria border, according to reports.
The attack was blamed on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
Violence has intensified in Turkey since a ceasefire between the government and the PKK collapsed in July.
The latest attack happened in Mardin province in the early hours of Friday. It struck an area close to a police station and a police housing compound, Turkey's state-run news agency Anadolu reported.
The blast caused extensive damage to the compound, the report said. At least four of those injured were said to be in critical condition.
There has been no claim of responsibility.
PKK defiant over long war
How dangerous is Turkey's unrest?
The PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish self-determination since 1984, is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey and its Western allies.
The militants have been attacking security forces, while the army has been besieging Kurdish-dominated towns.
Last month, an attack blamed on Kurdish militants on military buses in Ankara killed at least 28 people.
Turkey has also been shelling the Kurdish YPG militia in northern Syria, who it sees as allied to the PKK.
