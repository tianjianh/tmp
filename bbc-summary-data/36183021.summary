Juventus celebrated a fifth straight league title in Italy and Bayern Munich edged closer to their fourth in a row in Germany.

Spain's leading three sides all won to keep the thrilling race for La Liga going while the top two in the Netherlands are separated by goal difference heading into the final week.
And Zlatan Ibrahimovic starred again as Paris St-Germain maintained their stunning Ligue 1 form.
But what else happened around Europe? BBC Sport rounds up the stories you might have missed.
If Bayern Munich's domination of the Bundesliga and Juventus's run of titles in Italy are impressive, then FC Basel have taken superiority a stage further.
Basel clinched their seventh successive Swiss title on Saturday with five games to spare by beating FC Sion 2-1.
Unbeaten in the league since November, Basel took an unassailable 16-point lead over Young Boys, whose 2-1 win at Grasshoppers was in vain.
Basel have had five different coaches since their seven-title run began and this triumph is the first for Urs Fischer, who replaced Paulo Sousa at the end of last season.
However, Grasshoppers remain Switzerland's most successful club domestically with 27 league titles, followed by Basel on 19.
While Liverpool were warming up for their Europa League semi-final, second leg by losing 3-1 at Swansea with a much-changed team, their opponents were busy boosting their chances of Champions League football next season.
Villarreal will visit Anfield on Thursday looking to cash in on their 1-0 victory in the first leg in Spain by booking a place in the final at the Reds' expense.
But, while the semi-final winners will be just one win away from clinching a Champions League spot through the Europa League, Villarreal made themselves clear favourites to do so anyway by claiming fourth place in La Liga.
They beat local rivals Valencia 2-0 thanks to goals from Samu and Adrian and now lead fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao by six points with two games to play.
Borussia Dortmund captain Mats Hummels is used to adulation from the club's supporters, but requesting a move to Bayern Munich is an act that some fans simply cannot forgive.
So the Germany international centre-back was jeered and whistled by fans during Dortmund's 5-1 win against Wolfsburg after his club announced he wanted to leave for Bayern.
Hummels appeared unaffected by the reaction from a minority of fans and he was praised for his performance and applauded by other members of the crowd at the Westfalenstadion.
"They were not the real fans," said the 27-year-old.
"They were just a group of about 300 who never really loved me in the first place, and they just used this as a stage to vent their anger. I could see who it was coming from."
Bayer Leverkusen have secured another season of Champions League football with a 2-1 win against Hertha Berlin.
And Julian Brandt, their teenage star, continued to push his claims for a late call-up to Germany's squad for Euro 2016.
The 19-year-old opened the scoring against Hertha and has now found the net in six successive Bundesliga matches, just one behind the club record of seven set by team mate Stefan Kiessling in 2013.
He is the first teenager since the legendary Gerd Muller to score in six Bundesliga games in a row. Without his goals and assists, Leverkusen would be 12 points worse off.
The club have won seven straight games to secure third place.
He has hardly set the world alight in his one season in charge of Sampdoria, but his struggles in Serie A have not stopped former Italy striker Vincenzo Montella from throwing his hat into the ring to manage the national team.
Despite his side still being threatened with relegation, the 41-year-old has been touted as a possible replacement for Antonio Conte when the current Italy coach leaves to join Chelsea after Euro 2016.
And after seeing his side lose 2-0 at Palermo on Sunday, Montella did nothing to dampen the speculation, although club president Massimo Ferrero later insisted his manager would stay.
"The national team is the highest possible achievement for a coach and I've already said that if I got an offer I would consider it," said Montella.
Bologna boss Roberto Donadoni - who coached the national side from 2006 to 2008 - has been linked with a second stint in the role but the former Italy midfield said: "My contract is with Bologna and I intend to stay here."
