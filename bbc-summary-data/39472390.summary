Crowds have turned out to celebrate the first train to stop at a town's new station.

Ilkeston had no service for 50 years and while plans were approved in 2013, the project was delayed by  flooding and the discovery of protected newts.
Derbyshire County Council has estimated 160,000 people will use the Â£10m station in the first year.
Enthusiasts, community groups and the local MP all met the 09:45 Nottingham service, which arrived slightly late.
The town, which was one of the largest in the UK without a railway station, once boasted three - the last one closed in 1967 as a result of the Beeching Report, published in 1963.
MP for Erewash, Maggie Throup, said: "I haven't been able to walk round the town for years without people asking me 'When is the station going to open?'.
"The station will not only transform the way local people travel, but will undoubtedly give a significant boost to the local economy and attract new business to the area."
