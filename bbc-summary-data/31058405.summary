[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aston Court Nursing home death accused nurse cleared

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care home nurse accused of manslaughter over the death of a 91-year-old woman has been cleared.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Santhosh Rajan was found not guilty after the judge at Birmingham Crown ordered the jury to reach the verdict.
Mr Rajan had been accused of killing Iris Teale, who died 16 days after breaking her leg at Aston Court Nursing Home in Little Aston, in October 2011.
Mr Rajan, of Walsall, said: "I have maintained my innocence throughout the course of this lengthy investigation."
The 39 year old said there were "no winners in this case" and expressed his "great sympathy for the terrible ordeal Mrs Teale's family continue to suffer".
The court had heard Mrs Teale's care plan meant she should have only been moved by two people using a hoist.
She sustained her leg fracture after the limb was subjected to a twisting motion on 8 October 2011, which "contributed to the death in a significant way", the jury was told.
At the start of the trial, jurors were told Mr Rajan claimed Mrs Teale was already injured when he entered her room at about 22:10 GMT, and he did not know how she had sustained her fracture.
She died in hospital on 24 October.
