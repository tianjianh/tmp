Clevedon sea swim photos capture year-round activity

The Clevedon sea swimmers - come rain, shine or even snow - are continuing to keep a tradition alive that has been going on since the 1930s.
On an almost daily basis they don bright coloured swimming hats and battle the elements to swim in the sea at the Somerset resort before drying off and warming up with a cup of hot chocolate.
Sometimes they are only in the water for a matter of minutes, other days they will swim around the pier, depending on the tides and weather.
Now their morning outings have been captured by news and feature photographer Brad Wakefield, from Burnham-on-Sea.
Mr Wakefield, 26, said: "I have grown to love their attitude and sheer embrace of their surroundings.
"I have witnessed their pure dedication first hand, swimming through all weather as the seasons have changed from beautiful blue skies to painfully cold, snowy days."
The group of swimmers - aged 30 to 80 years old - swells in size from nine or ten in the winter to 20 or 30 in the summer.
Self-confessed as "totally mad", the "all year rounders", say the cold makes it all the more fun.
"I don't like swimming in swimming pools now, it's just too warm,"  former primary school teacher Dee Hamilton-Jones said.
"It all started with a conversation about swimming hats.
"I asked one of the members 'where did you get your swim hat?' and she said 'you must come down', but this was winter time and she said, 'don't start now, start in May', that's the best time to start."
Dee, 71, swims alongside her husband, 66-year-old Richard.
"The theory is, if you can cope with going in the British sea in the summer, the next day it only gets a little bit colder than the previous day," Mr Hamilton-Jones said.
"And if you keep going and keep going, you think, 'ok, it's December 31, but it can't be much colder than the day before'.
"It is absolutely wonderful. Somebody once said it's like having a high on oxygen."
The Clevedon Sea Swimming Photographic Exhibition will run from 9 March to 24 March at the Toll House Gallery on Clevedon Pier.
