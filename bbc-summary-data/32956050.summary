Budget airline Flybe has announced it will set up a new base at Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the latest development in a plan to rescue the airport, bought by the Welsh government for Â£52m in 2013.
Flybe said the 10-year agreement with Cardiff Airport had created 50 new jobs, including flight crew.
Two planes will be based at the site in Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan, and flights to Belfast, Dusseldorf, Geneva and Jersey will be increased.
New routes between Cardiff and Cork, Dublin, Edinburgh, Faro, Glasgow, Munich, Milan and Paris were previously announced.
