Somerset kept their Championship title hopes alive as they beat rivals Yorkshire by 10 wickets in their penultimate match of the season.

Somerset remain third in the table, one point behind second-placed Yorkshire and five behind leaders Middlesex - who will go a further 16 clear if they win their ongoing game with Lancashire.
Yorkshire were bowled out for 286 at Headingley, despite Jake Lehmann's 116.
Jack Leach took 6-64 before Somerset easily reached their target of 42.
Openers Marcus Trescothick (37 not out) and Tom Abell knocked off the required runs in 10.3 overs to complete a 23-point win.
Somerset, who have never been county champions before, host relegated Nottinghamshire in their last game starting on 20 September.
Their focus before then will be on Middlesex who, if they win at Old Trafford, would need only four points from their final match against Yorkshire at Lord's to clinch the title.
The visitors' seamers had skittled Yorkshire for 145 on day one at Headingley, but it was left-arm spinner Leach who took a prominent role in the champions' downfall on day three.
They were held up by Australian left-hander Lehmann, who shared a 101-run eighth-wicket stand with Liam Plunkett (73) to ensure Somerset would bat again.
But Yorkshire's chances of saving the game rapidly deteriorated once Leach had trapped Lehmann lbw with the first ball of a new spell.
The 25-year-old has taken 58 Championship wickets this season, with 33 of those coming in Somerset's last five fixtures, and is the second-leading wicket-taker in Division One behind Warwickshire off-spinner Jeetan Patel.
