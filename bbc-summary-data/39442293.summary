[SN]TITLE[SN]
Orkney renewables partnership with Norway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A partnership is being formed between the energy sectors in Orkney and Norway to look at ways they can work together to develop marine renewables.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Representatives from the west of Norway have been in the isles to discuss how expertise can be shared.
They believe knowledge built up in Scandinavia through work in the oil and gas sector could prove key to the next stage in developing technologies.
Orkney is a major Scottish hub for renewables.
In January, plans for a Â£6.5m research and innovation campus in Stromness in Orkney took a step forward after the organisations driving the project agreed funding.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Orkney Islands Council are behind the venture.
The campus is aimed at supporting sectors including marine renewables.
