[SN]TITLE[SN]
Spalding Flower Parade to lose council funding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The future of a famous Lincolnshire flower parade is in the balance after its funding was cut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lincolnshire County Council and South Holland District Council have decided not to fund Spalding Flower Parade beyond next year's event.
The parade, which has been run since 1959, attracted crowds of more than 100,000 people in its heyday.
But councillors said attendances had dropped to a level where it was difficult to justify supporting it.
The parade, which features tulip-covered floats and marching bands, costs Â£200,000 a year to stage.
Each council contributes Â£40,000 towards the event but have said they will not be able to provide any funding after 2013.
Lincolnshire County Council's Eddy Poll said: "Back in the day when we were getting 100,000 visitors plus, it was worth the investment but I would imagine there was less than 40,000 there this year.
"I know the weather played a part but visitor numbers have been falling off over the past few years and it's now at a level that I don't think we can really sustain."
"I've personally been involved with the parade for 25 years so it's not been an easy decision for me but I think it's come to a point where we can't afford to underwrite it any more."
Mr Poll said the council welcomed suggestions on how the parade could continue beyond 2013 in a different form.
