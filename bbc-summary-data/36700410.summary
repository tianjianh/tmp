Hosts France beat Iceland 5-2 in Sunday's quarter-final at the Stade de France to set up a last-four tie with the world champions, who beat Italy on penalties on Saturday after a 1-1 draw.
Thursday's semi-final takes place at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille.
"It will be a huge match, and we have to give our all," said Deschamps.
"We're going to really go for it against the best side in the world. They had a few problems against Italy, but Germany are Germany."
Olivier Giroud scored the opening goal as France built a 4-0 half-time lead in Paris, with the Arsenal striker adding his second between Iceland's consolation goals.
Paul Pogba, Dimitri Payet and Antoine Griezmann also scored for the host nation.
"Are we confident? No, because Germany are the world champions and favourites," said Giroud. "But we'd like to write another chapter in French football history.
"We're very pleased with our performance. We scored five goals, and although we did concede a couple we had a lot of fun. We came out fighting right from the start, which we'd been struggling to do since the start of the tournament.
"We're going to try and erase a few of those small defensive mistakes though, because against Germany we'd pay a heavy price."
