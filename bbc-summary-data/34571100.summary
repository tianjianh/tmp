DUP launch petition of concern on sports clubs rates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The DUP has tabled a petition of concern on a private member's bill that seeks to exempt all amateur sports clubs from paying rates.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bill was proposed by Sinn Fein MLA Daithi Mckay, and is due to be debated in the Assembly tomorrow.
Currently amateur sports clubs qualify for an 80% reduction in their rates.
The petition of concern means the bill would require a cross-community majority, so can be blocked by the DUP.
Mr McKay says that such clubs make an important contribution to local communities and should be exempt from paying rates.
