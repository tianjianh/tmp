We Were There was written by Leicester singer Bob Wragg for the 1982 World Cup finals in Spain.
Mr Wragg, 82, said its original release was deemed "inappropriate" following the outbreak of the Falklands War.
The recording features many of the winning side including Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.
The song came about through Mr Wragg's friendship with keeper Gordon Banks, England's victorious goalkeeper in 1966, and he asked him about recording a song to wish the 1982 side well.
Many of the World Cup winning players feature in the video, with the exception of brothers Bobby and Jackie Charlton, who were away at the time, and Nobby Stiles, who was ill.
The recording, which has sat in the attic at Mr Wragg's Isle of Man home for more than three decades, includes captain Bobby Moore playing tambourine.
Mr Wragg, who performed with the 1950s variety act the Dallas Boys, said: "The atmosphere was amazing but I had to teach a few of them to sing - I even taught Alan Ball to sing a harmony. We had a right knees up.
"I heard the lads were in Leicester to shoot a promo so I had one night to write a song and one day to record it and make a video. The record label loved it but then the Falklands war broke out and it was shelved."
The singer is a founder member of what has been described as Britain's first boy band and now lives in Laxey with his wife.
He decided to search his attic for the song and video after reading that three of the squad were living with Alzheimer's disease.
It has been released coincide with the European Championships in France and all funds from the song will go to the charity Alzheimer's Research UK.
Mr Wragg added: "This is a nostalgic delight and will support a very worthy charity - I was so emotional watching it back knowing that some of the lads have passed away now."
