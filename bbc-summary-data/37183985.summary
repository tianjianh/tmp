Breastfeeding mother told to use pub toilet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A breastfeeding mother said she was asked to "cover up" and feed her nine-week-old son in a pub toilet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lauren Noakes, 22, said "there was nobody around" at the Sneyd Arms in Stoke-on-Trent when she was approached by a member of staff.
She was eating dinner with her sister and one-year-old son, Mickel, whilst breastfeeding Zion.
The pub apologised for the "ill-advised decision" that it said was against its policy.
Ms Noakes, from Cannock, Staffordshire, said: "If you go to a beach you'll see a topless woman, but if you're breastfeeding it makes it ungraceful - but it's more graceful than a topless woman."
Rosalind Bragg from Maternity Action said it has been illegal for businesses to prohibit a mother from breastfeeding for five years.
More reaction to the story
Ms Noakes said: "Mickel's one, so I had to put him in the high chair and feed him. I had to feed myself. And Zion woke up and wanted a feed at the same time."
The mother of two was then approached by a member of staff who said "can you cover up and go in the disabled toilet" because "breastfeeding isn't good around other customers".
Ms Noakes said she was close to tears: "I stopped breastfeeding. Mickel was still moaning so I left my dinner and we just went.
"I'm not the kind of person to complain. I don't feel confident doing it [breastfeeding] anyway so I was really embarrassed."
Ms Bragg is calling for the government to raise more awareness: "Businesses clearly are not aware of their legal obligation."
The pub released a statement saying: "We would like to apologise for the ill-advised decision taken.
"The team member was trying to accommodate another guest's request, however this is against our policy to provide a welcoming and comfortable experience for breastfeeding mothers, and therefore shouldn't have happened."
Ms Noakes said she was a regular at the pub but "will not go back at all" regardless of the apology.
