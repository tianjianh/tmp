A £208m project to cut congestion along two key dual carriageways in Greater Manchester has begun.

The scheme will focus on parts of the M60 and the M62, creating a 17-mile "smart motorway".
Technology will be installed to monitor traffic, provide information to drivers, and ease congestion by using variable speed limits.
The network between junction 8 of the M60 near Sale and junction 20 of the M62 near Rochdale, will be upgraded.
Stephen Greenhalgh, project manager at the Highways Agency, said the work was expected to create more than 1,000 jobs to help deliver the scheme.
"Once completed, the smart motorway will tackle the congestion and unpredictable journey times that users of the M60 and M62 experience every day," he said.
Site surveys will begin this week, meaning some sections of the hard shoulder will close.
From 21 July, a 50mph temporary speed limit will be enforced near junction 18 of the M62, and then widened along other sections affected by the work.
The project is due to be completed in 2017.
By that time more than 200 new electronic signs will warn drivers of changes in the mandatory speed limit, lane closures, and road obstacles.
CCTV will also be used to monitor traffic levels from the Highways Agency's control centre at Newton-le-Willows in Merseyside.
