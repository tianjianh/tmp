[SN]TITLE[SN]
Human rights reform still a long way off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the treats in store for 2016 is the government's much-anticipated announcement on human rights reform.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Conservatives promised in their election manifesto to "replace the Human Rights Act with a UK bill of rights" as long ago as 2010 - but they were unable to reach agreement with the Liberal Democrats during the coalition government of 2010-15.
Even so, the Tories promised to produce their own draft Bill of Rights by the end of 2014.
Although that failed to materialise, there was a commitment in their 2015 manifesto to "scrap the Human Rights Act".
And reporters were told after the Conservatives won a majority in May that plans would appear within the government's "first 100 days".
By September, ministers were promising to publish a consultation paper "towards the end of the autumn".
Human Rights Act versus a British Bill of Rights
In December, though, the justice secretary told the House of Lords Constitution Committee that his plans had been put back. "I expect that any consultation document that we produce will now be produced in the new year," Michael Gove said.
This was to allow consideration of an entirely new issue.
Mr Gove said he had been asked by David Cameron "to think hard about whether we should use the British Bill of Rights in order to create a constitutional longstop similar to the German Constitutional Court and, if so, whether the Supreme Court should be that body".
This longstop was not intended to deal with rulings of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which are not directly binding on the courts of the United Kingdom.
It was aimed instead at the entirely separate EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
"The German Constitutional Court can, in certain circumstances, say that rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union may pose problems for their constitution," Mr Gove said.
This was an enormously complicated area, he told peers, and one in which the government had to tread with care.
At this stage, ministers were simply considering questions they might ask in a consultation paper.
But from what the justice secretary was saying, he seemed to be considering how judges in the UK could block rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
That idea was first outlined by the prime minister in his EU reform speech at Chatham House on 10 November.
"We need to examine the way that Germany and other EU nations uphold their constitution and sovereignty," David Cameron said.
"For example, the Constitutional Court in Germanyâ€¦ reserves the right to review legal acts by European institutions and courts to check that they remain within the scope of the EU's powers - or whether they have overstepped the mark. We will consider how this could be done in the UK."
That would be a major change, because some EU laws have direct effect in the UK and the EU court has always had the last word on how they should be interpreted.
But Prof Guglielmo Verdirame, of King's College London, predicted that the EU might back down rather than confront judges, government and Parliament.
For the government's plans to work, however, the UK might need to adopt a codified constitution - which would itself be a major undertaking.
The UK, Israel and New Zealand are the only democracies not to have fully written constitutions.
Lord Neuberger, president of the UK Supreme Court, suggested in 2013 that a written constitution "would presumably have primacy over decisions of the Human Rights Court in Strasbourg and even those of the EU Court in Luxembourg".
"Accordingly," he added, "where those decisions appeared to be inconsistent with any fundamental constitutional principles, those principles would prevail."
Even if the government's objectives can be achieved in a single statute rather than by codifying the entire constitution, the legislation will take a long time to think through.
So if human rights reform is linked to reforming the UK's relationship with the EU, the Human Rights Act 1998 may remain in place for a long while yet.
