Referee Mark Clattenburg took the players off in Saint-Etienne when fans in the Croatia end threw flares.
The Croatia Football Federation has also been banned from selling tickets to fans identified as "hooligans".
But with tickets for Tuesday's game against Spain all sold, this sanction is deferred until after the tournament.
If there is further Croatian crowd trouble in that match - the final one in Group D for both sides - then the sanction would kick in immediately.
The fine is the second biggest handed out at the tournament after Russia were fined 150,000 euros last week.
Clattenburg took the players off in the 86th minute.
During the delay, some Croatia players went over to the fans to ask them to stop causing trouble.
A steward appeared to be hurt when a firework he was removing from the pitch went off.
Journalist Andy Mitten, who was at the game, told BBC Radio 5 live at the time: "I was in a section full of Croatia fans. The team was playing really well, everything was good, the people around me were happy but then I noticed a big line of police and soldiers building up in front of the Croatia end.
"It became clear they knew something was going to happen and it did happen. I saw fighting. It was horrible to watch. It went on for two or three minute.s"
It is thought that the fans were protesting against Croatia Football Federation vice-president Zdravko Mamic.
Mamic was arrested last July and subsequently charged with embezzling money from Dinamo Zagreb when he was the club's chief executive.
He denies the accusation, but the controversy has led some Croatian fans to believe the federation is corrupt.
In a post on Facebook, a Hajduk Split supporters' group said it intended to disrupt Tuesday's Group D match against Spain in Bordeaux.
