Manager Lee Clark has raised the standards at Bury since his arrival, says Shakers full-back Greg Leigh.

Bury's 3-0 win over Bristol Rovers means they have won four of six games since ex-Huddersfield and Birmingham boss Clark joined from Kilmarnock.
The 18th-placed Shakers are six points above the League One relegation places with six matches left this season.
Asked what Clark had changed, Leigh, 22, said: "I'd say the intensity of training and games."
He told BBC Radio Manchester: "As soon as a new manager comes in you want to impress, but I feel like his standards have pushed the squad and got players to their maximum potential, myself included.
"It's good that he has such high standards to push people because that is when you get performances."
