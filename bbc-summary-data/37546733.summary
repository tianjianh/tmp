Joshua Follin was seen being hoisted into the air by Jonjo Shelvey amid the celebration of the Magpies' 4-3 win against Norwich.
The midfielder visited Shanklea Primary School to present him with a signed copy of a photo that went viral.
"I was over the moon when he came and picked me up," the nine-year-old said.
Joshua, who was working as a ball boy for the first time at last week's match, said: "I was jumping up and down, going crazy, when we scored. It was really good and I was really excited to see him come into school today.
"He's my favourite player now!"
Newcastle United came from 3-1 down to win the game at St James' Park in stoppage time.
Former Liverpool and Swansea player Shelvey said: "Games like that don't come around too often so it was an unreal moment. Joshua was smiling and jumping around so I just thought I'd get him involved in the celebrations.
"You always try to relate to fans and I know little things like this go a long way. It has meant a lot to him and his family."
