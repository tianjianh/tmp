[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 1-2 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot made their way into the top five of the National League with an excellent win at Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shamir Fenelon broke the deadlock for the Shots midway through the first half with a crisp finish past Steve Arnold.
Liam Bellamy made it 2-0 four minutes before the break, cushioning a neat header back across the sprawling keeper.
Ross Lafayette still had time in first-half stoppage-time to pull one back with a sweetly struck 25-yard free-kick.
In a high-tempo second period, Aldershot had to work hard to hold on, but Matt McClure was unlucky not to extend the winning margin when he headed an effort against the underside of the bar.
