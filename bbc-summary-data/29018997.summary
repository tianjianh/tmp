MWL Print Group, in Pontypool, established in 1973, closed its doors on the Pontyfelin Industrial Estate on Friday.
It printed universities prospectuses and made billboards and exhibition stands.
Last year, its pre-tax profits fell by Â£295,000 and a directors' report said it was a "very competitive" landscape.
One worker, who did not want to be named, said the sector had become fiercely competitive and with "everyone undercutting everyone else".
Another worker, Adam Romanic, 37, said he was "gutted".
"We had a really good client base and there were rumours that they'd would be bought out by management, but that doesn't seem to have happened," he said.
"I've got lots of friends here and everyone's devastated really."
