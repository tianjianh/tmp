[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 79-year-old daredevil was forced to abandon his bid to become the oldest person to water-ski across the English Channel.

The stunt was the last of eight challenges Robin Hanbury-Tenison had set himself ahead of his 80th birthday.
The others included skydiving from 14,000ft, running the London Marathon and cave abseiling.
He abandoned the water-ski on Saturday owing to large waves which were described as "boat breaking".
Mr Hanbury-Tenison, who is from Cornwall and turns 80 in May, said: "We thought we had a hole in the weather but it wasn't as good as everybody had hoped... There was no way that I was going to fight those waves for an hour and a half."
He set himself the eight challenges - one for each decade of his life - to raise funds for Survival International, a global movement for tribal people's rights which he co-founded in 1969.
He left Dover with 13-year-old Lauren Bird, who got just under halfway across in her bid to become the youngest person to water-ski across the Channel.
Her father Steve, from Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, said: "She was doing really well in really taxing conditions, but some of the waves were bigger than her, and she's quite small."
Mr Hanbury-Tenison has raised more than Â£60,000 of his Â£80,000 target.
Although he does not plan to repeat his attempt, he aims to prove he can complete the distance by water-skiing 20 miles on an estuary in Rock, Cornwall, close to where he lives.
