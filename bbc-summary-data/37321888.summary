Adam El-Abd: Shrewsbury Town defender keen to play for Egypt again

Shrewsbury Town skipper Adam El-Abd is hoping his form in League One this season can help him resurrect his international career with Egypt.

The Brighton-born defender, who has an English mother and Egyptian father, won the last of his seven caps in 2013.
And at the age of 31, he hopes it is not too late to add more appearances.
"I was very much the English boy in the Egyptian squad, but I would love another opportunity," El-Abd told BBC Radio Shropshire.
"It was a good experience which I'll cherish and look back on with pride."
"I'm told I walk like one apparently," joked El-Abd. "I'm half Egyptian by blood, but I grew up in Brighton, I feel more English and I don't speak great Arabic.
"But I've never forgotten my roots. That was driven into me from an early age by my dad and my brothers."
He comes from a sporting family, elder brother Joe having played professional rugby union in France with Top 14 team Oyonnax, while younger brother Sami was a Brighton apprentice before playing non-league football with Crawley Town, Hayes & Yeading, Whitehawk and Bognor Regis.
El-Abd was first called up by former US coach Bob Bradley to represent Egypt in 2012 and, although he is only nine matches into his career in Shropshire, the former Brighton, Bristol City, Bury, Swindon and Gillingham man is hoping to feature in the Africa Cup of Nations in the new year.
The biennial competition, won a record seven times by Egypt, is a lot more than what El-Abd light-heartedly refers to as all "pot holes and two-footed tackles".
"It's not always played on the best pitches," he said. "But the players are very athletic, and it's very technical, with a pass-the-ball mentality. And I would love to play in it."
