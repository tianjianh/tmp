Ivor Bell: Republican's bail varied for wedding anniversary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A veteran republican accused of involvement in the murder of Jean McConville has had his bail conditions varied to allow him to celebrate his wedding anniversary in Donegal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ivor Bell, 79, from Ramoan Gardens in west Belfast is facing two charges over the murder of the mother-of-ten.
The IRA kidnapped 37-year-old Mrs McConville from her home in Divis flats in 1972.
Mr Bell's lawyers have said at previous hearings that he denies the offences.
Ivor Bell was due to be arraigned on Friday at Belfast Crown Court but the arraignment was adjourned for a second time after his defence team said he was waiting to be examined by a Dublin-based consultant on whether he was fit to plead or not to the charges.
The Judge granted Mr Bell a variation in his bail to allow him to stay at an address in County Donegal for a week later this month to celebrate his wedding anniversary.
The case is next listed for hearing on 19 November.
