Stephanie Shevlin had been to the Box nightclub in Crewe on Saturday when she became ill. She died later in hospital.
Cheshire Police believe Ms Shevlin, from Liverpool, had taken MDMA and are investigating the cause of her death.
Her mother Michelle said her daughter was due to start college in September and had her whole life in front of her.

"To have her life cruelly taken away in this manner is soul destroying and all I want is for my little baby to come home."
She appealed for anyone with information about who supplied the drugs to come forward and contact police.
In May, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction warned that Ecstasy and MDMA was getting stronger, with dangerously "pure" pills and crystals in circulation.
