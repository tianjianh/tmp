[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury has retired to consider verdicts against three men accused of preparing acts of terrorism involving knives.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Haseeb Hamayoon, 28, Nadir Syed, 22, and his cousin Yousaf Syed, 22, all deny being inspired by so-called Islamic State to prepare an attack between September and November 2014.
Prosecutors say the men were obsessed with beheadings and the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby.
They were arrested days before 2014's Remembrance events, the jury heard.
Mr Hamayoon, from Hayes, west London, Nadir Syed, from Hounslow, west London, and his cousin Yousaf, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, have accepted that they went online through various social media apps to share graphic and violent imagery and material.
They told the jury their social media habits had been offensive, but they have denied having any plan to kill anyone.
The prosecution told the jury at Woolwich Crown Court that the men were inspired by an IS fatwa - or decree - to kill westerners, which was published in mid-September last year.
But each man has denied being a supporter or follower of IS, saying there is no evidence of a plot or target.
The jury has been sent home for the day and is due to return at 10:00 GMT on Thursday.
