[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to 100 jobs could be cut at Imperial Tobacco's head quarters in Bristol, the company has confirmed

The firm, which produces cigarette brands including JPS and Gauloises, said the "structural changes" were part of a "new phase of cost optimisation".
About 500 people are employed at the firm's head office on Winterstoke Road.
A company spokesman said the steps were "difficult but necessary" to strengthen its "competitiveness and sustainability".
Along with restructuring its head office, the firm is also looking at getting rid of a factory and research laboratory in France and closing a factory in Russia.
The spokesman said: "Potential job losses are always extremely regrettable and we will ensure that anybody affected is treated fairly.
"These are difficult but necessary steps for us to take to strengthen our competitiveness and sustainability.
"Consultations with unions and works councils are ongoing and we are therefore unable to make any further comment."
The announcement follows the closure of Imperial Tobacco's Horizon factory in Nottingham in May, with a loss of over 500 jobs.
Bosses at the factory previously blamed falling sales and an increase in the illegal tobacco trade for their decision to move out of the UK.
