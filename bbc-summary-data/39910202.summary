One-Day Cup: Glamorgan v Kent (Sun)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan go into their final One-Day Cup game against Kent in Swansea with two players rated among the top three performers in the competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Ingram still tops the Professional Cricketers' Association rankings, with fast bowler Marchant de Lange third.
Kent all-rounder Darren Stevens is set for his 300th limited-overs appearance.
England wicket-keeper Sam Billings and ex-Glamorgan seamer James Harris are also in the Kent squad.
Glamorgan look set to choose from an unchanged 13 after their spectacular three-wicket win away to Hampshire, their third win in seven matches.
De Lange's five-wicket haul makes him the country's leading wicket-taker with 17 in seven games.
"It makes Wednesday's defeat at Radlett (against Middlesex) a bit frustrating, but it proves to us we can play the kind of cricket we want to" said Chris Cooke after hitting 59 off 27 balls at Southampton.
"It's still May, and there's a lot of cricket to play with a big T20 Blast coming up, so it proves we can beat the best teams.
"I will be trying to hit those ice-cream vans at Swansea!"
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph is likely to have recovered from a badly bruised hand suffered in the field at Southampton, which prevented him from opening the batting.
Glamorgan (from, probable) : Jacques Rudolph (capt), David Lloyd, Will Bragg, Colin Ingram, Kiran Carlson, Chris Cooke, Aneurin Donald, Craig Meschede, Andrew Salter, Marchant de Lange, Timm van der Gugten, Lukas Carey, Michael Hogan.
Kent Spitfires (from): Sam Northeast (capt), Daniel Bell-Drummond, Joe Denly, Sean Dickson, Darren Stevens,Alex Blake, Sam Billings (wk), Calum Haggett, Matt Coles, James Harris, James Tredwell, Imran Qayyum, Charlie Hartley, Ivan Thomas.
