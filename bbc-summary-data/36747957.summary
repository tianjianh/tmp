[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four people have been rescued after their yacht got into difficulty off the County Antrim coast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vessel's engine failed a mile north east of Muck Island on Thursday evening.
Weather conditions at the time were described as good with a Force 3 wind and a slight swell running.
A volunteer crew from the Larne RNLI launched two lifeboats at about 18:30 BST.
The lifeboat towed the yacht to Carrick Marina.
Larne RNLI Deputy Launching Authority Philip Ford-Hutchinson said the call-out was "a great example of both our inshore and all-weather lifeboats working well together to assist the four people onboard the casualty vessel".
