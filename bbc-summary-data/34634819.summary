[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gloucester bishop Rachel Treweek to take seat in Lords

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The most senior female bishop in the Church of England is set to take her seat in the House of Lords.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bishop of Gloucester, the Rt Rev Rachel Treweek, will be introduced as one of 26 Lords Spiritual by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Bishop of London Richard Chartres.
As a diocesan bishop, she is the first woman with enough Church seniority to be appointed to the House of Lords.
She will take the parliamentary oath before taking a place on the benches.
Bishop Treweek sent back the first version of the writ of summons because it termed her a "right reverend father in God". Instead, it will describe her as "bishop".
In an interview, she said she wanted to gently challenge people - and that God should be seen as neither a male nor a female figure but simply as God.
On gender equality within the Church, Bishop Treweek says there is a long way still to go, even though it is more than 20 years since the first women were ordained.
She has also been critical of the lack of diversity within the Church, calling for more participation by people of all colours and different social backgrounds.
Before moving to Gloucester, Bishop Treweek worked in London's poorest communities and says she wants to use her voice not only for the needy but for justice for all.
She was one of 84 Anglican bishops who signed a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron calling for sanctuary for an extra 30,000 Syrian refugees.
Bishop Treweek began her role as Bishop of Gloucester last month after the retirement of the Right Reverend Michael Perham.
At a service in Gloucester Cathedral she was presented with her pastoral staff and placed in her bishop's chair. She also preached her first sermon as a bishop.
Two women bishops have already been appointed, but Bishop Treweek is the first woman to run a diocese.
