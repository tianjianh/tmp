The 25-year-old, who spent last term on loan at Aston Villa, will join Everton on 1 July when his United deal expires.
He was also called into the England squad for Sunday's friendly with the Republic of Ireland to replace the injured Ryan Mason of Tottenham.
"I can think of many reasons why fans will enjoy Tom representing our club," said Everton boss Roberto Martinez.
"The most important one is that he is a perfect fit for what we are trying to build here as he has so much experience of playing in the Premier League and he still has his best years just ahead of him."
Cleverley, who has also had loans at Leicester, Watford and Wigan - where Martinez was in charge - won the last of his 13 England caps in November 2013.
"At the age of 25 and a player who is representing his country, Tom has experienced winning trophies and having big roles in demanding teams," the Toffees manager added.
"Having worked with him previously, I know the type of character he is and I know that, with the Everton fans' support, we will get a very special footballer joining our already exciting team.
"It says a lot also, when someone like Tom is available on a free transfer and he can pick his next club out of many options home and abroad, that he has chosen to play for our football club. That's the perfect start to his career here at Everton."
