Tens of thousands of children in the UK are young carers.
Being a kid carer can be tough. Looking after a family member whilst dealing with the pressures of school, friends and growing up can be very hard.
January 28th is Young Carers Awareness Day.  We've been to meet Charlotte, who looks after her mum who suffers from depression.
She tells us about the moment when she realised she was different to her friends and how caring for a parent has made her who she is today.
Here's her story.
