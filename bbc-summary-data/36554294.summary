Welsh football fans at Euro 2016 need to "keep safe and behave responsibly", a police chief has urged.

It comes after five Welsh supporters and four English ones were arrested after "disorder" on a train from Calais on Wednesday.
The atmosphere between supporters was said to be "good-natured" following Wales' 2-1 loss to England on Thursday.
Paul Corkery of Fan Embassy Wales said what was thought to be a "high risk" match had "a fantastic atmosphere".
It followed clashes in nearby Lille on Wednesday, where many have been staying.
Mr Corkery said: "[Following trouble involving Russia supporters Marseille] They decided safety in numbers and joined up together and all got on - there was some banter after the match, that was fun and games. With regards to violence, there wasn't any, that's fantastic."
Assistant Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for football policing, said the 12pm alcohol curfew and use of plastic bottles had been "helpful tools in preventing an escalation of violent behaviour".
"More UK officers are now in France and we are working with the French police should there be any further disturbances," he added.
"A reminder to fans to enjoy the rest of the tournament, keep yourselves safe and behave responsibly - do not retaliate to provocation and seek help from police if you are harassed or attacked."
There has been a high level of security in Lens and Lille where trouble broke out on Wednesday, with some English and Russian supporters being detained after scuffles.
At least 37 people were arrested as riot police fired tear gas and charged at hundreds of England fans.
The Russian football team have already been given a suspended disqualification from the tournament following attacks by their supporters on England fans at their opening fixture in Marseille on Saturday.
Wales face Russia in their final Group B game on Monday night and can still qualify for the last 16 stage of the tournament.
