Lee Tomlin gave the visitors the lead when he ran unchallenged into the box and fired low past keeper David Button.
Visiting keeper Richard O'Donnell saved Hogan's spot kick after he was fouled by Nathan Baker to keep their lead.
Hogan scored his first goal since his return from a year out with a cruciate knee ligament injury as he nodded Jake Bidwell's tee up to rescue a point.
The result means Brentford remain in 13th place in the Championship table while Bristol City climb a place to 18th and maintain their 10-point cushion on the relegation places with four games left to play.
Bristol City were chasing what would have been a first league victory at Griffin Park since February 2006, before Hogan's late intervention.
The former Rochdale striker injured his knee in Brentford's 2-0 win against Rotherham in August 2014 and scored his first goal for the Bees almost two years after joining the club.
Brentford head coach Dean Smith: "I spoke to my guys on the bench and said as [Hogan] stepped up that at least the keeper wouldn't have seen him take one, but it was a great save.

"Scott is a natural striker and they know where to be when it matters. He's had a round of applause from the boys after the game because he's worked so hard for that, and has come back even stronger.
"A re-rupture isn't nice at all so that goal was for him, his family and the medical team.
"He's a lot stronger player than I saw at Rochdale, he's a natural finisher and that's why the club went and got him. I certainly couldn't have afforded him at Walsall."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "I would say it's advantage Bristol City in that fight, but we want to try to catch Brentford because that's important for our mindset going forward.
"This was a good game for the neutrals with quite a few opportunities at both ends, major decisions that both teams feel didn't go their way, but it was a fair result in the end."
"Lee [Tomlin] is a top player and one of those who you don't see for 89 minutes until he sticks one in top corner.
He's a Premier League talent like Alan Judge for Brentford and we're lucky to have him."
