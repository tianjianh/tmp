Women's Euro 2017: Holders German beat Italy as Sweden overcome Russia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defending champions Germany secured a 2-1 victory to eliminate Italy in the group stage at the Women's Euro 2017.

Italy came from behind when striker Ilaria Mauro cancelled out Josephine Henning's first-half opener.
Babett Peter scored the winner from the penalty spot, after keeper Laura Giuliani brought down Anja Mittag, and a minute later Italy saw Elisa Bartoli sent off for a second yellow card.
Meanwhile, Sweden beat Russia 2-0 to move top of Group B.
Russia could have secured a quarter-final berth if they had won, following their surprising 2-1 win over Italy in their opener.
But Sweden captain Lotta Schelin gave her side the lead on 22 minutes, heading in Magdalena Ericsson's free-kick.
And Stina Blackstenius doubled their advantage in the second half when she capitalised on a poor goal kick and saw her shot deflect off defender Anna Kozhnikova, before finding the net via the woodwork.
Having drawn 0-0 in their opener, Sweden and six-time champions Germany need a point in their final group games on Tuesday (19:45 BST) to see them both through to the quarter-finals.
Russia will need to beat Germany in order to progress to the knockouts in the Netherlands.
