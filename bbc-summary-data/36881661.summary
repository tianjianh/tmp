Former Newport Gwent Dragons coach Paul Turner is to help a new Welsh exiles programme aimed at identifying the best Welsh players playing outside Wales.

The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) wants to track players who are Welsh-qualified by birth, parentage or residency.
Turner will work on a part-time basis with programme manager Gareth Davies.
The 56-year-old, who has previously coached the likes of Sale, Saracens and Wasps, is currently in charge of Ampthill in the English third tier.
Turner, capped three times by Wales, left the Dragons in 2011 after six years at Rodney Parade.
He will now report to Davies and WRU head of rugby performance Geraint John in their search to make players available to the Welsh regions and the national team.
"It's an area I'm very passionate about, having lived and worked outside of Wales for many years," said Turner.
"I'll be looking for Welsh qualified players around the world who have the potential to play at the top level.
"They may or may not be available to Welsh regions at the moment so I will continue to monitor their progress and their situation, in conjunction with the potential needs of the Welsh regions and Wales."
John added: "Paul has a fantastic eye for talent, and is extremely well connected in rugby circles in the UK and around the world.
"He will watch and observe top end players capable of playing regional and international rugby in Wales."
