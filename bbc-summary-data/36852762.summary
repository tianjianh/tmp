The fund was a government project to develop Malaysia's economy, but the Department of Justice (DoJ) has alleged that vast amounts of the fund's money was actually spent by a few individuals on luxury assets around the world.  Officials at 1MDB have denied any wrongdoing.
Here are some of the ways the US says the money was spent.
The DoJ alleged that $380m was spent on a stake in the Park Lane, a luxury hotel overlooking Central Park in New York.
Another property, Park Laurel Condo, also in New York, cost $33.5m at purchase, the US claims.
Walker Tower Penthouse and Time Warner Penthouse were purchased for $50.9m and $30.5m respectively.
The Viceroy L'Ermitage Hotel in Beverly Hills in Los Angeles was also on the list, purchased for $44.8m, the US alleges.
A mansion in Beverly Hills with a pool curved around and it and tiered gardens was valued at $31m at purchase.
And the DoJ says $41.8m was spent on a secluded townhouse in the London's upmarket Belgravia area.
The US says 1MDB spent $100m on Red Granite Pictures, the studio backing the The Wolf of Wall Street - a film about corruption and greed. The production company was co-founded by Riza Aziz, stepson of the Mr Najib.
A Bombardier Global 5000 private jet was purchased for a reported $35.4m.
Vincent Van Gogh's La Maison de Vincent à Arles, a pen and ink drawing by the Dutch post-impressionist, was picked up for $5.5m, the DoJ said.
Oscar-Claude Monet's Nymphéas Avec Reflets de Hautes Herbes, an oil painting was worth $57.5m at purchase.
Monet's Saint-Georges Majeur au Crépuscule was bought for $35m.
