Mr Souza's original post contains many more photos and the background on them. He has also posted a "year in photos" round-up from the White House in previous years.

"It's been the honour of a lifetime to be a witness to history these past eight years."
The president's photographer, Pete Souza, has selected the finest photos from inside the White House and beyond for his final annual review, before the Obama administration is replaced in January.
"The editing for this project is both subjective and personal," he said.
"Yes, there are some historic moments included but mostly I was looking for behind-the-scenes moments that give people a more personal look at the president and first lady."
We have reproduced a selection, with insights from behind the lens by Mr Souza.
