English player Burke and Morgan, from Wales, carded four-under rounds of 67 to take a share of second place.
France's Nocera, the 2008 champion, shot five birdies on the front nine.
"It was raining and windy so we had the full experience of Scottish weather. Then it got really good and sunny, so we had a good back nine," said Nocera.
