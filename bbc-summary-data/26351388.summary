More than 24 portraits by America's 43rd president will feature in the exhibit, called The Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy.
His works will be displayed at the George W Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas.
The subjects of the portraits, signed with the number 43, are not known.
However, President Bush did famously present a portrait of Jay Leno to the US chat show host on an edition of his show last November.
Artefacts, photographs and personal reflections will also be part of the exhibition, which aims to "provide an insider's view into President Bush's unique relationships with other world leaders".
President Bush took painting lessons after leaving the White House in January 2009 and has cited British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's book Painting as a Pastime as an inspiration.
The 67-year-old's known works include a picture of Barney, his black Scottish terrier who died in 2013, and paintings of his ranch near Waco, Texas.
"People are surprised," he told the Dallas Morning News last year. "Of course, some people are surprised I can even read."
