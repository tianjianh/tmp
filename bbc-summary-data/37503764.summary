Trade has started to recover at Alton Towers following a crash on its Smiler rollercoaster last year.

Its owners, Merlin Entertainments, said visitor numbers had picked up over summer, but that overall numbers "still remain some way below the 2014 level".
On Tuesday, the company was fined Â£5m for the incident, for which it has apologised.
Sixteen people were injured in the June 2015 crash, including two teenage girls who needed leg amputations.
"We have learned every lesson from what happened last year and made a number of technical and procedural improvements to make sure that an accident like this cannot happen again," the company said its trading statement.
Overall, Merlin Entertainments saw growth in revenue of 10.6% in the year so far.
"Trading across the existing estate has been mixed," said Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainments.
"Our Resort Theme Parks Operating Group is now showing year-on-year revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing recovery in trading at Alton Towers."
However, he added that its Midways Attractions group, which includes its Madame Tussauds and Sea Life chains, continued to see challenges, with London in particular suppressing overall trade.
"Many of our city centre attractions have experienced volatile trading patterns as a result of wider security concerns that have affected both domestic and international visitation," Mr Varney said.
"This continues to have a significant impact on Midway London, the largest Division within the Operating Group, where visitor volumes have also yet to see any material benefit of sterling weakening to current levels."
Meanwhile in China, Madame Tussauds in Shanghai is having a "challenging" time since Disney opened its resort there.
Shares in Merlin Entertainments finished nearly 6% lower on London's FTSE 100.
