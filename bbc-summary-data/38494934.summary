The UK's stock market started the year in positive mood, closing at a record high on its first day of trade.

After closing at a record level of 7,142.83 on the final trading day of 2016, the FTSE 100 rose another 0.5% to close at 7,177.89.
"No January blues for equity markets as traders in London have returned to their desks in optimistic mood," said Neil Wilson at ETX Capital.
"The FTSE is still enjoying the momentum from last week's Santa rally."
Banks and financial companies were the strongest performers with stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown up 5% and the bank Barclays up 3.78%.
Changes to broker ratings were behind some of the day's biggest moves. Intercontinental Hotels Group rose 1.3% after Barclays raised its rating on the company to "overweight".
But shares in Halfords and Next were both hit by downgrades from Deutsche Bank. Halfords fell 5.6% after Deutsche cut its rating on the company to "sell" from "hold".
Next - which is due to release a trading update on Wednesday - fell 4.2% after Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the retailer to "hold" from "buy".
A stronger than expected survey of the UK's manufacturing sector boosted the pound. The latest Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index for manufacturing suggested activity in the sector hit a two-and-a-half-year high last month.
The pound rose 0.2% against the euro to â‚¬1.1766, although against the dollar it slipped by 0.17% to $1.2256.
