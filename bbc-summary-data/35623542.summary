The Bundesliga match against Borussia Dortmund was delayed for around eight minutes and only started again after Schmidt left his technical area.
Schmidt claimed Dortmund's goal, scored by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, should not have stood.
"I was too stubborn and reacted emotionally," said Schmidt afterwards.
Re-live all the drama here.
The 48-year-old claimed a free-kick leading to the goal was not taken from the right place.
German referee Zwayer asked Leverkusen's acting captain Stefan Kiessling, who had conceded the foul that led to the goal, to tell his coach to leave the dug-out.
When nothing happened, Zwayer led the teams off the pitch and into the dressing rooms.
"It was certainly a mistake on my part," added Schmidt.
"However, I wish the referee had explained to me just once why I had to go to the stands."
It was the first time a Bundesliga match had been suspended in such circumstances, with Schmidt going on to watch the remainder of the game from his team's dressing room.
The result moved Dortmund to within eight points of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich following Bayern's 3-1 win over Darmstadt on Saturday.
The top two teams meet in Dortmund on 5 March.
Leverkusen missed the chance to go third in the table as their six-match unbeaten league run came to an end.
In a game of few chances, the controversial moment came after 64 minutes when Kiessling fouled Sven Bender.
Matthias Ginter took a quick free-kick which released Erik Durm to break clear and cross for Aubameyang to side-foot in his 28th goal of the season.
Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt: "We went behind to an irregular goal. I pointed it out to the fourth official.
Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel:  "I can empathize with Roger, but better he took that position than I did.
"Emotions can sometimes boil over, but on this occasion it was a little too much."
