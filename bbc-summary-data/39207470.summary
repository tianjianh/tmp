Swansea City midfielder Ki Sung-yueng has resumed training ahead of Saturday's game at Premier League relegation rivals Hull City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old South Korean international has been out since January because of a knee injury.
Winger Jefferson Montero is also set to return having been sidelined since Boxing Day with a hamstring injury.
Defender Kyle Naughton will miss Saturday's game because of a hamstring injury.
Naughton's injury is not as bad as first feared and the 28-year-old should be back for the following game against Bournemouth.
