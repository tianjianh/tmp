The blast happened at about at 16:40 BST on Saturday at Plumpton Road in Hoddesdon.
A man in his 30s and another in his 40s, both from Wood Green in London, died from their injuries at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford.
Hertfordshire Police said a man had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence.
A third victim, who is in his 20s, was taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow but has since been discharged.
Police said the arrested man is a 40-year-old from Hoddesdon. He was also being questioned on suspicion of health and safety offences.
The fire service tweeted to say it had received "numerous calls to a building fire".
The scene remained cordoned-off on Sunday while investigations took place.
Police said the unit was currently unoccupied, but it was believed the men may have been carrying out some form of work there.
