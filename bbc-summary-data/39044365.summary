The 21-year-old was on a season-long loan from Chelsea and had been an ever-present for the side in League Two.
He has now returned to his Premier League parent club for treatment.
Rovers manager Darren Ferguson told the club website: "He has been so important in terms of how we want to play. We're all disappointed for him as he has done so well for us."
