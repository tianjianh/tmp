Championship: Jersey 44-27 Rotherham Titans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jersey's play-off dreams are still alive with two Championship matches to go, after they ran in six tries in a 44-27 victory over Rotherham Titans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jersey got tries from Nick Haining, Rich Lane and two tries apiece from Tom Howe and James Freeman.
Winger Michael Keating scored twice and replacement prop Lewis Thiede went over once for the Titans.
Jersey remain in fifth, eight points behind Bedford Blues who won 54-46 in a thriller against Cornish Pirates.
The islanders will fancy their chances of closing the gap as Bedford still have to play the top two, Bristol and Doncaster, in their final league games.
After an early penalty from the boot of Rotherham fly-half Will Robinson, Jersey registered three tries in the opening 15 minutes.
First, winger Lane was found in space out wide and scored in the corner, but he was injured in the process and replaced by Aaron Penberthy.
Soon after, Howe went over in the other corner when scrum-half Joel Dudley dished the ball out wide from the back of a maul, and then flanker Freeman caught a high kick and had a clear run through for his first of the afternoon.
Titans though, boosted by the news the previous night that they were mathematically safe from relegation, hit back when Keating danced through to narrow the gap to make it 19-10, with Robinson superbly converting with a drop-goal after the ball fell off the kicking tee during his run up.
But the home side had the bonus point wrapped up before the break when Freeman powered over from a maul for his second.
Jersey back-row Haining scored Jersey's fifth after Joe Buckle spotted a gap in the Titans defence, and Penberthy's penalty meant they had a 21 point advantage.
Rotherham still made Harvey Biljon's side work for the win though, as they stole the momentum - the touch judge ruled Thiede had grounded the ball successfully after the referee Mike Hudson had originally signalled that it had been held up.
Keating then ran through for his second to reduce the deficit to just seven points, but Penberthy's penalty with a minute of normal time remaining steadied the Jersey nerves, before Howe ran onto Samisoni Fisilau's kick over the top to touch down and complete the win.
