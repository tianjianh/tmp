Five first-half tries, including two for full-back Stefan Ratchford, put Wire 30-6 ahead at half-time.
The visitors almost matched them after the break, but ended up well beaten.
Ratchford, Ryan Atkins and Tom Lineham all crossed twice, with Wire's other tries from Matty Russell, Peta Hiku and Declan Patton, who kicked eight goals.
Krisnan Inu scored twice for Catalans, who also crossed through Remy Casty and Lewis Tierney, while Luke Walsh added four goals.
Veteran England forward Benny Westwood returned from a three-game suspension to make his 400th appearance for Warrington since moving from Wakefield in 2002.
Warrington began the qualifiers last weekend with victory at Widnes, while the Dragons edged home against London Broncos.
Warrington coach Tony Smith:
"The way Benny Westwood performed was instrumental in our good start. He hasn't played for a month, but he put his hand up and showed his class. He's tough and uncompromising. I like coaching him and like having him in the team.
"I'm not just mentioning him because it's his 400th game, but that is a massive achievement in this day and age in a sport like ours.
"Our attack in the first half was as good as we've shown this year. The second half was scrappy and disjointed. It was difficult to get into the flow. But overall I'm pleased to get that sort of scoreline against another Super League team."
Catalans coach Steve McNamara:
"They blew us away physically at the start of the game and the scoreboard went way too far against us.
"There was a response from us in the second half and we showed some resolve but ultimately we were clearly second best.
"We played a good team, who played very well. We were flat at the start and we paid the price."
