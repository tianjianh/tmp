[SN]TITLE[SN]
Celta Vigo 4-1 Deportivo La Coruna

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Liverpool striker Iago Aspas scored twice as Celta Vigo beat La Liga rivals Deportivo La Coruna 4-1 in the Galician derby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aspas scored from the penalty spot on the hour to put Celta 2-1 up after Raul Albentosa had cancelled out Hugo Mallo's opener.
Fabian Orellana added a third for Celta in the 78th minute before Aspas, 29, sealed the win seven minutes from time.
Aspas scored once in 15 appearances for Liverpool in the 2013-14 season.
Liverpool signed Aspas from Celta for £7m in June 2013 but he struggled to make an impact and was sold to Sevilla.
He rejoined Celta for a second spell in June 2015 and scored 14 goals in 35 appearances in La Liga last season.
