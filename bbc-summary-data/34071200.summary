[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have described a paramilitary-style attack on a man in Londonderry as "absolutely barbaric".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 30-year-old man was beaten with an iron bar and shot by masked men at Corrib Court, Ballymacgroarty at about 22:25 BST on Wednesday night.
The man's partner, who was also assaulted, and children were in the house when he was ordered to lie on the kitchen floor to be shot in the leg.
The man is in a stable condition in hospital.
PSNI Ch Insp Tony Callaghan said the front door of the man's house was forced open and a number of masked men entered his home.
"These people, armed with a handgun and an iron bar, assaulted the victim, striking him on the head and then dragged him to the kitchen where they shot him in the right leg.
"The victim's partner was present as were two children and during the assault the victim's partner was also assaulted as she tried to come to his aid and protect him.
"She was struck by those involved, dragged off and pulled by the hair."
Ch Insp Callaghan said police were exploring the motivation for the assault but that it has all the hallmarks of a paramilitary attack.
"The youngest child was 10 years of age and an older teenager was present as well," he said.
"To force their way into someone's home, to drag that person to the floor, to assault him with an iron bar is bad enough and to then shoot him in the leg is absolutely barbaric.
"These crimes have no place in our society, they are a residue of the past and can lead to death."
