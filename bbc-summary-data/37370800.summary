The seven-year-old took part in a scheduled swim at a camp run by St Edmunds School in Canterbury in August 2014.
He struggled for more than three minutes before becoming motionless, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said.
The school was fined £18,000 at Canterbury Crown Court and ordered to pay costs of almost £10,000.
Lifeguards noticed the youngster was in trouble and got him out of the water to administer CPR.
He regained consciousness but went on to develop pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung tissue), an HSE spokesman said.
The spokesman added: "The lifeguards were not effectively managed and monitored to ensure they were constantly vigilant.
"Two out of the three lifeguards did not hold a current, in-date lifeguard qualification."
St Edmunds School, which admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act on 11 April, was fined on Wednesday.
