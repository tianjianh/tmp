Snowdonia beauty captured in time-lapse videos by couple

It would surely take something special to inspire a couple to sleep in their car at isolated places during the coldest months of the year.

Most people visit beauty spots such as Capel Curig in Conwy, Gwynedd's Cwm Idwal, Cadair Idris and Llyn Padarn and Penmon, on Anglesey, for a few hours.
But Kingsley, 28 and Amy Summers, 27, have taken the back seats out of their Vauxhall Zafira so they can stay at these places overnight.
And the point of cuddling up with springer spaniels Mollie and Tink as their only "central heating" is not even instantly obvious to them.
Sometimes when darkness descends, the couple cannot even see Snowdonia and the lakes, trees and mountains in front of them properly.
It is only after they return home to Milton Keynes that the reason for a night spent shivering in their car becomes clear.
The couple's aim is to capture the changing scenes around Wales' best-known beauty spots at times when nobody else is around to witness them.
They do this through time-lapse videos, which involves placing their camera on a tripod and setting it to take photographs at regular intervals.
For example, if it took 12 hours for the sun to set and you took a photograph every minute, you would have 720 stills.
By compressing these into a video that shows them at the rate of 24 frames per second, you could show changes in weather and light from sun rise to sunset in 30 seconds.
"At night, you can really absorb the beauty. In places like north Snowdonia, it is so busy during the day, but you won't see another human being from dusk until dawn," Mr Summers said.
"You need to find the right spot, but (through the videos), you can see mist coming up the valley, water freezing and coming off the lake and ice moving along the water."
Some of their favourite locations include Llyn Padarn near Llanberis, Gwynedd, where they have captured the changing colours around "the lonely tree" on its banks.
Mr Summers' love affair with north Wales began when his parents took him on a family holiday to Anglesey when he was four.
Yet, for a man used to climbing down the side of office blocks and living life at a fast pace, sitting quietly overnight photographing its best-known beauty spots may not have been top of his list of priorities.
But it was a near-death experience some 20 years after his first visit to the area that changed all that.
Mr Summers worked as a rope technician, which involved abseiling off the side of big buildings every day, completing various repair and other jobs.
However, in 2012, after an operation to remove his gall bladder, he picked up a bad post-operation infection.
"I spent a lot of time in hospital and if things had been slightly different, I probably wouldn't be here now," Mr Summers said.
"I wasn't able to physically do anything and spent three or four months in bed, with movement very difficult."
As he recovered, Mrs Summers bought him a camera, which was not only the catalyst for a new hobby but a new career as a photographer.
"For quite a while, I was in quite a state when everything was up in the air," he said.
"But setting up a camera to take photographs and sleeping in a tent was something I could just about do."
The couple now take off in the car with the two dogs, and "depending on the weather we will either be under metal or fabric", Mr Summers added.
Other favourite locations include Scotland - in the Highlands and around Stirling, Lyme Regis in west Dorset and places like Grimsby and Kingston upon Hull on the east coast of England.
And just as fate seems to have conspired to turn him into a photographer, it also seems to have ensured he will continue taking pictures around Anglesey and Snowdonia.
"I fell in love with north Wales when I was young and visited for the first time," he said.
"My parents are in the process of moving to Old Colwyn, so it will give me even more excuse to keep going back in the future," he added.
