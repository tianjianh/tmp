Andy Murray has pledged to give £50 to children's charity Unicef every time he hits an ace for the rest of the season in a bid to help the refugee crisis.

Murray, 28, said that he was moved to act by coverage of people travelling to claim asylum in Europe.
"Having seen the images broadcast on the news I felt I had to do something to help," he said.
Murray's sponsor Standard Life, along with the Lawn Tennis Association and ATP, will each match his donation.
The world number three will play for Britain in their Davis Cup semi-final and is also due to compete in events in Shanghai and Paris before the World Tour Finals in London in November.
The British number one hit 64 aces in his four matches at the US Open earlier this month.
Murray has been one of Unicef's celebrity supporters since 2014 and starred in a series of comedy skit videos in June to raise money for the charity.
