[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Freeman netted an early goal for Mayo but Sean Quigley got the Fermanagh goal as Pete McGrath's Ulstermen carved out a 1-10 to 1-4 half-time lead.
Mayo's second goal was a harshly-awarded penalty converted by Cillian O'Connor who finished with 1-5.
Referee Joe McQuillan ruled that Aidan O'Shea had been fouled - Erne boss Pete McGrath said it was a "dive".
Fermanagh, one point up at the time, were clearly furious with the decision of the Cavan official.
Mayo struggled in the opening quarter and Fermanagh were on target from long range with points from Aidan Breen, Barry Mulrone, Quigley and Tomas Corrigan giving them a 0-4 to 0-1 lead after 10 minutes.
Freeman scored Mayo's goal in the 14th minute, when Christopher Snow saved expertly from Keith Higgins but he could not do anything about the follow-up.
Cillian O'Connor popped over another point and Mayo were level but Fermanagh scored 1-2 in the next three minutes.
Tomas Corrigan scored a point first, and then Ryan Lyons found Quigley and the big full-forward finished to the net. Then Tomas Corrigan pushed Fermanagh further ahead.
However, Cillian O'Connor scored two points in a row to bring Mayo back within two points as they looked to have the momentum into half-time.
Fermanagh had not scored since the 18th minute, but Breen got two points in a row and the efforts of Eoin Donnelly and Ryan Lyons gave them a comfortable 1-10 to 1-4 half-time advantage.
Points from Cillian and Diarmuid O'Connor gave Mayo the dream start to the second-half but Mulrone got one back for Fermanagh.
However they didn't score again until the 62nd minute, and meanwhile Mayo hit them for five points.
Then came the controversial penalty incident, Cillian O'Connor finding the net in the 65th minute and the incident involving O'Shea and Che Cullen.
And Mayo scored three more points as Alan Dillon rounded off the scoring after an impressive second-half comeback from Stephen Rochford's side.
"When I first saw it I thought the penalty was soft but after seeing it again it was an absolute dive," added an irate McGrath.
"The referee bought it hook, line and sinker - it was the defining point of the game and after we had defended so well."
