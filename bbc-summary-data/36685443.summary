[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swindon Town have signed Liverpool's Chilean goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old has agreed a three-year contract at the County Ground, having played 36 games for the League One club during a loan spell last season.
He was initially sent back from his season-long loan last October after paying a Â£50 fine for turning up late to training in one pence pieces.
After apologising, he resumed his spell, which ended in March through injury.
Vigouroux began his career at Tottenham Hotspur before moving to Anfield in 2014.
