A father-of-one charged with murdering a man in Craigavon has denied involvement in the fatal attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, stands accused of murdering Owen Creaney in July 2014 along with co-accused Shauneen Boyle, 25.
Both defendants blame each other for the attack.
Belfast Crown Court heard on Wednesday that Mr Hughes claimed his co-accused "went nuts" and "stood all over" the victim.
The jury heard Stephen Hughes's version of events via police interviews, during which he claimed not to have taken part in an assault launched on Mr Creaney solely by Shauneen Boyle.
Mr Hughes also said Ms Boyle "begged" him not to call an ambulance as she feared she would not see her young son again, and that it was her idea to put his remains into a green recycling bin after he died.
The jury also heard evidence from a PSNI custody sergeant who said he overheard Stephen Hughes telling his mother by phone that both he and Shauneen Boyle put Mr Creaney's remains in the wheelie bin.
The body of Mr Creaney, 40, from Lurgan, was found in the bin on 5 July 2014.
The court heard on Tuesday that trainers and jeans belonging to Mr Hughes were analysed by forensic scientists and found to contain traces of the victim's blood.
Stephen Thomas Hughes' address was given as Maghaberry Prison, but with a previous address in Moyraverty Court in Craigavon.
Shaunean Boyle's address was given as Hydebank Prison, but with a previous address in Edenderry Park, Banbridge.
