Amar Atwal was in a collision in Hollyhedge Road, West Bromwich on 27 May, along with two relatives, a 12-year-old boy and a 44-year-old woman.
They remain seriously ill in hospital with multiple injuries.
The Atwal family, from Great Barr, said they were "devastated" by Amar's death, but had donated his organs in the hope they would prove "life-changing" for others.
The driver of the other car - a man aged 34 - was uninjured.
Sgt Adam Green from West Midlands Police said: "We are extremely saddened to learn that this crash has now claimed Amar's life and our thoughts are with his family at this time."
An investigation into the cause of the crash is under way.
