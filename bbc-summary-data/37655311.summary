Striker Jefferson Louis has made the 37th move of his 20-year playing career by joining Oxford City of National League South, his 26th different club.

Louis, 37, established himself with Oxford United from 2002 before spells with Bristol Rovers, Stevenage, Mansfield and Wrexham among others.
The Dominica international joins Oxford City after two seasons with Wealdstone.
"He's certainly collected a few clubs and appearances along the way," City boss Justin Merritt said.
"Although he's had many clubs, he hasn't been with Oxford City before," Merritt joked to BBC Radio Oxford.
"We're hoping to have him involved in Saturday's game against Poole Town."
Louis' career has involved several returns to a number of clubs either on loan or permanent deals, with his sole international cap coming in a World Cup qualifier against Barbados in Match 2008, which Dominica lost 1-0.
