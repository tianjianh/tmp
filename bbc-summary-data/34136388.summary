A boy who sent a naked photograph of himself to a girl at school has had the crime of making and distributing indecent images recorded against him by police, the BBC has learnt.

The boy, aged 14, who was not formally arrested or charged, could have his details stored for at least 10 years.
The information could also be disclosed to future employers, his mother said.
The Criminal Bar Association said the case highlights the dangers of needlessly criminalising children.
The schoolboy, who lives in the north of England, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme he took the naked photo of himself in his own bedroom.
He then sent it to a girl from his school using Snapchat - an app which deletes direct messages within 10 seconds.
However, before the image disappeared, the girl saved it on her own phone and it was then sent to other pupils at the school.
The matter was brought to the attention of a police officer based at the school and it has now been officially recorded as a crime.
If he had been aged over 18 he would have been the victim of so-called "revenge porn" and those who distributed the image prosecuted.
However, his mother was told her son's details - along with those of the girl involved and another teenager - had been added to a police intelligence database and could be stored for at least 10 years.
She said the school police officer said the incident could be flagged up in an advanced CRB check, if her son ever wanted to get a job working with children.
She the Today programme her son has been "humiliated", saying he was "at best naive" and at worst was just being "a teenager".
Many children at the school now take part in so-called "sexting" as a form of "flirting", she said.
The boy, who has asked to remain anonymous, said he felt "embarrassed and a bit intimidated" by the way the incident had been dealt with by police and his school.
He said he knew some people at the school  still had the image.
Asked about the consequences of the incident, he added: "It is just annoying really.
"Something that I did when I was 14 that could reflect badly in the future."
The school said there was no aggression or intimidation during his questioning and that the boy admitted what he had done straight away.
It said all students are taught about the dangers of sexting in assemblies and in class.
The boy's mother said police had only recently started filing crime reports about similar incidents, something her son says he was not aware of.
However, the school said all students were informed about the recent change in policy.
BBC Home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the case raises "important questions about the role of the police in dealing with disputes arising from social media".
Olivia Pinkney, Sussex Police's assistant chief constable and the National Police Chief Council's lead on children and young people, said if a school chose to take an incident to the police, then officers must record the crime.
She said the boy would be able to appeal against the decision before it was disclosed to future employers, saying she did not believe it would ever "be disclosed".
Mark Fenhalls, the chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, said most people would be "pretty astonished that a boy who's done this has ended up with material on a police computer".
