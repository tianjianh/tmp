American qualifier Todd Harrity upset 29-year-old Clyne, the highest ranked Scottish player at world number 34, 3-2 in just over an hour.
And Lobban, having lost to Hong Kong's Max Lee at the Qatar Classic two weeks ago, was beaten by him again.
The 23-year-old lost in straight games, going down 11-7, 11-8, 11-5.
Lobban tweeted: "Nowhere near good enough to beat someone like Max Lee today. Far from ideal losing so early in the tournament. #overbeforeitsevenstarted."
