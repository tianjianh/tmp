Canadian writer Kelly Oxford called on women to tweet their first experiences of sexual assault on Friday.
She described five personal experiences of being assaulted, including on a bus at the age of 12.
She continues to receive stories "every second".
Many women tweeted under the #NotOkay hashtag.
Women from around the world described being raped by public safety officers at university, groped by colleagues at work, stripped by police officers and molested by doctors, dentists and x-ray technicians.
Many of the stories recounted described assaults that took place when the women were underage, some as infants.
The exposure of "predatory males have made us stronger", Ms Oxford tweeted, adding "we realized the shame we carry is their shame".

Someone is sexually assaulted every two minutes in the United States, according to anti-sexual violence organisation RAINN. Nine out of every 10 rape victims are female.
