In a statement, they said: "He was an advocate of putting Herefordshire on the map and would take every opportunity to do so."
Lib Dem president Baroness Sal Brinton described Mr Keetch as a man of "absolute principle".
"He cared passionately about the people he represented in Herefordshire and was an assiduous local MP," she said.
"His knowledge of foreign affairs and the experience of individual people in some of the most difficult places in the world informed his role on national issues. We will miss him."
The party's former leader Lord Campbell said Mr Keetch was "an enthusiast in everything he did".
He added: "He had a special interest in defence, in which he showed exemplary judgement. It was a pleasure to work with him."
