Scottish Borders Council has appointed a "specialist enforcement firm" to help tackle dog fouling and littering.

Officers from 3GS will work alongside the local authority on a 12-month pilot scheme targeting problem areas.
They will have the power to issue Â£80 fixed penalty fines.
The council said it believed it was the first time a Scottish local authority and a private firm had teamed up to tackle dog fouling. Officers should be in place by the end of May.
The one year pilot is part of SBC's new "responsible dog ownership strategy", which was approved by councillors in February.
Councillor David Paterson said: "While we are keen to educate owners about the issue of dog fouling, the considerable feedback received from the public, communities and councillors has indicated that enforcement is also crucial.
"That is why I am pleased to announce 3GS as the external contractor to work beside the council by issuing tickets for dog fouling and littering.
"This is a 12-month pilot and will be reviewed regularly to understand its impact, before a longer term solution is recommended.
"We are carrying out a number of positive educational activities including the Green Dog Walkers scheme, but for those not willing to listen, they face an Â£80 fine or potential court appearance."
3GS managing director Paul Buttivant said they were delighted to work with the council on the scheme in light of "significant pressure" from local residents concerned about "escalating problems".
"Residents can be reassured that our officers are highly trained and will only issue fixed penalty notice to individuals who choose not to observe the law," he said.
