[SN]TITLE[SN]
Offender scheme 180 Degrees 'may increase crimes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A programme designed to cut reoffending rates actually made criminals more likely to offend, a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) study has found.

The police-led 180 Degree scheme covers Norfolk and Suffolk.
The Ministry of Justice study found 81% on the scheme reoffended within a year compared with 69% who were not on it.
A spokesman for the 180 Degree scheme said the findings might reflect the fact its clients were more closely watched than other offenders.
The study also found those on the Â£1m-a-year scheme committed more offences - on average 4.56 each - than the 3.25 offences per person found in the control group.
At any one time, there are between 280 and 290 offenders on the scheme.
The Ministry of Justice said both those on the scheme and the control group who were not were "similar offenders" and said its findings were "statistically significant".
The ministry's Justice Data Lab said: "The overall results show that those who took part in the scheme were more likely to re-offend and had a higher frequency of re-offences than those who did not."
The Ministry of Justice did not respond to questions about either an explanation for the higher likelihood of offending of those on the scheme or whether its findings were likely to be explored further.
Norfolk Constabulary's Insp Danny Kett, who manages the 180 Degree programme, said although the report has only just been published it was based on "old data".
He also claimed the findings might be due to people on the scheme being more closely monitored than other offenders (hence more likely to be caught).
Up-to-date figures comparing those on the scheme with those who were not, however, were not available when the BBC contacted Insp Kett.
"The scheme has come on quite a long way since then," he said, adding the report did not include details about either reductions in offending or the types of offences committed.
Insp Kett said: "If they step out of line," he said, "we know about it and we will report them."
Just last week in Norwich, he said, a shoplifter was identified wearing an unusual top which resembled one of the "clients" on their scheme. When the client arrived the next morning for a meeting with his probation officer he was wearing the same top and was arrested and charged.
"If he had not have been on the scheme, we would not have known who he was," said Insp Kett.
