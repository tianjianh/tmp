Alcohol is responsible for around 1 in 20 of all deaths in Wales - 29 a week - according to Public Health Wales.
A higher proportion of children in Wales aged 11 to 16 were drinking alcohol than in England or Scotland.
The report said progress was being made with heavy drinking falling among adults under 45 but could be on the increase among older people.
Linda Bailey, a consultant with Public Health Wales, said advertising and sports sponsorship needed to be tackled.
