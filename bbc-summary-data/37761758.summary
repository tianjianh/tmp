The Scottish government said the review group would assess whether college and university students in Scotland receive fair and effective support.
Ms Gadhia, who has been chief executive officer of Virgin Money for nine years, will also make recommendations for improvements.
The group will report its findings in 12 months' time.
The review group will look at whether effective support is being provided for the poorest and most vulnerable students. It will also examine the current repayment threshold and period for student loan debt.
It is being carried out as part of the programme for government announced by Nicola Sturgeon in September.
Minister for Further Education Shirley-Anne Somerville said: "With such strong financial experience, and already contributing to Scottish education as a member of the International Council of Education Advisers, Jayne-Anne will provide a fresh perspective to the work of the review.
"I look forward to the recommendations that the review group will offer."
Ms Gadhia, who last year led a UK government review into women in finance, said: "It is important to ensure the student support system is fit for purpose, fair and firmly focused on meeting the needs of all students in further and higher education, particularly the most vulnerable.
"As such, I welcome the opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review of the current systems of student support in Scotland."
The review, which will be carried out jointly with universities and colleges, has been welcomed by Colleges Scotland.
Shona Struthers, the chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said: "We want a standard and fair system for student support funding that provides students with adequate financial support, as well as reasonable certainty on the support they are likely to receive for the duration of their study.
"We fully support measures to improve student support funding to ensure that all students can attend college, regardless of their personal circumstances or background."
The announcement was made as figures from the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS) showed the number of students being paid grants across Scotland fell by 4.8% on last year as an increasing number take out loans.
However, the total cost being spent on grants increased by 3.9% - from £63.6m in 2014-2015 to £66.1m in 2015-2016, according to the SAAS report.
The number of students taking out loans rose during the same period by 3.4% to 92,005 and the total authorised in loans was £486.3m, a 3.7% increase.
The average loan per student in 2015/16 was £5,290, up £20 on the previous year.
Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: "These are hugely worrying figures, and show that the SNP has slashed bursary support in recent years.
"At a time when we should be doing all we can to close Scotland's attainment gap, the SNP has chosen to cut the money given to those who need it most.
"Bursaries are designed to help students get their foot in the door but this is becoming increasingly hard, and it's those in our poorest communities who are missing out."
Scottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: "Figures released today show that almost 20,000 fewer students are receiving grants and bursaries than at the beginning of the last parliament.
"Meanwhile student debt - which the SNP came to power promising to abolish - has soared under the SNP government.
"Labour supports free tuition but students need the financial support to get through university when they get there. Instead the SNP has slashed bursaries and ballooned debt."
