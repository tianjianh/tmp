[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A special Stormont committee, set up to try to create jobs, has met just once since it was established, the BBC has learned.

The ministerial sub-group was set up in January and said it wanted to "rebalance the regional economy".
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said its initial focus would be on Londonderry and the north west.
Since the group's inaugural meeting in January, only one further meeting has been held.
That meeting took place at Stormont Castle in March. The committee has not yet agreed a date for more talks.
Mr McGuinness said he was setting up the group to tackle issues like jobs, the A5, the A6, the expansion of Magee, the One Plan, Ebrington and Fort George.
He said the group was tasked with "delivering a more balanced regional economy with an initial focus on the north west".
The first and deputy first ministers attended the initial meeting along with the then Enterprise Minster Arlene Foster, Environment Minister Mark H Durkan, Employment and Learning Minister Stephen Farry and Chief Executive of Invest NI Alistair Hamilton.
Ms Foster said the executive was committed to the sub-group.
The Office of First and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) confirmed to BBC Radio Foyle that the first meeting happened on 5 March at Stormont Castle and focused on infrastructure.
Most of the main group members were there, but the then environment minister and the enterprise minister were absent.
A spokesperson for OFMDFM said: "Progress will not and cannot be measured by the number of meetings.
"The group will continue to work collaboratively regardless of departmental boundaries to drive forward economic development and prosperity for all in the north west."
SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said: "This group was launched with quite a fanfare of publicity.
"I believe a group like this is extremely important and I believe we should be determined to get things working.
"I didn't get to the meeting in March because I had an extremely important engagement.
"I am asking the first and deputy first ministers and other executive colleagues to prioritise going to the Treasury and asking for a city deal for Derry city or Derry City and Strabane District Council.
"I wrote to the first and deputy first ministers in June to ask about a date for another meeting. I still haven't got a reply."
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Raymond McCartney said: "We are dealing with decades of underdevelopment.
"The group should be meeting when the assembly reconvenes in September. I don't know what date that will be.
"Ministers meet with their officials on a constant and daily basis. In between times ministers are assuring they are doing their jobs.
"You can see the intention of the sub-group with key decisions around Ballykelly and the teaching block at Magee.
"This sub-group absolutely has a future."
