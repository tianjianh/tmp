Prince Charles tours Portsmouth's Mary Rose museum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prince Charles has toured the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth, 38 years after he first dived down to the wreck of the Tudor warship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£36m museum, opened last May, reunited the wreck with the 19,000 artefacts discovered with it.
Among the items found was a nit comb used by Tudor sailors, with nits still attached.
The Prince of Wales, who is president of the Mary Rose Trust, was accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall.
He was one of the last people to dive down to the wreck in 1982, before watching the hull being raised from the site just outside Portsmouth Harbour.
During his visit, the prince handled some of the artefacts and held a replica longbow.
He said: "I don't want to put my shoulder out."
The foundation stone for the ship's museum was laid by Prince Harry in 2011.
The warship was discovered in 1971 in Portsmouth Harbour where it was sunk in battle in 1545 while leading an attack on a French invasion fleet.
After the visit to the warship, Prince Charles was due to visit one of the Royal Navy's newest and most advanced warships, the Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon, at Portsmouth naval base.
