Jack Towes was caught recording a family member's court appearance from the public gallery at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court.
The court heard the footage even showed him filming a sign warning against the use of cameras in the court room.
The 21-year-old, of Hunwick Close, Middlesbrough, admitted contempt of court and was jailed for three months.
He initially attempted to deny the phone was his before eventually accepting his guilt, the court heard.
PC John Ennis, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "Unfortunately cases such as this are becoming more and more commonplace.
"Towes showed complete disregard for these laws, flouting them openly and flagrantly in front of staff members.
"I hope that this sentence sets an example for others."
