No-one was injured in the incident in Craigfoot Walk, Kirkcaldy at about 22:30 on Thursday but the house and a car were damaged.
Insp Graeme Neill, of Police Scotland, said: "Incidents like this are extremely rare, however, we have stepped up high visibility patrols in the area.
"I am satisfied that the risk to the general public is very low."
He added: "I can reassure the community that we have a dedicated inquiry team actively pursuing those responsible.
"Part of the roadway has been cordoned off and the local community are thanked for their cooperation. The road is still accessible to traffic."
Det Insp Colin Robson, of Police Scotland, said: "This is a significant police inquiry and I would appeal for anyone who has any information that could assist with this investigation to come forward."
