Byte Night is taking place in 10 cities across the country, and for the first time in Cardiff.
Last year more than 1,300 people gave up their beds to raise more than Â£1.1m for Action for Children.
The charity supports young people to rebuild their lives by offering accommodation, education and training.
Among them is 19-year-old Jess Williams who was homeless for two years in the Aberdare area. She was helped into accommodation by the Rhondda Cynon Taff youth support team.
Ms Williams said: "The help, guidance and support they've given me has taken me from the streets into my own flat so I can live an independent life in a warm place of my own.
"I don't know what would've happened to me otherwise, it's that simple."
The people sleeping rough in Cardiff are from a variety of businesses, such as KPMG, Admiral, BT and Barclays.
Among them is KPMG director Jeremy Thomas.
He said: "Although it'll be a hard night, it'll also be fun - but the difference is we can return to our warm homes, full fridges and cosy beds in the morning.
"For many children and young people living in the UK this simply isn't the case."
