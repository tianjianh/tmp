[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A volunteer RNLI crew have been given the seal of approval from an unlikely passenger.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boarding boat at St Davids RNLI Lifeboat Station takes crew to and from its lifeboat.
But the vessel has recently become a regular sunbathing spot for a 7ft (2.13m) long bull seal.
Dai John, St Davids RNLI coxswain, said: "His presence doesn't impact on our ability to save lives at sea at all so he is a welcome visitor."
The boat is currently being kept on a mooring until the charity's new lifeboat station is completed next year.
