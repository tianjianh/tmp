Neil Lennon: Touchline ban for Hibs boss following dismissal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil Lennon has been given a one-match touchline suspension by Uefa following Hibernian's 1-0 defeat by Brondby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lennon, who was taking charge of Hibs for the first time, was sent to the stand shortly after protesting against a disallowed Jason Cummings goal.
The 45-year-old will be banned for the Europa League second qualifying round second leg in Denmark next Thursday.
Speaking to BBC Scotland, Lennon said he felt the goal, which was ruled offside, was "perfectly legitimate".
Should Hibs overcome Brondby, they will face Germans Hertha Berlin in the third qualifying round.
