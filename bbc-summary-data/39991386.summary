The surviving half of a couple of "celebrity" swans has been attacked by dogs, only a week after his mate was savaged and put down.

"Mr and Mrs Swan", described as "big friends of the community", have made national headlines for holding up the traffic as they waddled through the Cornish resort of Perranporth.
However, she was killed last week and now he has been hurt in a new attack.
Witnesses said blood could be seen "all over" the stricken bird.
Witnesses to the latest attack, on Saturday, described three or four springer spaniels pinning the swan down as he tried to make his way down the beach.
He was taken to be treated by the RSPCA.
Thankfully, Mr Swan's wound is said to be superficial and the bird has been returned to his boating lake home.
Annie Mayes, who waited with the swan for help to arrive, said: "Everybody is gutted; they are so upset that this has happened again."
Some bird lovers have taken to Facebook to share their anger. One, Nick Joy, said: "This is a warning to people. It's time something was done before it's a person... a child!"
The owner of the dogs - which are not believed to be the same animals that killed Mrs Swan - is said to be "gutted" and offered to pay for Mr Swan's treatment.
Concerned locals are now calling for dog owners to keep their pets on leads at the lake and on the beach.
