[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Indian court is due to rule on whether Bollywood star Salman Khan is guilty of running over five men sleeping on a pavement, killing one.

The actor was charged with culpable homicide in Mumbai for the September 2002 incident. Mr Khan has always denied he was at the wheel.
If convicted, he faces 10 years in prison.
Mr Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars and has starred in more than 80 Hindi-language films.
Several of his films, including Dabangg, Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aap Ke Hain Kaun, have been huge commercial hits.
Late on the night of 28 September 2002, his Toyota Land Cruiser hit the American Express bakery in the Bandra area of Mumbai, authorities say.
The vehicle ran over five people sleeping on the street, killing 38-year-old Noor Ullah Khan and seriously injuring three others. Another person received minor injuries.
The prosecution has alleged that Mr Khan was driving the car and that he was drunk. In March the actor told the court he was not drunk and was not driving the car.
But many witnesses have said that was not the case.
A constable attached to Mr Khan's security said in a statement to the police that the "drunk" actor had lost control of the car. The policeman died in 2007 of tuberculosis.
In April, Mr Khan's driver told the court that he had crashed the car after a tyre burst.

It's not uncommon most days to find people camped outside the house of Salman Khan hoping for a glimpse of the star.
But on Wednesday morning dozens of journalists and fans gathered as they waited for the actor to leave on the way to court.
Even Mr Khan's father was ambushed as he went on a morning stroll along the seafront encircled by security guards - proof this is a case that has gripped Bollywood and wider India.
