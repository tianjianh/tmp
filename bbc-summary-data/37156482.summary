The victory over the visiting Ghanaian side sees the Algerians through to the last four on the head-to-head rule.
A goal shortly after the break from France-born Chadian international Morgan Betorangal proved to be the winner for Bejaia.
It was only the second goal the Algerian side have scored in the six matches of the group phase.
Bejaia will meet FUS Rabat in September's semi-finals after the Moroccan side drew 0-0 with defending champions Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia in their Group B match on Tuesday.
Rabat finished top of the table, one point ahead of Etoile, who also qualify for the last four where they will take on TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Mazembe clinched top spot in Group A with a 3-1 win in Lubumbashi over Tanzania's Young Africans.
Jonathan Bolingi opened the scoring for the hosts in the 28th minute, moments before Young Africans' Vincent Chikupe was shown a straight red card for a foul that prevented a goal scoring chance.
Mazembe made the extra man count after half-time with Zambia international Rainford Kalaba scoring two more goals before Burundi's Amissi Tambwe grabbed a consolation.
On Wednesday Kawkab Marrakech of Morocco played out a 2-2 draw with bottom-of-the-table Al Ahly Tripoli of Libya in the remaining fixture, which had no bearing on the final standings.
