Flint, 19, was released by City in October, and had since been playing for third-tier side Preston North End.
"I think it's the right move for me to come along to County and set myself some new challenges," she told the Women's Super League 1 club's website.
"I'm looking to score and to supply goals. If I can bring trophies to Notts County I'll be very happy."
