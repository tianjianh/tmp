A sculpture has been unveiled in memory of a popular cat which frequented a bus stop in Hampshire.

Well-wishers from as far as the United States and Australia donated Â£5,000 towards the sculpture on the Leigh Park housing estate in Havant.
Missy was a regular sight for almost 10 years at the number 39 stop in Dunsbury Way.
She was found in January with "horrific injuries" after being run over or attacked and was put down by a vet.
Flowers, photos, children's drawings and messages were left at the bus stop bench where the 13-year-old ginger cat would often be found asleep or sitting on someone's lap.
Bus driver Craig Cockram raised Â£5,000 for the memorial, which attracted online donations and messages from around the world.
One donor from the US wrote: "Remember the joy and happiness you brought to those waiting for the bus over the years."
Samantha Hadaway wrote: "Bless you dear Missy for making people smile every day and only asking in return for some kindness. Such a senseless awful waste of a precious little fur angel's life".
Kristi, from the USA, posted: "God has a special place for Missy. She touched so many lives. I wish I'd known her."
The memorial bench made from oak, with a sequoia cat sculpture curled up at one end, was placed on a grass verge directly opposite Missy's favourite shelter.
The Mayor of Havant, Faith Ponsonby, who unveiled it, said the appeal's success was partly a sign of loneliness on the Leigh Park housing estate.
She said: "Not a lot of people are allowed to have pets and I have concerns that we need to look out for elderly lonely people.
"For children, to stroke her was something they could look forward to every day."
