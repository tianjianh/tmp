Oxford's landlord licensing 'a complete failure'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme to crack down on rogue landlords in Oxford has been branded a "complete failure" as half the city's shared houses have not been registered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oxford City Council began licensing houses of multiple occupation (HMOs) in 2011 to raise the quality of housing.
It said the scheme had resulted in Â£3.5m being invested in housing stock.
The National Landlords Association (NLA) said the scheme was not properly enforced and it was driving up rents, forcing people out of the city.
NLA policy offer Gavin Dick said: "I think it's a complete failure by the council, both on the good landlords and for the tenants that are having to live in substandard housing.
"We want the criminals prosecuted and we want tenants living in good accommodation.
"It's having a massive impact on housing costs in Oxford, its driving rents up and driving people out. It's not thought through, its not financed property and people are still living in poor conditions."
The authority estimates about 21,000 people are living in 7,000 HMOs in Oxford.
Council leader Bob Price said: "We have a team of inspectors but we do have to take into account that we don't have a complete register. We rely on the public to tell us that next door to them has been taken over by a landlord and has become an HMO.
"What we do, also, is take particular streets and look through the register of electors, we look at the council tax register and that also gives us indications of problems we can look at."
Landlords who refuse to comply with the rules face a fine of up to Â£5,000.
The council said it had so far gained about 50 successful prosecutions.
The scheme has been revised and extended until 2021.
