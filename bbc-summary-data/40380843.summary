[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Zealand v British and Irish Lions (Sat)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scrum-half Conor Murray says Saturday's first Test against New Zealand is the biggest game of his career - this is surely the case for every British and Irish Lions player.

By common consent, the Lions have to win the tour opener to give them a chance of emulating the greats of 1971.
The improvement made by the tourists over the past few weeks has given the thousands of travelling supporters genuine hope.
But the All Blacks, who are the world champions, have not lost at Eden Park since 1994.
For the first time since 1930, the Lions tour captain has been left out of the starting XV, with Peter O'Mahony leading the side instead of Sam Warburton.
Meanwhile head coach Warren Gatland has rolled the dice in his back three, with Elliot Daly and Liam Williams - who both started against the Chiefs in midweek - making late darts into the Test team.
Despite a virtuoso individual performance against the Maori, English lock Maro Itoje has to make do with a place on the bench, with the experienced Welshman Alun Wyn Jones - the last man to captain the Lions in a Test - preferred alongside George Kruis.
Gatland's counterpart Steve Hansen has also sprung the odd surprise, dropping the prolific Julian Savea for the rookie Rieko Ioane on the wing. Ioane has already played twice against the Lions on this tour, scoring for the Blues.
Although Gatland insists his side will play "bold and courageous rugby", taking New Zealand on at their own game would be lunacy.
Instead the Lions are likely to use the template that so successfully suffocated the Crusaders and Maori: an imposing rush defence, an aggressive and slick set-piece, and an accurate kicking game.

By winning the territorial battle and the gainline, the Lions should create opportunities as a result, and this is where the likes of Williams, Daly and Watson can provide the ruthless edge that has been missing at times on this tour.
However the Lions play, keeping up intensity, discipline and accuracy for 80 minutes is a non-negotiable.
Lions head coach Warren Gatland: "Let's get excited about what could be a fantastic series. Let's let the rugby do the talking because there's been enough trash talking already."
New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen: "I'm cool, calm and excited. Worrying is a waste of emotion."
10: Number of Lions in the 23 who were involved in the series-clinching win over Australia in 2013.
23: Number of years since New Zealand lost to France at Eden Park, their last defeat at the venue.
358: Number of international caps on the Lions bench, compared to 216 on New Zealand's.
"Result is all that matters. There are no bonus points for beautiful rugby or style." - Wynne Gray in the New Zealand Herald.
