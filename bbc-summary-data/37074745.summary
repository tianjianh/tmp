The result means Britain, bronze medallists in 2012, progress from the group stage with a 100% record.
Michelle Vittese put the US ahead on 39 minutes, but GB scored twice in three fourth-quarter minutes through Sophie Bray and Alex Danson.
Danny Kerry's side will play Spain in the quarter-finals on Monday.
"If you'd offered us top spot at the start of the week I'd have bitten your hand off," said captain Kate Richardson-Walsh.
"The momentum we've created is good. All the sides are excellent in this tournament so I'm really proud of what we've done so far."
