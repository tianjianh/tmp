The world number one, 25, is seeking a first Masters title following victories at the US Open, the Open Championship and the US PGA.
And winning the famous Green Jacket on Sunday would propel him into exalted company - alongside Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Gene Sarazen, Gary Player and Ben Hogan - as the only men to complete the clean sweep.
Are the omens with him? BBC Sport crunches the stats to find out...
Since the first Masters in 1934, there have been 48 different winners of the Green Jacket.
But how does McIlroy compare to the previous first-time winners?
He may be six years younger than the average maiden victor, but he should still have enough Augusta experience judging by his number of previous appearances.
One would expect the experience of winning four other majors to aid the Northern Irishman's chances of claiming the Green Jacket. However, history shows us that previous major success is not necessarily vital at Augusta.
McIlroy has been in promising positions at previous Masters - particularly in 2011.
The Northern Irishman led by four shots going into the final day, but collapsed spectacularly - dropping six shots in three holes on the back nine.
And the following year, he started the third round one shot off the pace. However, he dropped six shots in a disastrous front nine to end his chances.
For four years UK golfers dominated at Augusta.
Scotland's Sandy Lyle started that run in 1988 after 'that shot' and he was followed by the back-to-back play-off victories of England's Nick Faldo. Then, Welshman Ian Woosnam claimed the 1991 Green Jacket with a five-foot putt on the final hole.
Faldo won a third title in 1996 but apart from that success, golfers from these shores have had a barren run.
Northern Ireland is yet to provide a winner but could that be about to change with McIlroy?
McIlroy, a right-hander, may be bidding for the fifth major of his career - but he still has a long way to go to catch the game's greatest. Jack Nicklaus is way ahead with 18 majors, followed by Tiger Woods (14).
Only Gene Sarazen (seven) won more majors before a first Masters than McIlroy. Like the current world number one, Ben Hogan had also won four before taking the Green Jacket.
