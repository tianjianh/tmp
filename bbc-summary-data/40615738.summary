Polish-born Dagmara Przybysz, 16, was found dead in a toilet at Pool Academy near Redruth on 17 May last year.
The cause of death was hanging, Cornwall Coroner's Court heard.
The inquest also heard a pastoral support manager at the school had made a social care referral over the home life of the teenager.
Susan Kent said that Dagmara had told her about an incident when her mother Ewelina Przybysz got "very angry" at her and her sister over a broken mobile phone.

Dagmara's parents Jedrzej and Ewelina Przybysz said she had told them a girl had banged into her and she had heard comments like "stupid Pole" in the year before her death.
However Mrs Przybysz said she thought the biggest problem for Polish-born Dagmara at school "was not racism but bullying".
Dagmara's boyfriend, Lewis Simpson, told the inquest in Truro she had mentioned pupils making comments about her being Polish.
She had told him she heard girls in the changing rooms at school saying "horrible" things about her taking PE too seriously after a lesson the day before her death, the court heard.
On the morning of her death Dagmara was upset but "did not want to disclose the reason", her father told the court.
Lewis told the inquest the night before her death she asked him: "What would you do if I killed myself?"
He said both he and Dagmara had got upset about false rumours that they were going to split up.
They had a Facebook call about it and she said she was so angry she "wanted to jump off a bridge", the inquest heard.
But by the end of the call she seemed calmer, he said.
Principal Zelma Hill said the teenager was a "beautiful, bright and creative 16-year-old student with a very promising future ahead of her".
The inquest continues.
