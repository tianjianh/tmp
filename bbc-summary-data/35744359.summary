Arla Foods plans to close its milk processing plant at Hatfield Peverel at the end of July, with much of the work moving to its Aylesbury site.
The company said a staff consultation was under way, and that some employees could be relocated.
Dan Kolding, from Arla Foods, said: "We are committed to supporting affected colleagues at this difficult time."
The company said the decision to recommend the closure of the Hatfield Peverel facility followed "an extensive review".
It said a recent Â£150m investment in its Aylesbury plant made it the "world's largest dairy operation".
