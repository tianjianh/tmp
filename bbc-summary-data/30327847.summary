Daniel Craig will return as 007 for a fourth time but it's rumoured it could be his last appearance in the role.
Due out in November 2015, the film will also feature Oscar winner Christoph Waltz, WWE wrestler David Bautista and Sherlock star Andrew Scott.
The film will be directed by Sam Mendes who also worked on Skyfall, which was released in 2012.
With the mystery over the name revealed - the big question now - who will record the theme song?
Smith, Sam Smith seems to be the name on top of everyone's list.
If chosen, the 22-year-old singer would join the likes of Adele, Madonna and Alicia Keys in recording the title track for a 007 film.
We've been asking some self confessed celebrity 007 fans who they think should sing the theme song.
Former X Factor judge Tulisa says if it was up to her, we'd all be dancing to the Bond theme tune in clubs.
She said: "I think we should up the ante and go for something really modern. Dance and deep house has become really popular.
"And they should go for a really big producer. Someone like Calvin Harris or Duke Dumont. I think that would be kind of epic."
The Saturdays say they would be up for taking on the job but if they don't get the call - Sam Smith should.
"I just think he's got that voice that's so unique so powerful," said band member Una. "That classic British voice."
Ella Eyre is another artist waving the Sam Smith banner.
"Adele absolutely smashed it last. Who could follow that?
"Probably Sam Smith is the obvious answer. He's a got a gorgeous voice."
