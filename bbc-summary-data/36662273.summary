The 22-year-old right-back made 12 appearances for the Bees last season, either side of a loan spell with League Two side Barnet.
"Josh finished last season really well and his role now is to carry that on," Brentford head coach Dean Smith said.
"He has to continue developing and to continue the work ethic that has seen him rewarded with a new contract."
Meanwhile, set piece coach Gianni Vio, who joined the backroom staff at Brentford last summer, has left Griffin Park.
