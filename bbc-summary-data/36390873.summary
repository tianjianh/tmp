[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eren Hasyer had denied attempting to aid the escape of Izzet Eren as he was being driven to Wood Green Crown Court in a custody van.
Accomplice Jermaine Baker was shot dead by police during the escape attempt in December 2015.
Jurors at Woolwich Crown Court cleared Hasyer, 25, of a firearms charge.
Izzet Eren was being held on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs accused of gun offences when he arranged for a gang to spring him from the van en-route to a hearing, Woolwich Crown Court was earlier told.
Jurors heard the prisoner hatched the escape plot from his cell using a smuggled mobile phone and the attempted breakout took place on 11 December, in what the prosecutor described as a carefully thought out and professional crime.
Ozcan Eren, 31, changed his plea and admitted his part in the plot after the trial opened.
Two other men, Nathan Mason and Gokay Sogucakli, admitted being part of the escape plot before the trial began.
A separate investigation into the death of Jermaine Baker is ongoing.
Det Ch Supt Tom Manson Met Police said: "This was a bold, well planned and carefully thought out conspiracy that bears all the hallmarks of a professional crime.
"They put in place anti-surveillance techniques; their own surveillance 'unit' and a command structure to run the operation."
