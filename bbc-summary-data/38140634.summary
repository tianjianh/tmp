Militants have attacked an army camp in Indian-administered Kashmir with grenades and gunfire, killing three soldiers, police sources told the BBC.

Indian troops have returned fire from the camp in Jammu's Nagrota area. The army did not confirm any casualties.
The camp is the local headquarters of a counter-terrorism unit.
In September, militants attacked a base in Uri and killed 18 soldiers. In response, the Indian army carried out "surgical strikes" in the region.
The army said it had destroyed "terrorist launching pads" used by militants with support from Pakistan, but the Pakistani military disputed this.
On Tuesday, officials told the BBC that heavy firing was taking place after "three to four" militants attacked the camp in Nagrota.
The morning strike came a month after a similar attack in Baramulla, where one border guard was killed and another wounded.
Tensions between India and Pakistan have risen since the attack in Uri.
Last week, officials in Pakistan said at least nine people were killed and 11 others injured when cross-border shelling from India hit a passenger bus in the disputed region.
India had earlier vowed to avenge the killing of three soldiers, one of whose bodies it said had been mutilated.
India accuses Pakistan of arming and training insurgents fighting for Kashmir's independence from India or its merger with Pakistan, a claim Pakistan denies.
Disputed Muslim-majority Kashmir has been a flashpoint for decades and has sparked two wars between India and Pakistan. Both control parts of the disputed territory but claim it in full.
