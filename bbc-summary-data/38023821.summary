[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Sir Elton John by his former bodyguard has been dropped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In legal papers filed in March, Jeffrey Wenninger accused the singer of making sexually suggestive comments towards him and groping him.
A representative for Sir Elton confirmed: "The case was withdrawn, with no payment made."
Mr Wenninger, a Los Angeles policeman, worked for the singer from 2002 to 2014.
He had accused Sir Elton of three separate incidents - all of which he claimed occurred in the final year he worked for the singer.
Sir Elton's legal team previously described his claims as "baseless".
