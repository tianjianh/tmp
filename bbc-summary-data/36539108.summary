Tranmere Rovers: Luke Pilling, Evan Gumbs and Mitch Duggan agree new deals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers have agreed new one-year contracts with teenagers Luke Pilling, Evan Gumbs and Mitch Duggan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Duggan, 19, who can play in defence or midfield, played more than 45 games for non-league sides Marine and Trafford during loan spells last season.
Goalkeeper Pilling, 18, made his Wales Under-19 debut last season, but is yet to feature in Tranmere's first team.
Gumbs, 19, was part of the Salford City team that won promotion to National League North.
"They progressed a lot last season and deserve this chance," Tranmere boss Gary Brabin told the club website.
"They're still young but they're enthusiastic and willing to learn and hopefully they can continue to develop as footballers and help this club."
