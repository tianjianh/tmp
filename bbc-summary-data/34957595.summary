Western Heights Preservation Society say the burglary at the Drop Redoubt fort in Dover cost it a year's income - about Â£2,500.
Equipment stolen included a generator, toolboxes, water boilers used in the cafe and a PA system.
The burglary was discovered on Thursday after a photograph was posted online.
The picture showed one of the main Victorian access doors wide open despite the 19th Century fort being closed for the winter.
"The volunteers who work here are devastated," said spokeswoman Mandy Whall.
"They have put a lot of time and effort into assisting and keeping the site running and having wiped out a year's worth of money from the donations and various events we have put on. It is heartbreaking."
Kent Police said it was believed an entrance to the fort was forced at some point between 1 and 26 November.
