Last year an accounting scandal led to the resignation of Toshiba's chief executive Hisao Tanaka.
Back then Toshiba admitted to overstating its profits by 151.8bn yen ($1.22bn, £780m) over six years.
Mr Tsunakawa was not involved in the scandal and is credited with increasing earnings at the healthcare unit.
The company also named a new chairman, Shigenori Shiga who is currently serving as senior executive vice president.
The appointments need the approval of shareholders at a meeting in late June.
Last year, Toshiba was found to have overstated its operating profit by a total of 151.8bn yen (£780m) over the course of six years.
The revelation led to a record £40m fine for the company from regulators.
When the scandal hit, chairman Masashi Muromachi temporarily took over as chief executive.
Mr Muromachi will now become a special adviser.
Toshiba has also reported it expects to make a £4.1bn annual loss for 2015. The company also said it will cut 14,000 jobs as part of a restructuring programme.
Part of that programme saw the recent sale of Toshiba's healthcare unit to Canon for £4bn.
Last month, Toshiba also took a ($2.3bn) £1.6bn writedown on its US nuclear unit Westinghouse in a move to address any lingering doubts over its accounting practices.
Toshiba, which was founded in 1875 and launched the world's first mass-market laptop in 1985, currently employs almost 200,000 people.
