JK Rowling has announced that she'll be waving a wand over December and releasing 12 short stories from the wizarding world.
The news came via email to fans of the Pottermore website, all in the 12 days leading up to Christmas eve.
The email promises "wonderful writing by JK Rowling in Moments from Half-Blood Prince, shiny gold Galleons and even a new potion or two".
Obviously speculation is now rife as to whom each story will focus on.
There have been rumours that at least one of the stories will focus on Harry's nemesis, Draco Malfoy.
The stories shall be released everyday from 12 December.
It's not the first new story from Rowling since the end of the Harry Potter series. She wrote 5,000 words for Pottermore about Potter character, Dolores Umbridge at Halloween, earlier this year.
