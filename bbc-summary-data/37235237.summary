[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farm worker who drove at speeds of up to 140mph to get away from police has been banned from driving for a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charles James Evans had six passengers in his BMW - three without seatbelts.
Evans admitted dangerous driving and was sentenced to six months at Mold Crown Court on Wednesday, suspended for a year.
He was also ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work and retake his driving test.
A police officer saw Evans' BMW Coupe drive at excessive speed towards the roundabout of the A483 near Welshpool cattle market, Powys, on 11 June and decided to follow it.
Judge Niclas Parry said Evans, 22, of Shropshire, reached "alarmingly high speeds" estimated at between 120mph and 140mph.
He drove on the wrong side of the road, and across a junction.
Simon Medland QC, defending, said that his client was a "hard working and highly thought of" agricultural contractor whose loss of driving licence would affect him greatly.
