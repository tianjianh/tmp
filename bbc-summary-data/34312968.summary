[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Indies fast bowler Shannon Gabriel was in destructive mood as relegated Worcestershire bowled out Middlesex for just 98 on the opening day at New Road.

After a rain-delayed start, Gabriel took 5-31 to dent Middlesex's hopes of securing second place in Division One.
Only four batsmen reached double figures, and six made ducks, with John Simpson's 27 not out the top score.
Worcestershire replied by reaching 79-1 at the close, with Brett D'Oliveira 38 not out and Tom Fell on 37.
After their relegation back to Division Two was confirmed by defeat against Durham last week, the home side soon gave notice that they would not go down meekly when play finally got under way at 13:40 BST.
Joe Leach had Paul Stirling caught at point in the third over, then Sam Robson became Gabriel's first victim when he edged into the slips before the paceman bowled Dawid Malan for a duck with his next delivery.
After Jack Shantry removed both Neil Dexter and Middlesex skipper James Franklin for ducks in a spell of 2-5, the visitors were finally all out at the start of the 35th over.
Middlesex began 12 points clear of third-placed Nottinghamshire, as they look to achieve their best Championship finish since 1995.
