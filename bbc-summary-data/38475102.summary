[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They took the lead in the 22nd minute when a poor clearance fell to Gus Mafuta and he teed up Nyal Bell, who turned before finding the bottom corner for his second goal in two games.
Mafutu almost doubled the advantage in the 70th minute but his 22-yard drive was kept out by a stunning fingertip save from Solihull goalkeeper Daniel Lewis, while Luke Hannant also hit the post for the visitors.
Moors pushed for a late equaliser but Gateshead sealed the win in injury time as Sam Jones snatched a second with a backheel.
