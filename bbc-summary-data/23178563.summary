Una Crown murder: Suspect released without charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man arrested on suspicion of murdering an 86-year-old Cambridgeshire woman has been released without charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Una Crown's body was found stabbed and burned in Wisbech on 13 January.
A 58-year-old man was arrested later that month and bailed pending further enquiries, but police said he will now receive no further action.
A man who subsequently burgled Mrs Crown's boarded up bungalow after her murder was jailed last week at Cambridge Crown Court.
A post-mortem examination concluded Mrs Crown, who lived on Magazine Lane, had been stabbed repeatedly, including through the heart and lungs.
Her body had then been set alight in what police believe was an attempt to cover up the murder.
She had not been seen alive since 11 January, but had spoken to a friend by telephone at about 17:00 GMT.
Three men were seen near her home late on the Saturday night. Her body was discovered the next day.
The charity Crimestoppers has offered a ??10,000 reward for information which leads to the conviction of her killer.
