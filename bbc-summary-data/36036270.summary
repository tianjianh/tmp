[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two businessmen who plotted to kidnap a former stockbroker in West Lothian in a bid to force him to pay a debt have each been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Green, 43, from Kirkliston, and Alan D'Ambrosio, 51, from Edinburgh, were convicted of assault, robbery, abduction and attempted extortion at a farm at Philpstoun on 25 April 2014.
The 55-year-old victim was beaten up, trussed, hooded and forced into a van.
He told the High Court in Edinburgh he thought he was going to die.
The victim was targeted in an attempted extortion after he had negotiated to buy a company from former bank manager Green, but the money had not yet been paid.
A judge told the pair at the High Court in Edinburgh: "The use of violence in business dealings has to be suppressed by appropriate punishment being meted out to those who engage in it."
Lord Uist told them it was a "deplorable" incident of criminality and lawlessness.
He said neither had shown shame or remorse and continued to deny their guilt in the face of compelling evidence.
Green ran venture capital firm Pentland Capital and held an interest in Glencairn Risk Solutions - which was co-owned by D'Ambrosio. Both men had denied assaulting, abducting and attempting to extort money from the victim on 25 April 2014 at West Philpstoun Steadings, Philpstoun.
However, the pair were convicted of committing the crime while acting with others unknown by a jury last month and remanded in custody ahead of sentencing.
During the attack the victim was repeatedly hit on the head with a weapon and had bleach poured on him. He was robbed of a wallet, phone and car keys and threatened with violence if money was not paid to Green within seven days.
The attack victim estimated he was hit 30 to 40 times.
Defence counsel Keith Stewart, for Green, said a series of testimonials produced on his behalf were "remarkable" and reflected his conduct in business, family life, his faith and the help he had given others including through charity work in Africa.
Matt Jackson, defence counsel for D'Ambrosio, said he had previously been "a very successful businessman" who had enjoyed "significant success at times".
