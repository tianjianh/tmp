It is Prince William first official visit to the city where his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car crash in 1997.

Do you have what it takes to work for the Duchess?
The couple have travelled without their children, three-year-old George and one-year-old Charlotte.
Kensington Palace said the trip was at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: "Royal visits play a very important role in the United Kingdom's bilateral diplomacy.
"Whilst every royal visit is unique, each visit is designed to support foreign policy objectives and promote closer ties across a range of areas, for example cultural, economic or political, between the UK and the host country."
