England v Argentina: Autumn Tests intense like World Cup - Marler

England's autumn international schedule mirrors the intensity of a Rugby World Cup, according to prop Joe Marler.

Eddie Jones' side play four Test matches in as many weeks, with Argentina and Australia still to come.
"The autumn is pretty intense and is probably little bit harder mentally to stay focused," Marler told BBC 5 live.
"Eddie mentioned it's very similar to a World Cup [in terms of] the intensity you have to go through in order to get through your pool."
Ahead of Saturday's match with the Pumas, Marler says the England squad have spoken this week about the challenge of staying mentally refreshed after being in camp together for over a month.
"We have discussed how this could be a tough week for boys who are missing home a bit," the Harlequins forward added.
"It's a collective buy-in from boys to help each other out. We haven't got a specific senior leadership group, but there are boys who have been around long enough.
"The Six Nations brings a lot of history and tradition but you get those two fallow weeks in the middle of it that breaks it up a little bit more - you get more of a change of environment and maybe a couple more days to get home and see the family.
"It is tough, but it's part and parcel of rugby life, and you get on with it."
However, Marler insists that the facilities at England's training base in Surrey means the players have no excuses around their preparation.
"We haven't exactly got it hard, the accommodation and facilities we have here are incredible," the 26-year-old said.
"They are here for a reason, and that's for us to improve as players and as a team. We have the best facilities; there is no excuse."
Marler also says he has learnt from his past experiences, and is now able to act as a mentor to the younger members of the England squad, such as his Harlequins club team-mate Kyle Sinckler, who recently made his international debut.
"Kyle Sinckler has been brilliant for the past 18 months and has finally got his shot, but there have been times with Kyle when I've had to sit down with him and say 'what are you doing?'" Marler said.
"He'll listen and nod, but part of me also thinks is he saying 'what are you going on about Joe, you have done this and that before, you were bad once?'
"I was once, but I like to think I am working on that now.
"So it's little things like that, just to help each other out. It's all about that experience."
