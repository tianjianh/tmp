Wales' win over Argentina has restored some pride, coach Rob Howley said.

The hosts had to hold on at the end to register a 24-20 victory after Martin Landajo went over, with the boot of Leigh Halfpenny easing home nerves.
Victory came seven days after a 32-8 mauling by Australia.
"We are generally pleased because we'd had some criticism," said Howley. "I thought they answered that criticism in their performance and how proud they are to wear the Welsh jersey."
He added: "I'm pleased for the whole squad, who worked so hard off the back of the last game."
Wales dominated the first half at Principality Stadium, but led only 6-3 at the break thanks to Halfpenny's kicking against their tenacious opponents.
"I thought we deserved the win," added Howley.
Howley praises 'world class' lock Jones
"The players were a little frustrated at half-time. We had a lot of pressure in their 22 and they were quite smart.
"At half-time we weren't rewarded for that dominance and that's disappointing and I said to the players it's important we learn from those aspects.
"It is important that when you get opportunities you take them."
Wales captain Gethin Jenkins became the fourth most capped international of all time.
But most attention was given to his uncharacteristic kick out of hand that led to scrum-half Gareth Davies scoring a try.
He credited former Wales, Cardiff Blues, Pontypridd and British and Irish Lions team-mate Martyn Williams with the inspiration for that moment.
"I learned that from Martyn. I think one kick a game is my limit," said Jenkins.
"It's a great feeling. When it comes to the things we have been working on, I think we put a lot more of that into practice this week.
"But we also know we have got a long way to go, looking at the last few games.
"We played some good stuff. We sort of let them back into the game with that one try.
"But they are a quality team. It was backs against the wall time and it is nice to come away with a win."
Centre Jonathan Davies says Wales must be more clinical in their remaining autumn series games against Japan and South Africa.
"We can be a bit more clinical at times but we are creating chances which is a good thing," the 28-year-old told BBC Radio Wales.
"We have things to look back on and improve but there were a lot of positives from that game.
"We created a few chances and took two and it would have been nice to have converted a few more chances but it's something to work on.
"We're a very talented bunch, we know that, and sometimes it's frustrating for us but we've got to keep working and keep pushing."
