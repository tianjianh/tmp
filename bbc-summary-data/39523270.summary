[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 0-0 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyle Vassell missed a penalty as Blackpool wasted the chance to move into the League Two play-off places following a goalless draw against Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Vassell saw his tame second-half spot-kick saved by Stanley goalkeeper Marek Rodak after Seamus Conneely caught Jack Payne with a high boot in the area.
Other results going their way keeps the Seasiders within two points of the top seven, while Accrington extend their unbeaten run to 14 games and retain a slim chance of making the play-offs.
Blackpool should have been ahead after 37 minutes. A rapid counter-attack set Colin Daniel free down the left, and he squared for the unmarked Bright Osayi-Samuel who inexplicably shot wide from four yards.
Blackpool's Neil Danns went down just inside the area early in the second half but the referee waved away the appeals, before Tom Aldred was forced to block on the line to deny Matty Pearson at the other end.
Gary Bowyer's side, who had lost their previous two, had their big chance after 75 minutes when Vassell fired straight at Rodak from the penalty spot.
With the last action of the game, Kelvin Mellor struck a post with a flicked header from eight yards as Accrington clung on for the draw.
