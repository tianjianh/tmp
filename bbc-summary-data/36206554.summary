Prof Roger Scully of Cardiff University said, if the results were applied in an uniform way across Wales, Labour would win 27 seats, Plaid Cymru 12, the Conservative 11, UKIP 8 and the Lib Dems two.

The poll for ITV and Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre had a sample of 1,326 Welsh adults and was carried out by YouGov from 2-4 May 2016.
