One-Day Cup: Rain puts Warwickshire out of competition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire failed to qualify for the One-Day Cup last eight after their match against Kent was washed out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
However Kent went through to the quarter-finals after the Lancashire against Glamorgan match at Old Trafford was also abandoned.
Heavy rain throughout the afternoon at Edgbaston saw the umpires call the game off at 19:40 BST, almost six hours after the scheduled start time.
Kent will now play Surrey at The Oval in the next round.
The game takes place on Thursday, 27 August at 14:00 BST.
