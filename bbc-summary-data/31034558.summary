Left-armer Amir, 22, was jailed for six months and banned from all cricket for his part in a spot-fixing scam during Pakistan's tour of England in 2010.
He delivered pre-arranged no balls at Lord's in a plot that also saw Mohammad Asif and captain Salman Butt banned.
Amir's ban was due to expire on 2 September, 2015 but he has been cleared to play domestic cricket in Pakistan.
"It's a new life for me and you will see not only Mohammad Amir as a better cricketer but also a better human being," he said.
The International Cricket Council (ICC), the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the head of the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (Acsu), approved Amir's domestic return.
An ICC statement read: "Sir Ronnie Flanagan, with the prior approval of the ICC board and the Pakistan Cricket Board, has exercised his discretion to allow Mohammad Amir to return to domestic cricket played under the auspices of the Pakistan Cricket Board with immediate effect."
It added that Flanagan "was satisfied" that Amir had:
Before his suspension Amir took 51 wickets in 14 Test matches at an average of 29.09, and 25 wickets in 15 one-day internationals at an average of 24.
In the aftermath of the spot-fixing scandal, Amir, who was 18 at the time of the incident, separated himself from his co-conspirators by admitting his guilt and showing remorse.
Fellow paceman Asif and skipper Butt repeatedly fought charges before being found guilty at Southwark Crown Court.
The latter pair were also jailed, with Asif banned from cricket for seven years (two suspended) and Butt 10 years (five suspended).
