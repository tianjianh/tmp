Streatley crossroads shut as lorry gets wedged in road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry has hit a house and become wedged in a narrow village road as the driver attempted to take a sharp turn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A passerby said they could "not believe their eyes" as the lorry attempted the bend into the tiny road near the crossroads on the High Street of Streatley, Berkshire.
Tim Schulz, who lives in the annexe of the house, said he heard a "crunch" as the lorry hit the building.
The crossroads next to the 15th Century Bull coaching inn has been shut.
Fire crews on the scene said the lorry had damaged the chimney stack on the house which has been hit.

Schulz said crews were trying to make the house safe in case the chimney stack collapses further.
He added: "It's pretty insane actually. I don't know how he ever thought he could get round the corner."
Mr Schulz also said the historic coaching inn had "a wedge taken out of it", though he was not sure if the pub or the lorry had "come off worse".
The lorry has now been removed by fire crews, but the A329 Streatley crossroads and B4009 Streatley Hill remain closed while the chimney stack is made safe.
