The hedgehog, which was attacked in April outside Arena Leisure Centre in Camberley, Surrey, was taken in by Harper Asprey Wildlife Rescue charity.
Animal welfare champion May, who has homes in London and Surrey, is a long-term supporter of the rescue centre.
He owns the land where Percy has been rehomed after being nursed to health.
The animal, thought to be about three years old, was put in a bag and swung round in the attack, and had a concrete block dropped on it.
Police called to the incident took Percy to Harper Asprey.
An operation saved his life but shattered shards of bone had to be removed along with part of a hip joint.
"Fortunately Percy came to us within an hour of the attack and we were able to treat him and prevent him going further into shock," said a spokesman for the charity.
"When Percy arrived he was still tightly balled and in shock, but as he relaxed we could see lesions and areas of swelling all over his body.
"The swelling continued in front of our eyes. This is one of the most horrific wildlife incidents we have seen in a long time.
"Percy will be unable to return to the wild as he is unable to curl properly and this would prevent him finding food and make him vulnerable to predators."
The brain damage has left Percy slightly slower than normal but he will be kept in a protected environment.
The attacker was prosecuted by the RSPCA and given a nine-week suspended jail sentence with a 12-month supervision order.
