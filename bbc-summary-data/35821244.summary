Storm-hit Oxgangs Primary School: Wall collapse uncovers whole building problem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation into a school wall which collapsed during stormy weather earlier this year has indicated a problem around the whole building.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hundreds of bricks were blown from Oxgangs Primary school during Storm Gertude in January.
Now a safety inspection has revealed there were issues with how the external wall was erected when the school was built about 10 years ago.
The school was closed on Wednesday until Monday 11 April.
The Easter holidays begin on Friday 25 March.
Andy Gray, Edinburgh city council's head of schools, lifelong learning communities and families, said: "Edinburgh Schools Partnership has now carried out a detailed investigation of the external wall cavity around the whole building and this indicated an issue regarding variations in cavity width.
"This raised a further issue with the associated embedment of the wall ties and remedial works will be carried out to address this."
The school was shut immediately after the incident which happened on 29 January but reopened a few days later following a safety inspection.
Edinburgh City Council said the decision to close the school again was taken after a further building survey was carried out earlier this week.
Parents have been told to take their children to Oxgangs Primary Astroturf area on Thursday. The 500 primary and nursery pupils will then be taken to temporary classrooms in nearby schools by bus.
Packed lunches will be given to pupils on Thursday and Friday, with lunches also provided free of charge next week.
Parents were informed of the closure by an email from the council's education department on Tuesday.
