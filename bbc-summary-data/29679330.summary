[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 0-2 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter beat Morecambe to move to within a point of League Two's play-off spots.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City went ahead when Shrimps defender Shaun Beeley tried to chest Christian Ribeiro's cross back to his goalkeeper but could only divert it into the net.
Morecambe keeper Scott Davies then brilliantly saved Matt Grimes' free-kick and David Wheeler's header to prevent them falling further behind.
But Tom Nicholls' composed finish eventually wrapped up the win late on as Exeter deservedly moved up to 10th.
The margin of victory might have been greater but for Davies, who also produced fine stops to deny Nicholls and Jimmy Keohane after half-time.
The Grecians are now just one point behind Morecambe, who remain in seventh having not won at home since 13 September.
