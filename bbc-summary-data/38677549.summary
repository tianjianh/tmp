Daphne the deer was found at Waters' Edge Country Park in Barton on Wednesday, and later put to sleep.
She was so badly injured she could not be saved, staff at the 110-acre park said.
A Â£200 reward has been issued for information leading to a successful prosecution.

The park is home to numerous deer, but Daphne, who was about three-years-old, chose to stay close to the visitor centre after people started feeding her.
A spokesman for North Lincolnshire Council, which owns the site, said she would be "greatly missed".
"Daphne the deer was a friendly face for many visitors to Waters' Edge", he added.
Staff believe she was attacked by a dog and are warning visitors that although dogs are welcome, they must be on either a lead or in close control at all times.
Anyone with information about the attack is asked to contact staff at the visitor centre.
