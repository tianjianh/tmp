The 42-year-old was found with "significant" injuries in Greenend Avenue at about 10:45 on Saturday.
Police believe he was killed after a disturbance when someone came to his door in the early hours.
They have appealed for anyone with information or who saw anything suspicious to come forward.
Det Ch Insp Raymond Brown said: "We know that there was a disturbance at Mr Quail's home in Greenend Avenue, Johnstone around 0050 hours on Saturday 25 February 2017 and extensive inquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances.
"Greenend Avenue is in a busy residential area and it may well be that local residents or those in the area may have seen people acting suspiciously.
"I believe that the answer to this murder inquiry lies in the local community and I am in no doubt that there are people out there with vital information regarding this incident, who have not yet spoken to police."
He added: "A man has lost his life and it is critical to this investigation that anyone who has information, no matter how insignificant it may appear to them, contact the inquiry team who are based at Helen Street Police Office through 101."
