[SN]TITLE[SN]
Red Bull Salzburg 1-0 Rapid Vienna

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Red Bull Salzburg sealed their fourth consecutive Austrian Bundesliga title, meaning Uefa will need to make a decision in June on whether RB Leipzig can enter the Champions League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uefa rules prohibit clubs with strong links from being in European competition in the same season.
If Uefa rules that only one can enter, Salzburg will be given the place as the higher-finishing team in their league.
Leipzig can, at best, finish second in their first German Bundesliga season.
They sealed their top-four spot in April.
RB Leipzig are also run by Red Bull, but German football rules prohibit a club from having a sponsor in their name.
Leipzig, who lost 5-4 to Bayern Munich on Saturday, have previously said they are confident of being allowed into Europe as the clubs have ensured there are enough differences between them.
Salzburg, who have lost in the Champions League qualifiers in each of the past five seasons, clinched the title with a 1-0 win against Rapid Vienna on Saturday.
Football's European governing body repeated their position this week: "All criteria, including matters of ownership, will be verified for each club by Uefa only once we have received the competition entry forms and documentation from the national football associations and clubs, following the end of the season in the respective leagues [in June]."
Uefa Article 5 - Integrity of the competition
5.01 To ensure the integrity of the Uefa club competitions, the following criteria apply:
a. no club participating in a Uefa club competition may, either directly or indirectly:

ii. be a member of any other club participating in a Uefa club competition,
iii. be involved in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of any other club participating in a Uefa club competition, or
iv. have any power whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of any other club participating in a Uefa club competition;
b. no-one may simultaneously be involved, either directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a Uefa club competition;
c. no individual or legal entity may have control or influence over more than one club participating in a Uefa club competition, such control or influence being defined in this context as:
i. holding a majority of the shareholders' voting rights;
ii. having the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the club;
iii. being a shareholder and alone controlling a majority of the shareholders' voting rights pursuant to an agreement entered into with other shareholders of the club; or
