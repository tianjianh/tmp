He sent these texts to his husband Jack, in the UK, as the gunman entered the club.
Jack says: "I'm in UK at the moment - but I live in Florida, and I would normally have gone to Pulse nightclub with my husband if it wasn't for my sister's 30th birthday.
"At 02:00 local time I got a text from Ivory.
"He said, 'They are shooting everybody.'
"We spoke on the phone whilst he hid behind a palm tree.
"I heard gunshots for five to 10 minutes.
"I am still in shock.
"Six of his friends died.
"I knew them too.
"I could have been killed if I had been there."
"Ivory's best friend, also a survivor, was in the bathroom as the gunman approached.
"He had to break the toilet to hide behind it.
"At 02:45 local time Ivory got out and he was home at 03:30.
"He didn't sleep at all on Sunday.
"Ivory's mother is with him now."
