[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 0-3 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Midfielder Anthony Wordsworth scored a brace as Southend secured a convincing win over MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Cox opened the scoring for the visitors after only two minutes as he turned and slotted home from close range after the Dons failed to clear their lines from a corner.
And just as the Dons looked to be taking control of the game, Southend doubled their lead in the 25th minute when Wordsworth fired a low strike into the bottom right-hand corner.
Dean Bowditch should have pulled one back late in the first half after finding himself one on one with Mark Oxley, but his tame effort was wide of the mark.
Wordsworth rounded off the victory for Southend - ending a run of five away games without a win - by curling home a free-kick late on.
