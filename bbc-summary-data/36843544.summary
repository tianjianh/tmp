Ashley Yates, 45, used a spy pen to record images of pupils and staff at The Tynings Primary School in Staple Hill, South Gloucestershire.
On Tuesday, at Bristol Crown Court, he admitted charges of making indecent images of children and voyeurism.
In a letter to parents the school said "additional adult victims have been identified" which the police confirmed.
On Tuesday the court heard Yates, of Filton, who is married with children, and had been in post as head at the school for eight years, filmed six girls, one boy and two members of staff.
It also heard Yates had handed over passwords to computers that would assist with the continuing police investigation.
A police spokesman said: "Enquiries are ongoing and we will not be commenting until sentencing."
But the letter to parents on the school's website says: "Police have confirmed that additional adult victims have been identified.
"These victims came to light after items were seized by police during the course of the investigation.
"The additional victims are all adult victims who have been contacted.
"They have also been offered support from police and the local authority.
"If any further victims are identified during the course of the investigation they will be notified immediately."
The school said it was working closely with the police and South Gloucestershire Council and would be disclosing as much information as possible without prejudicing the continuing legal proceedings.
In a letter to families, the acting head also thanked parents for their "patience and co-operation during this difficult time".
Yates has been remanded in custody until his next court hearing at Bristol Crown Court on 9 August.
