Ballinamallard v Institute play-off second leg called off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tuesday's promotion/relegation play-off second leg between Ballinamallard United and Institute has been postponed by the NI Football League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision was taken on Monday after relegated Warrenpoint Town raised a number of eligibility issues with league officials.
NIFL said it was calling off the match at Ferney Park as a precaution, and was seeking guidance from the Irish FA.
Premiership side Ballinamallard won the first leg at Institute 2-1.
Warrenpoint have asked the league to rule on whether Carrick Rangers manager Gary Haveron properly served a three-match touchline ban.
It has been claimed Haveron should not have been in the dugout for Carrick's win over Dungannon Swifts on 23 April - and that he actually sat out a game when he was not banned.
Irish FA rules state that the sanction for a player or manager failing to serve a ban is a minimum Â£350 fine  and the forfeiting of the match on a 3-0 score.
If Carrick lost three points, they would be automatically relegated as the bottom club, and Warrenpoint would go into the play-off instead of Ballinamallard who would be safe.
