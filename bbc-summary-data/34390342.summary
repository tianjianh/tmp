Norfolk Police budget cuts 'a game-changer'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Policing in Norfolk has reached a "critical point" and requires radical change to accommodate looming budget cuts, the chief constable has warned.

Simon Bailey, who is reviewing how the force will work with a reduced budget and workforce, said the cuts are a "game-changer" for policing.
It has a £10m shortfall to the £22.5m in savings required by March 2020, a a figure which is expected to increase.
Mr Bailey said job cuts were inevitable.
"We are undertaking a fundamental review of how local policing services are delivered," he said.
"Our demands have changed, for example the greatest demand every day is reports of domestic abuse, with 50 calls a day, and 30 for concerns for safety.
"So, 80 calls are non-traditional crime related so we need to think about how we tackle this."
Reports of crime excluding fraud were up 16% in 2014-15.
He added: "I don't like seeing fewer officers on the street, but we are going to be working with a significantly reduced budget which means things have got to change."
He said it would be looking at its work with other counties and emergency services as a way to save money, with joint working with Suffolk Police saving the forces £24.3m.
Mr Bailey said: "The next round of public sector budget reductions will be a game-changer for policing in Norfolk.
"No longer can we simply adapt or adjust our existing model - the change required to meet this challenge must be radical."
The Norfolk 2020 review will begin with an internal consultation, and initial recommendations will be made to chief officers in December.
