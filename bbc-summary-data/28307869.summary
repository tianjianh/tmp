Organisers of the Henley Royal Regatta say they hope the event will be televised in the future.

Chairman Mike Sweeney said the rowing event would be broadcast "in some form or other".
However, broadcaster John Inverdale said committee members should consider changing the dates of the event from early July, so that it does not clash with the coverage of Wimbledon.
He said: "I'm afraid Henley is always going to come off second best."
Mr Inverdale said if organisers "bit the bullet" and moved the regatta back a week then more people would watch it.
He said: "It's an established and fantastic landmark in the sport calendar every year... It deserves a higher profile than it gets.
"Henley is more than the rowing, just like Ascot is more than the horses."
Mr Sweeney, who is retiring, said: "We have been looking at televising for the last ten or 20 years. It eventually will happen in some form or other.
"Things are moving in the right direction, it will happen, but we only do things slowly and carefully."
