The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service were called to a house at Cathedral View, Downpatrick, just before 18:00 BST on Friday.
It's understood the man who died was in his 50s and was married. He had one daughter.
SDLP MP Margaret Ritchie said she learned about the death "with a deep sense of sadness".
"My thoughts and prayers are with the man who lost his life; his family, relatives and friends," she said.
"My deepest sympathies to the bereaved in their sad loss. The people of Downpatrick will stand shoulder to shoulder with the family of this man who lost his life in the days, weeks and months to come."
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Chris Hazzard said: "Not only has a family lost a father and a husband, but Cathedral View has lost a popular and friendly neighbour.
"I have every confidence that the community will rally around the McCabe family as they come to terms with this loss in the weeks and months ahead."
