Isak is Sweden's youngest ever goalscorer, having netted on his full debut against Slovakia on 12 January this year aged 17 years and 113 days, breaking a 105-year record.
He made his AIK debut in February 2016 and has scored 13 goals in 29 games.
Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc said Isak was wanted by a "number of top European clubs".
The transfer, reported to be worth 10m euros (Â£8.6m), needs approval by world governing body Fifa as Isak is under 18.
USA attacking midfielder Christian Pulisic, 18, who had been linked with Liverpool, has extended his contract at Dortmund until 2020.
