The event takes place at Drumlanrig Castle at Thornhill at the end of August.
Tickets for the festival go on sale from noon on Friday.
Last month organisers announced that the major festival in Dumfries and Galloway, the Wickerman, would not take place this year.
Meanwhile, 250 acts over 11 stages have been lined up for this year's Eden Music Festival - also staged in southern Scotland.
They include Skye and Ross from 1990s trip-hop band Morcheeba; soul singer Andreya Triana; and Coronation Street actor and BBC 6 Music presenter Craig Charles.
The event takes place over three days in June, at Raehills, near Moffat.
