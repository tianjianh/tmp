General election 2017: Captivated by the campaign?

Brilliant or boring? Inspired or insipid?

How would you describe the election campaign so far?
This game of political musical chairs should all be getting quite feisty by now, so are you excited or exhausted by yet another election?
We took to Belfast's Continental Market at lunchtime on Friday to find out your views on the polling news.
It was back to business as usual for the parties on Friday as they resumed full campaigning after three low-key days in the wake of the Manchester attack.
And the big two parties wasted no time in taking a pop at each other, as has been their wont for the past six months or more.
DUP leader Arlene Foster accused her Sinn FÃ©in counterpart Michelle O'Neill of "hypocrisy" over her condemnation of Monday's bombing, in which 22 people were killed.
"You have to reflect on the fact that she, only a few weeks ago, was in Loughgall commemorating those who were going out to murder and to kill," said Mrs Foster.
"I think that's where the hypocrisy lies in all of this."
But Sinn FÃ©in's Martina Anderson said that was an "absolutely outrageous statement", as she defended her party's Stormont leader.
The MEP asked: "Are you trying to suggest that we, as a party who have been involved in peace-building for many, many years, should not condemn such an attack?
"We should."
It's all work and no play out there for political journalists, apparently, as they follow the parties around on the campaign.
But wait, what's this? BBC News NI's political correspondent Gareth Gordon seems to be dodging the work while down in Newcastle in County Down this week.
Well, not really - he was filming his profile of South Down, where two parties are vying in a race to the summit, which you can read about here.
And you can see Gareth's full report from the majestic Mourne mountains constituency on BBC Newsline here.
We'll leave you with something to get your mind whirring over the weekend.
