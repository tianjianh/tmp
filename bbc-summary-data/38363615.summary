Scotland's economy secretary has held "productive" talks with Amazon after claims of unacceptable working conditions at its Fife depot.

Keith Brown said the firm agreed to "consider" his request to pay a "living wage" of Â£8.45 an hour.
He said they would have another meeting in two or three months' time.
The minister had previously said he was concerned by reports that staff at the Dunfermline site could be sacked for being off sick.
The Sunday Times claimed that workers could be dismissed for taking four days off, even if they had a sick note from a doctor.
The issue was raised in the Scottish Parliament, with North East Fife MSP Willie Rennie saying he had been contacted by constituents who reported "intolerable" working conditions.
Speaking after his visit to the Dunfermline "fulfilment centre" on Monday, Mr Brown said: "I had a productive meeting with senior members of Amazon's management team this afternoon and I asked them a series of questions around personnel and transport related-issues, which had been the subject of recent media reports.
"I then made a series of requests of the senior management team including in relation to becoming involved in our Fair Work agenda through the fair work convention, paying the real living wage and trade union activity in the workplace
"They have agreed to consider these requests and to a further meeting in the course of the next two to three months.
"These jobs are important to Scotland's economy - 4,500 at its current peak and 1,800 permanent employees - and so it's crucial that we continue to work with Amazon to help deliver fair work practices."
Amazon said all permanent and temporary Amazon workers started on Â£7.35 an hour or above, regardless of age, and Â£11 an hour and above for overtime.
A company spokeswoman said: "Amazon provides a safe and positive workplace with competitive pay and benefits from day one. We are proud to have been able to create several thousand new permanent roles in our UK fulfilment centres over the last five years.
"One of the reasons we've been able to attract so many people to join us is that we offer great jobs and a positive work environment with opportunities for growth."
