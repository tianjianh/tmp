Estyn says there needs to be greater support for 'at risk' groups who are targeted because of their sexuality, ethnicity, religion or disability.
The rise in cyber bullying is a particular problem for schools because it is anonymous and pupils can be too embarrassed to report it.
Education inspectors have also drawn up an anti-bullying checklist for schools.
The report  found how different schools deal with bullying varies widely - and even between different staff at the same school.
The rise in cyber bullying was a concern for most secondary schools, with Estyn finding it difficult for staff and pupils and staff to deal with.
It was often unreported because pupils feel too ashamed to talk about it.
Often by the time teachers become aware of cyber bullying, it has been taking place for some time.
The report includes a checklist of anti-bullying practices which it recommends schools should have in place.
These include:
Estyn chief inspector Ann Keane said: "Schools should be places where all pupils feel safe and able to learn. Bullying not only affects a child emotionally and psychologically, but can result in poor attendance and underachievement."
While exact figures are not known, studies estimate between one-fifth and a half of all pupils suffered bullying at some point.

Pupils in secondary schools are less confident than younger children that the school would be able to do anything about it.
But some schools are praised for good initiatives aimed at preventing bullying.
They included Hafod Primary School, Swansea, for its panel of pupils able to call suspected bullies to account and  Eveswell Primary School in Newport for eradicating homophobic language.
Crickhowell High School, Powys, was praised for creating a more tolerant atmosphere by teaching pupils about diversity and equality through the curriculum.
