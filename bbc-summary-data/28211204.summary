Speaking to Annie Mac ahead of her Live Lounge session on Radio 1 she said: "People are expecting a dance record and I'm like, 'Don't expect [that from me]'."
The 24-year-old is best known for singing on Clean Bandit's number one single Rather Be.
Weeks later Route 94 released My Love, which Glynne also sang on and which also hit the top spot.
"It's weird 'cos it's quite cool 'cos I've had those hits with Route 94 and Clean Bandit.
"But at the same time I can still build my own artist on my own 'cos people don't know what I look like, which is quite exciting."
During the session on Radio 1 she performed her debut single Right Here.
"Right Here for me is the perfect connector of where I've come with the other two tracks and where I'm going," she said.
She also says people shouldn't assume it will be a dance record.
"You know when you don't expect, then you hear an album and then you're pleasantly surprised," she added.
She also did a soulful cover version of Katy Perry's Birthday.
Speaking about performing live, she said: "I'm not a gigger, I've done gigs, but I couldn't say I've done a load of gigs, because I haven't.
"I just did Wireless and Glastonbury. Both very overwhelming gigs that I've done. It's going really well. [I'm] loving it, I love life."
"I've grafted a lot, writing and working for a lot of different people. Trying to find the Jess sound has been my thing over the last four years."
