Bradford City 1-0 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford City will take a narrow lead into the second leg of their League One play-off semi-final against Fleetwood thanks to Rory McArdle's header.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The defender powered home a Tony McMahon corner with 13 minutes to go to give the home side a vital goal.
Bradford went closest to scoring in the first half when Billy Clarke's low half-volley hit the foot of the post.
Uwe Rosler's Fleetwood side will need to improve in Sunday's return leg if they are to reach Wembley.
McArdle's header gave Stuart McCall's men, who went the whole regular season unbeaten at home, a win they richly deserved in a game they dominated throughout.
Bradford were able to make 10 changes to the team who had drawn 1-1 at Rochdale on Sunday and their added freshness certainly contributed to the win.
Bantams forward Charlie Wyke miscued from 10 yards after a sliced clearance dropped to him, Nicky Law tested visiting keeper Alex Cairns with a long-range effort and Clarke hit the post in a first half where the hosts had 72% possession.
In contrast the visitors struggled to create anything but were nearly gifted the lead when home keeper Colin Doyle mis-kicked to David Ball who chipped the ball over Doyle and the crossbar from 20 yards out.
Home midfielder Josh Cullen drew a fine save from Cairns with a 25-yard free-kick after the interval before home skipper Romain Vincelot hammered a clear chance over from 12 yards.
Just when home fans were starting to voice their growing frustrations McArdle thumped a header past Cairns to give Bradford what could prove to be a vital advantage.
