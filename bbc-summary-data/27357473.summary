A World War One memorial not seen for 50 years has been re-erected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The marble tablet commemorating Gateshead men who died in the war was discovered in a council depot in 2006.
It had been moved from Park Terrace Presbyterian Church which was pulled down in 1964 for the now demolished St Cuthbert's Village development.
Soldiers from 103 Field Squadron of 72 (Tyne Electrical Engineers) Engineer Regiment have installed it in the graveyard at St Mary's Heritage Centre.
One of the 27 soldiers commemorated on the stone, Pte George Wood, is listed as a member of the Royal Engineers.
Staff Sgt Paul Nash said: "Once you're Royal Engineer you're always Royal Engineer. It's a family. That's how we like to think of it - he's one of our own, look after him."
The raised garden housing the memorial has been constructed using timbers which once supported the road deck on the High Level Bridge, thought to date back to the 1850s.
The work was partly funded with a Â£9,600 Heritage Lottery Fund grant.
