Merseyside Police said they had received reports that a person had been seen with a firearm in Beech Rise, Kirkby, at about 05:20 BST.
A 17-year-old boy was also arrested on suspicion of burglary offences and possessing a firearm.
Officers also held a man, 38, from Litherland on suspicion of conspiracy to import and supply controlled drugs after 15kg of cannabis resin was found.
A 24-year-old man from Kirkby was also arrested on suspicion of possessing cannabis.
The arrests were part of a police operation targeted at organised crime groups after about 80 shootings in Merseyside since April - 39 of which have led to people being injured.
Five men have also died following various gun attacks including 18-year-old Yusuf Sonko in Toxeth on 2 June.
Detectives are also appealing for witnesses following a shooting in Croxteth at about 14:30 BST on Friday near the junction of Armill Road and Sovereign Road. No one was injured.
Det Insp Nick Suffield said: "If someone has been brazen enough to fire a shotgun in the middle of the afternoon on a residential street we need to find them urgently."
