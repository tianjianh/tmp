Daniel Bentley: New Brentford keeper ready for possible battle with David Button

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Daniel Bentley is determined to establish himself as Brentford's number one goalkeeper following his move from Southend United.

Last season's first-choice keeper David Button has been offered a new deal at Griffin Park but is yet to sign.
Jack Bonham is now the Championship club's third-choice keeper.
"I've come to play and be in the team. I've come to play at a higher level, not to sit on the bench at a higher level," Bentley, 22, told BBC London.
"David Button has proved himself at this level and I've got a lot of respect for what he's achieved. Jack Bonham is a similar age to me and has been here a while as well.
"I've seen at first hand what they're like in training and they're both very solid. But ultimately there is only one shirt and it's up for grabs."
Brentford were close to the relegation zone before ending last season strongly and finishing ninth in the table.
They reached the play-offs the previous year and Bentley believes they can challenge for promotion to the Premier League again next term.
"That's the aim, the drive and ambition of this club. None of us should be here if that wasn't the aim," he said.
"I'm not comfortable sitting and staying at this level. Why not try to get to the next level?
"Why not try to achieve as much as we can and fulfil the potential these boys have?"
