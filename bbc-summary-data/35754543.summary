Hibs football fans who verbally abused a disabled man on a train in Glasgow are being sought by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 51-year-old man boarded a Helensburgh-bound train at Carntyne station at about 12:30 on 27 February.
He asked the group of supporters, believed to be travelling to watch their team play Dumbarton in an SPFL match, if he could sit on a seat designated for disabled passengers.
After initially refusing they allowed him to sit down.
However, as he left the train at Glasgow Queen Street, the group verbally abused the man, who walks with the aid of two sticks, making references to his disability.
PC John Paul O'Kane, of the British Transport Police, urged witnesses to come forward.
He said: "Hate crime in any form is totally unacceptable and there really is nothing that excuses such behaviour from the group of Hibs supporters."
