Rosena Allin-Khan, who works at St George's Hospital, was selected at the party's candidate on Saturday.
The by-election will be held on 16 June.
Mr Khan triggered the election earlier this week when he formally stepped down as MP, after 11 years, to focus on his duties as London mayor.
Writing on her website, Ms Allin-Khan describes herself as a "passionate local, a community activist and health advocate".
She adds: "As someone who was born and bred in Tooting, it would be an honour to be your next MP and serve the community I call home.
The mother-of-two is also a Wandsworth Labour councillor.
Mr Khan was first elected to represent Tooting for Labour in the 2005 general election.
Winning 1,310,143 votes in the London mayoral election, he received the largest personal mandate of any politician in UK history.
