Japan's stock market was in recovery mode on Friday after closing down below 3% for the second time in a week.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 1.69% to 15,695.33 in mid-morning trade, as a slightly weaker yen gave a boost to exporters' shares.
On Thursday, the yen soared after the Bank of Japan announced it would not add to its current stimulus programme.
Worried investors have also been drawn to the safe-haven yen in the lead up to the UK's upcoming EU referendum.
There has been global concern around the vote and impact it could have on global markets.
The possibility of a Brexit was one of the factors that led the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates on hold earlier this week.
Japanese officials from the ministry of finance and the central bank, among others, are set to meet later to discuss worries around the equity and currency markets.
"Stability in currencies is extremely important," said Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso on Friday. "We'll closely coordinate with other countries on this issue," he added.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 index was up 0.21% to 5,157. The index would need to close at 5,312 to avoid a third straight week of losses.
Chris Weston of IG Markets in Melbourne said, however, that the index was unlikely to end the week on a positive note.
"It's hard to see traders buying with any conviction given next week's event risk, but we could see some brave souls who see a 'remain' vote in the UK referendum tempted by adding selective risk to portfolios," he said.
In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.88% to 20,212.33, while the Shanghai Composite was up 0.86% to 2,897.57.
Stocks in South Korea were also in positive territory, up 0.52% to 1,961.4.
