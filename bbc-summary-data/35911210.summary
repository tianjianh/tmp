The alert was raised at about 13:10 BST after the man's kayak capsized on the River Wey at Guildford and he went into the water near a weir.
A police helicopter, firefighters and ambulance crews are all at the scene.
Ch Insp Dave Mason, of Surrey Police, said he had been seen in difficulty because of the strong current.
"We have a large number of officers out looking for this man alongside a number of fire crews," he said.
"The man was spotted in the water by several members of the public and was clearly in difficulty due to the extremely strong current.
"We are doing everything we can to try and find him."
He urged anyone who sees the man not to go into the river, but to call 999 immediately.
The man went into the water near Guildford Borough Council's offices.
A flood alert is in place for the Upper River Wey, including the Guildford stretch.
The Environment Agency said river levels rose on Sunday and were expected to continue to rise on Monday.
An update on River Wey conditions from the National Trust on Monday said all river sections were in flood and dangerous to navigation.
