Officers were called to the Wheatley area of Doncaster on Saturday when players called 999 after seeing what they thought was a theft taking place.
A police statement said: "I never thought I would write this headline but â€ª#â€ŽPokemonGo has helped fight crime."
The force said two men had been arrested on suspicion of burglary in relation to the incident.
Pokemon Go players search real-life locations for digital creatures.
The force said that following the emergency call officers arrived at the scene to find people "leaving the yard carrying their stolen goods".
"They were stealing decking, clearly wanting to enjoy the summer sunshine in luxury," the spokesperson said.
Pokemon Go, which has become a global phenomenon, was launched in the UK on Thursday.
A smartphone update of the Nintendo Game Boy classic, it encourages players to catch monsters via a combination of GPS and augmented reality.
Its popularity has prompted a series of safety warnings and reports of players finding themselves in dangerous situations.
