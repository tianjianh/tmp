The owner of the Thomson and First Choice brands said it was seeing greater demand for Spanish and long-haul destinations.
Last month, Tui reported a 40% slump in summer holiday bookings to Turkey amid the strife in neighbouring Syria.
In its latest trading statement, the firm said demand for Turkish destinations remained "subdued".
"We remain pleased with our summer 2016 trading performance, with 95% of our source market programme sold and increased revenue in all our major source markets," the statement said.
"The UK continues to demonstrate a strong bookings performance, up 9% on prior year."
Tui Group said it had sold 47% of its summer holidays for this year, broadly in line with expectations. Overall, bookings were up 2% and revenues were 3% higher.
