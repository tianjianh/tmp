The 30-year-old agreed to move to the Premiership club from French side Racing 92 in March.
He previously played for Northampton Saints between 2008 and 2010.
"My recruitment drive will, as always, be based on people who have ambition and want to wear the shirt," said director of rugby Steve Diamond.
The Sale boss confirmed that they will now be looking to add another second-row as well as a new winger.
