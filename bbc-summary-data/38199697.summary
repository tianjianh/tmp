The Queens tournament, which began last year, returned to the Miyoshi Country Club in Nagoya and the Koreans won the first seven matches of the final against the hosts, with Kotone Hori sparing Japan a whitewash by halving the final game with Lee Seung-hyun.
In the third-place play-off, Matthew defeated Rachel Hetherington two up to make it three wins out of three over the weekend, while Parker beat Sarah Kemp 5&4 and Hall saw off Katherine Kirk 2&1.
Sarah Jane Smith, Cathryn Bristow and Whitney Hillier won points for Australia, with Hillier beating Wales' Becky Morgan on the 18th hole.
"It's one of the best events I've ever been to - the whole team have performed admirably," said first-time captain Johnson.
"You've got a mixture of young players and players that have never played before.
"They've all been an absolute pleasure to spend a week with."
