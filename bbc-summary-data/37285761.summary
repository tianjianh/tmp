A painting commemorating Margo MacDonald's 40-year contribution to politics has been unveiled at the Scottish Parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms MacDonald, who died aged 70 in 2014, served as an MP and MSP and was deputy leader of the SNP between 1974 and 1979.
Her husband, Jim Sillars, has donated the painting by Scottish artist Gerard M Burns to Holyrood.
The portrait shows Ms MacDonald inside the parliament's debating chamber.
It has gone on display in the members' room of the parliament.
Speaking at the unveiling, Ms Sillars said his wife had "left a legacy of ideas which have inspired a generation".
Ms MacDonald, who was a key figure within the Scottish independence movement, had Parkinson's Disease and campaigned for assisted suicide to be legalised ahead of her death.
She had been an SNP MP and MSP until being formally expelled by the party in 2003 following her announcement that she intended to stand as an independent candidate in that year's Scottish Parliament election, in which she was subsequently elected to represent the Lothians region.
Mr Burns has previously painted portraits of well-known Scots including Nicola Sturgeon, Billy Connolly and Ewan McGregor.
But he had never before painted a subject after their death.
