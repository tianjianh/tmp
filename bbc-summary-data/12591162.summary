BBC News Online looks at the timeline of events which led to the sentencing of Colin Howell and his former lover, Hazel Stewart for the murders of their respective wife and husband.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At 1047 GMT the judge sends the jury of nine men and three women out at Coleraine Crown Court to consider the verdict.
It takes them just over two hours to find her guilty.
Her former lover Colin Howell pleaded guilty to the murders in November 2010. He was sentenced to 21 years for the murders of Trevor Buchanan, 32, and his wife, Lesley Howell, 31.
On the 14th day of the trial it is Hazel Stewart's Birthday, she is 48.
The judge begins his summing up in the case.
Judge Anthony Hart acknowledged there had been a lot of public attention on the case and the jury had to put that aside and make their decision based on the evidence.
Mr Hart told the jury the key question was: "Were they in it together?"
Stewart jury sent out Wednesday
Prosecution and defence lawyers give their closing arguments in the trial.
Mrs Stewart's defence lawyer tells the court she could not have been in a joint enterprise with Howell who regarded her as "weak, vulnerable and easy to control".
The lawyer also says financial issues had motivated Colin Howell to murder his wife Lesley and Stewart's husband Trevor Buchanan in May 1991.
Earlier in the day a prosecution lawyer claimed Stewart agreed to a plan to carry out the two murders so she and Howell could continue their relationship.
He says she helped execute a plan to sacrifice the life of her husband and kill her then lover's wife with carbon monoxide fumes.
On the 12th day of her trial, Hazel Stewart's defence lawyer tells Coleraine Crown Court that she will not give evidence at her trial.
Earlier in the trial, police interview tapes were played in which Mrs Stewart admits she was aware of a plan to kill her husband but insisted she wanted no part in it.
The court is played more tapes of a police interview with Hazel Stewart.
In them she cries bitterly and says: "The biggest mistake of my life was ever meeting Colin Howell and I have paid the price,"
"I would like to say sorry to Trevor's family. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose a son.
"I have a son and I love him very much. To David, my husband I love so much. Lisa and Andrew. They are my life and I have lost it."
In another tape played to the court Stewart admits she was part of a plan to kill her husband but insisted she wanted no part in it.
The court hears Stewart tell police how she got rid of evidence.
They also hear how she encouraged her husband to take a sleeping tablet on the night of the murders.
Through police interview tapes the court hears Stewart describe how Howell often gave her laughing gas.
She says she "went crazy" when she feared her former lover gave her too much laughing gas before they had sex on his dentist's chair.
"I knew what he was trying to do and I freaked out," she says.
The jury listen to the first of 15 taped interviews Hazel Stewart gave to investigating officers in 2009.
In them she says she wished she was dead when they questioned her about the murders.
At one stage, her daughter Lisa, who is sat in the public gallery beside her brother Andrew, wipes her eyes with a handkerchief.
On his final day of giving evidence for the prosecution in the trial of his former mistress, Howell denies he was a monster and says Hazel had gone along with the plan.
Howell, tells the court: "It could not have happened without her co-operation, she didn't say no, there was no objection to me being there."
Money was the only reason Colin Howell murdered his wife Lesley, a lawyer for his former partner claims on the third day of her double murder trial.
The barrister says that the dentist gained Â£414,000 from his wife's will, life insurance, an endowment payment and cash from her late father's estate.
Paul Ramsey QC, defending Hazel Stewart, put it to Howell, that all his financial problems had been solved with the death of his wife.
But the dentist denies the suggestion, claiming he received only Â£212,000 as a result of his wife's death.
On the same day Howell admits flicking his wife with live cable a month before her death.
A friend of Lesley Howell, tells the court Mrs Howell had told her of the incident before her death.

Howell begins giving four days of evidence at the trial of his former lover, Hazel Stewart.
He says Mrs Stewart was not convinced they could get away with making Trevor Buchanan and Lesley Howell's deaths look like suicide.
"I remember the word crazy being used by her," he said.
"That was nature of the objection Hazel gave to me."
Howell says her concern is over being caught, not about the concept
It was the first time some of the details of Howell's role in the murder emerged as Howell pled guilty ahead of his trial.
The prosecution lawyer says the double murder plot was a joint plan.
He says she played an active role in a joint plan to kill for "selfish ends", as he outlined the prosecution case against Mrs Stewart.
"Hazel Stewart knowingly entered into this agreement and assisted Colin Howell in ensuring he could safely kill her husband and afterwards they both covered up the whole thing," he said.
The prosecution tell the jury about a series of interviews given by Mrs Stewart when she was arrested in January 2009, they say she changed her account of events three times.
The jury is sworn in for the trial of Hazel Stewart at Coleraine Crown Court.
