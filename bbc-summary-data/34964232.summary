Alice Burch from the New Forest started on 1 October and passed the finish line in Southampton on Sunday.
The mother-of-one is raising money for a charity which provides veterinary care to working animals in Africa and the Middle East.
She said at the end: "It was really hard because it was so windy. It's been good though, I've enjoyed it."
"I am quite stubborn, I said I was going to do it so I did it."
She posted on Facebook after the event: "It's been an epic journey, one I've had the pleasure of sharing with both old and new faces.
Ms Burch has raised Â£3,800 out of a target of Â£60,000 for the charity SPANA.
She started after a close friend, who championed the charity, passed away last year.
During the course of her challenge she took part in the Bournemouth Marathon, but many have been run at the athletics track at the Outdoor Sports Centre in Southampton.
