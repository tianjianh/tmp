The Dutch-Romanian pairing won 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 6-4 in one hour and 52 minutes.
Murray had hoped to claim a first men's doubles Slam title having won the mixed doubles with Jelena Jankovic in 2007.
The 29-year-old was watched by younger brother Andy on Centre Court, 24 hours after his singles semi-final defeat.
"I didn't know he was coming till I heard him shouting," said Jamie Murray.
"He was shouting all the time, encouragement. It was cool.  It was nice to see him out there supporting."
The brothers must now regroup after Wimbledon disappointment as they are both part of the Great Britain squad which will take on France in next week's Davis Cup quarter-final at Queen's Club.
"It's an exciting match to look forward to," he said. "It's a big tie for us. There's going to be a lot of people coming out to support. Motivation is high for the match."
Murray and Peers had three chances to break serve in the first five games of the doubles final but could not convert, and Rojer and Tecau took advantage.
Rojer hammered away a smash to convert their third set point in the tie-break, and when Peers netted a volley to drop serve early in the second, the lead was convincing.
A Peers double fault invited huge pressure at 4-4 in the third and Rojer proved more solid than Murray at the net to earn the decisive break.
The fourth seeds served out the match to love and fell to their knees in celebration, with Tecau finally getting his hands on the trophy after three times finishing runner-up.
"It was a good tournament for us," added Murray, who had never previously been past the quarter-finals of the men's doubles in a Slam.
"We got to the final of Wimbledon, which is not so easy to do.  I mean, my best result in a Grand Slam by quite some distance, I guess.
"It's sad to lose but I guess overall it was a positive tournament."
