[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon left a message on behalf of the Scottish people expressing sympathy and solidarity with those affected by the tragedy.
A total of 89 people died at the venue when gunmen mounted a series of attacks on 13 November, killing 130 people.
Ms Sturgeon is in Paris to attend the UN climate change summit.
The first minister was accompanied by the British ambassador.
The message she left reads: "I would like to express, on behalf of the people of Scotland, my deepest sympathy and sincere feeling of solidarity towards the victims of this tragedy and towards their families."
Speaking afterwards, the first minister told BBC Radio Scotland that the array of flowers around the Bataclan was "deeply, deeply moving".
She said: "It's impossible for us to imagine the horror that unfolded in there that night but the way that the city of Paris has come together has been very impressive indeed.
"So, I was glad on behalf of Scotland to lay some flowers and pay my respects this morning."
