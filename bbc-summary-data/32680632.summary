About 2,500 teenagers aged between 14 and 19 hiked distances of up 55 miles (89km), visiting 10 nominated tors.
The first team to cross the finish line was from the Combined Cadet Force at Churcher's College in Hampshire.
The teams left Okehampton Camp at 07:00 BST on Saturday and must complete the challenge before 17:00 BST.
The challenge is organised by the Army and assisted by the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the Dartmoor Rescue Group.
A spokesman from the group said about 150 members had assisted and there had been a "handful" of sprained ankles and minor injuries, but nothing major.
Organisers said Radzi Chinyanganya and Lindsey Russell from Children's TV programme Blue Peter also took part, with the third presenter, Barney Harwood, also present at the event.
