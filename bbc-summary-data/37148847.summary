A group of football-mad artists have a challenging goal for the Premier League season - to paint or draw every time their team hits the net.

Six artists aim to raise funds for two charities, including one founded by ex-Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson.
The Gift Of A Goal project was initiated by animator and Tottenham Hotspur fan Richard Swarbrick.
He is one of the founders of Wundergol, a social network of artists who combine their love of football and art.
"I was inspired by the Panini Cheapskates, who created their own World Cup album in 2014 to raise money for charity," said Mr Swarbrick.
In addition to Mr Swarbrick, other artists taking part are Manchester City supporter Lesley Ross, Arsenal fan Mathew Vieira and Preston North End fan Hanna May Jones, who will draw Manchester United goals. New York-based Van Hong will focus on Liverpool goals
They have also been joined by Chelsea follower Matt Pascoe.
The idea of recreating every goal scored by their teams was inspired by Ms Ross, who drew all of the 100-plus goals Manchester City scored in the 2013-14 campaign.
He said: "I don't actually do anything while the game is on as I am a fan first - I then look at the videos and try to pick a particular moment."
People can either donate to a special page or buy copies of the prints.
Some of the images are going to be given to young people helped by the Willow Foundation, the charity set up by former BBC Presenter and Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson for seriously ill adults aged 16 to 40.
The second charity set to benefit is The Robin Cancer Trust, which aims to raise awareness of germ cell cancers.
