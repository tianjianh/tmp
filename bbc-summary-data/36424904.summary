The next sculpture trail to take to the streets of Norwich will be made up of hares, a charity has announced.

The decorated fibre glass creatures follow in the footsteps of elephants, gorillas and most recently dragons last summer.
The hares are to be unveiled in 2018, the 50th year of Norfolk charity Break, which helps vulnerable children.
Each sculpture is sponsored, decorated by an artist, group or school and auctioned once the trail ends.
The Go Go Trail figures - made up of three different designs - are due to be revealed later.
More on this and other Norfolk stories
As in previous years, the plain fibre glass figures are each given their own design, theme or character.
Alanrilla, a tribute to Norwich DJ Alan Partridge, and a Freddie Mercury-inspired Radio Go Go graced the streets of Norwich during the Go Go Gorilla trail in 2013.
Norfolk artist Kieron Williamson, then aged 12 and nicknamed Mini-Monet, created one of the most striking dragons for last year's trail.
It sold for £20,000 at an auction which netted a total of £369,500 for the charity.
Break said that the hare was chosen because it is popular with artists and is a regular sight in the East Anglian countryside.
Fifty sculptures will make up the main trail in Norwich, with further hares being dotted around Norfolk for the first time, between June and September 2018.
