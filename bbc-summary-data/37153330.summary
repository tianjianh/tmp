The former husband and father of a woman allegedly murdered in a so-called honour killing in Pakistan have been remanded in custody pending the outcome of a police report.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died last month in northern Punjab.
Her former husband Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel, who is accused of murder, has confessed to strangling her with a scarf, local police have told the BBC.
He and her father Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid were remanded until 5 September.
Mr Shahid is being held as an accessory to murder.
The brief hearing in Jhelum, Pakistan, was the men's third court appearance in connection with the death of Samia Shahid.
Police in Pakistan previously told the BBC Mr Shakeel, who is also Ms Shahid's cousin, has confessed to her murder.
Ms Shahid had been visiting family in the village of Pandori when she died and her relatives had initially claimed she died of a heart attack.
Her second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazim, believes she was the victim of a so-called honour killing as her family did not approve of their marriage.
A post-mortem examination has since confirmed she died as a result of being strangled, police have said.
