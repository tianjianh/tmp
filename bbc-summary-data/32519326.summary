West Mercia PCSO sacked for 'personal relationship'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) has been dismissed for gross misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Mercia said an allegation had been made towards the officer, based in Shropshire, relating to a "personal relationship".
The force refused to confirm the PCSO's name or gender, but said they had served for six years.
A hearing found the PCSO's behaviour had fallen "below the standards expected".
The decision is subject to the normal appeals process.
