Donaldson spent the first 14 years of his life in the Middle East before moving to London.
He got his first job as an announcer with the forces radio station, BFBS, before joining Radio 2 in 1970.
He soon switched to Radio 4, becoming the station's chief announcer in 1983.  His last broadcast was in 2012.
Prior to his BBC career, Donaldson worked with both the Royal Shakespeare Company and the New Shakespeare Company at the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park London.
He once said: "Understanding the material in front of you makes you a good newsreader."
Ten years ago, secret files released by the National Archive revealed that Donaldson was part of the government's plans should there be a nuclear attack on the UK.
He was chosen to read bulletins on the Wartime Broadcasting Service, a radio station which would have replaced all others should an attack happen.
In 2005, Donaldson re-recorded words which had previously been covered by the Official Secrets Act.
The bulletin, which would have been played on the hour, began: "This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked by nuclear weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known.
"Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes."
