The plan would involve building a new conference centre on the Black Rock site next to the Marina.
The space vacated by the Brighton Centre on the seafront could then be used to expand nearby Churchill Square shopping centre.
The council said the plans were at a "very early stage".
The authority's policy and resources committee will consider the plans on Tuesday.
