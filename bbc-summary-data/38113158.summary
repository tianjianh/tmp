Charlton Athletic 0-0 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Karl Robinson's first match in charge of Charlton Athletic proved to be an anti-climax as they were held to a goalless draw by his former club MK Dons in the FA Cup second round.

The Dons, who Robinson left in October, had won only two of their previous 11 matches in all competitions but raised their game against their former manager and could have won at The Valley.
Richie Barker, Robinson's former assistant, was in caretaker charge of the MK team for the last time after the appointment of former Hearts boss Robbie Neilson as manager on Friday, but he left on a high as his team out-thought and outran their hosts.
Dean Bowditch, with a header over the crossbar, and right-back George Baldock, with a shot saved by Dillon Phillips after Bowditch's dummy, were unable to capitalise in the first half.
Charlton improved after the break, but Josh Magennis' effort was saved by David Martin and Ademola Lookman twice shot wide.
Bowditch, who had earlier had an angled shot well saved by Phillips, could have won it in injury time but his close-range shot was blocked on the line.
