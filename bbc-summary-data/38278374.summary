Colin Shields slammed the puck home early in the first period to put the Giants ahead.
Michael Forney doubled the lead four minutes into the third period when he scored a fine unassisted goal.
Sheffield pulled a goal back through John Armstrong with just over a minute left but the Gianst held on to win.
The hosts started the contest brightly, with player-coach Derrick Walser almost scoring with barely a minute on the clock, but his shot flew just wide of the post.
Belfast then capitalised on a high-sticking penalty called against Jesse Schultz of the Steelers, exploiting the extra man advantage as Shields netted.
The Steelers then failed to make two powerplays of their own count and the Giants ended the first period with their lead preserved.
It stayed 1-0 in a frenetic second period, mainly thanks to Belfast's Jackson Whistle, who was the busier of the two netminders as the Steelers stepped up a gear.
But the reigning champions had nothing to show for their efforts by the second intermission.
Forney finished with aplomb past Mustukovs in the Steelers goal early in the third period to make it 2-0 while Armstrong struck late to deny Whistle a clean sheet.
The Giants are back in league action Sunday with an away game against Manchester Storm.
