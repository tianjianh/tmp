The QPR striker scored on his home debut to boost his hopes of making the squad for the Euro 2016 finals.
"Conor has strength, power and composure - he looks like he is going to be an asset for us," said O'Neill.
"It's a great achievement to go unbeaten in 10 games and now we just want to build on it."
Washington struck his first goal for Northern Ireland before the break, while Roy Carroll kept out Milivoje Novakovic's penalty in the second half.
"Scoring the goal was crazy but overall the boys played well and we deserved the win," said a delighted Washington.
"To set the new 10-game unbeaten record is brilliant and hopefully we can take this form into the next few games and into the tournament in France.
"I'm pleased to get another start and a goal, and I just have to work hard and see where it takes me."
Carroll was another Northern Ireland hero, with his fine penalty save ensuring the feel-good factor continues going into friendlies against Belarus on 27 May and Slovakia on 4 June.
"I had watched their penalties over the last couple of days so I guessed which way it was going," said Carroll.
"I've had some bad nights out there but with that save and clean sheet I really enjoyed it."
