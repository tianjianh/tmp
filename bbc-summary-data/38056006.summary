Manus Deery: MoD admits boy's killing was unjustified

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Army's killing of an innocent 15-year-old boy in 1972 was unjustified and breached military rules, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has admitted.

The family of Manus Deery, who was shot dead yards from his Londonderry home, welcomed the admission after 44 years.
The Deerys led a long campaign to uncover the truth and clear his name.
Their barrister said the violent death of a child who was wrongly labelled a terrorist was among the worst experiences a family could endure.
The teenager was eating chips with friends when he was hit by bullet fired by a soldier positioned high above him on the city walls.
At a hearing in Belfast's Royal Courts of Justice on Monday, a barrister for the MoD and Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said his clients accepted the boy had not been carrying a weapon and was not posing any threat to soldiers.
"He was behaving lawfully. He was innocent of any wrongdoing at the time of his death," the barrister told the court.
"We accept that there was a breach of the Yellow Card and that the decision (to shoot) was premature and cannot be justified," he added.
"The MoD accept that Manus was unarmed and did not pose a threat. That is undisputed."
The teenager's sister, Helen Deery, who campaigned to clear his name, said she was "delighted".
Speaking outside court, she said: "They have just said what we have been saying for 44 years."
"Manus would have been 60 on Thursday and it was very important for me, especially this week, that on his 60th I can turn around now and say clearly that he was innocent and the soldier was in breach of the Yellow Card; he acted out of law."
The killing, which took place at the height of the Troubles, is one of a number of controversial security force cases being re-examined by the coroner.
At a fresh inquest last month, the name of the soldier who killed Manus Deery was officially disclosed for the first time.
Private William Glasgow was never convicted and has since died.
The soldier had maintained that he fired at what appeared to be a gunman about 200 metres away, missed, and the stray bullet killed the boy.
On Monday, the Deerys' barrister told the court: "No evidence of the existence of a gunman has emerged in 44 years. We say that's significant in this tight-knit community."
The Mod's barrister urged the coroner to take into account Private Glasgow's age and inexperience and the fact that 1972 was the worst year of the Troubles.
However, the family's barrister said: "There is no doubt that 1972 was a terrible year. It was the worst year in terms of deaths and injuries in terms of the Troubles. It is right to acknowledge that the soldiers were in danger.
"They were in danger from explosives and gunfire and they were in danger on Derry's city walls. That's right, but it is not this case."
She added: "Innocent civilians like Manus Deery were also in danger from soldiers who were armed with powerful weapons and could fire with virtual impunity."
After taking final submissions from legal representatives, the coroner said he planned to deliver a verdict in Derry "as soon as possible".
