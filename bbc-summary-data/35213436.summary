Coal mining is "unlikely" to have caused a pavement to collapse, exposing a four metre-deep hole on a residential street, a report has said.

Emergency services were called to Coronation Terrace, Nantyffyllon, Bridgend county, at about 07:50 GMT on Thursday.
The Coal Authority has now carried out an initial assessment of the collapse.
A statement said investigations "indicated that the collapse is unlikely to be coal mining related".
Following the collapse, a fire service spokeswoman said a man was assessed, but he was not hurt.
The Coal Authority said the hole measured three metres by 3.2 metres (9ft by 10.4ft) and was four metres (13ft) deep.
A statement published on its website added: "The collapse goes up to the edge of a residential building and extends slightly underneath the road.
"Our initial site and desktop investigations have indicated that the collapse is unlikely to be coal mining related.
"However, we are continuing to work closely with the council while they carry out further physical investigation works.
"If these investigations reveal that the cause was due to unrecorded historical coal mine workings we will undertake repair works as required."
