Joyce, 30, had a considerable size advantage over his 27-year-old opponent, and shook Morais with the first punch he landed.
Morais was cut over the left eye within a minute, took a standing count after two, and failed to beat the count when he hit the canvas shortly afterwards.
Joyce will next fight on Tuesday.
