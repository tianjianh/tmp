The 29-year-old man was detained after being confronted by self-styled "paedophile hunters", at Bluewater Shopping Centre on Sunday.
A live stream of the interception by The Hunted One was shown on Facebook before a fight broke out at the scene.
Kent Police said it "strongly" discouraged people from taking the law into their own hands.
Det Ch Insp Emma Banks, from the force, said: "The arrested man is in custody. Police are also investigating a disturbance which took place in connection with this incident.
"I strongly discourage people taking the law into their own hands to avoid them and others including individuals which may have been wrongfully identified, being put in any danger."
The Hunted One group has declined to comment.
