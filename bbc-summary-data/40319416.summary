The partnership running the current system in Rhyl, Prestatyn and Rhuddlan say it is not sustainable and has agreed to pass it to Cheshire West and Chester council.
The scheme will see 32 prioritised cameras beamed to England.
If anything is spotted, officers will alert North Wales Police immediately.
The system in the towns was run and funded by Denbighshire council until 2015.
County council spending cuts saw it passed to a partnership of Denbighshire, three town councils and North Wales Police about a year ago for a trial period.
In the last 12 months, the cameras have been operational 24 hours a day but have not been monitored full-time, with crime figures in the area remaining much the same.
The network's server at Rhyl police station is said to be beyond its serviceable lifetime and, with a replacement costing about Â£80,000, grants are being sought.
The partnership board prioritised 32 cameras in the three towns according to their importance in tackling crime and disorder and their contribution to the community.
Ranked as lower priority, the remaining 48 cameras will not be repaired or replaced if they break.
