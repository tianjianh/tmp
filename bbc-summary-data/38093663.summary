Both attend Manchester College and were attacked outside its Shena Simon campus on Chorlton Street shortly before 11:10 GMT.
One, aged 17, was found with a stab wound to his chest while the other, 18, had a stab wound to his back. Both are in a stable condition in hospital.
Another boy, aged 17, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
Students reported parts of the campus being put into lockdown for about an hour after the attack.
Others were told to stay in their lessons, before the campus was closed for the remainder of the day.
Lisa O'Loughlin, principal at Manchester College, said: "An incident occurred this morning at our Shena Simon campus in which two of our students were injured.
"We are providing full support to our students and staff at this difficult time."
Greater Manchester Police said a knife was found at the scene.
Chief Inspector Gareth Parkin said: "The knife will be forensically examined, but we still need people to contact us with any information they have.
"I'd like to reassure the community that we have a number of highly-skilled officers working on this investigation and will continue to carry out extensive enquiries."
According to its website, Manchester College is the largest further education college in the UK, with about 20,000 full and part-time students across 17 campuses.
Its Shena Simon campus offers courses in performing arts and music.
