Stuart Hogg will recover from his injury setback to tour again with the British and Irish Lions, according to Scotland captain John Barclay.

The 24-year-old Glasgow Warriors full-back is returning home from New Zealand after suffering a fracture in a facial injury.
He was on his second Lions trip, having been involved in Australia in 2013.
"He'll be back next season and he'll be back on another Lions tour, I've no doubt," Barclay told BBC Scotland.
Hogg was hurt 20 minutes into Saturday's win over Crusaders after accidentally colliding with the elbow of team-mate Conor Murray.
"I text him last night when everyone was hoping it was just a deep cut," Barclay said as Scotland prepare for Saturday's Test with Australia in Sydney.
"He's gutted but he's young enough to hopefully get on the next tour [South Africa 2021].
"He was player of the [Six Nations] championship two years in a row and, for my mind he was a shoo-in for the Lions Test team.
"What can you say? He's done all the graft to get there and it's a freak injury.
"You can just sympathise with him and hope he's all right, getting through whatever he needs to in terms of operations."
