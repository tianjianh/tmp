Cheeki Rafiki sailor Steve Warren's memorial held

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial service has been held for one of the four yachtsmen who was lost at sea when their yacht Cheeki Rafiki capsized in the Atlantic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The service for friends and relatives of Steve Warren was held at Huntworth near Bridgwater.
Mr Warren's sister Kay Coombes said: "He would want us to celebrate his life."
His family also met the US Coastguard in Boston earlier in the week to thank them for their efforts in the search.
Ms Coombes and Mr Warren's family returned earlier this week from their trip which included visiting Cape Cod, the nearest landmass to where the yacht was reported missing.
The yacht's upturned hull was found by the US Coast Guard on 23 May.
There was no sign of Mr Warren or his fellow yachtsmen; Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham, Surrey; Paul Goslin, 56, from West Camel, Somerset and 22-year-old James Male, from Romsey, Hampshire.
Speaking of the visit Ms Coombes said: "The coastguard put an awful lot of effort into this and we have since found out... that this was one of the most complex cases they have dealt with.
"We didn't realise that at the time and it was lovely to be able to go over there and say thank you face-to-face."
She said the memorial had been organised in accordance with her brother's wishes and would be a "very personal service".
Another memorial is set to be held on Friday for Mr Goslin, in Sherborne.
