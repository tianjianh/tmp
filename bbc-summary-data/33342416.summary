The ambitious club also stated they would recruit another "big name" and "set the world on fire".
Cameroonian Eto'o is leaving Serie A side Sampdoria after just five months.
"I have signed a three-year contract," the former Barcelona, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Everton striker, 34, said.
Eto'o enjoyed much of his success at Barca, where he was from 2004 to 2009.
His trophies there included three La Liga crowns, alongside former Brazil forward Ronaldinho, and two Champions League titles.
He also won the Champions League, under coach Jose Mourinho, at Inter Milan in 2010, and has an Olympic gold medal, which he won with Cameroon in 2000.
Regarding Ronaldinho, club president Gultekin Gencer is reported to have told Turkish channel TRT Spor: "We reached an agreement with Ronaldinho. I think within two days it'll be made official."
