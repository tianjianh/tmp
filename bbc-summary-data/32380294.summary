A city's history has been brought to life in a new mobile phone tour.

Walkers in Newport can now scan eight QR codes across the city centre as part of the 'Heroes and Villains' tour.
Created by HistoryPoints.org, it features stories on a soldier who returned from the Boer War to kill his wife and a delivery boy who was the hero of the 1909 dock disaster.
The tour runs between the Cenotaph in Clarence Place and the Merchant Navy memorial in Cardiff Road.
Rhodri Clark, founder of HistoryPoints.org, hopes the new tour will appeal to both residents and tourists.
The QR codes can be found at:
