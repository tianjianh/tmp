The Irish captain, who also top-scored with 100 in Thursday's win, helped the tourists to 203-2 after United Arab Emirates could only manage 202.
Andy McBrine and Craig Young each took three wickets while Shaiman Anwar put up resistance with 48.
Andrew Balbirnie scored an unbeaten 58 in Ireland's successful reply.
Paul Stirling (41) shared an opening stand of 94 with Porterfield while Niall O'Brien chipped in with 18 not out as Ireland reached their target in 41.5 overs.
The victory was set up by a disciplined bowling display from the Irish, with United Arab Emirates bowled out with 2.1 overs to spare.
Anwar, Rameez Shahzab (41) and Muhummad Usman (29) put on middle-order runs and it was an improvement on the 185 posted in Thursday's 85-run defeat.
McBrine (3-42) and Young (3-48) were helped by Jacob Mulder (2-28) and George Dockrell (2-41).
Ireland will now travel to Greater Noida in India for nine matches against Afghanistan across three different formats.
