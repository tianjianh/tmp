Coniston volunteers responded to 66 incidents in 2015 - a 53% rise on the previous year and 27% up on its previous highest in 2012.
In August, it said people relying on systems such as GPS and maps on mobile phones was a major issue.
Kendal also had a record year and countywide figures due this month will show a doubling of mountain fatalities.
Jeff Carroll, deputy team leader at Coniston Mountain Rescue, said it was "difficult to pinpoint any major trends" but added there had been a number of mountain bike accidents in areas such as Grizedale Forest.
Last week Kendal Mountain Search and Rescue Team said it had dealt with 73 alerts in 2015, an increase of 20% over its previous record.
