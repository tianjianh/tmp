Welsh boxer Ashley Brace is out of this month's Commonwealth Games after the International Boxing Association deemed her ineligible.

The association has refused to approve Brace's accreditation for Glasgow because of her involvement at the 2013 Unified Kickboxing World Championships.
The Welsh Boxing Association has accepted the ruling.
Brace, 23, had been included in Wales' 10-strong squad for the Commonwealth Games to compete in the 51kg category.
"Ashley is a fantastic young athlete with bags of potential," said Team Wales chef de mission Brian Davies.
"Both Welsh Boxing and the Commonwealth Games Council for Wales are saddened that she now won't have the opportunity to compete at the Games in just two weeks' time."
Women's boxing will be appearing for the first time in Glasgow with Charlene Jones and Lauren Price the representatives for Wales.
The Commonwealth Games begin on Wednesday, 23 July.
