[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Preston stretched their unbeaten run in the Championship to five games with a  home victory over Huddersfield.

The visitors were punished by Paul Gallagher's dead-ball skills for conceding fouls around their box.
Deliveries into the box by Gallagher were headed home by Tom Clarke and Alex Baptiste to put Preston on top.
Another free-kick by the midfielder eluded everyone and beat Town keeper Danny Ward and Nahki Wells' header in reply was no more than a consolation.
On boss David Wagner's 45th birthday, it was the first time former leaders Huddersfield had conceded more than one goal in a league game this season.
They remain fourth in the table but have now lost their last two games and have still not won in the league at Deepdale since November 1969.
The Terriers showed plenty of ability on the ball, but only managed one shot on target in the first half, which was marked by a round of applause by both sets of fans for 15-year-old Preston supporter Dylan Crossley, who died recently in a road collision.
The introduction of Wells and Harry Bunn as substitutes after the interval provided them with a greater threat up front, but Gallagher's goal left them with too much to do as Preston moved up to 13th.
Preston manager Simon Grayson: "Maybe leaving Paul Gallagher out for a couple of games has given a reminder that nobody is safe in the team if others are doing well. Gally, on his day, is as good as anyone in this division with his delivery.
"We knew what a good team they were and we knew that we had to be very good off the ball to stop them playing.
"Sometimes you win a match with the ball and how you play, but that was as much about what we did off it as well.
"We made them kick it long and not get into a routine. We got the goals at the right time and it was a really strong performance from first whistle to last."
Huddersfield boss David Wagner:  "To be fair, the explanation for our performance is very easy, we weren't on the aggression that we normally are.
"If you want to be successful here against Preston you have to be aggressive, especially in the first line to defend the ball and keep the ball. This is what we completely missed.
"In the end, three set-pieces decided the game. But credit to Preston, Gallagher is a great deliverer and unfortunately we were not able to defend these balls.
"It was a weakness in that game yes, but my bigger concern is that we didn't have our fighting attitude. In the second half it was better, but the first half was not good enough."
