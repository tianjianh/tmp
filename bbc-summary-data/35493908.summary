[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cashless system to be piloted at Powys schools

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new system of cashless payments for school transactions including meals is being piloted in Powys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Powys council said five schools in Crickhowell would test the scheme, which will then be rolled out across the county.
The aim is to reduce the risks and costs of handling cash.
Pupils will use cards which can be topped up online or via PayPoint outlets and parents will be able to see what their children are eating.
Cards will also inform catering staff of any dietary requirements or allergies.
