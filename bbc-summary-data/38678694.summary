The 22-year-old left-back has returned to his Bundesliga club Schalke, where he is on loan from Chelsea.
Ghana said Rahman has "a rupture of the meniscus and a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament" in the left knee.
Rahman was hurt in the Black Stars' 1-0 win over Uganda in Group D on Tuesday.
Ghana's next match at the tournament is against Mali on Saturday. A victory would put them into the quarter-finals.
