Jennifer Cann, 30, "failed to maintain professional boundaries" and engaged in an "inappropriate relationship" a disciplinary panel said.
Miss Cann, who taught at Burton Borough School in Newport, Shropshire, has been banned from teaching indefinitely.
She can apply to have a prohibition order set aside in two years' time.

The National College for Teaching and Leadership professional conduct panel found that between 2014 and 2016, Miss Cann had an inappropriate relationship with a student.
It found she made inappropriate physical contact with them and also met them outside of school hours more than once.
It was also found that between 2015 and 2016 she gave answers to two of her GCSE computing science classes.
The hearing was told Miss Cann stated she met with the student to provide mentoring.
"However, this appears to have contravened the previous warnings given to Miss Cann by the head teacher of the school, which was to avoid meeting with pupils alone in order to maintain appropriate professional boundaries," the panel concluded.
While she admitted hugging the pupil, the panel said there was "no suggestion that there was any sexual element to this".
The panel found Miss Cann had breached the Teachers' Standards and she was given a prohibition order with a review period of two years.
Christine Carter, head teacher at the school, said: "We investigated the matter and held a disciplinary hearing when we became aware of the issue because the allegations were a potential safeguarding concern.
"The member of staff resigned before the disciplinary process could be completed. However, our governors continued with and concluded the process therefore complying with safeguarding protocols."
