April had the strongest rise in business activity of 2017, according to the study for Ulster Bank.
New orders increased and job creation accelerated, according to the bank's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a detailed monthly survey of companies.
The private sector had an "encouraging start" to the second quarter of the year, said the bank's chief economist.
Richard Ramsey added that there had been a sharp rise in new business from outside the UK as a result of the weak pound.
However, the value of sterling also continues to make imports more expensive, with "input cost inflation most acute for manufacturers," he said.
Job creation has picked up and is the highest in 10 months, added the report.
