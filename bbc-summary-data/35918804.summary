Reality Check: Is the EU referendum reducing job vacancies?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said on BBC Breakfast this morning: "We've got research showing that the number of vacancies is falling while companies just wait and see what's going to happen on 23 June."

The research comes from a jobs website called Adzuna, which comes up with a monthly index that collects job vacancies advertised online in the UK from more than one thousand sources.
Its latest report suggested that there had actually been a moderate increase in the number of vacancies in February, but the number was well below the peak reached in November.
This is at odds with the official figures from the Office for National Statistics, which reports quarterly figures. It found that the number of vacancies between December and February was a bit higher than it had been in the previous three months.
But regardless, the Adzuna report does not appear to have done any research into whether the decline has had anything to do with the EU Referendum.
Doug Monro, co-founder of Adzuna, comments in his report that the debate about a potential Brexit "seems to have given employers pause for thought on hiring plans", but he also points out that there are other major challenges in the way, adding that "next month's national living wage is set to redefine the UK's job landscape".
Reality Check verdict: Vacancies may not be falling and there is no evidence that it's anything to do with the EU Referendum.
