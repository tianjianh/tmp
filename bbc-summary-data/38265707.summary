Stephen Hughes, 29, and Shaunean Boyle, 25, were convicted of attacking Owen Creaney in July 2014.
Mr Creaney, from Lurgan, died two days after the attack.
His family said Mr Creaney "thought he was with his friends but these people turned out to be his killers".
"The loss of such a wonderful son has left us heartbroken. He was a kind soul and didn't deserve what happened to him.
"Owen would have helped anyone."
Both Hughes and Boyle received automatic life sentences when convicted.
At a tariff hearing on Friday, a judge said Hughes would spend at least 15 years in prison before being considered for parole, while Boyle will serve 14 years.
The judge said Mr Creaney was subjected to a "savage and merciless attack".
The judge said Boyle would have a year less on her tariff because her past criminal record was less serious.
He added that the pair will serve their sentences in their entirety with no chance of earlier parole.
A jury had previously heard that Hughes and Boyle had punched, kicked and stamped on Mr Creaney.
They then washed and changed him and, after he died, put his body in a wheelie bin at the house in Moyraverty Court in Craigavon, County Armagh, where he was found by police.
Det Ch Insp Lee McNevison said the police hoped the sentences would "provide comfort and a degree of closure for the Creaney family".
"They have conducted themselves with great dignity over the past two and a half years since Owen's murder and more recently as they listened to the often difficult evidence at the trial."
