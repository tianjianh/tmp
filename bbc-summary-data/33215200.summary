The air and sea rescue was launched at about 08:10 after the single occupant of the boat issued a 'mayday' call one mile east of Portsoy in Aberdeenshire.
Aberdeen Coastguard said a rope had become wrapped around the boat's propeller, causing it to drift.
Two lifeboats from Macduff and Buckie and the Rescue Bond 1 helicopter were called the scene.
A coastguard spokesman said the man was rescued by the Macduff lifeboat and was safe and well.
