Plan for lap-dancing venue in former Southsea Conservative club rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An application to turn a former Conservative club in Southsea into a lap-dancing venue has been rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plan would have seen Elegance, in Granada Road, move to Albert Road and open between 21:00 and 04:00.
More than 1,300 people signed petitions against the proposals and the city council received 63 objections.
But 468 supportive representations were also received, one of which said lap-dancing clubs "tend to have the least amount of crime associated with them".
It added: "It's a venue where mostly mature individuals have a chance to enjoy a good night out."
At a Planning Committee meeting councillors voted seven to one against the application.
City MP Flick Drummond and the Unison union's South East Regional Women's Committee both also opposed the plan.
Objectors said it would be "wholly inappropriate" for the club to be near music venue the Wedgewood Rooms, and it would also cause women to fear for their safety late at night.
In 2012 Portsmouth councillors voted not to ban lap-dancing clubs in the city, but said no more licences will be granted for similar venues.
Applicant Paul Ojla also runs the lap-dancing club Wiggle in Surrey Street.
