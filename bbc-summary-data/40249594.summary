[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British and Irish Lions defence coach Andy Farrell believes Dan Biggar has been "harsh" by describing himself as third choice fly-half.

Biggar will start against the Highlanders on Tuesday having shaken off his own head injury issue but feels he currently trails Johnny Sexton and Owen Farrell in the fly-half race.
"It's a bit harsh for him to say he's third choice," said Andy Farrell.
"He got a head knock in the first game and hasn't had that much game time."
Biggar will partner Wales and Ospreys half-back partner Rhys Webb against the Highlanders on Tuesday having been forced off in the 22-16 defeat by the Blues by a head injury suffered in the first-half.

The 27-year-old  was not considered for selection in the 12-3 win against Crusaders.
"The other boys have played since and played pretty well but Dan's in the hot seat on Tuesday and looking forward to it,"  Farrell added.

"I don't think it's a pressure situation.
"It's a group that needs to keep on building and the message to the boys this morning about Tuesday is we're building our plan, the things that we do behind the scenes as well as what we do on the pitch.
"That's team harmony, team systems, team togetherness, and Dan's in charge of that on Tuesday
"Dan has been smashing me all morning, so he's fine and ready."
Farrell believes the Lions will be in no rush to call up a replacement if Stuart Hogg is ruled out of the New Zealand tour.
The Scotland full-back collided accidentally with Conor Murray's elbow in Saturday's 12-3 win over the Crusaders.
Hogg is still waiting on the outcome of specialist examinations on his cheek, but defence coach Farrell believes the Lions boast a good array of alternative options.
Jared Payne will slot in at 15 for Tuesday's Highlanders clash, with Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson also comfortable at full-back - and Leigh Halfpenny also a specialist.
"Warren (Gatland) will give Stuart all the time he needs to make sure he's right," said Farrell.
