Chris Brown wants Australia visa 'to discuss domestic violence'

US singer Chris Brown says he wants to go to Australia to use his influence as an entertainer to raise awareness about domestic violence.

He was commenting in a tweet to news at the weekend that he is unlikely to be given a visa to perform in Australia because of his domestic abuse record.
The singer is scheduled to go on tour in Australia in December, and tickets went on sale on Monday.
He was told on Sunday that he had 28 days to appeal against the decision.
"I would be more than grateful to come to Australia to raise awareness about domestic violence," Mr Brown tweeted. "I'm not the pink elephant in the room anymore."
"My life mistakes should be a wake up call for everyone. Showing the world that mistakes don't define you. Trying to prevent spousal abuse," he said.
In 2009, Chris Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting his then-girlfriend, the pop star Rihanna. He has toured Australia twice since, but the government is under pressure to refuse him this time.
Australia's immigration department has issued a "notice of intention to consider refusal," Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said.
The singer has 28 days to present a case as to why he should be granted a visa, after which a final decision will be made.
Minister for Women Michaelia Cash, who was until recently assistant immigration minister, had urged Mr Dutton to take a stand on the issue.
It follows the government's decision earlier this year to refuse a visa for world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather on similar grounds.
Mayweather had been booked for dinner and nightclub appearances in Sydney and Melbourne in January.
New Zealand has already ruled that Brown is unsuitable for entry into the country.
