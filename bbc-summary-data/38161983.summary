The 21-year-old midfielder was brought on by his father, the Madrid coach, at half-time in their Copa del Rey victory over Cultural Leonesa at the Bernabeu.
Madrid won the tie 6-1, beating their third-tier opponents 13-2 on aggregate to reach the competition's last 16.
Norwegian teenager Martin Odegaard, who signed as a 16-year-old in January 2015, also made his full debut.
Former France midfielder Zidane senior, 44, played 227 matches for Real after joining from Juventus for a then-world record Â£45.8m in July 2001, famously scoring their winner in the 2002 Champions League final.
Enzo, the eldest of Zidane's four sons, made almost 50 appearances for Madrid's reserve team before being given his senior debut.
