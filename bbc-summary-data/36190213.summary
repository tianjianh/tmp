Owen, 27, joined the region in 2012 from Ospreys, while wing Williams leaves Cardiff Blues having been on a season-long loan at Parc y Scarlets.
Williams, 25, has been out since the end of January after a shoulder injury.
"It has been a frustrating couple of months having to watch from the sidelines, but I'm looking forward to the next couple of years," he said.
"I feel that I've really settled in here at Parc y Scarlets since arriving earlier this season.
"There's a great bunch of boys here and I'm grateful to the coaches for giving me an opportunity."
Wing or centre Owen, who has represented Wales Under-19s and Wales Under-20s, added: "I'm delighted to have extended my contract here at the Scarlets.
"I feel that I've had more of an opportunity to show what I can do this season, and have stayed relatively injury-free, which has allowed me to put a decent run of games together."
Scarlets will clinch fourth place in the Pro12 if they beat Munster at Thomond Park on Saturday and Ulster lose at Ospreys.
