Train services through Anderston Station were halted after the damage was discovered in the early hours of Thursday.
ScotRail said staff had arrived in the morning to find a section of the roof had "come away" above platform one.
The company later said that services were now running normally through the station.
A spokesman said: "Station staff at Anderston arrived this morning to find that a small part of the roof over the platform had come away.
"For safety reasons, they were unable to open the station to the public until the platform had been cleared and safety barriers erected."
A ScotRail Alliance spokesman added: "We are investigating the cause, and are looking to repair the damage with a minimum of disruption to our customers."
