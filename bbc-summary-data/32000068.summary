A man has appeared in court in Belfast accused of seriously injuring a woman by attacking her with a metal pipe from a vacuum cleaner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Curtis Lee Morrow, from Maymount Street in the city, was charged with six offences that were all alleged to have taken place on Friday, 20 March.
They include causing grievous bodily harm, possessing a weapon - namely a metal vacuum pipe - with intent to commit GBH and resisting police.
He was remanded into custody.
The 23-year-old is also accused of causing criminal damage and breaching a non-molestation order by being in the vicinity of Cloverfield Street.
No further details of the alleged offences were outlined during the hearing at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Saturday.
However, a police constable said he believed he could connect the accused to each of the charges.
Mr Morrow was granted legal aid and although he did not apply for bail, his solicitor indicated he would do at the next appearance.
The accused was remanded into custody to appear in court again on Monday by video link.
