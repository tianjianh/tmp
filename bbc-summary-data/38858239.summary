[SN]TITLE[SN]
Virus glass sculpture exhibition opens in Bristol

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glass sculptures depicting the world's most deadly viruses have gone on display.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Artist Luke Jerram worked with University of Bristol virologists to ensure the models - which include HIV, swine flu and smallpox - were accurate.
He said his Glass Microbiology exhibition was designed to "contemplate the global impact of each disease".
The exhibition will be on at the At-Bristol science museum until 4 September.
The sculptures, which are not restricted solely to depictions of viruses, were made in collaboration with glassblowers Brian Jones and Norman Veitch.
Mr Jerram's previous art projects include turning Park Street in Bristol into a giant water slide, and mooring a flotilla of abandoned fishing boats in Leigh Woods.
