The former Oceana nightclub building is set to be demolished and replaced with a new office block.
Swansea council has exchanged contracts on the site which used to be at the heart of the city's nightlife.
Council leader Rob Stewart said the move was a "statement of intent" about the plans to transform the Kingsway.
