Brett Kyle's pick-up went off the road and rolled over into a ditch close to Foxx's California home.
Foxx said the truck became engulfed in flames "within five seconds" after he got the driver out.
"I don't look at it as heroic", he told reporters, "I just look at it like, you know, you just had to do something. And it all just worked out.''
The Oscar-winning actor said he heard the crash from his house and called 911 before running to the scene.
An off-duty paramedic who was driving by also stopped to help. They used his emergency room scissors to break the window and cut the man's seatbelt and pull him out.
"I told him as we were talking, as I'm getting him out, I said 'you've got to help me get you out because I don't want to have to leave you'", Foxx said.
"And I said 'You've got angels around you.'''
The driver's father Brad Kyle met Foxx to thank him for his actions.
He said he had been shown surveillance footage of the crash site and said several cars had passed by the scene without helping.
He broke down in tears when he spoke to reporters about what Foxx had done.
"I just kept watching it and going `My god, my god, he didn't have to do a thing,'" he said.
"I think we all hope that we can do something when the time is there. But the question is, do we? do we act or do we fear for our own lives? and he did not.''
The 32-year-old driver has broken bones and a punctured lung, but he is expected to recover.
