Friday's winning numbers were 01, 21, 26, 40 and 50 and the winning Lucky Star numbers were 02 and 04.
The winner matched all seven numbers to scoop £61,102,443 - one of the largest lottery wins in the UK.
The biggest was when Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs, North Ayrshire, won the £161,653,000 EuroMillions jackpot in July 2011.
The name of the winner has not yet been announced by the National Lottery, whose operator Camelot runs Euromillions in the UK.
