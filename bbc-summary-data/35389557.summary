The Stags started the game positively and should have been ahead through Matt Green who was denied by Callum Preston.
The breakthrough came in the second half when Beardsley flicked home a header past Preston on 60 minutes.
Mansfield ended the game with 10 men after Green received his second booking, but the Stags held out to record back-to-back wins.
Crawley's fifth home defeat of the season came just hours after it was announced that the League Two side are close to agreeing a takeover with an overseas-based business consortium.
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Sussex:

"It was a tight game. They had a couple of chances in the first half, then they hit us on the break with one ball and Callum Preston has made a couple of good saves.
"We probably got what we deserve. It's the end of a frustrating couple of weeks. Our lads are a little low on confidence and obviously Mansfield's late win the other night gave them a confidence boost.
"We were a little bit sluggish. There was nothing really in the game apart from hitting us on the break. We are making mistakes that are costing us."
