A 41-year-old man has not been seen since the boat overturned at Shepperton at about 18:00 BST on Thursday.
Witness John Mumford said people on the bank tried to get a buoy to him. He said: "They were shouting to hold on to his shirt and then it just went quiet."
The search team from Shoreham described underwater visibility as "very poor".
An 18-year-old man and a 39-year-old man managed to get to safety after the boat capsized near Russell Road but the other man was seen calling for help.
Mr Mumford said: "I heard a speedboat or a jet ski come around the bend, then it apparently tipped over and I heard screaming and yelling for help."
"Because the current was running so fast, the boat went down stream and out of sight," he added.
A search for the man on Thursday evening was called off for the night but resumed on Friday at Shepperton park, opposite Desborough Island.
The Environment Agency is helping to recover the boat, Surrey Police said.
