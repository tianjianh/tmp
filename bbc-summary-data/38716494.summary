On Friday, police were called to Daws Lane, Mill Hill, when offensive graffiti was found on a recycling bin.
The next day, a brick with anti-Semitic comments written on it was thrown through a window of a home in Edgware.
Several hours later, a swastika was drawn in condensation on a window in Watford Way, Mill Hill.
Officers are examining footage from CCTV cameras as part of their investigations.
Gary Ost, chief executive of Shomrim North West London, a community neighbourhood patrol, said: "Theses cowardly anti-Semitic attacks targeted Jews when they were asleep in their homes or walking with their families after dinner.
"These attacks are intended to instil fear in London's Jews. The best response to these disgusting acts is to ensure that the perpetrators are caught."
Insp Justin Zitver, from the Met Police, said: "Whilst there is no evidence at this stage to suggest that these offences are linked, it is of great concern that members of our local community are being targeted in this way."
No arrests have been made.
