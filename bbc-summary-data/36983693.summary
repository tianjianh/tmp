The incident happened at about 21:00 BST on Wednesday in Prestbury.
Cheshire Police said: "Officers went to the address and conducted a full search of the local area and were unable to find any trace of the offender."
The testimonial against Everton, which ended 0-0, made history as it was the first ever game between Premier League teams to be streamed live on Facebook.
