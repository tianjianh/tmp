A man who assaulted a security guard and fought with police while trying to get into Rangers' Ibrox Stadium has been jailed for eight months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Robertson, 32, from Springburn, Glasgow, seized the guard and pushed him against a wall on 7 February.
When police intervened he struggled with them, shouted abuse and threats and made a sectarian remark.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Robertson was also banned from attending football matches for three years.
Speaking after Robertson was sentenced. Stephen Ferguson, football liaison prosecutor for the west of Scotland, said: "This kind of physical and verbal violence directed at people who are simply doing their jobs is unacceptable, whether at football matches or elsewhere.
"The Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service takes a zero-tolerance approach to this type of behaviour and will continue to prosecute those who engage in it."
