The Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run passed some of the city's best known landmarks, including the Clyde Arc and the Finnieston Crane.
Uganda's Moses Kipsiro won the men's half-marathon in one hour two minutes 18 seconds.
Kenya's Edna Kiplagat successfully defended her women's title in 1:08:21.
The event, which started at George Square, also featured a wheelchair race and 10k events.
Meanwhile, more than 3,000 children and adults took part in the Great Scottish Run's Super Saturday opening events yesterday.
The two Family Mile races were started by Commonwealth Games 10,000m gold medallist Moses Kipsiro, Kenya's Japheth Korir and Team Australia's Collis Birmingham.
Andy Mitchelmore, of event organisers Great Run Company, said: "It was great to see George Square packed with excited kids taking part and enjoying sport, not to mention all the parents, grandparents, friends and families lining the routes to support them.
"Seeing elite athletes like Moses Kipsiro and Edna Kiplagat will hopefully inspire the kids to continue running, and maybe one day take part in our 10k and half marathon events in the years to come - we might even have a baby Bolt or a junior Jess Ennis in our midst!"
