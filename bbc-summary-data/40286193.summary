City of Leeds duo Bower, 17, and Banks, 16, scored 299.19 points from their five dives in the 10m synchronised event.
Their success follows individual 10m gold for Lois Toulson on Tuesday.
"This was an exciting competition with a completely surprising end for us," Banks said.
"As the youngest duo today, we would never have expected to win, especially since this was one of our first synchro competitions together."
Silver went to Russia's Iuliia Timoshinina and Valeriia Belova with a score of 297.00, while Ukraine's Valeriia Liulko and Sofiia Lyskun took bronze with 288.96.
On Thursday Noah Williams and Matthew Dixon secured the British team's third medal of the championships with bronze in the 10m synchro.
