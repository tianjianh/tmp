[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Glasswell, 34, of Simmons Way, Gipton, bludgeoned one of his victims with a hammer and also set fire to a house with a 78-year-old woman inside.
He pleaded guilty to a number of charges and was jailed for life with a minimum term of six years.
Police described Glasswell as a "despicable individual".
West Yorkshire Police said his crime spree began on 8 September last year by robbing a clothes store on Vicar Lane after threatening a store assistant.
Two days later he went to the home of an 86-year-old woman on Pendas Walk where he hit her several times over the head with a hammer.
The victim suffered two skull fractures and a broken eye socket and had to have 50 stitches in her head.
The following day he ripped the handbag off the shoulder of an 82-year-old woman walking on Beckett Street.
Later that day he returned to Leeds where he went into a shop and threatened a staff member with a plastic handgun.
Police said Glasswell's final offence took place in the early hours of 12 September when 78-year-old Jean Lord was woken in her home by Glasswell, who was stood in the door of her bedroom and threatened her with the same replica firearm.
He dragged her downstairs and threatened to pour boiling water over her head before making off with jewellery and a DVD player.
Leaving Mrs Lord injured on the living-room floor, Glasswell then started two fires as he left, one in front of the main door and the other in front of a desk containing all the keys to the house.
Mrs Lord managed to escape and raise the alarm with a neighbour.
Glasswell admitted aggravated burglary, assault, theft, robbery, attempted robbery, false imprisonment and arson with intent to endanger life.
