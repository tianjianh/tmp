Five men have been jailed over a plot to kill a man with a sawn-off shotgun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Catchpole survived a gunshot wound to the chest but needed surgery following the attack in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in August 2015.
Colin Deferia, 60, of Barking, Suffolk, who commissioned the "hit" due to a "grudge" against the victim, was jailed for 26 years.
Simon Webber, Frank Warren and Andrew Seaton were each jailed for 23 years and Paul Baker for 17 years.
All five had denied conspiracy to murder, but were found guilty at Ipswich Crown Court following an eight-week trial.
Webber, 32, of Bridgwater, Somerset; Warren, 52, of Dorchester, Dorset; and Seaton, 40, of Maiden Newton, Dorset; were also convicted of possessing a prohibited firearm.
Baker, 35, of Maiden Newton, had acted as a go-between between Deferia and the others, the court heard.
Police found Mr Catchpole with a "significant" gunshot wound to his chest at a flat in Forum Court, Bury St Edmunds, on 4 August 2015.
Shortly afterwards, a burnt-out car was discovered on the edge of the town. It contained a sawn-off shotgun found to have been used in the crime.
Deferia was identified as a suspect due to an ongoing dispute with Mr Catchpole and was arrested the next day.
Analysis of his mobile phone established he had been in contact with some of the other suspects. All four were arrested over the following days.
Mobile phone data, automatic number plate recognition and CCTV footage helped prove Webber, Warren and Seaton had travelled to the town from the south-west of England on the day of the attack.
Forensic evidence linked Webber to the shooting. Warren and Seaton assisted him in carrying out the attack, with Seaton driving the stolen getaway car.
The court heard since the attack, Mr Catchpole, who is in his 30s, needed life-saving surgery to remove multiple pellets.
A victim impact statement read to the court said he was now afraid to open the door and did not feel safe in his home.
Judge David Goodin said he had been shot at point-blank range and it was a "miracle" he had survived.
He described Deferia as a wealthy, successful, self-made businessman but behind his good nature was "vicious remorselessness".
Mark Milliken-Smith, for Deferia, said his client had been law-abiding until this crime, with no previous convictions, and suffered from a depressive disorder.
After the hearing, Ch Insp Caroline Millar, said: "This was a pre-planned and orchestrated attempt to murder an innocent man, all because of a grudge held against him by Colin Deferia.
"Deferia hired the other four men to carry out this attack and between them they thought they had planned the perfect crime."
