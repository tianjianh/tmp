[SN]TITLE[SN]
Revamp plan for disused Thornaby Town Hall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Grade II-listed former Teesside town hall, which has been mostly disused for more than 40 years, is to be restored.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thornaby Town Council has taken over the freehold of the 120-year-old building from Stockton Council.
It will now work with local development company, Green Lane Capital, to turn it and the adjoining property into a heritage centre, offices and spaces for up to 26 small enterprises.
The authority said the main chamber may also be restored for council meetings.
Councillor Mike Smith, Stockton Council's cabinet member for regeneration and transport, said: "We have been working for many years to find an appropriate and viable solution to secure the future of Thornaby Town Hall.
"Over the years we have carried out substantial renovations, including replacing the roof, but it requires a great deal more to secure if for the future and make it suitable for 21st Century use.
He added that he was "delighted" to hand over the freehold to the new owners.
"Their investment plans are very exciting," he said.
"I'm certain they will not only protect the heritage of the building, but also help support the town's economy by supporting small enterprises and providing accommodation for existing businesses both now and in the future."
Much of the building has not been used since the former Thornaby-on-Tees Borough Council ceased to exist in 1968.
