The Canada-born former Germany right wing takes over from Ryan Finnerty, who left after Clan failed to reach the Elite League play-off semi-finals.
Clan director Gareth Chalmers said: "We wanted someone young, ambitious, well-connected, with the leadership to take us to the next level.
"In John, we believe we have that."
Tripp, who has signed a two-year contract, made more than 50 appearances for Germany, playing for his adopted country at the 2010 Olympic Games.
The ex-wing enjoyed a long playing career in Canada, the United States and Germany before taking over as head coach at Eispiraten Crimmitshau, where he finished his career, in December.
Tripp's team finished bottom of DEL2 but retained their place for next season via a play-off.
Chalmers stressed that the Glasgow club had taken advice from, among others, Eisbaren Berlin head coach Uwe Krupp and Lowen Frankfurt counterpart Paul Gardner before making the appointment.
"He has been recommended to us by Uwe Krupp, Paul Gardner and a number of other well-respected people throughout hockey," he added.
"I believe John will challenge the rest of the club to be better with the aim of challenging for silverware."
