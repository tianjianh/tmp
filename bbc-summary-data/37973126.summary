North-east Scotland best for 'supermoon' watchers

The Moray coast could be one of the best places to see the "supermoon" in Scotland, forecasters have predicted.

A band of rain and cloud sweeping in from the west in the evening could leave skywatchers in the rest of the country disappointed.
The Moon is making its closest approach to Earth since 1948.
To observers, it will appear about 7% larger than normal and about 15% brighter - although the human eye is barely able to discern that difference.
The Moon will actually be at its closest - only 221,524 miles (356,509km) away - at 11:21.
Many skywatchers will be hoping to see the Moon as it rises, when it can appear bigger still.

Mike Alexander, from the Galloway Astronomy Centre, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: "What you get when it's rising is a thing called moon illusion when it appears much, much bigger than it does when it's high in the sky.
"At moonrise it will look bigger and be a nice effect."
However, Mr Alexander cautioned against too much excitement among moon-watchers in Scotland.
"I've been watching the weather all week for Scotland. If you're very lucky you might catch it," he said.
Forecasters are predicting cloud and rain to come in from the west from about 15:00 on Monday. A second front bringing rain will arrive a few hours later.
BBC Scotland Weather forecaster Judith Ralston said: "It looks like there's a band of rain coming in this evening, but it should miss Aberdeenshire and Moray.
"The best place to see it will be the north-east corner of the country."
The Moon will not be this close to Earth again until 25 November 2034.
