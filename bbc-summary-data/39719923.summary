The Republic of Ireland full-back, 28, was injured following a challenge from Wales' Neil Taylor in a World Cup qualifier on 24 March.
Taylor was sent off for the tackle and has been banned for two matches.
"I'm a fighter and there's a part of me that's looking forward to this challenge," said Coleman.
After successful surgery, Coleman spent a month with his family in his hometown of Killybegs in Ireland, where he was visited by Everton manager Ronald Koeman and captain Phil Jagielka.
On Wednesday, Coleman returned to Everton's training ground at Finch Farm for the first time.
Speaking to evertontv, he added: "I've started with very small exercises in the gym. I've been doing some walking in the pool and aqua-jogging.
"It's just good to be back in and around the club and feeling like a professional footballer again.
"It was great to be around my family and friends back home but I've been itching to get back. It's small steps but I'm ready to work.
"I'm really enjoying it and looking forward to the challenge ahead because it's going to be tough but I've had tough journeys before and this is just another one."
