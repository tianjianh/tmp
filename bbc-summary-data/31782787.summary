[SN]TITLE[SN]
NW chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal to step down in 'savings push'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Chief Crown Prosecutor for North West England is to step down as part of a savings push, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nazir Afzal has led several high-profile prosecutions, including ex-broadcaster Stuart Hall's trial.
The Manchester Evening News reported Mr Afzal was recently cleared of an allegation he sent a text message to a defendant in a court case.
He told the paper the decision to leave was a "long-planned move".
A CPS spokesman said: "We are continuing to reduce the number of staff employed across the organisation and Nazir Afzal is leaving the service as part of this on-going drive for efficiency.
"This is entirely unrelated to any issue of conduct and we are satisfied that there has been no impropriety on the part of Mr Afzal."
