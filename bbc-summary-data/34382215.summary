It follows Monday's "supermoon" - when the Moon is in the closest part of its orbit to Earth, meaning it appears larger in the sky.
On Tuesday, tides are higher than usual and the warnings and eight flood alerts have been issued for south east, west and mid coastlines.
A Severn Bore from 20:50 BST will be a metre higher than usual.
The warning is in place for north Gower at Crofty and the Wye Estuary near Tintern and at Chepstow, Monmouthshire.
The alerts have been issued for Pembrokeshire, Cardigan, Carmarthenshire, Swansea Bay and the Gower, the River Usk at Newport, the coast from Aberthaw to the Severn Bridge and two along the Wye Estuary.
Tenby's RNLI has also urged people to take extra precautions against tidal cut off.
High tide:
Adrian Philpott, from Natural Resources Wales, said: "While we are expecting tides to peak across Wales over the next few days, given the current high pressure and favourable weather conditions we are not expecting any significant problems.
"Our officers have been monitoring tidal conditions and forecasts over the weekend and will continue to keep a close eye on the situation.
"Water levels will be higher than usual, and we will issue flood alerts and warnings as required."
