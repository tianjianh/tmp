[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales has five billionaires, with Cardiff-born Sir Michael Moritz the wealthiest, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

Sir Michael, who made his fortune investing in firms including Google, PayPal and Yahoo, is now worth £1.95bn.
Moneysupermarket.com co-founder Simon Nixon and West Ham United co-owner David Sullivan are new to the list.
Specsavers co-founder Douglas Perkins remains second with a £1.55bn wealth while Sir Terry Matthews is fourth.
The list incorporates billionaires who were born or are based in Wales.
It said Mr Perkins, who was born in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, is worth £100m more than last year but Celtic Manor owner Sir Terry has dropped from third place.
That was taken by Mr Nixon who joined the billionaires list after selling the last of his shares in March for Moneysupermarket.com.
He co-founded the firm in Flintshire in 1999 with Duncan Cameron after dropping out of university.
He has earned £551m from share sales since the business was floated along and has properties valued at £310m along with stock market investments worth £490m.
Cardiff-born property investor and football club owner Mr Sullivan crossed the £1bn mark after his wealth grew by more than £150m in the last year.
Steve Morgan, the founder of Flintshire-based house builder Redrow, could become the country's sixth billionaire next year if his wealth continues to grow at the present rate, the Rich List added.
Ebbw Vale-born Mark Neale, who is behind outdoor clothing and equipment chain Mountain Warehouse, is a new entry to the Welsh list. He is worth £170m with more than 200 stores stretching from Poland to North America.
