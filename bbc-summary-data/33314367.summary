Starina Merrill, 27, was jailed for six months and banned from driving for two years after admitting dangerous driving in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire.
Mold Crown Court heard she drove at Carl Williams on 24 December last year, but he was not hurt and did not want his partner prosecuted.
Judge Rhys Rowlands described the incident as "the height of stupidity".
He said the mother-of-two's reaction was "extraordinary" after Mr Williams left her Rhuddlan home, taking her phone with him.
Merrill, a beauty therapist, had been "under enormous pressure" after being subjected to months of racial abuse and harassment from Mr Williams' former partner, the court heard.
Witnesses saw Mr Williams, from Rhyl, being knocked down onto a cycle path, the second time he ended up on the bonnet, and flew through the air the third time he was hit.
