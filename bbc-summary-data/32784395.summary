A British woman on holiday in Thailand has been found dead in a swimming pool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Initial reports from Ko Chang indicate Rachel Turner Brown drowned. A full post-mortem examination is due to be carried out.
Mrs Turner Brown and her husband Stefan Brown, from Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, travelled to the country on 12 May.
Mr Brown said on social media that he was "in absolute tatters, still in shock, [it has] not sunk in yet".
The couple had planned to spend seven weeks touring Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
They had been staying at Sofia Gardens Resort in Ko Chang, an island in the Gulf of Thailand's eastern seaboard, about 190 miles (310 km) from Bangkok and near the border with Cambodia.
The Foreign Office said: "We can confirm the death of a British national on 17 May in Thailand. We are providing consular support to the family."
