Chester 2-2 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester's winless run extended to seven games as Southport came back from two goals down to draw at the Deva Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 12th minute looked like it might prove pivotal as Chester goalkeeper Alex Lynch saved a one-on-one with Jamie Allen before Kane Richards went straight down the other end and headed in from Elliott Durrell's cross.
The Blues built on their good fortune and James Alabi nodded home at the back post from a Ryan Lloyd corner to make it 2-0 on the half-hour.
However, the Sandgrounders dominated the second half to salvage a draw.
Andrai Jones eventually ended Lynch's stubborn resistance, crashing in a shot from 25 yards to reduce the deficit to 2-1.
And then, with time ebbing away, Ben McKenna worked the ball to Jamie Allen, who volleyed past Lynch from outside the box.
