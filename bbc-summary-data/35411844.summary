Northern Ireland's two main airports saw an increase in passenger numbers in 2015, according to Civil Aviation Authority figures.

Passengers at Belfast International were up by 8.9% to almost 4.4m.
At George Best Belfast City Airport passenger numbers grew by 5.4% to almost 2.7m.
The airport said 2015 was "a record year" helped by a new KLM service to Amsterdam.
The International Airport can probably expect another significant increase this year with Ryanair to begin operating a new base.
The budget airline will fly to London's Gatwick Airport from March.
Five other routes, which have yet to be announced, will follow in October.
City of Derry Airport saw passenger numbers fall by 18.8% in 2015 to just over 284,000.
