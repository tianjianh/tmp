County Championship: Tom Westley stars for Essex after Alastair Cook makes one

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Westley starred for Essex after England Test captain Alastair Cook made just one as the visitors struggled on day two against Sussex at Hove.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sussex resumed on 355-8 but Jamie Porter bowled Ajmal Shahzad and Steve Magoffin in the first over of the day to wrap up their innings for 360.
The hosts reached 77-3 at lunch as Cook edged Magoffin to second slip and Nick Browne and Ravi Bopara fell cheaply.
Westley (86) and Jesse Ryder (51) boosted Essex as they closed on 252-7.
Cook complied with new helmet regulations while batting during the match, after being spoken to by the England and Wales Cricket Board following Essex's victory Gloucestershire last week.
