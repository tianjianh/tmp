"This is definitely not the Oscars," said 22 Jump Street star Jillian Bell on the red carpet in Los Angeles.
As well as fan-voted awards like best kiss and best shirtless performance (Efron won it - again) the ceremony was also an unofficial promotional platform for this summer's blockbusters.
The night's big winner was The Fault in Our Stars, which won best movie.
The film's star Shailene Woodley also picked up best female performance, the Trailblazer Award and best kiss for a scene with Ansel Elgort.
Woodley gave an emotional speech dedicated to John Green, the author of the book which the film is based on, saying "he gave this world a beautiful masterpiece".
Other winners included Bradley Cooper, who won best male performance for his role as the late Chris Kyle in American Sniper.
The 40-year-old actor said: "Chris Kyle would have turned 41 four days ago. Chris, this is for you," said Cooper.
Channing Tatum took home best comedic performance for 22 Jump Street and Meryl Streep picked up best villain for her role in Into the Woods.
Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Lawrence, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne were also among the winners.
Kevin Hart, who was the target of many size-related jokes throughout the night, brought his kids on stage to accept the comedic genius award.
He said: "I do it all for them. I'm trying to leave a legacy behind."
In one of the more energetic moments of the show, Robert Downey Jr brought his fellow Avengers stars to their knees while accepting the Generation Award.
Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all took the stage to present their co-star with the award, which Downey called "the recognition I so desire".
Clips from the upcoming Pitch Perfect sequel, Judd Apatow's latest comedy Trainwreck and Marvel's new film Ultron were shown during a look ahead to this summer's releases.
