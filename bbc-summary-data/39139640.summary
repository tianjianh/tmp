Sussex made a small operating profit of £1,000 in 2016, their first year as an integrated body combining professional, recreational and community cricket.

The figures for the year to 31 October 2016, include the Sussex Cricket Foundation charitable subsidiary.
An operating loss of £139,000 was recorded for the same period in 2015.
Sussex chairman Jim May said balancing the finances remained a "constant challenge but these were satisfactory figures for the new organisation".
A combined turnover figure of £6.5m showed a decline in match income, but the club said there had been a strong performance in commercial income.
Since the County Ground in Hove was redeveloped in 2011, net revenues for catering, events and rental income had increased by around £500,000 a year.
However, after making full allowance for depreciation, Sussex said it recorded a deficit after tax of £488,000.
The club's report added that the balance sheet was strong with total equity of £10.3m and no external debt.
"I believe that Sussex is in good shape for the current season," added May.
"We have made quality signings in the close season to complement our squad and we have an exciting group of youngsters coming through."
The club finished last season in fourth place in Championship Division Two and failed to progress beyond the group stage in the T20 Blast and One-Day Cup.
