[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hull City v Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are no new injury concerns for fourth-bottom Hull ahead of Saturday's match against relegated Sunderland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dieumerci Mbokani could return after two games out with a hamstring problem, while Omar Elabdellaoui has overcome a back injury but is short of fitness.
Midfielder Sebastian Larsson is available for Sunderland after completing a three-match suspension.
Billy Jones, Jason Denayer, Jack Rodwell, Darron Gibson and Lee Cattermole are all fitness doubts.
Guy Mowbray: "Hull this week, Swansea next. Sunderland might be down already but they could play a big part in who goes with them.
"After the furore surrounding Championship play-off hopefuls Huddersfield's team selection last week, David Moyes' plans for the remaining games will be interesting.
"Wouldn't Sunderland's best interests be served by a line-up of those players most likely to still be at the club next season? Moyes says he will be.
"Hull must simply do what they've done in six of the seven Premier League home games under Marco Silva. They must win. They MUST win - before watching Swansea versus Everton, cheering the Toffees.
"If they get the points to keep them in the top flight, keeping Silva would then be the challenge."

Hull City head coach Marco Silva on reports linking him with other Premier League clubs: "For me nothing has changed. It is normal that it (speculation) will start now but we will never lose our focus and we have one goal in mind.
"I see my future today and tomorrow to prepare the team and I am focused on playing well and winning next Saturday. This is what is important - not what happens in two months.
"I prepare one day then the next day and the next game, and this is my way."
Sunderland manager David Moyes on his future: "I've got a four-year contract and I'll be Sunderland manager next season.
"I know what needs to be done to get back in the Premier League and I know what the requirements are to do that.
"I met with Martin (Bain) and Ellis (Short) this week and we had initial discussions about how we move forward. We will meet again in a few weeks."
Hull know their strong home form is crucial to them staying up and they know they cannot afford to drop any points at the KCOM Stadium.
