Up to 200 people were evacuated from the block in Kensal Town after the fire took hold just before 21:30 BST.
Eight fire crews were sent to the Trellick Tower flat, in Golborne Road, which was completely ablaze.
There have been no reports of any injuries, London Fire Brigade said. The fire is thought to have been started by a discarded cigarette.
Trellick Tower is a Grade II listed building.  It was designed by the architect ErnÅ‘ Goldfinger in what became known as the brutalist style of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
It has appeared in numerous films, television programmes and pop videos.
It was also the inspiration for JG Ballard's dystopian novel High Rise and featured in the Martin's Amis book London Fields.
