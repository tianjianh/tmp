[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 28-year-old man has appeared in court charged with the murder of Londonderry man Paul McCauley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Brian Gillen from Kennedy Place in the Fountain area of the city appeared at Londonderry Magistrate's Court on Friday.
Mr McCauley died nine years after he was attacked at a barbecue in the city in 2006.
Mr Gillen is also charged with grievous bodily harm (GBH) and attempted GBH. He was released on bail.
Opposing bail, a detective told the court: "We believe Mr Gillen is still linked with loyalist paramilitarism and, at the very least, he is a supporter of it.
"This is based on a number of items found during a house search."
He said if released on bail, Mr Gillen could pose a significant risk to witnesses or prevent others from coming forward.
He cautioned that the defendant's personal safety would also be endangered as he had been threatened before. The senior officer also warned there was a risk of the suspect fleeing, as he worked across the UK and Europe.
Mr Gillen's solicitor said the evidence upon which his client was charged was based on audio recordings of the defendant.
"If he is granted bail there are no steps that he can take that would interfere with the integrity of that evidence," he told the court.
"The evidence comes from his own mouth."
The solicitor said Mr Gillen had no previous convictions and there was a presumption of innocence.
The magistrate released the accused on bail of Â£2,000.
He was ordered not to leave Northern Ireland and to report regularly to a police station near his home.
He is due to appear again at the same court on 21 April.
A 61-year-old man, arrested in England on Wednesday, has been charged with withholding information. He will appear in court on 4 May.
A third man arrested this week, aged 27, has been released on bail.
At the time, police believed up to 15 people were involved in the attack.
Paul McCauley suffered serious head injuries in the attack near Chapel Road. He died in a care facility in June 2015.
The following month, Piper John McClements, previously known as Daryl Proctor, was charged with Paul McCauley's murder.
So far 17 arrests have been made by detectives investigating the attack.
