[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Professor of medicinal chemistry at Cardiff University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chris McGuigan, had been a drug developer.
He was also chairman of the Welsh Government's Life Sciences Hub.
A university spokesman said the "exceptionally gifted inventor and chemist" died on Friday.
He added Prof McGuigan had "been at the heart of scientific research for more than 30 years" and his loss would be felt "across the university and the wider scientific community".
Prof McGuigan's research expertise was in discovering and developing new drugs for cancer, HIV, hepatitis B and C, shingles, measles, influenza and central nervous system (CNS) disease.
He invented four new experimental drugs that have entered human clinical trials.
As chairman of the Life Sciences Hub, he helped nurture home-grown companies and attract top international talent to Wales to develop new medicines and technology.
He also directed Life Sciences Research Network Wales, a Â£15m initiative aimed at funding 100 new drug discovery projects.
The university spokesman added: "He had a strong drive to use his scientific ideas for social good, working tirelessly to address medical needs where they were unmet.
"Our thoughts are with his family, friends and close colleagues at this very sad time."
