A woman has become the third person to be arrested and charged with the murder of joiner Jordan MacKay in South Queensferry on Sunday morning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 43-year-old will appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Wednesday.
Jack Mallon, 46, from Winchburgh, and Charlene Wilson, 36, from Kirkliston, appeared separately at the court on petition on Tuesday.
No plea or declaration was made and their cases were continued for further inquiry. Both were remanded in custody.
Meanwhile, Mr MacKay's family have paid tribute to their "handsome, brave boy".
"Our boy, Jordan William MacKay, was a born-and-bred Kirkliston lad, a joiner to-trade, with huge talent," they said.
"Jordan was and will continue to be a huge presence in all our lives forever.
"We, his mum, dad and whole family have sat and thought of how to describe Jordan and we came up with a list of words that help us do that. Handsome, hardworking, loveable, witty, charming, loyal, strong-minded but soft-hearted.
"Jordan was taken from us on 13 July 2014, aged 20. We were not ready to lose our perfect boy and words cannot explain the devastation this mindless act of violence has caused us.
"We, his family, ask for privacy at this time to mourn the loss of our handsome brave boy who hung on strong with all his might to the very bitter end."
