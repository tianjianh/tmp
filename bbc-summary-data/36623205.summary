The 29-year-old man was assaulted while he sat in his red Honda Jazz in Castlemilk at about 18:50 on Thursday.
Four hours later a "petrol bomb"' was thrown at the car as it was being loaded on to a flat-bed removal truck as part of a police investigation.
Detectives said the victim was awaiting surgery for a serious arm injury and the car was completely burnt out.
Det Insp Tom McKean said officers knew this was targeted attack and both incidents were linked.
"There was no attempt to rob the man in his car just to injure him and then to go after his car," he said.
"The attack on the man happened mid-evening and in quite a busy area so I am sure someone will have seen it happen."
He added: "The burning of the car was just before 2300 hours. Castlemilk Road is residential and I have no doubt that this attack on the car would have been witnessed.
"Thankfully, the driver of the removal vehicle was not injured but this must have been a terrifying experience for him.
"Officers are carrying our door-to door- inquiries and reviewing CCTV to trace those responsible."
The victim was sitting in his car outside an Indian takeaway on Castlemilk Road when a man opened the driver's door and attacked him.
His attacker was white, 6ft tall, and of slim build. He was bald and wearing a black T-shirt.
Police said the man who threw the petrol bomb was wearing dark clothing.
