Sky Ballantyne, 12 and sister Kia, 14, will appear on the BBC Two show on Sunday.
They will pitch their gadget Crikey Bikey, a harness to help parents teach children to ride bikes safely.
After winning their Monmouthshire school's inventor competition, they became junior engineers of the year at the Big Bang Fair in Birmingham.
The harness, worn by children learning to ride a bicycle, has a handle on the back for parents to hold on to, putting a stop to bad backs and scraped knees.
Sky had the idea after she saw a dad struggling to teach his child to cycle in the park.
