The double-decker  crashed into a railway bridge in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday.
First Bus said it was the driver's second incident since June but denied reports she had been suspended.
The firm and Greater Manchester Police are currently conducting separate investigations.
A First Bus spokesman said the driver had been "relieved from duty" during its inquiries and Wednesday's incident was currently not a disciplinary matter.
"She suffered shock. On safety grounds we wouldn't expect the driver to get back behind the wheel at the moment. And we wouldn't expect her to work while an investigation is on going," he added.
The firm said she also had "a minor incident involving a scraped mirror" since starting her role in June.
One man suffered a broken jaw and a woman was taken to hospital with serious facial injuries after the vehicle crashed on Milkstone Road shortly before 12:30 BST.
The number 17 bus was about half-a-mile away from its usual route between Manchester and Rochdale.
Twenty-five people were on board and managed to get off the vehicle.
