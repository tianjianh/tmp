Belfast city centre: Plans for 20mph speed limit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to reduce the speed limit in the whole of Belfast city centre to 20 miles per hour have been published by the Department for Regional Development.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The draft legal order was published on the department's website on Wednesday.
There is a 22-day period for the public to object to the proposals.
Depending on objections, it could be made a proper legal order and become enforceable once new 20mph signs are put in place.
