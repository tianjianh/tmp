Bentley was sent from the touchline as his side lost 2-1 at home to Cheltenham in a game for which he was only able to name five substitutes.
The defeat means the Shrimps have won just one of their last eight games in League Two.
"We've got problems in the squad, we've got problems off the field," Bentley, 40, told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"This is the worst it has been - in my opinion the next month is going to be the biggest in the club's history.
"We've got that much going on and there are things that need looking at on and off the field."
Brazilian businessman Diego Lemos bought the Shrimps on 1 September, taking over from Peter McGuigan, but the players were paid late in October because of  "unexpected cash flow problems."
