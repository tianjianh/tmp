A service has been held to remember 35 people who lost their lives when a Steam Packet ship sank near Liverpool more than 100 years ago.

The SS Ellan Vannin's 21 crew and 14 passengers all died when the ship sank in ferocious waters after leaving Ramsey on 3 December 1909.
A service was held at the spot from where the ship set sail.
The names of all of the victims were read out and then wreaths were laid at the Ellan Vannin memorial in Ramsey.
Charles Guard from the Manx Heritage Foundation said it was one of the "worst storms of the century" with waves reaching 25ft (7.62m) after the weather deteriorated during the crossing.
He said the tragedy had an "extraordinary impact" on the Isle of Man.
