[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheffield Hallam student Caroline Everest, from Walkley, had been at the Corporation nightclub on Milton Street.
Her body was found in the Porter Brook on 24 November, two days after she was reported missing by her family.
The coroner, Christopher P Dorries, said "alcohol and hypothermia played a part" in her death, but said "it's clear there was nobody else there".
South Yorkshire Police initially treated her death as murder, but later concluded that nobody else had been involved.

The inquest was told Ms Everest had drunk five "pints of purple", each of which contained shots of vodka, at the Corporation nightclub.
Mr Dorries said if true Ms Everest she would have drunk 30 shots of vodka at the club.
The club manager told the inquest the drink only contained three shots of the spirit.
The inquest also heard from 31-year-old Yousef Tarfasi who was arrested on suspicion of rape in November but subsequently released with no further action.
He confirmed for the first time that he was the person seen in CCTV footage with Ms Everest.
He said he had lied to police about being in the CCTV because he was afraid he would be charged with her murder.
"I was going back home and I ran across her and she was drunk and she was crying," he said.
He added that he held her hand and they walked together to where she told him she lived, at one point getting a taxi which he paid for.
Mr Dorries said the final bit of CCTV footage had shown Ms Everest sitting alone on a wall across the river from where she was found.
Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: "Whilst the exact circumstances of how she came to be in the water are uncertain it was clearly accidental and without third-party involvement.
"It is apparent that alcohol and hypothermia played a part in the circumstances. It's clear that there was nobody else there."
Ms Everest, known as Carrie, was a pupil at Walkley Primary and King Edward VII schools before studying biomedical science at Sheffield Hallam University.
