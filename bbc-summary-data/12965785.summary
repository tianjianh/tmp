[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan is one of the world's deadliest countries for journalists. Intelligence agents and members of banned militant organisations are behind "serious threats" to reporters, says Reporters Without Borders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government uses legal and constitutional powers to curb press freedom and the law on blasphemy has been used against journalists. The broadcasting regulator can halt the carriage of foreign TV channels via cable, particularly Indian or Afghan ones.
Television is the dominant medium, and there are dozens of private channels. Most viewers watch them via cable; there are no private, terrestrially-broadcast stations. State-run Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) is the sole national terrestrial broadcaster.
More than 100 private FM radio stations are licensed. They are not allowed to broadcast their own news.
Scores of unlicensed FM stations are said to operate in the tribal areas of North-West Frontier Province. Usually operated by clerics, some of the outlets are accused of fanning sectarian tension.
Pakistan's press is among the most outspoken in South Asia, but its influence is limited by a low level of literacy.
Nearly 10% of Pakistani citizens use the internet (ITU, 2012). The rapid growth in  mobile phone use is boosting the delivery of online content.
Filtering targets content deemed blasphemous, secessionist, anti-state, or anti-military, OpenNet Initiative reports. The regulator has imposed temporary blocks on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other sites over material it says is "sacrilegious".
Pakistani users active on Twitter include senior politicians and sports and entertainment stars.
