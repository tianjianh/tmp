Peter Mukerjea, the former CEO of Rupert Murdoch's Star India network, was arrested on Thursday night.
Mr Mukerjea and his lawyers are yet to make a statement although in the past he has always said he was innocent.
The murder of Sheena Bora, first thought to be Mr Mukerjea's sister-in-law but later found to be his stepdaughter, has gripped India.
Police have named Indrani Mukerjea, Ms Bora's mother, as the main suspect in the case.
They have also arrested her first husband as a co-conspirator in the murder, as well as her former driver who is listed as an accomplice.
Indian media quoted officials from the country's federal investigation agency as saying that there was enough to indicate that Mr Mukerjea knew of the murder.
The story, involving hidden identities, allegations and counter allegations and arrests has gripped Indian media for weeks now.
The coverage has attracted criticism, with politician Shashi Tharoor calling it "breathless and hysterical".
Speculation grew after Mumbai's police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who was personally investigating the case, was removed from his position.
