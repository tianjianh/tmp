Visitors have also been asked to stay away from wards nine and 10 at Wishaw General Hospital.
Tests are under way to establish the cause of the outbreak.
A spokesman for NHS Lanarkshire said: "Infection prevention and control measures are being taken to reduce the spread of any infection."
He added: "We would like to ask for the co-operation of visitors who can take some simple actions to minimise the impact of norovirus.
"People should not visit hospital if they have symptoms of suspected norovirus and they should wait until they have been clear of symptoms for at least 48 hours as they may still be contagious."
The virus is one of the most common stomach bugs in the UK.
Also known as the winter vomiting bug, it causes diarrhoea and vomiting, usually lasts for 72 hours and is easily spread among people who are already ill.
