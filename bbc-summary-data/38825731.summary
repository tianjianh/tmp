Organisers said due to "other events and road closure requirements across the cities" the 26-mile (42 km) race will not be taking place.
The marathon first launched in 2015 with 6,500 runners, and the date for the 2017 event was set for 22 October.
In a statement on the marathon's website, organisers described the news as "disappointing" for those who were "looking forward" to the event.
