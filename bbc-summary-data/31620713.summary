It also said no apology was necessary for the scheduling of the tournament, which will disrupt a number of leagues.
A Fifa taskforce has recommended the 2022 World Cup take place in winter to avoid Qatar's hot summer temperatures.

"There will be no compensation," said Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke. "There are seven years to reorganise."
Fifa's executive committee will meet in Zurich next month to ratify the taskforce's recommendation.
Valcke also suggested that a 2022 World Cup final on 23 December was looking increasingly likely.
Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore says a final that close to Christmas will cause havoc with the traditional festive club programme, while  Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce wants it played a week earlier.
But Valcke says European governing body Uefa and other confederations are keen on Friday, 23 December, although 18 December is also a possibility.
Valcke also confirmed the 2022 World Cup will be four days shorter as a "concession" to leagues and clubs - 28 days instead of the usual 31 or 32 - and that the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations will move to June from January.
Speaking at a news conference in Doha on Wednesday, Valcke admitted the situation was "not perfect" but added: "Why are we talking about compensation? It's happening once, we're not destroying football.
"Why should we apologise to the clubs? We have had an agreement with the clubs that they are part of the beneficiaries. It was $40m (£26m) in 2010 and $70m (£45m) in 2014. We are bringing all our people to enjoy the sporting and financial results of the World Cup."
Scottish Football Association chief executive Stewart Regan has added his voice to those lamenting the impact a winter World Cup will have on leagues and clubs around the world.
"We will look at the knock-on effects of the decision and how it will affect Scottish football," he said. "Clearly there will be fixture challenges for leagues across the world.
"We have been expecting this decision for some time, but it is going to run late into December and just how close to Christmas it gets is something that needs to be thought through."
The Football League's chief executive Shaun Harvey: "We are disappointed by this recommendation as we could have reasonably expected the tournament to be played at the end of our 2021/22 season given that was the basis upon which the tender process was conducted.
"Clearly, there will be any number of questions to raise with Fifa once the final decision is confirmed so that we can discuss the practical implications with our clubs and other stakeholders in order to keep any fixture disruption to an absolute minimum."
