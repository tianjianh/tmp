[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A policeman who had sex with women while on duty has been found guilty of misconduct in a public office.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Adam Rushton, 37, took advantage of his job as a beat officer in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, to carry out his crimes, his trial was told.
Det Ch Con Nick Baker said: "He has brought shame on himself, his colleagues and Staffordshire Police."
Rushton, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, will be sentenced on 1 May.
He was convicted of five counts of misconduct and another of breaching data protection rules, all dating between 2008 and 2012.
Rushton's conviction relates to four victims he met while working, two of whom he was found guilty of having sex with when on duty.
The jury also found him guilty of intending to have sex with another woman after exchanging "playful and flirty" text messages while on duty.
Prosecutor Duncan Bould said the officer's duties had brought him into contact with "vulnerable and frightened" women, often in "extreme circumstances".
Giving evidence at Birmingham Crown Court, Rushton, who has been with the force for 10 years, said it was "not very professional" to go to one woman's home for oral sex, while separately sleeping with two others.
However, he rejected claims his conduct amounted to criminal misbehaviour.
None of the women are understood to have made any complaints to police.
Det Ch Con Baker said: "I would like to apologise to the victims, witnesses and their families who have suffered as a result of Rushton's actions.
"Their bravery in giving evidence cannot be underestimated. Adam Rushton is a disgrace to the police service."
The Independent Police Complaints Commission praised the Staffordshire Police investigation, but said the case showed there had been "limitations in their supervisory processes".
Rushton was cleared of five counts of misconduct and one data protection breach.
