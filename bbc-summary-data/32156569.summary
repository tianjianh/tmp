[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A top US senator, Bob Menendez, has been charged with corruption.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Democrat from New Jersey is accused of using his influence to illegally benefit a Florida eye doctor, who he admits is a long-time friend.
He is charged with 14 counts including bribery and conspiracy, but insists he did nothing wrong.
Mr Menendez is the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and an outspoken critic of President Obama's policies relating to Iran and Cuba.
The 14 counts include conspiracy and making false statements, as well as eight counts of bribery.
The multi-year investigation first came to light in 2013, when federal authorities raided the office of Dr Salomon Melgan - who was also indicted.
Their investigation focused on whether Mr Menendez used his office to advocate in favour of Dr Melgan including by intervening in a Medicare billing dispute.
Dr Melgan attracted more attention last year when government data revealed that he had received more money from Medicare reimbursements in 2012 than any other doctor in the United States.
He donated large sums of money to Mr Menendez's re-election campaign.
Mr Menendez, 61, has served in the Senate since 2006, and was in the House of Representatives for more than a decade before that.
He is considered one of the most influential Hispanic American lawmakers in Congress, and is the lead author of legislation that would tighten sanctions against Iran.
The senator is expected to make a statement later.
