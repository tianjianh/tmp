While some stars have claimed the pictures are fake, others seem to have confirmed that it is them in the images.
The list of mostly female stars targeted also features names including Rihanna, Kate Upton, Selena Gomez and Kim Kardashian.
Lawrence's agent said her team would be taking legal action.
"This is a flagrant violation of privacy. The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence," her spokesperson told Newsbeat.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who has starred in films including A Good Day to Die Hard, also acknowledged the pictures were of her.
"To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves," she tweeted.
"Knowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this. Feeling for everyone who got hacked."
She later announced that she was going on "an internet break" because of the trolling she had received.
"Great day for the block button," she added.
Former Nickelodeon star and singer Victoria Justice said the images claiming to show her naked were not real.
A spokesperson for musician Ariana Grande told BuzzFeed that the images said to be of her, were "completely fake."
The list of celebrities who have supposedly been hacked is extensive and features other names including Avril Lavigne, Cara Delevingne, Jenny McCarthy and Kaley Cuoco.
Glee star, Becca Tobin also acknowledged her inclusion on the list with a jokey tweet saying, "Merry XXXmas".
Hilary Duff, Amber Heard, Hayden Panettiere and Kate Bosworth also appear.
A number of the stars on the list have trended on Twitter after the photos were shared online.
Newsbeat is waiting for confirmation from the social media site about whether accounts found to be sharing the images are being suspended.
Apple has yet to comment about claims that the person who stole the images obtained them by hacking into iCloud, the remote storage service.
The images were posted on forum site 4chan and included images of more than 100 stars.
Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton apologised after posting a number of images online.
