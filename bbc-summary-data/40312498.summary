[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Ruddy, 32, was murdered and secretly buried in France in 1985 by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).
His remains were uncovered at a site in a forest at Pont-de-l'Arche outside Rouen in northern France in May.
Mourners gathered at St Catherine's Dominican Chapel for the Requiem Mass to pay their respects.
The burial took place in Monks Hill cemetery in Newry.
The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during Northern Ireland's Troubles.

In his homily, Bishop John McAreavey said: "Whatever about the circumstances of Seamus' death, one thing is certain - his death represented the snuffing-out of a life that had many wholesome qualities.
"It also cut off the promise of a new life in France."
He added that Mr Ruddy's family were now able to say "a personal and dignified farewell to him", and "in the months and years ahead they will be able to visit the grave where Seamus lies".
New information given to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR) prompted a fresh search for Mr Ruddy's remains.
It is understood that the information came from the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP), which has close links to the INLA.
There had been three previous searches in the area, the latest of which was in 2008.
Of the 16 Disappeared victims, three have still not been found.
They are Columba McVeigh, Joe Lynskey and Army Capt Robert Nairac.
