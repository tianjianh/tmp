A mechanic became trapped in a car in Cambridgeshire when "thousands" of bees swarmed around it.

MOT tester Sean Reddington was driving the car into a workshop on Ivatt Way, Peterborough, when it was surrounded for about 10 minutes.
Elsewhere, Woodston Ponds nature reserve in the city has been shut until Monday because a swarm of honey bees has settled in a tree.
It is not known if the two reported swarms are connected.
Mr Reddington, who saw the first swarm on Thursday, said: "At first there were just a couple of bees, then suddenly there were thousands.
"I made sure the car's air vents were closed. I don't mind bees - just not that many bees."
He said the swarm moved on but he did not know to where.
Since then, the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire has closed its Woodston Ponds nature reserve on Wharf Road.
A spokesman said a swarm of honey bees arrived at about 11:00 BST and settled in a tree.
The site was closed for public safety reasons and to ensure the bees were not disturbed before they could be safely removed.
The British Beekeepers Association said bees can swarm when a hive is full and some leave to form a new colony.
A swarm contains a queen bee and up to 20,000 worker bees.
The swarming season is from April to July but the peak is from early May to mid June.
Swarms are not dangerous unless disturbed or aggravated - for example if sprayed with water, the association said.
