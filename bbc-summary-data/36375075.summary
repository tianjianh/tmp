[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Opener Daniel Bell-Drummond unbeaten 80 steered Kent to a seven-wicket away victory over Derbyshire.

The hosts resumed on 9-3 and Wayne Madsen (37) and Neil Broom (18) steadied the ship with a stand of 45.
But Calum Haggett (4-15) and James Tredwell (4-45) then ran through them as they were all out for 94.
Kent eased to 176-3, led by Bell-Drummond, as Alex Blake wrapped up the win with three sixes off spinner Matt Critchley, the only balls he faced.
Bell-Drummond put on 54 with Adam Ball (23) and 52 with Sam Northeast (30), and a hit a six off Chesney Hughes as well as 10 fours in his 99-ball innings.
One ball after Sam Northeast fell for a 34-ball 30, Bell-Drummond smashed Chesney Hughes for six to leave Kent needing 17 to win.
And Alex Blake (18 not out) needed only three balls to do it, hitting three successive maximums off Matt Critchley.
It was Kent's second Championship victory of the season, while Derbyshire, who drew their first five games, are still looking for their first win of the Division Two campaign.
