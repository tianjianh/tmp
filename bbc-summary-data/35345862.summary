Hammer and axe victim in Wishaw was 'not intended target'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was attacked in his home in Lanarkshire with a hammer and an axe was the victim of mistaken identity, police believe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old was assaulted by three men who burst into his house in Rannoch Drive at about 03:15 on Saturday.
He was treated in hospital for his injuries and later released. The attackers fled in a black car.
Police Scotland said the victim was not believed to have been the intended target for the assault.
Det Con Graham McAdam added: "I do not believe that this was a random attack however I think that the 33-year-old man was not the intended target and that he was the victim of mistaken identity.
"I urge anyone who has any information that could assist our enquiries to contact Wishaw CID immediately via 101. Alternatively calls can be made via Crimestoppers where anonymity can be maintained."
