Andy Murray will miss Great Britain's Davis Cup quarter-final against France next month as he recovers from an elbow injury.

Murray, 29, pulled out of the Miami Open almost a week before his opening match because of the problem.
GB captain Leon Smith conceded it was "a big loss to our team" to be without the world number one.
Dan Evans, Kyle Edmund, Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot will line up for Britain in Rouen from 7-9 April.
Andy Murray is resting his elbow injury for a second consecutive week and no decision has yet been taken about when he will return to the practice courts.
His next scheduled tournament - in Monte Carlo - starts in three weeks.
"Most importantly we all wish him well for a speedy recovery back to full health and fitness," said Smith.
"I know that he would really want to be here with the rest of the team."
There is no place in the France team for three of their top four players, with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils and Richard Gasquet not selected by captain Yannick Noah.
World number 22 Gasquet is recovering from appendix surgery, Monfils has had a knee injury, and world number 10 Tsonga is lacking match practice after recently becoming a father.
Monfils, ranked 11th in the world, is named as a reserve and could still be drafted into the team between now and next Thursday's draw.
"According to Gael's doctor and to his physiotherapist, he could start working again by the end of the week," said Noah.
Lucas Pouille, at 16th, is the highest-ranked player in Noah's squad, with Gilles Simon, Nicolas Mahut and Pierre Hugues Herbert also selected.
"France are certainly the nation with best strength in depth," GB captain Smith told BBC Radio 5 live. "It's certainly a big challenge. It should be a competitive tie.
"They are missing their top players. But doubles-wise, they've got arguably the strongest team in the world. Singles-wise, Lucas Pouille and Gilles Simon, are both top 25 in the world, so it's certainly a difficult tie."
The tie will be played indoors on clay at the Kindarena, and Britain will rely on the same squad that overcame Canada in the first round, when the younger of the Murray brothers was also absent.
"In Dan and Kyle we have two top-50 singles players who are improving all the time on the tour and both with games capable of upsetting higher-ranked opponents," added Smith.
"Jamie and Dom once again combine as our doubles team and will draw much confidence after performing so well recently to win key rubbers against Serbia and Canada.
"This is a team with significant Davis Cup experience and these guys have all stepped up and delivered performances at the very top of the competition."

There was no Murray in Canada for the first-round tie, and Britain still won, but this French side has six top-50 players to choose from - plus the world doubles number one Nicolas Mahut.
Edmund and Evans are also in the top 50, but Evans has not contested a tournament on clay since May 2015.
