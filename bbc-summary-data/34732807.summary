Mixed success for Welsh government enterprise zones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Only seven jobs each have been created at two of the Welsh government's enterprise zones in the last year.

More than a thousand jobs were created at the Cardiff and Deeside zones but just seven each at Ebbw Vale and St Athan, showing a "mixed success rate".
The seven zones were set up by the Welsh government to provide business support including financial help.
A spokesman said progress had been made but each zone was unique, and like-for-like comparisons were "unhelpful".
The figures show a mixed picture.
More than Â£70m has been spent on enterprise zones since 2011.
The Welsh government, supported by the chairs of the enterprise zones, initially refused to release figures for the number of jobs created at each one.
The Information Commissioner supported Plaid Cymru's challenge to that position and ordered ministers to make the details public.
The latest figures show jobs created in the 2014-15 financial year.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We have always said that any like-for-like comparisons between the seven enterprise zones are unhelpful and misrepresent the local economic conditions and priorities within each unique zone.
"From the start, we expected each zone to have its own timetable and objectives, but good progress has been made in the zones and all have met individual key performance indicator targets."
Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru AM for Ynys Mon and a member of the assembly's enterprise and business committee, said better performers like Deeside might be expected to do well anyway.
"We've been demanding this data not to name and shame those not doing particularly well but to highlight where the focus is needed," he said.
"Enterprise zones have to be more than just a name; they have to be places which deliver growth and secure jobs."
