Union protests in Aberdeen over Northern Isles ship 'poverty pay'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RMT union has protested in Aberdeen against what it claimed was "poverty pay" on a Northern Isles cargo vessel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union said MV Daroja workers were paid Â£2.56 per hour on freight routes between Aberdeen and Orkney and Shetland in January.
The RMT said the situation was a "disgrace" and called for action.
Streamline Shipping said it had been assured that terms and conditions offered were "entirely compatible" with all legislation.
The company said MV Daroja was "fully EU compliant".
