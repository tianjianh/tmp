Firefighters have now managed to extinguish the flames, the Rossiya 24 TV news channel reports.
They were helped by water-bombing aircraft. Five cases of alleged criminal negligence have been opened.
At least 5,000 people have fled to emergency accommodation.
Authorities in the Khakassia republic - part of the Russian Federation - have decided to ban alcohol sales while the state of emergency continues in the region.
