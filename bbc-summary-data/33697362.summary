[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evans, 27, has been training with Pompey since leaving Fleetwood Town at the end of the 2014-15 season, having scored 12 goals in 106 appearances for the League One club.
"The aim is promotion - it's as simple as that," the former Macclesfield and Bradford man told the club website.
"It's an honour to be at this club, but I've come here for success and I'm confident we are capable of that."
Evans was offered a contract by Fleetwood at the end of last season but decided to leave Highbury.
