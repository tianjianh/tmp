Police look for victim after serious assault in Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are keen to trace a man who suffered head injuries following a serious assault at a house in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were called to a disturbance at Penicuik Way in Carntyne at about 04:00 on Sunday.
It was reported that a man in his mid 20s to early 30s suffered head injuries but left in a taxi and did not contact emergency services.
The man was described as white, of a slim build, about 5ft 6in tall with short dark hair.
He was wearing a black leather jacket and dark jeans.
The driver of the taxi confirmed that the man was dropped off in Kinsail Drive, Penilee. Door-to-door inquiries in the area have so far been unsuccessful.
Officers want to speak to him to make sure he is safe and well and does not require medical attention.
Det Con Jennifer Carey said: "We are in the process of establishing the circumstances of what has happened in the house where the disturbance took place.
"We are making every effort to try and trace the injured man and I'm appealing for him to contact us so that we can be assured he is all right."
