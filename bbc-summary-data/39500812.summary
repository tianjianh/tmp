[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby County manager Gary Rowett has demanded a defensive improvement from his side despite an impressive victory over high-flying Fulham.

The 4-2 win over the Londoners kept alive hopes of a play-off place and means the Rams have seven points from nine since Rowett's appointment.
Derby are seven points adrift of the top six with six games remaining.
"When we are out of possession of the ball, we have to be better," 43-year-old Rowett told BBC Radio Derby.
"Our forward players will hurt any team and that is why our defensive structure is even more important."
Derby's win on Tuesday cut the gap to Fulham to five points.
Sheffield Wednesday are still seven points clear in the final play-off spot, but must play both Derby and Fulham before the end of the season.
Rowett said the players are responding well to the changes he has made but said they must work harder in the six-game run-in.
"We have to be far more aggressive and intense in the way we defend," he added.
"If we can get that right more consistently then we have the quality to win games against any team."
