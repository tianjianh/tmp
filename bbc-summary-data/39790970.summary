Police arrested Ms Nassib in February when she returned to the UK.
It followed an inquiry into claims the 48-year-old had died off the coast of mainland Tanzania.
The alleged fraud was carried out between March and December last year.
Ms Nassib, 48, Mr Kasim, and Mr Abdullah, 24, all of Lower Rushall Street, Walsall, did not enter pleas.
