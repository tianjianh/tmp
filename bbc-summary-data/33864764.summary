[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Europe's largest' sheep sale held at Lairg

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What has been described as Europe's largest one day sale of hill sheep has been taking place in Sutherland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 17,000 animals, mostly ewes and lambs, were booked for the auction at Lairg.
George Milne, of the National Sheep Association, said he hoped that this year's bad weather will not have affected prices.
He said the annual sale was a "fantastic spectacle to see of lambs straight off the hill".
