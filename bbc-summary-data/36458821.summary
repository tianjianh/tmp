Hughes, 24, has agreed a two-year deal after rejecting an offer from the Welsh side, for whom he played 151 games.
Tafazolli, also 24, was also offered a new contract at his previous club, for whom he appeared 118 times, and signed a three-year deal at League One Posh.
Meanwhile, former Derby coach Lee Glover has been named as Grant McCann's assistant manager.
Ben Mackenzie has been appointed as head of sport science at the ABAX Stadium.
Hughes and Tafazolli are Peterborough's second and third signings under McCann, with the latter joining despite reported interest from Sheffield United.
Tafazolli told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "There was a lot of interest, but coming from a League Two side I knew the most important thing for me this season was to go to a club where the manager wants me, I've got a good chance of playing and the club will be pushing for promotion.
"It ticked all the boxes for me and it was a no-brainer. Someone used the analogy of football being like a game of snakes and ladders. You can get on a big ladder (and go up) and get on a snake and come back down again.
"It's all about stepping stones and I think this is the perfect one for me."
