[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warren Joyce earned his first point as Wigan manager as the Latics defended well to draw with Barnsley.

Barnsley's Sam Winnall headed narrowly wide before Marley Watkins forced Wigan goalkeeper Adam Bogdan into a save.
Yanic Wildschut wasted Wigan's best chance when he scuffed a shot straight at goalkeeper Adam Davies.
Adam Hammill and Conor Hourihane had chances for the hosts, but Wigan kept out their opponents to claim a draw, which saw them drop a place to 23rd.
Joyce suffered a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Reading in his opening game, but despite a better showing from his side against the Tykes, they dropped a place after Blackburn's 3-2 win over Brentford.
The result was Barnsley's third consecutive draw and the second game in a row in which they have failed to score.
Winnall, Watkins, Hammill and Hourihane all came close, while Adam Armstrong also had a header ruled out for offside in the second half.
The hosts nearly won it in injury time, but substitute goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen dealt with Hourihane's effort after David Perkins did well to block Hammill's shot.
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom: "My only sort of criticism would be that we didn't work the keeper enough today.
"I thought we controlled the game from start to finish and we're disappointed we didn't get the three points there, definitely. Today showed how far as a club we've come, against a team that came up with us and romped our league.
"Their set-up and line-up, playing without a striker, a centre-midfielder at right midfield and the first sub is a left-back, so that shows that they came here paying us the utmost respect, trying to nullify us, which they did."
Wigan manager Warren Joyce: "I thought we did deserve the point. The way we defended, the way the lads put their bodies on the line second half, I thought it would be a travesty if we didn't get something out of the game.
"I think if you take out the first three minutes from Reading, it wasn't too dissimilar from a lot of things that happened today.
"It's a really tough place to come here, I've been here watching a lot of games. You know how good the crowd is here, what type of football they play, so we knew it was going to be tough today so I'm pleased."
