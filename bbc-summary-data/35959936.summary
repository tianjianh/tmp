Ballymena took the lead in the 31st minute  when defender Johnny Taylor netted from close-range when Tony Kane's ball fell in the goalmouth.
Home skipper Ciaran Martyn equalised from just a few yards out after Dave Elebert had headed down a corner.
Glenavon stay in third but Cliftonville are now just two points behind them.
The Lurgan side go to Cliftonville on Saturday and will have striker Eoin Bradley back after a six-match suspension.
Since former Linfield boss Jeffrey took over, Ballymena have had one win and three draws.
Ballymena manager David Jeffrey: "A draw was probably a fair result.
"Glenavon started very brightly and we needed a little bit of fortune and had to defend well.
"We played our way into the game and got that goal. Glenavon came out all guns blazing in the second half and scored their equaliser.
"Our players put in a lot of effort and there were some tired legs out there."
Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton: "I am disappointed the players did not get the win which their efforts deserved.
"We started brightly and I felt if we did not get a goal while dominating so much we might live to regret it.
"But you have to give credit to the other team. They battled really well."
