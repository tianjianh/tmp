The men were arrested across south Birmingham and at an address in Liverpool, West Midlands Police said.
They have been charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs and are due before Birmingham magistrates later.
The raids are part of an operation between police and the Prison Service targeting the supply of cocaine between organised crime groups in the cities.
Eight other people were arrested across south Birmingham last week in connection with the operation, the force said.
Three women and four men were charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs and will appear at the same court on Thursday 4 June.
One man was released on bail pending further enquiries.
Officers recovered large amounts of cash, cannabis and various weapons from the addresses, a spokesman said.
