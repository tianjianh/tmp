"I have good news and bad news. First the bad news, the cancer came back and it is a real pain in the butt," the 77-year-old comedian tweeted.
"The good news is I now have to use more marijuana to treat the cancer."
Chong said he would report back on his progress on his Chong and Chong podcast. "Please wish me luck while I kick cancer's behind," he wrote.
Chong came to public attention alongside comedy partner Cheech Marin in 1971, with the comedy album Cheech and Chong.
Their subsequent films Up in Smoke and Nice Dreams epitomised the pot-smoking culture of the 1970s.
After breaking up in the late 1980s, the duo reunited decades later for a comedy tour, Cheech & Chong: Light Up America.
Cheech Marin tweeted: "Join me in praying for my partner @TommyChong to have a quick recovery and enjoy many more years of good health."
'Waiting room'
"I'm using cannabis like crazy now, more so than ever before," Chong told Us Weekly this week, following his rectal cancer diagnosis.
"I'm in treatment now. Either I get healed or I don't. But either way, I'm going to make sure I get a little edge off or put up."
Chong was diagnosed with prostate cancer three years ago, and cited marijuana as a key player in his recovery.
In 2012, Chong - who is a passionate advocate of the decriminalisation of marijuana, told CNN he believed his cancer had nothing to do with smoking marijuana, adding, "Cannabis is a cure."
Writing on Twitter on Wednesday, he said he was "sitting in a waiting room... waiting".
"Thank you for your love and support, now excuse me while I medicate and meditate," he tweeted.
