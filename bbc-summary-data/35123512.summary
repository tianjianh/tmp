Premier League predictions: Lawro v Guy Mowbray

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is BBC Match of the Day commentator Guy Mowbray.
Mowbray has predicted five draws on a tight Bank Holiday Monday but has backed Manchester City to beat title rivals Leicester.
Lawro is also up against a state-of-the-art super-computer called SAM (Sports Analytics Machine) for the second week running.
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
On Boxing Day SAM predicted three correct results, plus two perfect scores, to register an impressive 110 points - equal top on the guest leaderboard!
SAM - built by Professor Ian McHale, Dr Georgi Boshnakov and Tarak Kharrat from the Centre for Sports Business at the University of Salford - pipped Lawro, who picked four correct results and one perfect score to score 80 points.
Who will come out on top this time around? Is man better than machine? Is anyone better than a commentator?
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
