Speaking after the funeral, Alex Kaye, of transgender support group SafeT, said: "It's a tragedy that shouldn't have happened.
"It's unjust and it's an unbelievable time for people who knew Vikki.
"It signifies a time for change, a very important change that has to happen."
Ms Thompson's death prompted calls for a shake-up of the way transgender prisoners are handled by authorities.
Justice Department minister Lord Faulks said the policy regarding transgender prisoners was currently under review.
A post-mortem examination found the cause of Ms Thompson's death was thought to be hanging.
