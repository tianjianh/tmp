Well that's exactly what this new baby prince from Bhutan, a tiny mountain country in the Himalayas, received.
Tens of thousands of people turned up to help celebrate Prince Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck's birth by planting 108,000 tree saplings.
Bhutanese people take nature conservation very seriously and by law 60 percent of the country must always be under forest cover.
Many of the people who live in the country are Buddhists, and in Buddhism trees are symbols of long life, health, beauty and compassion.
Dasho Karma Raydi, who was among the volunteers taking care off the trees said: "We are now nurturing the plants as if we are nurturing the little prince''.
This isn't the first epic tree-planting session that Bhutan has taken part in. In 2015 the country set a Guinness World Record by planting almost 50,000 trees in just one hour.
