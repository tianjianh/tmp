An area of Brussels will be named after the late MP Jo Cox in a tribute to the politician who was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency in June.

The 41-year-old has been included on a list of "illustrious women" whose names will be used for squares, streets and buildings to "feminise" the city.
She was shot and stabbed outside a constituency surgery in Birstall.
Twenty-six women have been named on the list including artists, sportswomen and scientists who have links to the city.
The City of Brussels said it had been "overwhelmed" by the Labour MP's death and wanted to "pay tribute" to the mother-of-two after she had lived and worked in the city for several years.
First Alderman Alain Courtois from the City of Brussels said the project was about "highlighting the great ladies who have marked our history" and "rebalancing" the sexes to "relegate the image of the macho to the closet".
Joanna Maycock, secretary general of the European Women's Lobby, said: "Jo was a very close friend and exactly the kind of person that we want to see in politics.
"[She was] an extraordinary, brilliant and fearless feminist, motivated by a passion for women's rights and social justice, and supported by the belief that we can and must struggle for a safer, fairer and more secure world."
Thomas Mair, 53, from Birstall, is currently being tried for Mrs Cox's murder at the Old Bailey. He denies the charge.
