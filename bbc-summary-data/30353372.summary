Charlotte Bevan left St Michael's Hospital in Bristol with four-day-old Zaani Tiana Bevan Malbrouck on Tuesday, sparking a major police search.
Ms Bevan's body was found on Avon Gorge on Wednesday night, before Zaani's body was found nearby on Thursday afternoon.
The hospital has launched a review into the circumstances of her disappearance.
The body of Ms Bevan was found after a member of the public, walking on a cliff-top path, spotted the white hospital slippers she was wearing when she left the hospital, along with a multicoloured-blanket on the gorge edge, on Wednesday.
Her daughter's body was found close to where Ms Bevan had been discovered.
