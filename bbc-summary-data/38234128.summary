Bonnyrigg Rose chairman Charlie Kirkwood hopes the club can play their Scottish Cup fourth-round tie against Hibernian at the home of Hearts.

The Junior club beat Championship side Dumbarton 1-0 in a third-round replay but it is "unlikely" their New Dundas Park home can host cup holders Hibs.
Kirkwood, who spoke to Hearts before the replay, said "three quarters of the team" support the Tynecastle club.
"They're buzzing at the thought of playing at their holy ground," he said.
"[Hearts owner] Ann Budge is going to phone me today sometime to arrange a meeting.
"She said we could get round the table and see what they could do and last night I got a text from Ann saying what a great result it was for the team.
"It's pencilled in for 21 January but there is a lot of talking to be done yet. There is no way it could be at Bonnyrigg."
The Midlothian club's New Dundas Park is roughly 10 miles from Hibs' Easter Road, and many Bonnyrigg fans also support either Hearts or Hibs.
The junior club qualified for this season's Scottish Cup by being East Super League champions last term.
Kirkwood has been associated with the Rosey Posey for over 50 years, and was kit boy when they won the Scottish Junior Cup in 1966.
He has been chairman for the past seven years and believes Tuesday's achievement was his best moment yet.
Adam Nelson scored the game's only goal after 86 minutes of the replay after the first meeting finished goalless.
"It was a great night for the club and the town so everybody's buzzing," Kirkwood told BBC Scotland.
"I had 50 text messages when I came out of the ground last night. They are the nights that make all the hard work that we put in all worthwhile.
"The players had something to eat then they realised there was a bar open selling a carry out so you can imagine what came back on the bus.
Kirkwood now plans to arrange a meeting to maximise the availability of Bonnyrigg Rose merchandise.
"There's a huge interest in the club," he said. "The merchandise the last couple of weeks has gone crazy - yesterday I had people phoning me for scarves."
"We've got a wee shop and a local guy - Ian Sprott - sells the merchandise. Every week he's handing in a couple of hundred pounds."
