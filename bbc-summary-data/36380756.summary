Mr Jones, who said he had a "positive and constructive" meeting, said: "They have emphasised they want to deal with this as quickly as possible. From their perspective I understand that.
"There's no date yet in terms of when this will be finalised. But [it is] hugely important that the bids are assessed in some detail before a decision is taken."
He said Tata did not tell him who might be a preferred bidder.
