The cards, written in the 1930s and addressed to fan Nellie Browning of Banbury, Oxfordshire, featured pictures of Blyton and her dog Bobs.
The were sold at Elliotts UK Auctioneers in Dorset, where many of the novelist's books, including the Famous Five series, were set.
Elliott's said the postcards showed "an interesting insight into the author".
Two of the cards bore the same picture of Blyton and Bobs outside the author's home in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire.
The other featured the fox terrier, which inspired many of the author's books, with a bird.
On one of the cards Blyton offered comfort to Miss Browning following the death of her dog.
In another, she thanked the fan for a Christmas card and calendar gift, before signing off: "Bobs send 22 licks for the pigs."
She also talked about letters she wrote from Bobs for the magazine Teachers' World being made into a book.
The author also had another fox terrier called Sandy.
Six hundred million copies of Blyton's books have sold worldwide, and they have been translated into 90 languages.
She produced more than 700 books in her career, writing one a week at her peak.
In 2008, Blyton was voted the UK's best loved writer, beating JK Rowling, Jane Austen and Shakespeare.
Her works include the Noddy, Secret Seven and Adventure series of books.
