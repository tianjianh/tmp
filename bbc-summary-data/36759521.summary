The AS Vita Club player produced a positive test during the 2016 African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Rwanda.
Caf confirmed the 28-year-old was being sanctioned after testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine following DR Congo's group match against Angola in January.
DR Congo went on to win the 2016 CHAN.
The South African futsal player Bryan Cottle has also been banned for two years after testing positive for the banned drug methylhexaneamine following the 2016 Futsal Afcon match against Zambia.
The suspensions were amongst a raft of measures announced on Sunday by Caf following the meeting of its disciplinary board on 3 July at its headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.
Caf also confirmed that the vice-president of Equatorial Guinea's Football Federation, Gustavo N'dong Edu, has been banned from football for two years and ordered to pay a fine of US $25,000 after being found guilty of attempting to bribe match referees in the Women's Afcon 2016 qualifier against Mali.
Elsewhere the Al Merreikh official Hatem Ahmed has been suspended for two years from all football activities after being found guilty of punching the referee during an African Confederation Cup match against Kawkab Athletic.
A number of sanctions were announced following that match, including a six-month football ban for Merreikh player Alaa Eldin Youssef who was found guilty of kicking a photographer.
Merreikh were also fined US $45,000.
Algerian club Entente Setif have been further sanctioned following the crowd trouble which marred their Champions League match against Mamelodi Sundowns.
Setif were disqualified from the competition after violence broke out in the stands.
Caf's disciplinary board has fined Setif US $45,000 and ordered the club to play their next two Caf matches behind closed doors.
Tunisian club Etoile du Sahel have been punished after missiles and flares were thrown from the crowd during their Champions League match against Enyimba.
The trouble prevented Enyimba's team and officials from reaching the dressing-rooms at half-time.
Etoile have been ordered to pay US $45,000 and play two Caf matches behind closed doors of which one is suspended.
