The massive crater is filled with household items and vehicles.
The hole is just four miles from the Arena das Dunas stadium, which is set to host the Group D match between Italy and Uruguay on Tuesday.
It opened up earlier this week after a record amount of rainfall fell and has continued to grow since.
