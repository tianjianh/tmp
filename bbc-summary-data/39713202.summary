California beauty queen, 27, jailed for child porn

A former US beauty queen has admitted possessing child pornography and lewd acts with a child.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Meghan Alt, 27, was sentenced to 300 days in jail and three years of probation after entering the pleas.
She was arrested in 2015 on charges of selling images she took of a four-year-old female relative to a Marine stationed in southern California.
In 2014 the mother-of-three won California's Mrs Orange County beauty pageant.
She was also a contestant in the Mrs California contest that same year.
When she learned her fate last Friday, Alt was also ordered to carry out 15 days of community service and complete a treatment programme for child abusers, court records show.
