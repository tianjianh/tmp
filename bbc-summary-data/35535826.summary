The Dragons have lost their first two games of the campaign and such a heavy home defeat early in the season will be a concern, with much of their success in recent years being based on a formidable home record.
Hull top the table ahead of Wigan, with both sides starting the campaign with two victories.
Former England international Ellis was making his first appearance for the Black and Whites since July after recovering from a serious Achilles injury.
