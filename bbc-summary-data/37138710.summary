[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town 1-0 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grant Ward's half-volley in the opening half was enough to earn Ipswich victory over Preston at Portman Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After Kevin Bru's free-kick was only partially cleared, Ward controlled the ball before firing it in the corner.
Jermaine Beckford was forced off with concussion, but the visitors nearly drew level as Callum Robinson's shot was tipped over by Bartosz Bialkowski.
Liam Grimshaw volleyed wide late on as Ipswich hung on for a first league win since the opening day of the season.
Ward's impressive strike came moments after Beckford was taken off in the 15th minute, and Freddie Sears then saw a goal-bound effort deflected just past Anders Lindegaard's upright as the hosts looked to double their lead.
However as the visitors grew in confidence Eoin Doyle almost reached Chris Humphrey's long throw, but Tommy Smith just blocked off the forward from reaching the ball.
Former Tottenham forward Ward had another opportunity to double Ipswich's tally after Jonas Knudsen laid the ball off to him in the box, but he could only send his first-time shot high and wide.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"I thought we were excellent today. We played really well in the first half and then we stood up to a right scrap in the second half - it was a real bloke's performance.
"Daryl Murphy put in a transfer request and my view is you don't stand in the way of someone who wants to leave.
"It is great move for him and he has been terrific for us so I wish him well. It is a great bit of business for the club and we will reinvest and get other players in."
Preston manager Simon Grayson:
"I am disappointed as you know when you come to Portman Road and play against a Mick McCarthy side, you have to compete and battle.
"We lost too many individual battles and not enough players played to the standard that I know they are capable of.
"There was not a great deal in the game but we didn't do enough, on or off the ball, to get anything out of it.
"I am hoping to strengthen. I have given a list of names to the owner and I am hoping to tick some people off. It is going to be a crazy three or four days through all the divisions."
