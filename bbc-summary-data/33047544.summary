Eritrea ruled by fear, not law, UN says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eritrea's government may have committed crimes against humanity, including a shoot-to-kill policy on its borders, a UN investigation says.

The government has created a climate in which extrajudicial killings, sexual slavery and enforced labour are all allowed to occur, its report says.
The situation has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to flee the country, the UN says.
Eritrea declined to take part in the investigation, the UN says.
President Isaias Afewerki has governed the east African nation for 22 years.
The country has never held elections since gaining independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
After a year-long investigation, the UN commission of inquiry said that Eritrea operates a vast spying and detention network, holding people without trial for years, including children.
Neighbours and family members are often drafted to inform on each other, according to the report.
"It is not law that rules Eritreans - but fear," it says.
The inquiry said that "systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations have been and are being committed in Eritrea under the authority of the Government".
The investigators are to present their findings to the UN Human Rights Council on 23 June.
Eritreans account for the second-largest group of migrants crossing the Mediterranean, after Syrians.
