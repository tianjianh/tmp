The incident happened in Lime Grove, in the Craigshill area of Livingston, at about 21:30 on Wednesday.
The thief got into the white Peugeot 208 but was unable to drive off because the passenger had managed to remove the keys from the ignition before running off.
The thief then chased the passenger in a bid to take the keys from him.
After failing to get the keys, the suspect returned to the car and tried to push it away, before eventually giving up.
He was last seen heading in the direction of Craigshill East Road.
Police are appealing for witnesses.
The man was white, aged about 19 and was about 5ft 6in tall.
He was wearing a grey hooded tracksuit with the hood up, partially covering his face, grey tracksuit bottoms and dark-coloured Adidas trainers.
Det Con Iain Duncan, of Police Scotland, said: "Although the victim was not seriously injured the brazen nature of this crime is quite remarkable.
"We are pursuing various lines of inquiry including a review of the local CCTV network and carrying out door-to-door inquiries.
"However, I'm now appealing to anyone in the local community who can help identify the suspect to come forward.
"I'd also be interested to hear from anyone who was in the Craigshill area of Livingston on Wednesday night and who noticed any suspicious behaviour."
