Team GB's Heather Stanning and Helen Glover were due to compete in one of 10 events beginning at 12:30 BST.
However, bad weather delayed the start by two hours before the rowing was eventually called off.
All of the races will now take place on Monday, where Glover and Stanning will begin their defence of their pairs title from 16:30 BST.
The weather caused problems on Saturday for Serbs Milos Vasic and Nenad Bedik, who capsized during their men's semi-final.
Play was also delayed on the outside tennis courts because of the wind, while the start of the canoe slalom event was delayed by one hour.
Alistair Magowan, BBC Sport: "Whether it was fans, rowers or Great Britain rowing performance director Sir David Tanner, everyone agreed that postponing events at Lagoa on Sunday was the right decision.
"At first, the wind speed wasn't too dissimilar to Saturday, which saw a bumpy day's competition result in a crew from Serbia capsizing, but soon after the regatta was called off the wind really increased to a level where it wasn't good for running around the lagoon let alone rowing on it.
"The hope is that time can be made up from Monday, and there is an extra day built into the schedule for circumstances such as this. But if organisers lose a second day, a revised schedule could mean crews rowing twice in one day."
