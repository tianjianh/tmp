Stagecoach West wants to hire a Zumba instructor to run "mini workouts" at the station for bus drivers, people waiting for buses and local workers.
Charlotte Potter, from the firm, said: "It will be once a month to start off, then maybe every week or twice a week."
Depending on the level of interest, the firm is hoping to introduce Zumba Wednesdays this summer.
Zumba is a Latin dance-inspired fitness programme created in Colombia that has become a global fitness craze.
"It was something we came up with in the office and we thought 'Well, everyone loves Zumba' and it's great for people of all abilities and ages," said Ms Potter.
"People can come along and join in for five or 10 minutes while they're waiting for their bus.
"It's an opportunity for people to let their hair down and have a bit of fun."
The bus and coach operator said it had already received emails from people saying "they'd be up for it".
But it said it wanted to gauge interest before introducing Zumba Wednesdays "throughout the region".
