Joe Allen put the Reds in front as he guided in a Christian Benteke knock-down after Philippe Coutinho's cross.
Roberto Firmino added a second when he drove in a shot keeper Heurelho Gomes should probably have saved.
Watford's most promising chances fell to Odion Ighalo but he failed to capitalise, with his best effort seeing him shoot into the side-netting.
Relive Liverpool's win over Watford
Reds boss Jurgen Klopp made eight changes from the Europa League semi-final win over Villarreal on Thursday and, unlike in the defeat at Swansea after the first leg, his support cast showed their promise.
Midfielder Kevin Stewart, 22, impressed with his work-rate and 18-year-old Sheyi Ojo produced some neat touches on the right wing as he also played a part in the build-up to Firmino's goal.
Cameron Brannagan, 19, came on and provided a chance for Christian Benteke, who failed to make proper contact with his far-post header.
"I'm really pleased for the young lads," said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.
"In another situation you don't get these opportunities but we can give them. It's good for all of them."
Wasteful Watford
There are question marks over the future of Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores and his side could have helped his cause had they taken some of their chances at Anfield.
Ighalo was the main culprit as he showed the lack of confidence of a striker without a league goal since 23 January.
The Hornets forward was twice well-placed in the first half but was dispossessed by Alberto Moreno and Martin Skrtel. When he did get in a shot after a neat bit of skill to sidestep Moreno, it was saved by keeper Simon Mignolet.
"In the first half, we created chances and didn't take them," said Watford midfielder Ben Watson. "We came out second half and gave it a real go, and were unlucky not to get anything out of the game.
"There's been loads of talk of late [about the manager]. All of the boys are behind the manager."
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "We deserved to win. We scored nice goals at the right moment. Everything is OK."
Klopp has been in charge for 49 of Liverpool's 60 games this season and added: "Usually, where I come from, you need one and a half years to have 49 games."
