Tweddle, 30, who retired from gymnastics in 2013, hit a barrier on landing and has quit the show.
A family statement read: "Beth had a fall on the slopes whilst in training for The Jump. She is stable and due to undergo routine surgery on her back."
Fellow Olympian Rebecca Adlington has also withdrawn because of injury.
Adlington, 26, who won two swimming golds for Britain at the 2008 Olympics, suffered a shoulder injury and said she was "so sad to be leaving".
Holby City actress Tina Hobley, 44, also pulled out of the show after dislocating her elbow and suffering two fractures to her arm.
