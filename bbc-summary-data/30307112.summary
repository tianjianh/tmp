[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Parliament cleaners and caterers given Living Wage guarantee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cleaning and catering staff at the Scottish Parliament are to be guaranteed the Living Wage of £7.85 per hour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Workers directly employed by Holyrood already receive at least the living wage.
But from next year staff employed by contractors will also be included.
The parliament's Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said that about 26 cleaning and catering staff would see their wages rise.
The living wage is more than the UK's National Minimum Wage, which is currently £6.50 per hour.
Ms Marwick said: "I am delighted that - as an employer - the parliament has moved to ensure the Living Wage guarantee now extends to all staff who work directly at the parliament.
"The cost of meeting this commitment is relatively small in financial terms but is hugely symbolic to employees and employers alike.
"Ensuring that employees receive decent pay and conditions is the hallmark of a good employer and I hope that our decision will encourage other organisations across Scotland to make the same commitment to their staff."
Peter Kelly, director of the Poverty Alliance, welcomed the move and said it demonstrated that the Living Wage was a "well-regarded concept that has benefits for individuals, employers and wider society".
