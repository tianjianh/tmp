Third Energy wants to fracture underground rocks at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in Ryedale.
The Environment Agency said the event in Kirby Misperton related to Third Energy's application for the necessary environmental permits.
An amended planning application is expected to be submitted to the county council by the end of June.
Fracking is a technique for extracting gas or oil trapped between layers of rock by forcing the layers open using water, sand and chemicals under high pressure.
Third Energy insists the procedure is safe and poses no danger to the community.
Anti-fracking campaigners are concerned about the effects of the process and have held a number of demonstrations against the plans.
A 1,000-signature petition calling on the county council to oppose fracking has also been submitted.
The Environment Agency said it welcomed comments from the public about the application and on local environmental factors.
Martin Christmas, environment manager at the agency, said: "Our regulatory controls for onshore oil and gas are in place to protect people and the environment.
"We will assess the proposals to ensure they meet our strict requirements."
The agency's drop-in session at Kirby Misperton village hall runs from 12:00 to 20:00 BST. The Environment Agency consultation lasts until 10 July.
