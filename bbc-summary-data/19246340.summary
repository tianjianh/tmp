President: Danilo Medina
Danilo Medina Sanchez was re-elected as president in May 2016.
He first came to power on 16 August 2012, succeeding three-times President Leonel Fernandez Reyna.
He is an economist and long-standing member of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD).
Until 2015 the constitution barred him from running for a second straight term, but a constitutional change allowed him to seek re-election in 2016.
He has controversially overseen the relaxation of abortion laws and the introduction of a naturalization law which led to the descendants of thousands of Haitian immigrants becoming stateless.
Media ownership is concentrated in a few economically or politically-powerful hands.
There are scores of terrestrial TV channels and many multichannel cable TV operators. More than 300 radio stations are on the air, most of them commercial. The government operates TV and radio networks.
Press freedom is guaranteed by law and media outlets carry diverse political views.
