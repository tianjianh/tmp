The first average speed cameras used in Scotland are being updated - 11 years after they were introduced and hailed for cutting road deaths.

A new generation of digital cameras will be operational by the end of June along a 32-mile stretch of the A77, between Monkton and south of Girvan.
The number of cameras will stay the same but some will be repositioned.
Transport Scotland said the cameras had cut deaths and serious injuries by 75% since they were introduced in 2005.
Transport Scotland's head of network operations, Stewart Leggett, said: "Safety is an absolute priority and the investment in camera upgrades are central to ensuring that we continue to positively influence driver behaviour on the A77.
"The latest available figures for the A77 show that in the last three years there have been 77% fewer deaths and 74% fewer serious injuries compared to the 2005 baseline.
"We expect the new and improved cameras will continue to support this reduction in casualties."
