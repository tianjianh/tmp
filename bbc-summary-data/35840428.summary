With some companies paying Â£16m a year to protect themselves online, it will tackle a skill shortage in the area.
The first students will start at the University of South Wales' Newport campus in October.
It follows predictions four and a half million people will be needed worldwide by 2019, and is supported by Welsh Government funding.
Computer forensics and computer security undergraduates will work with businesses to identify cyber challenges. If this is successful, the course will be developed into a full-time cyber security degree.
The university's vice chancellor Prof Julie Lydon described cyber crime as "one of the four major national security threats" facing the country.
