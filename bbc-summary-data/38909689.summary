The offences took place at the school in the 1970s and 80s. The 25 similar offences Lovatt admitted were not committed at the home.
Lovatt, from Redcar, and Allen, from Burnley, abused their positions to rape and assault the boys, the Crown Prosecution Service said.
Lawyer Caroline May said: "These vulnerable young boys were in need of compassion, care and support, but Thorp Arch Grange was not a place of safety for them.
"Far from being caring professionals, these two men were cynical sex offenders."
Three others who were on trial at Leeds Crown Court - Anthony Poles, 78, of Wetherby, Mark Wylie, 60, of Linlithgow, West Lothian, Scotland, and Paul Schoon, 59, of Otley, were found not guilty of a series of alleged sexual offences.
Arrests were made as part of Operation Polymer, an inquiry into abuse at children's homes in Leeds in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
Thorp Arch Grange residential school closed in the 1980s.
