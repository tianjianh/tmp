The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it believed a maximum of 50 litres of oil was involved.
The leak, spotted off Lewis on Thursday, was from a damaged section and no further leaks have been seen.
The 17,000-tonne structure is now out of water and on the deck of a semi-submersible transport ship.
The drilling rig ran aground on a Lewis beach in a storm in August after breaking free while under tow from Norway to Malta
It was floated on to the deck of the Hawk on Thursday.
The next phase of the salvage operation involves securely fastening it to the ship for its journey to Malta.
Transocean Winner is also being checked for damage. Ships with counter pollution equipment are stationed close by.
Once in Malta it will be stripped of various components before being moved to Turkey to be scrapped.
Hugh Shaw, Secretary of State's Representative Maritime and Salvage Intervention, said: "I'm delighted that after so much work and effort that the operation to load the Transocean Winner has been successful.
"We're so grateful to the community in the area for being so supportive from the time the rig first grounded in August right through this long process."
