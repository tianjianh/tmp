Football League: Five things you may have missed

Which 17-year-old made history and which caretaker manager masterminded a last-gasp, 4-3 win?

BBC Sport looks at five things you may have missed in the Football League on a Saturday that saw the 2013 FA Cup winners bring an end to their one-year stay in the third tier of English football.
It is not unheard of for a goalkeeper to save a penalty on their club debut, from Simon Mignolet doing so on his first appearance for Liverpool in 2013 to Jens Lehmann and Tim Howard's club-debut antics for Arsenal and Manchester United in the 2003 Community Shield.
But saving a penalty on your senior career debut? That is a completely different story.
Saturday, 30 April 2016 will therefore forever be a day to remember for 17-year-old Swindon Town stopper Will Henry, who saved a 15th-minute penalty on his first competitive appearance.
Henry denied Rochdale's Ian Henderson from 12 yards, to maintain Swindon's 1-0 lead at the time, although the Robins did later go on to have two players sent off and draw 2-2.
Nevertheless, the teenager's name goes down in the Wiltshire club's history books and evokes memories of Peter Brezovan saving not one but two penalties on his Swindon debut in 2006.
However, all the above have arguably got nothing on then 19-year-old Birmingham City goalkeeper Tony Coton, who saved a spot-kick with his very first touch in league football, after 54 seconds against Sunderland in 1980, helping his side go on to win 3-2.
There were plenty of late goals in the Football League on Saturday and none came later than at Oakwell, where play-off chasing Barnsley conceded a 98th-minute equaliser against Colchester.
But the most dramatic matches of the day were surely at League Two Barnet and League One Shrewsbury, with both games providing seven goals and stoppage-time winners.
At the Hive, six second-half goals saw Darren Way's Yeovil come from 2-0 and 3-1 down to eventually beat Barnet 4-3 thanks to Harry Cornick's 95th-minute strike.
Meanwhile, in Shropshire, there were also six second-half goals, but in Shrewsbury and Peterborough's case, five of them came in the final 21 minutes.
The Posh had led 3-0 before Shrewsbury fought back to level at 3-3 in the 89th minute, only for Jon Taylor to snatch victory for the visitors on 94 minutes.
Yet, after all that, Shrewsbury's survival in the third tier was secured by virtue of Doncaster losing at Crewe, coupled with Blackpool's earlier defeat by Wigan.
And it was hardly a dull first match in charge for Peterborough's caretaker boss Grant McCann, after Graham Westley was sacked last weekend.
"I've never been involved in an experience like that in football," Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire.
The two remaining automatic promotion places in League Two will be decided on the final day of the season after victories for second-placed Accrington, third-placed Oxford and fourth-placed Bristol Rovers.
Despite their inferior points tally, Rovers will fancy their chances if either of their rivals slip up on 7 May, as they host bottom club Dagenham & Redbridge.
But all three of the sides in the mix will be at home for the crucial afternoon next weekend.
However, there will be no such final-day drama in the battle for the play-off places, as seventh-placed Wimbledon secured a League Two play-off place for the first time with a draw at Stevenage.
Bradford City's bid to return to the second tier for the first time since 2004 took a big step forward as they clinched a place in the League One play-offs.
The fifth-placed Bantams secured their top-six spot thanks to an early goal from Lee Evans (not that Lee Evans) in their victory at Southend United.
It was not a bad time for the 21-year-old namesake of the retired comedian to net his first goal since November.
But the idea of Bradford celebrating at Wembley next month is no laughing matter - Phil Parkinson's in-form side have won six of their past eight games.
While many of the aforementioned clubs' fates this season are yet to be resolved, for one club, the celebrations can definitely begin.
After a desperate decline that saw them slump from the Premier League and a glorious FA Cup win in 2013, down to League One in 2015, Wigan fans finally have an upward trend to enjoy.
The Latics secured an immediate return to the Championship with a 4-0 win at Blackpool that looks certain to crown them champions as well.
However, it was not such a happy day for the Seasiders, who remain two points adrift with one match to play and will be relegated if Fleetwood win at Walsall on Monday.
The Blackpool fans staged a protest before the match against the club's owners, the Oyston family.
