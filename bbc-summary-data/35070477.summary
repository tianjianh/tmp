Mergers and pay rows rock colleges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The impending dispute in colleges is specifically about pay.

But it is hard to divorce the dispute from the bigger issue of the shake up to the sector in recent years.
Overall budgets were cut and jobs have gone. Colleges across Scotland have merged into a series of so-called "regional supercolleges".
Mergers in any field can often be difficult - they can lead to job losses and the inevitable challenges of  bringing together the culture and practices of different institutions.
These concerns were exacerbated by rows over pay offs for some senior staff. The public spending watchdog raised concerns about the practices followed by some.
At the former Coatbridge College there were claims of collusion though, when questioned by MSPs, the former principal denied any wrongdoing.
Indeed at some colleges, the merger process itself has been difficult.
A distinct but related debate has also been going on. This is the question of  just what role colleges should have in the education system.
Colleges were told to focus on full time courses which led to recognised qualifications - such as HNCs And HNDs.
Their principle aim is to help develop the skills of the workforce and, perhaps inevitably, an even higher proportion of the students than before are in their teens or 20s.
The number of part time student numbers fell dramatically.
A report by Audit Scotland argued there was no evidence that students had suffered from the shake up but also questioned whether there had been any actual benefits beyond savings.
This big shake up in the system inevitably colours the question of pay.
Each college used to have its own pay and conditions. But a move back to national pay deals has thrown up discrepancies between institutions.
Dealing with those would inevitably be an expensive, long term business.
A formal vote on industrial action is expected within weeks and some in the EIS Further Education Lecturers Association anticipate a strike in February if the issue is not resolved.
Some in the colleges sector have long complained that they can feel as if they're overlooked: political, media and public attention can, some argue, tend to focus unduly on schools and universities.
Any national college dispute, in the run up to May's Holyrood election, could certainly put the focus on the sector.
