West Brom boss Tony Pulis says he is "desperate" to make signings before Wednesday's transfer deadline.

Albion, booed off after a 0-0 Premier League home draw with Middlesbrough on Sunday, have signed two players this summer - Matt Phillips from QPR and Brendan Galloway on loan from Everton.
But Pulis believes further arrivals will lift morale.
"We need those players. There are no problems with the boardroom, they know my feelings," Pulis said.
"They don't need people to boo to know my feelings."
Only Hull City, of the clubs in the Premier League, have made fewer signings than West Brom during this summer's transfer window.
However, Albion have recently been taken on by new owners, with former chairman Jeremy Peace agreeing a deal earlier this month to sell to a Chinese investment group led by entrepreneur Guochuan Lai.
Pulis added: "As you have seen today, we need that bit of quality and mobility. We have 14 players that were here when we came in two years ago when we were favourites to go down. We've improved but we need five new players."
Match report: West Brom 0-0 Middlesbrough
The transfer window closes at 23:00 BST on Wednesday, and Pulis is expecting "an interesting few days" before then.
West Brom striker Saido Berahino started on the bench against Middlesbrough on Sunday, and his long-term future remains uncertain.
"That's going to be another topic of conversation over the next few days," said Pulis.
"We'll see in the next 48 hours hopefully."
Berahino's future has been uncertain for some time.
The Baggies turned down bids from Tottenham for the 23-year-old during last year's summer transfer window, while Stoke and Crystal Palace had offers rejected earlier this year.
Berahino's contract expires next summer and he has turned down an offer to extend it.
Former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright believes the situation needs to be resolved imminently, so that the Baggies can add to their squad before the window closes.
"Berahino can then get on with his career," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"You heard them [the fans] booing three games in, but it depends what kind of players they bring in. Are they going to be offensive, creative players that get fans up off their seats and they look forward going to see?"
