Sam Muggleton: York City sign former Eastleigh left-back until end of the season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York City have signed left-back Sam Muggleton until end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old played more than 50 games for Barnet before following former manager Martin Allen to Eastleigh in January.
But along with Allen, he left the National League side in February after making just five appearances.
Gary Mills' York, who have reached the FA Trophy final, are 22nd in the National League table, six points from safety with 10 matches left to play.
