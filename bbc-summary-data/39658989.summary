Bus driver Michael Birch had to be cut free from his cabin following the crash.
He said he thought he "would die" and has been unable to drive since.
The court was told parts of the engine was held in place by just one strap, which snapped in the collision.
Last said he was "extremely horrified" by what happened and was "devastated by the unintended consequences".
In a statement, he said he "heard a crunch" and came to a "dead halt" when he and the bus were due to pass each other on a slight bend in the 40mph road.
Judge David Goodin said the accident had "grave consequences".
He added: "You are an experienced driver of heavy vehicles.
"You had the advantage of specific training of how to secure this six tonnes of metal to ensure no movement.
"You wouldn't have wished this for a moment, but you caused it."
