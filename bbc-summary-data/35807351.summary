As first reported in the Northamptonshire Telegraph, the lamb climbed into the bucket on Saturday night and was discovered "very poorly" the next morning, according to West Lodge Farm Park in Desborough.
Farmer Ed Dee brought the lamb home and used his wife Mo's hairdryer to warm it up again. It was later returned to its mother.
