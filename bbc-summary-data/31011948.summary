The 28-year-old tweeted: "I've heard if you earn minimum wage in England you're in the top 10% earners in the world. #stay #humble."
Broad, who is in Australia on England duty, deleted the message after angry replies from some Twitter users.
Broad then posted: "No offence meant and sorry if any taken. The hashtag was aimed at myself."
In an interview with the BBC, the Nottinghamshire seamer tried to explain further the reasons for his tweet.
"I didn't mean anything by it," he told Test Match Special reporter Charles Dagnall. "It was purely… I was amazed by the size of the world."
Broad is due to face India in the tri-series in Sydney on Friday.
In another post, he wrote: "Clarifying my earlier tweet, I merely wanted to emphasise my amazement at just how big the world is."
Since October 2014, the UK minimum wage has been £6.50 an hour for adults aged 21 and over, and £5.13 for those aged 18 to 20.
