Contaminated blood: Victims 'should have compensation doubled'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People infected by contaminated NHS blood products should have their compensation nearly doubled, a report to the Scottish government has recommended.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It said those infected with HIV, or who developed advanced Hepatitis C, should get £27,000 per year - the equivalent of the average Scottish salary.
They are currently offered £15,000.
The Scottish government said it had yet to decide whether to implement the new proposals.
Campaigners have been split over the level of payouts, with some saying more money should be found.
The move follows the publication of the findings of the Penrose Inquiry into the contamination of blood supplies in the 1970s and 80s.
Financial support is targeted at people who were infected by their NHS treatment, including haemophiliacs and people who have had blood transfusions.
Many went on to suffer conditions such as liver disease.
The Department of Health recently estimated the number of victims was 30,000 UK-wide.
Under the Scottish proposals, those who have both infections would receive £37,000 per year, an extra £7,000 on present arrangements.
For the first time, widows or widowers would also be supported by an annual pension.
But victims' groups said many people would still miss out on compensation completely.
Philip Dolan, of the Scottish Infected Blood Forum, said: "Disappointment is an understatement.
"It's like thirty pieces of silver paid to Judas to betray Jesus.
"These proposals mean that people are only getting what Lord Ross recommended in 2003. They are only getting what they were due 13 years ago."
Hepatitis C is a virus which damages the liver.
In the early stages most people are unaware they have the infection, and between 15-25% of people will clear the virus from their system naturally.
For the remaining 75-85%, their health will gradually deteriorate.  They may suffer jaundice, drowsiness, and pain.
Drug treatments are effective in just over half of all cases, although new drugs are offering more effective cure rates.
Twenty years after infection, approximately 15% to 20% of the remaining patients will develop cirrhosis or advanced liver disease, which is fatal without a liver transplant.
Those infected with HIV as well as Hepatitis C develop cirrhosis sooner and have a higher risk of death.
He added: "Eighty per cent of people with Hepatitis C are still ill but are not in the advanced stages of the disease therefore they and their spouses will get nothing. Many of them are people who had blood transfusions.
"I'm glad some people are getting this money but do think it's a failure of government to give recognition to the majority of people who got Hepatitis C from a blood transfusion."
Lawyer Patrick McGuire, who represents most of the Scottish victims, welcomed the report.
But he said the grading system which differentiates between victims and the symptoms they have needs to be looked at.
Mr McGuire said: "Until this issue is sorted out, some people with terrible health problems will lose out due to this unfair grading system.
"Another obstacle is that, while this new scheme will give a better standard of living to victims in their daily lives, no progress has been made to compensate people for the monstrous injustice they have suffered in the first place.
"Let us not forget that thousands of Scots, through no fault of their own, have been infected with very serious conditions.
"Many have died, many continue to live lives blighted by pain and uncertainty. It is only right that these people receive settlement for what has been done to them."
A Scottish government spokesman said an announcement would be made on the new recommendations before World Haemophilia Day next April.
