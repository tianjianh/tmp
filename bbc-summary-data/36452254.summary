[SN]TITLE[SN]
Temporary bridge reopens 'vital' County Durham route

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A temporary crossing has opened above a bridge in County Durham that was closed after inspectors identified "issues with its structural integrity".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Traffic and pedestrians were banned from Deerness Bridge, between Ushaw Moor and New Brancepeth, on 13 April.
Durham County Council has now installed a replacement Bailey bridge so people can cross the river while a permanent solution is developed.
A council spokesman said he was "pleased" the "vital route" had opened.
A structural review of the bridge following its closure raised concerns it could no longer withstand the weight of traffic.
