With the introduction of a quarter-final stage at Rio, they only need to finish in the top four of their six-team group to qualify.
They play host nation Brazil on Tuesday, face world champions Australia on Wednesday, then wrap up the group stage against Spain on Friday.
GB head coach Bobby Crutchley:
"It was disappointing not to win. We had some good opportunities we were better than against Belgium in our intensity and the way we played.
"Our execution was a bit off and we didn't deliver our corners but we showed better intent.
"There were glimpses of quality but it'll come in the coming games. The players are good at self evaluation so we know what we need to do.
"We need to win our next game. We're playing a team we haven't played before which doesn't happen often. We have to make sure we're diligent and prepare properly and put in the performance we need to get the win."
