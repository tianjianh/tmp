United will pay 105m euros for Pogba and performance-related bonuses and other costs could see that figure rise.
The midfielder will have a medical in the next few days with the deal due to be completed in midweek.
The 23-year-old, who left United for £1.5m in 2012, is set to return for a fee that surpasses Gareth Bale's £85m move to Real Madrid in 2013.
The Old Trafford club still have to agree personal terms with the France midfielder, although that is expected to be a formality.
Pogba's imminent medical was announced just over 90 minutes before Sunday's Community Shield, which United won 2-1 against Leicester.
Boss Jose Mourinho said after the game at Wembley that United is the "perfect" club and the Premier League is the best stage for Pogba.
"We have everything to give him and we know the reasons why he wants to come to us," added Mourinho.
"He comes because he knows the club, knows the city, many of the players and wants to be an important part of the project.
"If you want to be the best player in the world, if you go to Barcelona or Real Madrid you are in trouble because I don't think the other two big guys [Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo] will let you."
Asked about the size of Pogba's transfer fee, Mourinho said: "I don't think Real were upset when they broke the record with Gareth Bale or Cristiano.
"I don't think it's a reason to be sad - it's a reason to be proud.
"Football is crazy and the market has become crazy. What you think this season is crazy, you realise three years later it's not crazy any more.
"What is expensive and not expensive in football? I don't know any more. I just know he is a big player."
In four seasons in Turin, Pogba, who helped France reach the Euro 2016 final, won four league titles.
He is Mourinho's fourth signing at United, after Eric Bailly, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
It is the first time in 20 years an English club will have paid a world record fee.
Newcastle United were the last to do so when they spent £15m signing England striker Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers.
Pogba joined United from French club Le Havre in 2009 as a 16-year-old, but made just a handful of appearances before his contract expired in July 2012.
He has made 178 appearances for Juventus, scoring 34 goals, and helped the club reach the 2015 Champions League final. The Serie A side had offered him a new contract, while Real Madrid were also interested in signing him.
Pogba's agent, Mino Raiola, also represents striker Ibrahimovic, who signed for United on a free transfer from Paris St-Germain, and midfielder Mkhitaryan, who joined from Borussia Dortmund.
In August 2011, then United manager Six Alex Ferguson described Pogba as a "young boy" who was "showing great promise".
He said: "If we hold Pogba back, what's going to happen? He's going to leave. So we have to give him the opportunity to see how he can do in the first team and he's got great ability, plus he's got the physique and athleticism."
However, later that year, with Paul Scholes retired, Owen Hargreaves leaving and Darren Fletcher injured, Brazilian full-back Rafael was preferred to Pogba in midfield, a decision the Frenchman later said "disgusted" him.
Scholes came out of retirement aged 37 in January 2012, and Pogba said: "I didn't want to sign a contract as Ferguson didn't play me, even though there were no midfielders there.
"I was frustrated because he spoke to me a few times and said I was nearly there. When I saw Scholes come back, part of me was really happy as he's a legend, but I knew it was the end of me."
Pogba left United when his contract expired, with the Red Devils receiving a £1.5m fee as compensation.

In his second autobiography, Ferguson said he "distrusted" Pogba's agent, Raiola, describing their first meeting as a "fiasco".
"He and I were like oil and water," said the Scot. "From then on, our goose was cooked because Raiola had been able to ingratiate himself with Paul and his family and the player signed with Juventus."
Juventus full-back Patrice Evra, who was at United with Pogba, said the club initially "underestimated" his France team-mate.
Speaking in 2014, he said: "I went to talk to him and spent two hours with his parents and his brothers to discuss his future, even though I'm just a player.
"I said, 'Here in Manchester you will become a legend. Be patient'. I tried to tie him up. I even tried to put him in padlocks. But, no, he'd already made his choice."
