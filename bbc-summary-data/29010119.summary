For a while, you didn't need to look any further than Perez Hilton's gossip site after he published a handful of them.
He has since taken them down with an apology that he acted in "haste".
The images he posted included ones reported to be of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice.
In a series of tweets, Hilton said he had decided to remove the naked ones from his site. He then had a change of heart and removed the censored ones too.
Representatives for Jennifer Lawrence have issued a statement to Newsbeat, saying: "This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
"The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence."
Perez Hilton has not confirmed whether he has read that statement himself.
The blogger later posted a video saying that he would not post "intimate photos like that" and that he is trying to "think of other ways to make things right".
He added: "A lot of you let me know my actions were wrong. I didn't even stop to think about my actions, I just wanted to get this out there as soon as possible."
The 36-year-old said he would "use this as an opportunity to learn from and grow from and make some changes going forward".
The FBI is now looking into allegations that the intimate pictures of celebrities were stolen and posted online.
