The 29-year-old central defender's contract was due to expire at the end of the 2014-15 season.
I didn't want to go anywhere else
He had been linked with a possible move to Sunderland and other clubs were interested but Williams wanted to stay.
"Swansea is where I wanted to be so as long as we could work something out and they wanted me, this is where I would be," he said.
"I didn't want to go anywhere else. I didn't feel like I was ever going to go anywhere else.
"I'm happy. This is me. I know Swansea and they know me.
"I'm just really happy that I managed to get it done early in the pre-season and know I can really get my head down and kick on."
Williams joined Swansea from Stockport for Â£400,000 in 2008.

He forged a central defensive partnership with Garry Monk, as the club rose up the leagues to claim a place in the top flight in 2011.
In 2013 the pair lifted the League Cup together, as the Swans won their first major domestic trophy.
Monk was appointed manager on a full-time basis in April, having taken over the reins temporarily after Michael Laudrup was sacked in February.
Williams says Monk was also an "important" factor in his decision to stay at the Liberty Stadium.
"The fact that he's [Monk] the manager now made me want to stay even more really," said Williams.
"I know the guy and I like the guy.
"I enjoyed the back end of last season, the way he works, the way we train, the way he sets up the team, everything he wants to do I enjoy it.
"I agree with what he wants to do."
