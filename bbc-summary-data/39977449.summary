Pearson played more than 250 games in six seasons at Grimsby and was part of the team which secured promotion to the Football League in 2016.
The 28-year-old has also had stints at Spalding, Stamford and Boston United during his career.
"Once the situation at Grimsby was made clear, there were some options for me," Pearson said.
"But this was the most appealing and we sorted it out nice and quickly."
Pearson is Wrexham manager Dean Keates' second signing of the close season following the arrival of versatile full-back James Hurst.
