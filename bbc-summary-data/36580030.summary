The Chelsea forward's 10-minute cameo during the 1-0 victory over Czech Republic is his only appearance of the competition so far.
Spain are through to the knockout stages, having beaten Turkey in their second game.
David Silva and Nolito have been preferred to the 28-year-old former Barcelona player.
Pedro told Spanish media that it was "difficult" for him to accept being second-choice as there was "no continuity" for him.
"If you don't see continuity, coming here to stay with the group is no longer worth it," he said.
The winger has 58 caps for Spain, scoring 17 goals since his debut in 2010.
Spain play their final group fixture against Croatia in Bordeaux at 20:00 BST on Tuesday.
