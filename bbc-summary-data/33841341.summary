Dungiven: Bus attack that injured four people shameful, says priest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An attack on a bus carrying spectators of the Apprentice Boys parade in Londonderry on Saturday was "shameful", the parish priest of Dungiven has said.

Four people were injured after stones were thrown at the bus and smashed a number of windows.
One woman had to be treated in hospital for serious facial injuries.
Fr Aidan Mullan told the BBC's Sunday News programme that the attack "did not represent the views of the people in Dungiven".
He said he was getting ready for a vigil mass at Dungiven Parish Church when he heard about the attack.
"What is very annoying is that it was pre-meditated, these people had to be there, armed with these stones in a pre-meditated, cold-blooded fashion," he said.
"They do not represent the good people of Dungiven and that was what people were saying to me in the church, one woman had tears in her eyes saying 'we get painted in a bad name and it's not fair, it's not right, that doesn't represent us'.
"It is shameful, we're rightly ashamed, and this attack does not represent the feelings of the vast majority of people in Dungiven."
A 16-year-old boy arrested after the attack on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm has since been released on bail pending further inquiries.
