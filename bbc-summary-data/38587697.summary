A supermarket worker downloaded a terrorism guide in preparation for joining extremists, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Counsell, 28, denies four charges, including trying to join an Islamic terrorist group in the Philippines.
Woolwich Crown Court heard the e-book suggested using a fake beard or moustache as a disguise and playing console games like Call of Duty.
It also advised against going Paintballing "because they write down the names of every Muslim who goes".
Counsell, who worked at the Hyson Green branch of Asda, in Nottingham, used annual leave to travel to remote parts of South-East Asia, prosecutors said.
Dan Pawson-Pounds, for the Crown, said the defendant spent two years stockpiling equipment for his trip.
Items included Kevlar-lined underpants called "Blast Boxers" and badges with the words, "Zombie Response Team," "I love my beard," and "We do bad things to bad people", he added.
Counsell is charged with preparing acts of terrorism by obtaining information about Islamic terrorist groups in the Philippines, arranging to travel to the Philippines to join and fight for an Islamic terrorist group, and purchasing equipment and clothing for use when having joined such a group.
The married father, from Nottingham, also faces a charge of possession of electronic documents containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.
The trial continues.
