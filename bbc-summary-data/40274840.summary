[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brexit provides an opportunity to "reinvent and strengthen" the United Kingdom, Wales' first minister will say in a speech on Thursday.

Carwyn Jones will unveil a blueprint for an overhaul of relations between the governments of the four nations after the UK leaves the European Union.
A new UK Council of Ministers would settle post-Brexit power disputes.
Mr Jones will call on the UK nations to work together "through discussion, not diktat, to map our collective future".
The first minister has already written to Prime Minister Theresa May urging her to rethink plans for a hard Brexit, saying she had "no mandate" for it after the Conservatives lost their majority in the snap election she called hoping to strengthen her position.
Speaking in Cardiff on Thursday, Mr Jones will re-state his preference for securing "full and unfettered access" to the EU single market after Brexit, and stress the need for co-operation to find a way forward.
He will describe leaving the European Union as "the biggest challenge facing the United Kingdom, a challenge thrown into even sharper relief by the outcome of the general election".
It will influence "our ability to trade, travel, attract investment, determine policies, legislate, support our countryside, invest in our regions", Mr Jones will add.
He will warn the "fallout" from Brexit has "the potential to destabilise the United Kingdom as we know it - or, if we work together, we can use this as an opportunity to reinvent and strengthen our union".
The proposed UK Council of Ministers would take over from the current Joint Ministerial Council, through which the UK government has heard the Brexit priorities of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
A new white paper from Mr Jones will also call for a convention looking at the wider questions about the future of the UK once it leaves the EU.
"The opportunities presented by EU exit must be about the future, not the past - and that is what our paper is about," he will add.
"It represents an important step forward in the work which we must undertake together with England, Scotland and Northern Ireland - through discussion, not diktat - to map our collective future."
