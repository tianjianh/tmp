[SN]TITLE[SN]
Surfer treks 300 miles round Devon and Cornwall with board

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surfer Dan Sharpe has completed a 300-mile trek around the South West coast path, carrying his surfboard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Engineer Mr Sharpe, 25, from Worcester walked for six weeks from Plymouth on 7 May to Bude in Cornwall.
His aim was to discover as many surfing spots as possible on the way and "absorb most of what the Atlantic swells have to offer".
He admitted that carrying his board tested his strength and led to some severe pain in his shoulders.
