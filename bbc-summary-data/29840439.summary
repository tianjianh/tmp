Calbee Inc - Japan's largest producer of savoury snacks - is opening a new factory in Flintshire, which is its first investment in Europe.
The news was announced in Japan by Wales' Economy Minister Edwina Hart and Calbee chairman Akira Matsumoto.
The move is backed with undisclosed business finance from the Welsh government.
A Welsh government spokesperson said the investment the firm received was 'commercially confidential'.
Mrs Hart said: "I am delighted to announce this important new inward investment for Wales.
"Calbee is the latest in a long line of highly prestigious Japanese companies that have invested in Wales and I welcome their decision to establish their first European plant in Wales."
Mr Matsumoto said: "We are very excited to establish our first European factory in Wales.
"We are making a long-term commitment to grow our business from this important base in Deeside.
"I appreciate both the Welsh government and everyone's dedication and support for its  successful establishment."
Calbee (UK)'s new facility on Deeside Industrial Park will begin manufacturing savoury snacks in the first half of 2015.
