A man who wants to be the first person to swim Britain's longest river, the Severn, said it would take him longer than expected due to the "cold and the lack of current".

Kevin Brady, 32, from Gloucester, who set off on 23 September from Plynlimon, Powys said he could not swim 10 miles a day as he had not trained enough.
He had hoped to complete the 220-mile (350 km) swim on 11 October but said a finish on 18 October was more likely.
Mr Brady is raising money for charity.
After setting off from the river's source in mid-Wales 12 days ago, Mr Brady arrived in Shrewsbury on Saturday.
He said the water was "absolutely freezing" and if he could "keep up the pace and avoid sickness and injury" he hoped to finish about a week later than his original target.
He has now developed an ear infection, delaying the next leg of the journey due to an appointment with a Shrewsbury doctor.
"I want to get to Ironbridge, which is seven miles away, by 6pm today but am seeing the doctor at 11:15 this morning," he said.
He said he was using "two special potions" - one created by him, which he said "took a month to brew".
Ingredients included "apple cider vinegar, garlic, onions, ginger and turmeric" and Mr Brady said it was "just like lava".
"I take a swig after each swim and it kills every bacteria that's got into me. Yesterday I swam past a bloated dead sheep and I am still not sick. The potion must be working," he said.
The swim is to raise money for the Superhero Foundation, a charity which he co-founded with his cousin and fellow endurance athlete Jamie McDonald.
