The hosts should have won comfortably in normal time, but squandered a hatful of chances.
Taylor headed them in front from a Chris Lines cross in the 34th minute, only for Jordan Roberts to lash in a left-footed equaliser from a corner in first-half injury time.
Rory Gaffney, who had hit a post in the opening 45 minutes, made it 2-1 to Rovers seven minutes after the break, beating Crawley goalkeeper Glenn Morris at his near post.
But substitute Matt Harrold netted against his old club in the 65th minute from a chance set up by fellow replacement Enzio Boldewijn.
Gaffney scored his second of the game as he bundled the ball home in the 96th minute, before Taylor finished Crawley off six minutes later with a penalty after Luke James had been fouled.
Rovers now entertain Barrow in the second round on December 4.
