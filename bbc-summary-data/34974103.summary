The magazine has had access to the movie's director JJ Abrams and cast, including Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill for its latest issue.
In an online feature, Star Wars: The Force - Everything you need to know?, Empire has listed Scotland among the UK and international locations used.
There had previously been rumours the production came north for filming.
Empire's article does not say where in Scotland filming was done.
Other major productions, such as Ridley Scott's Prometheus, have been shot on Skye while Sam Mende's Bond flick Skyfall was partly shot in Glen Coe.
Pinewood Studios and RAF Greenham Common are among the well-known locations for the Star Wars film, which will be released in cinemas later this month.
Hamill, who plays Luke Skywalker, filmed scenes on Skellig Michael Island off the coast of Ireland.
