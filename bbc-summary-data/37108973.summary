Police are searching a park in an area where three severed human feet have been found this year.

Officers are searching in Weston Park East in Bath, where the first foot was found by dog walkers in February.
A second foot was found in a garden of a property in Weston Park in July, and another was found in a garden in nearby Cranwells Park two weeks ago.
Police said they do not believe a crime has been committed and it is likely they were all medical exhibits.
Det Insp Paul Catton, of Avon and Somerset Police, said he "strongly believed" the finds had originated from "an old private collection".
A spokesman said the new search was being carried out "to try to find anything which may be connected to the discoveries".
"All three feet show signs they have come into contact with animals and it is likely that they have been moved to the locations they were found from a specific source," Det Insp Catton added.
"Regulations are significantly stricter these days compared to several decades ago and we believe the source is most probably someone who used the feet as a teaching aid.
"It is also possible these feet may have been found by someone who has then innocently buried them in an attempt to dispose of them and they have then been unearthed by animals, or that animals have disturbed the location they were stored."
Tests on the first foot showed it was human but found very little DNA, and preliminary results from on the second foot were similar.
The third foot, found on 5 August, is still undergoing tests.
Mr Catton said officers were searching the whole of the park and the grounds of a nearby school.
"The school is in a central location to the sites where all three feet have been found and the last thing we want is for a member of the public to come across one of these unpleasant finds.
"We believe someone knows something about where these feet have come from and would appeal for them to get in touch," he added.
