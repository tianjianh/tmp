[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wales star Jonathan Davies will miss England game ahead of New Zealand tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales centre Jonathan Davies will miss the match against England on 29 May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game at Twickenham falls outside World Rugby's international window in June and his French side Clermont Auvergne have confirmed Davies, 28, will be released after their Top 14 match against Toulouse on 29 May.
Davies will then travel to New Zealand for Wales' three-Test series against the world champions in June.
He will miss Clermont's final league game on 5 June against La Rochelle.
Warren Gatland's side are also expected to be without lock Luke Charteris against England as he could feature for Racing 92 on 27 May against La Rochelle.
Wales do though have first call on their players during the June international window so can select Davies and Charteris for the matches in New Zealand, even if their clubs are involved in French domestic play-offs.
The Top 14 final will be played on 24 June, the eve of Wales' third and final Test against the All Blacks in Dunedin.
British and Irish Lions lock Alun Wyn Jones is likely to have some game time at Twickenham after he missed Ospreys' Pro12 run-in with a heel injury.
Gatland must also decide whether captain Sam Warburton, centre Scott Williams and props Paul James and Samson Lee will feature against England as they recover from various knocks.
Warburton injured a shoulder playing for Cardiff Blues against Ospreys on 30 April, and has not played since.
Tight-head Lee missed Scarlets' final game of the season after suffering a head blow in the Judgement Day win over Newport Gwent Dragons, while Williams was also absent with a hamstring injury.
Loose-head James sat out Osprey's last four games of the season after undergoing eye surgery.
Lions full-back Leigh Halfpenny was not considered for the tour of New Zealand having not played since September following knee surgery.
He could yet be called up as injury cover, provided he proves his fitness.
Wales are also without open-side flanker Justin Tipuric and wing Alex Cuthbert who are both injured.
