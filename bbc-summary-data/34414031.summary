Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli, 19, and Reds forward Danny Ings, 23, have received their first senior call-ups, having represented England Under-21s.
Sturridge, who has just recovered from a hip injury, scored twice in Saturday's 3-2 win over Aston Villa.
Reds boss Brendan Rodgers said he could not manage both England games.
Also returning to the squad are Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand, Manchester United's Phil Jones and Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana, who missed September's matches against San Marino and Switzerland with injury.
England have already qualified for next year's European Championship in France.
In their final two group games they face Estonia at Wembley on 9 October and then Lithuania away three days later.
England manager Roy Hodgson is expecting Sturridge to be back in his squad for friendlies against Spain and France in November.
"The best way to have him for November is to leave him out for October," said Hodgson.
"We can survive without him for the next two games. Our hope is that he will come to us in November super-fit, fully recovered and in great form."
Alli signed for Spurs from MK Dons in February, ending the season on loan with the League One side.
In August he made his Spurs debut - his first of eight appearances so far - and last month won his first England Under-21 cap.
Ings, who was at the European Championship with England Under-21s this summer, joined Liverpool from Burnley in the summer and has scored twice for the Reds.
Hodgson added: "We have been impressed with what we have seen of Alli. We are a year away from France and it is a good opportunity for him to come with us and get to know him better, he is an exciting talent."

Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish, who has opted to play for England rather than the Republic of Ireland, was ineligible for selection as he is awaiting international clearance.
The Birmingham-born 20-year-old played for the Republic up to under-21 level but turned down a call-up to the senior squad for a friendly against England in June.
England asked Villa if Grealish could train with the squad but his club boss Tim Sherwood requested he stay with them to regain full fitness.
Hodgson said he was "pleased" Grealish had chosen England, but warned the midfielder he would not be an automatic pick.
"I am happy he took the bolder choice to play for England. I think he has the talent to be an England player but he has a lot of work to do before that day happens. There is no doubt he has the talent but he needs to confirm that talent to play week after week for Villa in the Premier League."
Bertrand will replace Manchester United left-back Luke Shaw, who is expected to be out for six months after breaking his leg in the Champions League defeat by PSV Eindhoven on 15 September.
Hodgson, who described the injury as "heartbreaking," said: "I had really high hopes for Luke in 2016. We were punting on him to be the left-back for us and maybe the best left-back in the tournament."
England have won all eight qualifying games so far, but Hodgson said he may use the last group in Lithuania to "experiment" with his starting line-up, even if it costs his side their 100% record.
But he said he will name strong teams for friendlies in the build-up to the Euros in November and March.
England lost to Chile and Germany in warm-up matches before the 2014 World Cup.
"I am pleased with my squad. I would like to win both games but the one in Lithuania is where I will experiment or make changes.
"It might damage our chances of getting a perfect 10, but I am prepared to take that risk. As we go into friendlies in November and March I want to work with players more likely to start in June and not experiment, which cost us after qualifying for the last World Cup."
BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty: "Liverpool manager Brendan Rogers will be pleased with two aspects of England manager Roy Hodgson's latest squad - no early recall for Daniel Sturridge and the first call-up for fellow striker Danny Ings.
"Rodgers is determined Sturridge's return from long-term injury problems will not be rushed, a position understood by Hodgson as he is in no hurry with England already qualified for Euro 2016.
"The call-up for Ings is reward for his energetic displays that have made him one of the plus points in Liverpool's indifferent start to the new season.
"And as Hodgson starts to look at his options for France with qualification secured, it will be intriguing to see how 19-year-old Spurs midfield man Deli Alli acquits himself. There is a lot of excitement surrounding the youngster, who has been handed a chance to stake his own claim to be at the Euros next summer."
