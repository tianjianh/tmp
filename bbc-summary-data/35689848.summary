The 35-year-old, who has 15 New Zealand caps, will make the switch should he receive a visa and pass a medical.
Flynn has played 42 times since joining the French Top 14 club in 2014.
Warriors coach Gregor Townsend said: "We're excited about his arrival, which will be the first time a Rugby World Cup winner has played for Warriors."
Flynn, who was a member of their Rugby World Cup winning squad in 2011. had joined Toulouse after 12 years in Super Rugby with the Crusaders and also played for Southland and Canterbury in his homeland.
"Corey is a very experienced player, who has played at the highest level of the game," said Townsend.
"He will strengthen our leadership group, having captained Canterbury and the Crusaders, as well as the Junior All Blacks.
"He has shown his ability to adapt to a different rugby environment having been involved in 32 games for Toulouse last season, starting in all but one of them.
"Corey is also going to play an important role to help mentor some of our our younger players and bring the best out of the other hookers in our squad."
Flynn, who will compete for a place with Scotland hookers Pat MacArthur and Fraser Brown, has already played at Scotstoun with Toulouse, having started both of their European Rugby Champions Cup games against the Warriors last season.
Flynn said: "When I played at Scotstoun last season, the atmosphere was fantastic and it shows the club has a really good support base.
"I jumped at the chance to join the Warriors after chatting to Gregor and I'm good friends with Scotland full-back Sean Maitland and he couldn't say enough good things about Glasgow.
"I want to help the young hookers at the club by passing on my experience and helping them come to terms with professional rugby in a similar role to the one I had at the Crusaders."
