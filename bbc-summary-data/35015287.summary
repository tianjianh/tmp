[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's women won the World Twenty20 Qualifier final against Bangladesh in dramatic fashion, with Lucy O'Reilly getting a single from the final ball.

Ireland, who had already qualified for next year's tournament in India by making the decider, won by two wickets.
Bangladesh made 105-3 off their 20 overs, with Nigar Sultana top-scoring with 41 and Ciara Metcalfe taking 3-14.
Cecilia Joyce and Clare Shillington hit 24 off the first two overs and O'Reilly saw Ireland home to victory on 106-8.
The 16-year-old held her nerve to drive the ball to mid-on and pick up a single as rain fell and lightning flashed around the ground in Bangkok.
The drama intensified in the run-up to the final delivery of the match as, with the scores level, Bangladeshi bowler Salma Khatun attempted to run the non-striker out before she bowled the ball, with the umpires deciding after a long conversation that Laura Delany was not out.
With O'Reilly waiting patiently at the striker's end for a second attempt at the final ball there were anxious faces all round, but the youngster held her nerve.
Joyce (32) and Shillington (12) got Ireland off to a flying start but it was left to Delany (26 not out) and O'Reilly to finish off the game after wickets fell at regular intervals to leave Ireland eight wickets down with eight runs needed heading into the final over.
Metcalfe, the only Ireland player not required to bat, played a huge part in the win thanks to her contribution with the ball.
She took the only three wickets to fall in Bangladesh's innings, as Ireland's bowlers did well to limit boundaries.
