Yellow box junction blockers in Cardiff to be fined

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers who block yellow box junctions in Cardiff are to be fined Â£35.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warnings will be issued to offenders from Monday with the first fines expected at the end of the week. Those who fail to pay without appealing could see the cost rise up to Â£105.
The council claims it is the first in the UK, outside London, to enforce yellow box junction rules using CCTV.
It already fines drivers for using bus lanes, with more than 3,500 penalties issued in the first month.
Cameras are in place at Customhouse Street, Bute Terrace and Bute Street junction. Other junctions will be monitored and more cameras could be installed.
The move is the latest phase in the authority's Moving Traffic Offences Scheme, which aims to cut city centre congestion.
Ramesh Patel, cabinet member for transport, said: "We are not being secretive about where and when the enforcement will take place.
"This isn't our intention, we want to change drivers' behaviour."
