A town is set to open its first cinema for 22 years as part of a Â£60m regeneration project.

Hinckley has been without one since the MGM Canon, in Trinity Lane, closed in May 1993.
Cineworld, which is in The Crescent development near Lancaster Road, is hosting invited guests for its gala nights before opening to the public.
Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council said the town had been calling for a movie theatre for years.
Council leader Mike Hall explained the town could expect to see "gradual openings" of new businesses from now until March.
"The one thing that people have consistently said, whenever we've looked at development of the town centre, is they want a cinema.
"Thanks to Cineworld and the council, that's finally here," he said.
The Crescent, which also includes a bus station, shops and restaurants, is expected to create about 500 jobs.
Plans for the scheme were approved in 2011, but work did not begin until last year.
Tim Arnold, owner of newly-opened micro pub Elbow Room, said: "We spent two years looking for premises and when this opportunity came up, we felt we couldn't miss it.
"It's a fantastic location."
However, experts believe more work must be done to regenerate the town.
Philip Garton, principal lecturer in retailing at De Montfort University, said: "A lot of Hinckley was originally reliant on industry which is no longer there and it needs to find a new place for itself.
"Not just this one, but other developments that will help Hinckley going forwards."
