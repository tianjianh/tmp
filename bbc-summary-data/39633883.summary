Welsh netball side Celtic Dragons will be looking for a reaction against Team Bath after their defeat by Severn Stars, says Bethan Dyke.

The Dragons came close to beating the Severn Stars on Monday, but finally lost out 59-50 at the Sport Wales National Centre in Cardiff.
The defeat was their ninth of the season and leaves them bottom of the Superleague table with three points.
"We are disappointed with the result," Dyke said.
Having beaten the Sirens at home to record their first win of the year, spirits had been high in the Dragons' camp, but Dyke says they have to regain their levels of consistency if they are to return to winning ways.
"We keep saying we need to be consistent, but we did some really good things," added Dyke.
"We just need to do it for longer periods of the quarters. It was a very physical game, so I think our change of direction with short-and-sharp play and our through-court attack was really good.
"We'll take that into the game against Bath."
The Dragons go on to face Manchester Thunder on Saturday, 29 April before playing Hertfordshire Mavericks on Monday, 1 May.
