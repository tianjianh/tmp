A donkey that spent two weeks being treated at an equine hospital after falling down a water-filled storm drain has returned home.

Noah fell into the 7ft (2m) ditch in Heydon, Cambridgeshire, on 17 August after metal thieves stole the cover, and was rescued by firefighters.
Fans of the donkey raised more than £2,000 to help with vet care, which Noah is still receiving at his stables.
He is said to be "back to his cheeky self".
After six-year-old Noah toppled into the drain in his field, Cambridgeshire Fire Service, stable workers, a vet, and a man with a mechanical digger worked into the night to save him, holding his head above the water.
After he was winched out, it was initially thought Noah had suffered just scrapes and bruises.
However, three days later he "went into shock as donkeys get very stressed", said Elaine Fisher, who runs Lovely View Stables where he is kept.
Noah was admitted to Cambridge University's equine hospital.
A Just Giving page was started with the aim of raising £500 to help fund Noah's care. So far about 150 people have pledged more than £2,200 and many have followed Noah's progress on a Facebook page.
Tina Pankhurst, who is looking after Noah at the stables and started the fundraising drive, said she was "overwhelmed and blown-away by people's generosity".
"He was looked after really well and had exceptional care at the hospital," she said.
"I was amazed at how Noah progressed during those two weeks, but there's still some way to go before his wounds heal."
She said vet bills had come to almost £3,000 so far, although the donkey will need weekly visits for at least the next month.
Noah is owned by All Saints' Church in Melbourn, which is holding collections to help with the bills.
The donkey is well-loved in the village, having starred in the church's Nativity services for the past five years.
Firefighters who rescued Noah were presented with an Animal Hero award by animal rights campaigners Peta for the "skill, determination and compassion" they demonstrated in saving him.
