[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wrexham 0-0 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Resilient Chester held Wrexham to a scoreless draw in the Anglo-Welsh derby in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Mills' team dominated the first half, but Michael Bakare failed to capitalise on two good headed chances.
The other talking point was a tackle on Craig Mahon which earned John Rooney a booking, with referee Martin Coy possibly lenient.
Neither team looked capable of breaking the deadlock and the result was met with a chorus of boos from home fans.
Chester have picked up eight points from their last available 12 thanks to four successive clean sheets.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills said: "We had two or three good chances in the final third and the final ball could have been better.
"But overall we were solid again. The players have worked their socks off but unfortunately we weren't able to get that goal to win the game.
"There's no guarantees - you keep working away and we've got our game in hand on Tuesday and hopefully we can go and get a result."
