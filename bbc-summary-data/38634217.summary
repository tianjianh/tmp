St Mary's Hospital on the Isle of Wight has cancelled hundreds of operations due to an increasing number of patients attending its emergency department.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There have been no routine operations at the hospital in Newport for two weeks due to a lack of beds.
Isle of Wight NHS Trust said about 350 operations have been cancelled.
The hospital said it was in the process of contacting those affected and planned to transfer some patients to the Southampton NHS Treatment Centre.
The trust said the hospital had been under "significant pressure" during recent weeks, however urgent admissions would continue to go ahead.
Sarah Hayward, head of operational performance at the Isle of Wight NHS Trust, said: "The trust is sorry for anyone who is experiencing a delay in receiving their operation.
"Whilst we will be able to increase day surgery here at St Mary's Hospital on the island, a number of elective surgeries, requiring a stay of one night or more, may be achieved more quickly at Southampton, reducing the delay for patients."
The trust said patients choosing to be treated in Southampton would have their travel costs for the ferry and taxi paid for by the NHS Treatment Centre.
The 22 mile (35km) journey to Southampton takes up to two hours.
It requires a six mile (10km) journey from Newport to East Cowes, a one hour vehicle ferry crossing, then a two mile (3km) journey from the ferry terminal to the centre at the Royal South Hants Hospital.
Or a four-and-a-half mile (7km) journey from Newport to West Cowes, a 25 minute high-speed ferry crossing, then a two mile (3km) journey from the ferry terminal to the centre at the Royal South Hants Hospital.
