Mrs McGuinness said the family wanted to express their "deep appreciation of the many thousands of people who attended vigils in the course of the week in many parts of Ireland and overseas".
She said they had been "touched by the efforts of so many to provide solace and comfort".
"From Martin's return home on Tuesday, and until we left for the funeral service on Thursday, long queues of people visited our home.
"The family took great comfort from their presence.
"I want to especially acknowledge the many thousands who attended the funeral. Words cannot express our appreciation at the outpouring of love and solidarity, which embraced us throughout Thursday."
