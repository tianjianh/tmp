Winger Matt Phillips punished a horrendous error by midfielder Danny Drinkwater to score the winner for West Brom at champions Leicester.

Two goals in three second-half minutes livened up what had been a dull encounter at the King Power Stadium.
The Baggies scored first when midfielder James Morrison, making his first league start since January, headed in from Phillips' brilliant right-wing cross.
We have to stay together as we did last season when everything was right
Moments later Riyad Mahrez, on Leicester's right, provided a similarly accurate delivery for £29m club-record signing Islam Slimani to nod in his fourth goal since joining the Foxes in the summer.
But with 18 minutes remaining Phillips pounced on the ball after Drinkwater miscontrolled, and strode forward before dinking his shot past keeper Ron-Robert Zieler.
At this stage last season, Claudio Ranieri's side had come away from The Hawthorns with a 3-2 win that lifted them to third in the table. Over the subsequent 27 matches they only dropped points in 10 en route to a stunning Premier League title success.
After 11 games this season, the Foxes have three wins and sit in 14th spot, only two points above the relegation zone.
On Sunday, they mustered only two efforts on target, one of which produced their goal.
One of the three main protagonists in Leicester's success last season who remain at the club, Mahrez, impressed against the Baggies. The other two - Jamie Vardy and Drinkwater - looked lacklustre.
Vardy came off the bench for the third time this season, and with the one chance he had he sent his eight-yard header wide. Drinkwater, Ranieri's dependable midfielder last campaign, produced a careless mistake for the West Brom winner. In total, the central midfielder lost possession 26 times, more than any player apart from the attacking Mahrez.
The Foxes are closing in on a spot in the Champions League knockout stages, but will this extra competition have a detrimental effect on their domestic league campaign?
With current Baggies top scorer Nacer Chadli missing through injury, summer signing Phillips stepped up as a more than able replacement.
Against Leicester he was outstanding. The 25-year-old provided a pinpoint cross for Morrison's headed goal and was alert to Drinkwater's error in the 74th minute, before applying a well-judged finish.
The former QPR man was the standout player on the pitch - he managed a goal, an assist, three shots and three key passes.
Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri: "We tried to do our match - the first half wasn't so good, the second was better.
"Today it wasn't so easy. Maybe we played too much in Champions League.
"We have to speak to find a solution together. I am unhappy because we lost our home record.
"We have to stay together as we did last season when everything was right."
West Brom manager Tony Pulis:  "Phillips should score a lot more goals. It is confidence that is the problem for him. He has the tools to be a very good player.
"He has got everything a top player needs - power and strength and quality on the ball. The big weakness is his belief; he should have no doubts at all.
"I have had a chat with the Chinese owners about bringing good players in over the next few windows. Chadli came in and has been first class - that is what the club have to do."
The Foxes are away at Watford on 19 November for a 15:00 GMT kick-off. Two days later West Brom are at home to Burnley for an 20:00 GMT start.
