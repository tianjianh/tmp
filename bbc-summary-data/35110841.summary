[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Lander, of Montrose, was caught on CCTV at Wagley's bar in Exchange Street and Sizzlers in Guild Street at the end of November.
Lander admitted the crimes at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. He was estimated to have taken about Â£160 in total.
The court heard he had lost his bus ticket home.
Sheriff Donald Ferguson told Lander: "This has crossed the custodial threshold by a large margin.
"This was a mean and despicable offence and it's important that you are jailed immediately."
The tin at Wagley's was in aid of Children's Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) and the bar is raising funds to replace the money.
