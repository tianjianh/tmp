Brian Parker, who represents Marsden ward, told Pendle Council he wanted to sit as an independent on Wednesday.
The Lancashire councillor, who won his seat in 2006, has told the BBC he is now again representing the BNP.
The BNP said it was "pleased to reassure members" that the councillor "has taken up the party whip again".
In a statement, the BNP said Mr Parker "remains the most successful record-breaking BNP councillor in history".
Pendle Council confirmed the development but said it was not commenting on the matter.
