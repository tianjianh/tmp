Shares on Thursday had been boosted by upbeat economic data, but Friday's trading was more subdued.
By the close of trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index had fallen 13 points to 5,120.09.
The Dow Jones fell 104 points to 18,012.14 while the S&P 500 dipped 12 points to 2,109.65.
Analysts said the falls were expected given the rally on Thursday. The fact that the situation in Greece still shows no sign of being resolved didn't help the situation. Eurozone leaders are due to hold an emergency summit on Monday.
Among individual stocks, shares in chocolate maker Hershey fell 3.6% after the company cut its sales growth forecast for this year.
