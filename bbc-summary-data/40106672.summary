County Championship: Ben Coad puts Yorkshire on top against Lancashire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire pace bowler Ben Coad took a career-best 6-25 as Lancashire were skittled for just 123 on day one of a rain-delayed Roses match at Headingley.

Brought on for the 15th over, he then took 4-6 in his first 18 deliveries, starting with England's Haseeb Hameed, caught behind for nine.
But Ryan McLaren and Stephen Parry both made 30 to see Lancs to three figures.
Ryan Sidebottom supported Coad with 3-30 before Adam Lyth made 40 not out as Yorkshire reached stumps on 93-2.
Having drawn at Old Trafford two weeks ago, Lancashire started this return Roses match in fourth place, one spot higher than the hosts.
There was no play before lunch because of the weather but, once under way, after opting to bat, the visitors were soon in trouble when Sidebottom dismissed Alex Davies and Luke Procter with successive balls.
Coad's second delivery accounted for Hameed, whose run of low scores continued, and he followed that up with the wickets of Shiv Chanderpaul and Dane Vilas in the same over.
Lancashire slumped to 48-6 before McLaren and Jordan Clark added 27, the biggest partnership of the innings, which came to an end in the 44th over when Coad had Parry caught at second slip.
Alex Lees fell cheaply at the start of Yorkshire's reply and Peter Handscomb (33) edged Procter to the keeper, but Lyth hit seven fours before the rain returned to end play.
Lancashire captain Steven Croft told BBC Radio Manchester:
"Historically, it is tough to bat later in the game here. It looked quite a good pitch, but it didn't play as well as it looked for us.
"It's by no means a minefield. We didn't bat well as a unit and didn't get any partnerships. We have to keep in mind the Somerset game when we were massively behind in that game and won.
"Coad challenged us ball after ball. He didn't waste too many balls and was ideal on that surface. It's a lesson for us in hitting those areas consistently."
