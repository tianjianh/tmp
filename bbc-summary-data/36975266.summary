The world, European and Commonwealth champion will now meet Ukraine's Tetyana Kob or Bulgarian Stanimira Petrova on 15 August.
Fifth seed Muhammad Ali progresses unchallenged in the men's fly, as does third seed Joe Joyce at heavyweight.
Team GB, who won five medals at London 2012, have a squad of 12 boxers in Rio, each in a different weight class.
During a confusing draw process, officials made no mention of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ratifying a decision to allow 11 Russian boxers to compete at the Games.
The IOC asked individual federations to decide whether Russians could compete following the country's doping scandal.
No Britons drew a Russian opponent.
Commonwealth middleweight champion Anthony Fowler's draw is arguably the toughest as he faces fifth seed Zhanibek Alimkhanuly of Kazhakstan.
Savannah Marshall, also Commonwealth champion, meets Sweden's Anna Laurell Nash at middleweight and could face Dutch second seed Nouchka Fontijn if she wins.
Ireland's Olympic champion Katie Taylor received a bye at lightweight.
