[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oyster extended along Surrey rail route to Gatwick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London's pay-as-you-go Oyster card is being extended to Gatwick Airport and five Surrey railway stations on the route from the airport to the capital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Department for Transport (DfT) said Oyster and contactless payments would be accepted at Horley, Salfords, Earlswood, Redhill and Merstham.
New ticketing arrangements come into force in January, the DfT said.
It follows an agreement between the government, Transport for London and rail operators.
The DfT said the pay-as-you-go fares would be cheaper than normal tickets and available on Southern, Gatwick Express and Thameslink services.
Currently, a single peak-time journey from Gatwick Airport in West Sussex to London terminals costs Â£15.40, compared with Â£14 under pay-as-you-go.
Rail commuters in Reigate and Redhill recently called for calls for London's transport zone to be extended to Surrey amid complaints about a "worsening service".
