A video of Bailey Matthews abandoning his walking aid to cross the finish line was viewed on Facebook more than 27 million times.
The award is in memory of the BBC presenter who died of cancer in 1999.
It is given for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity.
Matthews said: "I think you can stop cheering nowâ€¦ Sport is amazing. Five triathlons next."
The award was presented at the SSE Arena in Belfast by double Olympic swimming champion Becky Adlington and One Direction singer Niall Horan.
Matthews, from Doncaster, competed in the children's event at Castle Howard in North Yorkshire in July, swimming 100m, riding a bike for 4km and running for 1.3km.
Despite stumbling twice on his way to the finish line, he picked himself up and ran the final 20m of the course without his walking frame.
