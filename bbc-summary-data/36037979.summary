Officers said a package weighing over a kilo, which had been delivered from the Netherlands, was discovered at a home in the town on 8 April.
The raid was a joint operation between Border Force and the National Crime Agency.
A 23-year-old man was arrested and charged and appeared at Falkirk Sheriff Court on Tuesday.
The package contained 990g of ecstasy worth £29,700.
Ecstasy tablets worth £4,840 were also recovered at the property.
Det Sgt Forbes Wilson said: "This was an excellent piece of proactive work and shows how effective multi-agency work can be.
"It's always satisfying to get drugs off our streets, particularly when it's a high quantity."
