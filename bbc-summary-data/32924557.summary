The aerobatic team had been the star attraction at a Families Day held at RAF Valley.
The aircraft hit was the leader - Red One - but the pilot and an engineer believed to be aboard were unhurt.
Onlookers said the plane was leaving RAF Valley after the display to return to its base in Lincolnshire when the mishap happened.
An RAF spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that a Hawk aircraft from the Red Arrows suffered an apparent bird strike in the vicinity of RAF Valley this afternoon.
"The aircraft recovered to Valley safely and will undergo checks from specialist engineers to ascertain if any remedial work is required."
