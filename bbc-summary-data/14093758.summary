Senegal profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senegal has traditionally enjoyed one of the most unrestricted press climates in the region.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But media freedom is threatened by "physical attacks on news media, jamming of radio broadcasts, abusive prosecutions and the jailing of journalists", Reporters Without Borders said ahead of polls in 2012.
Self-censorship arises from laws which ban reports that discredit the state, incite disorder or spread "false news". Nevertheless, private media often criticise the government.
Radio is an influential medium. Commercial and community stations have mushroomed.
There are nearly 20 daily newspapers. Foreign publications circulate freely and multichannel pay TV is readily available. BBC World Service (105.6 MHz) and Radio France Internationale are available on FM in Dakar.
By December 2011 there were just under two million internet users (Internetworldstats.com). Access is unrestricted.
