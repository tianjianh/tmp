[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 0-0 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New manager Karl Robinson saw Charlton earn a goalless draw at fourth-placed Bradford in an exciting game of many chances and several narrow escapes at both ends of the pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The result preserved Bradford's unbeaten home record but they had to settle for a point against a Charlton team who played the four minutes of stoppage time with 10 men after defender Patrick Bauer was sent off for a second yellow card.
In the first meeting of the clubs since they were both in the Premier League 15 years ago, Charlton gave the Bradford a defence a torrid time in the first half, hitting the post, seeing a shot cleared off the line and having a penalty appeal turned down.
The penalty appeal came in the ninth minute as Bradford defender Nathaniel Knight-Percival wrestled for the ball with the visitors' dangerous Northern Ireland international striker Josh Magennis.
Three minutes later Magennis saw his angled shot hit the far post and rebound to safety after running on to a pass from strike partner Nicky Ajose, while he also had a shot cleared off the line by Bradford right-back Stephen Darby after taking a pass from Lee Novak.
Bradford's best first-half chance was in the 37th minute when Nicky Law supplied a through pass for Jordy Hiwula, but goalkeeper Dillon Phillips came quickly off his line to block the shot.
The home side had the better of the second half with Hiwula again having their best chance. Mark Marshall played him through on goal in the 59th minute, but he was again denied by Phillips.
