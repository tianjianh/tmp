A&E; demand at Shrewsbury hospital sees operations cancelled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 30 operations have been cancelled at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital because of an increase in emergency patients.

Fifteen were cancelled on Monday and a further 18 on Tuesday, Dr Edwin Borman, medical director at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said.
He has apologised to patients but said they were dealing with an "unprecedented number" of ill people.
He urged people to think carefully about where they seek treatment.
"It's very disappointing but when we have emergency patients coming in needing a bed, compared to elective operations, unfortunately the elective operations get postponed," he said.
Dr Borman said: "If A&E is the best place for your treatment we will provide the best care possible, as quickly as is possible.
"If it isn't, please think of the emergency and urgent patients who really need our A&E services and consider an alternative."
Last weekend, West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was "stretched to the limit" due to near-record 999 calls.
Calls on Saturday were close to what it expected on New Year's Eve, traditionally its busiest time.
