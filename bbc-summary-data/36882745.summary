Salford owner Marwan Koukash has said he will decide his future at the Super League club at the end of the season.

Koukash first questioned his ongoing involvement after Salford failed to overturn a six-point deduction for breaching salary cap rules.
The deduction has put them in danger of relegation, as they now go on to play in The Qualifiers.
"The immediate future is we just need to concentrate on ensuring we've got Super League status," he said.
"As for me, I'm absolutely tired physically, mentally and emotionally and I just want to wait until the end of the year.
"My family suffered recently and I just need that time to think it over. I'll decide at the end of the season what I will do."
If he does choose to end his three-and-a-half-year spell in charge of the Red Devils, Koukash has already decided what will happen in the future.
"I've always said I'm a custodian of the club and it will always belong to the fans," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"I will never sell the club onto another owner. I will put in place fan ownership, the season ticket holders will become the shareholders and they will elect a president, chairman and board."
