Lots of snow but fewer skier days, says Ski-Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's ski centres had deeper snow than some Alpine resorts this season, but there were fewer days when skiing was possible.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ski-Scotland said the season had 235,303 skier days and generated about Â£23.7m for the Scottish economy.
But that was down on the November 2012 to May 2013 season when there were 290,996 skier days, raising more than Â£29m.
High winds and snow that was too deep have been blamed for the fall.
Ski centre staff were sometimes spending more time digging out runs, tows and chairlifts than they were selling tickets.
In total, the latest season had 441 operational days across Scotland's five resorts - CairnGorm, Glencoe, Glenshee, Nevis Range and The Lecht.
Heather Negus, of Ski-Scotland, said: "Back at the end of January, there was deeper snow on most of Scotland's upper pistes than there was in world-renowned resorts in the Alps, Pyrenees and even the Rockies.
"In fact, some pistes in the Highlands were twice as deep as those overseas - and the snow kept on coming and coming."
A skier day means one person who skis or snowboards on one day. Many of the same people return to the slopes several times during the season.
