The Black Cats are the second Premier League club to take the step after West Ham did so as a result of the record television rights deal.
"Keeping the cost of watching football at a realistic level is something that is very topical at present," said chief executive Margaret Byrne.
Liverpool scrapped plans for a £77 matchday ticket after protests by fans.
The Anfield club's dearest ticket will now stay at £59 and the highest season-ticket price is also frozen, after thousands of fans left 77 minutes into the draw with 19th-placed Sunderland on 6 February.
Adult season tickets at the Stadium of Light will start at £350, down by £20, and would compare favourably even if they were relegated to the Championship, where Hull's cheapest season ticket is £531.
