[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company has started to sell cartons of "fresh Shropshire air".

The pots, which are filled in a back garden in Bridgnorth before being heat-sealed, are priced at Â£1 on eBay.
Rachel Moorcroft, who owns novelties company Fun Favours, said she already had the machinery from her previous business selling alcoholic jelly shots.
She claimed to "lovingly harvest" the air, and was hopeful "expats missing home will like to have their own little bit of Shropshire in a pot".
In April 2014, Chinese artist Liang Kegang sold a jar of French mountain air he gathered on a business trip to Provence for 5,250 yuan (Â£494).
He did it as a way of taking a stance about air quality in Beijing after a Chinese businessman sold millions of cans of air when pollution levels soared.
Ms Moorcroft said her venture was "just a bit of fun".
