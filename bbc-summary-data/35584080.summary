[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joey Barton is "petrified" thinking about Everton's future and fears the club's best players will leave in the summer.

The Toffees are 11th in the Premier League but have won just three of their last 13 league games.
Barton, 33, a life-long Everton fan, believes there is discontent among supporters, who he feels have no confidence in manager Roberto Martinez.
"It is really worrying times," Barton told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I know there is discontent because I have dinner with my family once a week, they are all Evertonians and they all moan about what is happening there, some even refuse to go to the games under Martinez, that is how disillusioned they are."
Everton defender John Stones was the subject of interest from Chelsea in August last year, and Barton believes he will be one of several high-profile departures at the end of this season.
The Burnley midfielder added: "This summer Ross Barkley, John Stones, Romelu Lukaku and Seamus Coleman could all potentially leave Everton - what are you left with?
"Everton have very good talented young players but how long are they going to say 'we are not playing Europa League or Champions League and we need to go'?"
