Bournemouth lost a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Arsenal in the Premier League on 3 January.
Barker, on Hitchin's books at the time, posted on Twitter: "Big hype just for a disappointment like the nine months leading up to your child's birth."
A date for a hearing for Barker, who was sacked, will be set in due course.
He was charged with allegedly posting comments which were abusive and/or insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute.
The 18-year-old later apologised for his "disgraceful comments" and said that he would accept any punishment given to him.
Barker, who takes medication to combat the symptoms of ADHD and a mild form of autism, was sacked by both Hitchin and Codicote FC, where he had been on loan.
Arter and partner Rachel's baby daughter Renee was stillborn in December 2015.
