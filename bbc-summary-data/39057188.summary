Arsenal fan Kemp will be delivering his verdict on the performances in the live final of Let it Shine at 18:45 GMT on Saturday on BBC One.
But the Spandau Ballet star has already made his mind up about long-serving Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.
"I think everyone knows where I stand on the Wenger in/out question," Kemp told BBC Sport.
"I have said it openly for the last couple of years that I want him to step down and he has left it too long.
"If he had gone at the end of last season there would have been a few managers to choose from, but if he goes in the summer then there are not many great ones around."
You can make your Premier League predictions now and compare them with those of Lawro and other fans by playing the BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
On FA Cup fifth-round weekend, Lawro got four correct results, with no perfect scores from the eight ties for a total of 40 points.
Lawro was up against ArsenalFan TV's Robbie Lyle, and Sammy, Jack and Ben from the Fulhamish podcast.
He drew with the Fulhamish team, who also got four correct results with no perfect scores, but was beaten by Robbie, who made five correct predictions, including two perfect scores, for 110 points that put him joint-top of the FA Cup leaderboard.
Those scores do not count towards Lawro's total for the season from Premier League fixtures or appear on the guest leaderboard.
All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated.

Leicester v Liverpool (20:00 GMT)
I did not see Claudio Ranieri's sacking coming and I think it is a really strange time to do it, the day after a game [against Sevilla] in a competition [the Champions League] that they are still in.

At this stage of the season, you would have thought they have done it having lined someone else up, otherwise why do it?
Surely we will not see any headlines along the lines of 'search starts for new Foxes boss' on Friday - so I would expect some news on an appointment soon.
Why has it happened? Ranieri has made mistakes and probably kept faith with people who helped Leicester win the title last season for too long, but I have to say he seems like he has been let down by his players.
I made my original prediction for this game before Ranieri's exit and, although I have not changed the score, the situation makes it more difficult for Liverpool.
There is no doubt there will be more of a unified effort from the Leicester team, whether their new manager is in place or not. It always happens.
I still think Liverpool will win, if they play like they did against Tottenham. It suits the Reds when they press teams all over the pitch, and that is definitely the way forward for them.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Kemp's prediction: Haven't Leicester been just awful this season? At the end of last season, when they had just picked up the Premier League trophy, my son told me he had put a bet on that they were going to go down this season. I looked at him and said: 'You are joking, where are you getting that one from?" He said, 'you wait and see, they are going to fall apart' - and where are they now? 0-1
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 140 points (week 22 v James McAvoy)
Lawro's worst score: 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
