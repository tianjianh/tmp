A pensioner has been convicted of drug dealing after DNA traces were found on his clothing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Williamson, 73, of Manse Crescent, Stanley, was identified because heroin, found inside a leopard skin dress, had first been wrapped in his shorts.
Perth Sheriff Court heard that if they had been washed, they would not have been linked to Williamson.
The shorts were found at his home and the heroin was discovered in a box wrapped in the dress.
The haul of drugs was folded up inside Williamson's shorts and were said to have had a potential street value of Â£88,000.
Williamson, was found guilty of being concerned in the supply of diamorphine at his home on 23 December 2014.
Scottish Police Authority forensic scientist Barry Mitchell told the jury: "We would not have expected that DNA to have persisted through washing or laundering. If the item was washed we would not expect the DNA to persist. If kept in good condition it could persist almost indefinitely."
Fiscal depute Gavin Letford said the evidence against Williamson was circumstantial and there was no dispute that the drugs had been found at his home.
He also said the quantity of drugs found, almost a kilo, meant it was being stored for onward supply.
"The accused's DNA was found on the shorts," Mr Letford told the jury. "They were the shorts used to wrap up these 13 packages. That is not disputed.
"The only DNA on the shorts that found a match belonged to John Williamson. They were his shorts and they were used to wrap up these packages.
"It can be reasonably inferred that he used his house to store drugs and used his house as a safe house. He knew these drugs were stored in the storage cupboard."
Williamson was warned he faced a prison sentence, but was freed on bail pending the preparation of background reports.
