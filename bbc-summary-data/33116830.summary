Staff were told on Friday evening that the business has closed and their jobs are gone.
Clerys has been sold to real estate company Natrium Ltd for an undisclosed sum.
Dublin High Court has appointed joint provisional liquidators to the company operating the outlet.
A spokesperson for the liquidators said that Clerys ceased trading at 17:30 BST.
As well as the 130 people employed by the company, around 330 other people are employed by the 50 concession holders, who sold clothes and other goods in the store.
Clerys is one of Europe's oldest purpose-built department stores, and it first opened in 1853 under the name of "The Palatial Mart".
