[SN]TITLE[SN]
New exhibition on Aberdeen FC stadium plans for Kingsford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new exhibition about Aberdeen FC's proposals for a new stadium on the outskirts of the city is to be held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stadium and training facilities would be built at Kingsford, close to the Aberdeen bypass, near Westhill.
The Yes to Kingsford Stadium group believes it would be a vital step forward, but there has been opposition.
The exhibition will be held at Pittodrie on Thursday 24 November from 15:00 to 21:00, at the AAM Suite in the Richard Donald Stand.
It will also provide feedback on the public consultation events staged in Aberdeen, Kingswells and Westhill in July and August.
