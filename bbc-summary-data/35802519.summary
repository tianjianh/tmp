World Grand Prix champion Shaun Murphy has set his sights on winning the World Championship for a second time.

Murphy lost to Stuart Bingham in last year's final but gained revenge with a 10-9 Grand Prix win in Llandudno.
The 33-year-old was 2005 world champion and is keen to win snooker's biggest tournament, which starts in Sheffield next month.
"I got to within three frames of winning last year, let's see if I can go three better this year," he said.
"I think if I can prepare in the same way as I did last year and continue doing the right things that I think I'm doing with my coach and my team, then I arrive in Sheffield in great form and good nick," he said.
"It doesn't mean you're going to win - it doesn't mean you're going to win your first match. But I'll give myself the best possible chance."
Murphy won his sixth ranking event, and his first in two years, by beating Bingham in north Wales and he was delighted to bring what he described as a "slump" to an end.
"I had a fantastic year in 2015 - victory in the Masters, nearly winning the world title and nearly winning the German Masters as well but nothing quite beats taking trophies home," he said.
"That's what we play for. That's what it's all about. No-one comes for second place.
"It's very difficult winning ranking tournaments. With three events left of the season it really points to good things for me "
