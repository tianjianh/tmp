[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pure Wafer factory was damaged in a blaze before Christmas last year.
A total of 68 firefighters tackled the fire at the silicon chip recycling plant on Millbrook Drive, Llansamlet.
Gleeds Management Service, on behalf of Pure Wafer, have now submitted plans for external cladding, a new roof, structural steel frame and internal works at the site.
At the time of the incident, chief executive Richard Howells said he was thankful no one had been injured at the factory which employs 130 staff.
