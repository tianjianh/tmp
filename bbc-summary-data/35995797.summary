Victory at Sixfields for the Cobblers, who are 14 points clear at the top with six games remaining, would secure them at least an automatic promotion spot.
But Rovers, whose top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions this term is Taylor, have their own promotion hopes.
"We have a gameplan to try to execute a win," he told BBC Radio Bristol.
"It will be a tough game. But we'll be going there to ruin their promotion party."
Manager Darrell Clarke added: "Northampton are going to win the league and they thoroughly deserve it. We will go there with respect.
"But we'll be expecting to win. We'll have a gameplan to try and win a football match. The expectation will always be sky-high here, while I'm manager."
Clarke's third-placed side go into Saturday's game level on points with fourth-placed Plymouth and fifth-placed Accrington, and two points behind Oxford United.
