[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Army medic has told an inquest he raised concerns about not having enough medics prior to a fatal SAS selection exercise.

The soldier, known as 1U to protect his identity, also said he had to arrange for more water for his checkpoint because it nearly ran out.
L/Cpl Craig Roberts, of Conwy county, L/Cpl Edward Maher, and Cpl James Dunsby from Trowbridge, died attempting the march in the Brecon Beacons.
It was on one of 2013's hottest days.
The inquest had previously heard it took medics about an hour to reach casualties on the 16-mile (26km) march.
1U was asked about the medical plans and how an evacuation would be performed.
"It would take us time to get there, and especially with heat injuries time is against you," he said.
"I raised it several times in the past that we don't have enough medics, but we had to work with the resources we had."
He said he raised the issue with those higher in the chain of command within his reserve unit, but not directly with Signal Regiment that was running the exercise that day.
1U said he would usually have a radio, but did not that day because "there weren't enough to go around".
The coroner, Louise Hunt, asked if he told the directing staff why a soldier, 2J, was withdrawn earlier in the day.
"I didn't, no, because I was still trying to cool him down at that particular point," he said.
1U added that it was not routine practice in 2013 to detail why a candidate was being withdrawn, other than it was for medical reasons.
The coroner asked: "How can the commanders make decisionsâ€¦ if they don't have knowledge about medical withdrawals?"
"I don't know," he replied.
