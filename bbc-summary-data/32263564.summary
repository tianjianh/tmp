Brownlee clocked one hour 46 minutes 51 seconds to beat Mario Mola by 18 seconds with fellow Spaniard Javier Gomez a further 10 seconds back.
"I thought 'let's be aggressive', I think it hurts the guys," said the 24-year-old, who also won in New Zealand.
USA's Gwen Jorgensen won the women's event for her eighth victory in a row.
Brownlee, whose brother Alistair is still injured, won in Auckland last month after finishing fifth in the season-opener in Abu Dhabi.
He added: "On the run I knew they would take time out of me on the first lap, then I thought 'be steady, and if I run 30:30 it's going to take a great run for them to catch me', and fortunately they didn't."
Brownlee leads the rankings with 2,186 points, 219 ahead of Gomez.
The next event is in Cape Town in South Africa, where Jonathan will not compete but Alistair hopes to return.
In the women's race, Sarah True was second and Katie Zaferes finished third to make it an all-American podium. Britain's Lucy Hall was 25th and Jessica Learmonth was 30th.
World champion Jorgensen served a 15-second penalty after the cycling leg for not racking her bike properly but dominated the final run leg to win her third event of 2015.
"One, two, three for Team USA, I don't think you can get any better standing on the podium and looking over and seeing the other two girls and hearing the national anthem," she said.
Watch highlights on Sunday, 12 April from 13:20 BST on BBC Two.
