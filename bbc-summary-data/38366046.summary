A cancer charity is giving £16m to help Scottish scientists develop new treatments for the disease.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cancer Research UK has promised £8m to its Edinburgh centre where researchers are focusing on brain tumours.
Another £8m will go to its Glasgow centre which is a world leader in pancreatic cancer research.
Much of the funding will go towards training the next generation of researchers, including 30 PhD students across both cities
The Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre is a partnership between the charity, the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian.
Prof Margaret Frame, science director at the Edinburgh centre, said: "From research into how brain tumours develop and grow, to identifying genetic and environmental markers that could help diagnose bowel cancer sooner, Edinburgh is home to world-class cancer research.
"This award represents a critical investment in the research infrastructure at Edinburgh, equipping us with the key laboratory and clinical tools needed to advance the understanding and treatment of cancer for the benefit of people in Scotland and beyond."
The Cancer Research UK Glasgow Centre is a partnership between the charity, the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde, and the Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde.
Prof Owen Sansom, interim director at the Beatson Institute, said: "This investment is fantastic news for cancer research in Glasgow.
"The city is home to a thriving community of world-class cancer scientists and doctors, who are working to reduce the devastating impact of this disease, not only locally, but around the world.
"This award means we will be able to further develop our work in translational research - getting cutting-edge discoveries from the laboratory to patients and learning as much as possible from patients to initiate new research."
The grants are part of £190m committed to 13 Cancer Research UK centres over the next five years.
