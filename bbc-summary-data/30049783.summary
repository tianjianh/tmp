Any young mutant will know that the fictional Xavier Institute For Higher Learning is in Salem, New York.

But luckily for anyone less familiar with X-Men, Professor Charles Xavier's school has appeared on Google Maps.
The building, described by Marvel as a "safe haven" for mutants, can be seen just off Keeler Lane in North Salem.
Despite 60 reviews of the school's faculties, a quick scan of Street View confirms that the site is indeed empty in reality.
However, those with an eye for finer detail will note that the institute is listed at 1407 Graymalkin Lane, Westchester County, New York in the comics.
Search the address and you'll find Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.
But again, another look at Street View and there is no sign of Wolverine and co.
Marvel recently announced its film release schedule until 2019, including Captain Marvel, Black Panther and a new two-part Avengers sequel.
