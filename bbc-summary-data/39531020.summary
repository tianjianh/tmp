Changes allowing people to keep more of their savings when they move into residential care come into effect on Monday.

The limit will move from £25,000 to £30,000 as part of a Welsh Government plan to raise it in phases to £50,000.
Labour had promised at the assembly election to double the amount people can keep.
The first increase is expected to benefit about 250 care home residents who pay for full time care in Wales.
A total of 4,000 care home residents pay for the full cost of their care.
Social services minister Rebecca Evans said: "Older people who have worked hard and paid in all their lives deserve a fairer deal."
A full disregard of the War Disablement Pension (WDP) is also being introduced, meaning veterans do not need to use any part of it to pay for care they need.
The Welsh Government said there were 6,500 recipients of a WDP in Wales, with an estimated 150 of these receiving social care.
