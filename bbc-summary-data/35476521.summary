[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pearson, 23, made one appearance for Leicester and previously had spells on loan with Carlisle United and Wrexham.
He was sacked by the Foxes in June 2015 after he took part in a racist sex tape filmed on a club tour of Thailand.
Pearson, son of former Leicester boss Nigel, was one of three players released by the club after an internal investigation into the incident.
"I'm very happy to have signed for Barnet. Now it's time to get going and to get some games under my belt," he told the club's website.
