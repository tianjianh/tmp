[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dementia patients on a Kent ward had to wear incontinence pads whether needed or not, care inspectors have said.

The ward at Littlestone Lodge in Dartford was singled out in a report on the wider Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust.
The mental health trust required improvement in four out of five areas.
Trust chief Angela McNab welcomed the report which she said showed where improvements were needed. She said action had been taken at Littlestone.
Dr Paul Lelliott, the Care Quality Commission's deputy chief inspector of hospitals and lead for mental health, criticised some of the trust's environments including too-small seclusion rooms, and wards with high bed occupancy.
He said inspectors were particularly concerned about Littlestone Lodge and managers should have acted sooner.
Inspectors there found unsafe administration of medicine, patients wearing incontinence pads when they were not needed, and two patients who needed immediate action to address their needs.
Across the trust, there was high use of agency staff, varying quality of care plans, failure to meet guidance on same-sex accommodation and processes that were not identifying risks.
But he said the trust was rated "good" for being caring.
Ms McNab said: "What the report really clearly articulates is those areas where we're providing very high quality, really good services.
"It also shines a light on those areas where there's a little bit further to go, and some improvements that we need to continue making."
She said some buildings were not fit for purpose, some systems had gaps, and the trust was under pressure and trying to recruit more staff.
At Littlestone Lodge, the trust had begun action when the CQC came in, she added.
Managers there referred the BBC to the mental health trust for comment.
