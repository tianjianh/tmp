[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man jailed after he tried to grab a gun at a US rally in an apparent bid to kill Donald Trump fears the president may extend his 12-month sentence.

Michael Sandford, 20, of Surrey, admitted last year to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function.
The incident happened in Las Vegas in the run-up to the US election.
His mother said he feared Mr Trump would make an example of him and extend his term or block his return to the UK.
At Sandford's sentencing in December, the court heard he could be eligible for release after four months, at which point he will be deported to the UK.
Lynne Sandford, from Dorking, said: "I have tried to keep him grounded, that Mr Trump has lots more important things on his hands. But as Michael said, 'I did try to kill him. How would you feel?'
"He's just terribly worried that Mr Trump will make an example of him for what he tried to do by blocking him coming back to the UK or having him spending years longer in prison for various reasons."
Sandford has autism, suffers from mental health problems and was diagnosed as having had a psychotic episode at the time of the incident last June.
His mother said he had been frequently put on suicide watch in prison and Trump-supporting guards and inmates were making his life a misery.
"He can't relax and he doesn't know whether he can trust anybody," she added.
Sandford initially denied the charges but faced a 20 year jail term if convicted and admitted the offences following a plea agreement.
