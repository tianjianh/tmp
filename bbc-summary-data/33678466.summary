Belfast animal feed company Thompsons is investing £2.5m in a new heat and energy plant.

The new gas-powered plant will save up to £300,000 a year and make the company self-sufficient for energy.
It will also mean a 10% cut in the company's CO2 emissions - the equivalent of taking around 350 cars off Northern Ireland's roads.
The savings will be invested in the research and development of more efficient feed products.
The company has also signed what is known as a "prosperity agreement" with the authorities that regulate the industry.
The intention is to make the relationship between business and regulator less adversarial and more collaborative.
Businesses agree to operate above the minimum required environmental standards.
The regulator - in this case the Department of the Environment - agrees to cut red tape for companies that demonstrate compliance with environmental regulation.
Visiting Thompsons, Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: "This is not just about reduced CO2 emissions. More nutritious animal food produced by it means less harmful emissions into the environment from farm livestock.
"Better awareness of environmental responsibilities on farms will further demonstrate that Northern Ireland is serious about creating a world-class clean, green agri-food sector."
Declan Billington of Thompsons added: "The signing of this agreement affirms Thompsons belief that improving on-farm production efficiencies through nutrition will also improve the environmental footprints of farms and will profit both rural communities and the environment as a result."
This is the third prosperity agreement signed by Northern Ireland companies.
Thompsons employs 165 workers and produces 850,000 tonnes of feed a year across all agricultural sectors.
It accounts for about 40% of the agricultural feed market in Northern Ireland.
