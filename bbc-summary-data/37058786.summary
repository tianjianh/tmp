Waseem Al-Muflehi, 15, and Yahya Mohammed, 14, both from Birmingham, disappeared in the water at Barmouth beach, in Gwynedd, last Sunday.
Coastguard teams searched for them for three days but the hunt was called off on Tuesday.
The body has not yet been identified but the families have been informed.
The boys were part of a group of about 500 people from the Somali and Yemeni communities in Birmingham, who were visiting the area last weekend when the incident happened.
Emergency services were called to the beach on Sunday after one of the boys was seen to "disappear under the water".
Members of their group tried to help them but the wind and waves were said to have been too strong.
