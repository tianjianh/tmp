[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Walsh, 53, has been a West Indies selector for two years and his contract with Bangladesh will run until the 2019 World Cup in England.
Bangladesh face Afghanistan in three 50-over matches before England visit in October, despite security concerns.
Walsh, who took 519 Test wickets, said the job was a chance to work with a "seriously talented bunch of players".
He will work with head coach Chandika Hathurusingha, the Sri Lankan former Test all-rounder who has been in charge of the national side since 2014.
