The 37-year-old ended his career with the Bluebirds in 2014 and made 91 appearances during two spells with his hometown club.
In the role, Bellamy will oversee the club's youth development as they progress to the first team.
"It's a position I feel passionately about and one that comes with huge responsibility," Bellamy said.
"To be appointed in such a role is a fantastic honour for me."
Bellamy played for seven clubs in the Premier League and made 78 appearances for Wales before retiring from international football in October 2013.
During two spells with Liverpool, he won the 2006 Community Shield and the 2011-12 League Cup, where they beat Cardiff City on penalties in the final.
A season later, he moved to Cardiff City on a permanent basis and helped the club win promotion to the Premier League for the first time.
The club's executive director and CEO Ken Choo said: "The Club has recently undertaken an internal restructure of its academy and development programmes.
"With this firmly in mind, it's felt that having somebody of Craig's stature in this role can be of huge significance to us moving forward.
"I know that Neil [Warnock] feels Craig's influence here can create greater synergy between our youth players and the first-team with the ultimate goal of bringing players through to senior football."
