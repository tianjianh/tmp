Serial bird thief Dean Wells given time to behave

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A serial bird thief who admitted stealing a pensioner's racing pigeons in Aberdeen has been given time to show he can behave.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Wells, 23, of Fochabers, admitted taking 24 of the birds from a back garden in the city's Auchmill Road in April.
Police managed to return the pigeons to their owner three days later.
Sheriff William Taylor deferred sentence for six months for Wells "to be of good behaviour".
Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard that Wells had previously been convicted of stealing pigeons in Inverness and budgies in Elgin.
