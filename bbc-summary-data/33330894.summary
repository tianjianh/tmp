Four "randy" bulls had to be kept at bay with water jets while a trapped cow was rescued in Derbyshire.

The bulls were found circling the heifer, after its head became lodged between two trees on a steep bank in Alfreton, police said.
The RSPCA said the stricken cow was very weak, dehydrated and surrounded by "uncastrated male Limousin bulls".
It took three hours to release the cow, which has since been "recovering" from the ordeal, earlier this month.
RSPCA animal welfare officer Andy Snowdon said he was grateful firefighters from Matlock and Alfreton used their hoses to keep the bulls away.
"Their jets of water helped keep me safe while we winched the trees apart and managed to free the cow," he said.
"I love all animals, but I have to admit having four large randy bulls circling around me was quite an interesting experience and one I don't want to repeat any time soon."
The cow appeared tired but in good health after an RSPCA vet checked it over, following the rescue on 20 June.
