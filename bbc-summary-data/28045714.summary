Trojan Horse: Reports have 'broken down trust' in Birmingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people have attended a meeting to discuss the fallout from the Trojan Horse inspections of Birmingham schools.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bordesley Centre in Camp Hill heard concerns about inspection reports linked to an anonymous letter alleging an Islamic takeover plot of schools.
A number of speakers told the crowd they believed the reports were biased.
Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has previously agreed to meet parents and children from the affected schools.
