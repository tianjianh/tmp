Workington welcomes RNLI 'legacy' lifeboat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £2m "advanced" lifeboat, partially-funded by a legacy, has arrived at a Cumbrian port.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Workington's RNLI Shannon-class vessel is powered by water jets rather than propellers, making it 50% faster than the one it is replacing.
The charity said this would enable it to reach those in need more quickly.
It will be named Dorothy May White after the woman who left a £1m bequest to the charity in her will.
Mrs May White, who lived in Birmingham and died in 2012, was a life-long supporter of the RNLI and left her entire estate to the charity on the condition it fund a new lifeboat somewhere in the UK.
