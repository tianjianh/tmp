One-Day Cup: Glamorgan beat Hampshire despite James Vince record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan won a last-over thriller by three wickets, despite a superb county record knock of 178 from Hampshire captain James Vince.

Vince's knock came off 138 balls as he dominated in a fourth-wicket stand of 221 with Liam Dawson (74) in their 332-6.
But Colin Ingram's 115 off 78 balls got Glamorgan's chase going, though they still needed 113 off 10 overs.
Chris Cooke blasted 59 off 27 as Glamorgan swung their way to victory.
Marchant de Lange claimed a career-best 5-49 despite the run rampage.
Vince and Dawson came together in the ninth over after de Lange's opening three-wicket spell, and timed their acceleration perfectly.
Vince smashed 18 fours and five sixes as he took the rest of the Glamorgan attack apart, with his innings just beating the previous record of 177 by West Indies great Gordon Greenidge, also against Glamorgan in Southampton back in 1975.
South African paceman de Lange proved effective at both ends of the innings, before being taken off for bowling a second high full-toss in his last over.
Glamorgan's chances were not helped by a hand injury suffered by captain Jacques Rudolph while stopping a ferocious Vince drive, which meant he batted down the order.
But yet another classy performance from Ingram gave them an outside chance, sharing stands of 73 with Kiran Carlson (33) and 92 with Rudolph (28) as he passed 7,000 runs in limited-overs cricket.
Glamorgan needed 38 off 2.3 overs when Ingram was out, but Cooke's stunning hitting took them to victory with a ball to spare.
Glamorgan's Chris Cooke told BBC Wales Sport:
"When Kiran Carlson was batting with Colin they were going really well, then Jacques came in, gave Colin the strike and he kept hitting sixes- from then on, we thought it was going to be unlikely but there was a chance.
"When you've almost got nothing to lose with a high run-rate, you just say 'let's give it a go' and luckily today it came off.
"I hit it (the winning six) and I knew I'd got it, it was great to win the game and it was a brilliant run-chase."
Fast bowler Marchant de Lange added:
"A personal best, I'm very happy with that, but from the team point of view the chase was spectacular.
"Mature guys came to the party, they know their roles and it was nice to be there at  the end with Chris Cooke who smacked the winning six.
"It's always good to win, it keeps morale up and I'm very glad Robert Croft didn't rest me!"
Hampshire captain James Vince told BBC Radio Solent:
"It hurts posting a total like that and not defending it, it was (a case of) execution at times but Ingram and Cooke struck it pretty well, it's hard to take.
"At the half-way stage (of the game) we were happy especially after losing three early wickets, to chase 330-odd on any ground is a good effort.
"We'll pick ourselves up, two big games (to come) and if we win two there's still a good chance of qualifying."
