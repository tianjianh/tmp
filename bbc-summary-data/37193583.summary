The body of Shana Grice, 19, was found at a house in Chrisdory Road, Mile Oak, Portslade, after she failed to turn up for work on Thursday morning.
Sharon Grice and Richard Green, from Hove, said she was "our beautiful girl... who always thought of others".
A 27-year-old Portslade man was arrested on Thursday afternoon at an address in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.
Sussex Police said magistrates granted a warrant authorising his continued detention until Sunday if necessary.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was notified of Ms Grice's death as police had been in contact with her and "other people" previously, Sussex Police said.
No one else was in the house when her body was found. The cause of death has not yet been established but it is being treated as suspicious.
Residents said fire engines as well as police were called to the scene and that one man tried to get into the property to rescue Ms Grice.
"He said he heard a lot of shouting," the resident said.
"They broke in and there was smoke inside the property.
"He could see somebody in one of the bedrooms but he could see she had died."
Ms Grice worked in the accounts department of Palmer and Harvey, a company in Hove.
Director Brian Hurley said everyone was "extremely shocked and saddened" to hear of her death.
"Whilst Shana only worked with us for a few months, she was a very well-liked and popular member of the Palmer and Harvey family.
"We have set up counselling for staff and will support them as best we can, as we all come to terms with the tragic news," he said.
