Disco lights, music and Doctor Who are helping to take the fear out of surgery for patients with learning disabilities at a south Wales hospital.

Princess of Wales dental surgery staff in Bridgend put patients at ease by letting them play their favourite film or video game as they go to sleep.
Workers said it helped reduce stress and helped staff gain their trust.
The Spa - Soothing Patients' Anxiety - approach has won two health board awards.
Operating department practitioner Paul Harris said: "Often some patients have very rigid routines and if they become distressed it can cause complex behavioural issues.
"They have a very unique view of the world and we have to tap into that view and try to fit their norm into our environment.
"We try to keep their anxiety manageable so it doesn't distress them and trigger behaviour that could cause harm to themselves or to others."
Items such as toys, balloons, bubbles and magic tricks are popular, along with sensory toys such as disco lights and torches.
Mr Harris said characters including Doctor Who and Thomas the Tank Engine were among the favourites with patients, but one of the department's earliest success was bubble wrap.
"... and you cannot get much simpler than that," he added.
