Recycling rates for waste in Wales rise again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More rubbish is being recycled in Wales than last year with figures showing a 2% rise to 54%.

All Welsh councils need to meet a target of 58% by 2016 with Denbighshire and Monmouthshire and Pembrokeshire already passing that figure.
But four authorities have seen their rates fall in the last year and Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf failed to recycle half of their waste.
Natural Resources Minister John Griffiths backed the figures.
He said Wales led the UK in recycling and was on course to reach targets of 58% by 2016 and 70% by 2025.
"It's great to see that Welsh households and local authorities are continuing to increase the amount they recycle and reuse," he said.  "I want to congratulate them for their efforts."
He added councils would get a share of Â£4m Welsh government funding this year to help them meet the required targets.
The report from Statistics for Wales notes that recycling rates may vary according to people's willingness to take part in the recycling schemes, and differences in the methods used by local authorities.
In June, a key Welsh government adviser warned household recycling services were too complicated, uneconomic and confusing.
Sustainable futures commissioner Peter Davies called for one system of recycling rather than 22 different ones in each local authority.
