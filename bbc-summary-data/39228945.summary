British Cycling: 'Sufficient care and attention' not paid to wellbeing of riders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British Cycling has admitted it did not pay "sufficient care and attention" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The organisation was responding to a leaked draft report of an investigation into alleged failings in its culture.
Published in the Daily Mail, it claims British Cycling "sanitised" its own probe into claims Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Jess Varnish.
It also spoke of a "culture of fear", with some staff "bullied".
The leaked draft is reported to conclude:
In response, British Cycling says it accepts:
In October, British Cycling found Sutton guilty on one from nine charges of using sexist language towards Varnish, who was dropped from British Cycling's elite programme last April.
The Australian, who quit in the wake of Varnish's allegations, was found to have used the word "bitches", but claims that he used other offensive and discriminatory language were not upheld.
That included Varnish's complaint that Sutton told her to "go and have a baby".
Sutton was also cleared of any bullying allegations, including claims he made comments about the cyclist's weight.
However, the Daily Mail quotes the leaked draft as saying "considerably more" of Varnish's claims had been proven, but these findings were "reversed".
The Mail quotes the draft report as describing this as "shocking and inexcusable", adding that it "calls into serious question whether the composition of the British Cycling board is fit to govern".

An investigation into the culture at British Cycling was launched last year following "disturbing" claims of "fundamental behavioural issues".
A number of ex-riders and former staff members have added to Varnish's claims, including former road world champion Nicole Cooke, who told a parliamentary select committee the body was "run by men, for men".
The investigation is chaired by British Rowing chief Annamarie Phelps, and was co-commissioned by UK Sport and British Cycling.
A report on its findings is imminent, and UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl has said "valuable lessons" have been identified.
But she also criticised British Cycling for providing "a very light-touch version" when asked to provide details of its own November 2012 internal investigation.
Earlier in March, British Cycling chairman Jonathan Browning apologised for "failings", as the governing body announced planned changes designed to improve the care of riders.
