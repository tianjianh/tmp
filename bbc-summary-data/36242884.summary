Celtic manager Ronny Deila paid tribute to his side's consistency in the Premiership after they sealed a fifth straight Scottish top-flight title.

A 3-2 victory over closest challengers Aberdeen opened up a 12-point gap with two games to play.
And it sealed a second title in two years for Deila, who will leave the club this summer.
"We have shown that we are the best team," the Norwegian told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
"It means that we are the best team in Scotland. It's a very, very good achievement."
Deila announced he would be departing shortly after Celtic's Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Rangers, having also lost a League Cup semi-final to Ross County this season.
The Premiership winners also had a disappointing European campaign - dropping into the Europa League from the Champions League qualifiers for a second year in a row and finishing bottom of their group.
"We have lost important games, that makes the season a little bit more grey than white but in the league we have been very, very consistent and we haven't lost since we played Aberdeen up there in the beginning of February," Deila explained.
"We have done a lot of good things but the last two months, we haven't had that real energy in the team like we had before in the season.
"I've had fantastic staff around me. The players have been supporting me all the time, working really, really hard and I'm very, very happy for them.
"It's been two long seasons - I'm not used to having so long seasons - it's been tough but it's good when you cross the line.
"It's a special place to be here in Celtic, in paradise, so of course I'm going to miss it."
Against the Dons, Celtic opened up a 3-0 lead with Patrick Roberts firing home twice in the first half and Mikael Lustig finishing well shortly after the break.
However, Aberdeen replied with Niall McGinn slotting past Craig Gordon and Andy Considine heading the visitors' second.
"The players here have great talent and they're young but when things are going against us, it's important to be brave and to be strong; to have that belief and confidence to play in difficult situations," Deila said of Celtic's performance.
Roberts, who impressed with his two left-foot strikes, said: "It's always good scoring goals and to do it to win the title is great and I've enjoyed it very much. It was unreal out there on Celtic Park."
And, asked what his targets were for next season, the on-loan Manchester City winger replied: "Obviously it's the treble and Champions League."
The teenager will remain with the club next term and now has five Celtic goals to his name.
Top scorer Leigh Griffiths is nearing 40 goals for the season and said: "It's been one of the best [seasons] of my life.
"Thirty-nine goals - I've still got one game to go as I'm suspended for the last game.
"We're champions again, deservedly so."
