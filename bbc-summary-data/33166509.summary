It's the second chick from mum, Cora and dad, Bigglesworth who is now 23 and the oldest penguin at Chessington.
He's been keeping a constant watch to try to protect the nest.
The colony of penguins moved into a new enclosure in March.
Keeper Nick Tulley said: ''The transition into the new enclosure was so smooth and the penguin couples all settled back into their original nests.
It is rare to see a successful birth happen so quickly.''
