[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 0-1 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Craig Tanner scored the winning goal as Plymouth reclaimed top spot by beating struggling Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pilgrims had slipped down the table, after Doncaster's lunchtime win, but Tanner fired the ball through home goalkeeper Elliot Parish's legs in the 78th minute.
It was tough on Stanley, who created plenty of chances but could not find a way past in-form Plymouth goalkeeper Luke McCormick.
The first real chance came in the 20th minute with Plymouth striker Jordan Slew firing inches wide of the far post.
Stanley bossed first-half possession, but McCormick was not called into action until the 40th minute when he rescued his side in quick succession.
He kept out Bristol City loanee Zak Vyner's curling effort and, one minute later, superbly tipped Jordan Clark's fierce strike over the crossbar.
The home side continued to press after the break with Billy Kee heading just wide, while Seamus Conneely's shot hit a defender and looped up on to the woodwork.
But the deciding goal came when David Goodwillie played through fellow substitute Tanner and he fired the ball through Parish's legs.
