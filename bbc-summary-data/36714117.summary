County Championship: Keaton Jennings ton sets up strong Durham reply v Hampshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Keaton Jennings struck his fifth first-class century of the season as Durham declared on 421-9, 51 runs behind, on day three against Hampshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jennings, who has now scored 867 runs this summer, batted for almost six hours for his 129 off 261 balls.
Ben Stokes (51) earlier scored a run-a-ball half-century as he continued to prove his fitness in front of watching England selector James Whitaker.
Hampshire safely negotiated six overs to close on 9-0, 60 runs in front.
Left-hander Jennings, began on 36 and he and overnight partner Jack Burnham went on to add 158 for the third wicket.
Burnham fell to Ryan McLaren for 74, but Stokes soon picked up the momentum, striking eight boundaries and sharing a further 90 runs with Jennings.
The all-rounder, hoping to make England's squad for the first Test against Pakistan at Lord's on 14 July, fell three balls after reaching fifty when Hampshire captain Will Smith breached his defence.
Hampshire took three lower-order Durham wickets for just seven runs, but after McLaren was forced off with a hamstring injury which is expected to rule him out for two weeks, Barry McCarthy produced some lusty blows in an unbeaten 51 to push the Durham total beyond 400.
The Irishman brought up his maiden first-class half-century off just 47 balls as he and Graham Onions added an unbroken 72 for the last wicket.
