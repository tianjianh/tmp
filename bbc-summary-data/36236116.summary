The idea is one of several being discussed by European governing body Uefa as it looks to maximise interest in its flagship club competition.
Change to the Champions League schedule would not happen for at least five years because of broadcasting cycles.
"We are in constant dialogue with all stakeholders and any decisions will be taken in agreement with them," said a Uefa spokesman.
"It is far too early to speculate about changes to the formats of our club competitions."
The Champions League, previously known as the European Cup, has been played as a midweek competition since 1968.
Its final was played in midweek until 2010 but now takes place on a Saturday.
Weekend games could be staged at times more suited to the television audience in the Far East but would require changes to domestic schedules.
