The Scottish Fish Farm Production Survey 2014 report said 179,022 tonnes of farmed Atlantic salmon were produced - 10% more than in 2013.
Rainbow trout, halibut and trout production also increased.
The survey also reported that the number of jobs in the fish farming industry rose from 1,625 in 2013 to 1,796 last year.
Environment minister Aileen McLeod welcomed the figures.
She said: "Salmon is a key part of our economy providing employment and investment, particularly in some of our most remote, coastal communities.
"Salmon is Scotland's number one food export and is highly valued across the world for its exceptional quality and provenance."
Ms McLeod added: "Aquaculture revenue in Scotland is now estimated to be worth Â£1.86bn annually to the economy, an increase of Â£110m year-on-year, and supports over 8,300 jobs.
"If industry's sustainable growth targets, supported by the Scottish government, are met this value will rise to well over Â£2bn a year and support 10,000 jobs across Scotland by 2020."
Animal conservation organisation WWF Scotland said the fish farming industry should commit to protecting the environment from harm as a result of its activities.
Director Lang Banks said: "Scotland's salmon farming industry must be about quality, not just quantity.
"It must be about protecting the environment, not putting it at risk.
"With the environmental impacts of salmon farming under close scrutiny once again, more of the industry needs to commit to independent labelling schemes - such as that run by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council - which will improve transparency and allow consumers to know that their salmon was produced to the very best environmental standards."
