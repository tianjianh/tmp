South Wales Police and Gwent Police are bidding goodbye to paper and pens and using mobile devices instead.
The electronic notebook and I-Patrol app means officers can take audio and video accounts from witnesses and victims and upload data onto a system without returning to a police station.
It was developed over two years with the help of a Â£1.5m Home Office grant.
Gwent police and crime commissioner Ian Johnston said the purpose was to minimise the time officers have to spend in stations and not on the streets, as well as saving time and money.
South Wales Police's Assistant Chief Constable, Richard Lewis, added: "Technology is always changing and, despite the current financial challenges, we are committed to making best use of innovation to fight crime and keep out communities safe.
"Our officers have more information at their fingertips than has ever been previously possible and we are confident the public will benefit."
