Robert Edward Pittam had denied 13 counts of attempted rape and one of rape, but was convicted following a trial in November.
The 43-year-old, of Seatonville Road, Whitley Bay, has now been sentenced to a 17-year term by the judge at Newcastle Crown Court.
The offences took place between 2008 and 2012.
Det Supt Roger Ford, or Northumbria Police, said: "Pittam is an evil man and a predator and he will be behind bars for a very long time.
"The victim showed tremendous courage in reporting this to police and I would like to thank her and her family for supporting us throughout the investigation."
