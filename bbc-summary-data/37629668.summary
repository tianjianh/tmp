Artist Luke Jerram was commissioned by 20-21 Arts Centre in Scunthorpe to produce the work called Treasured City.
Five small objects from North Lincolnshire Museum were selected for wax replicas which will be cast in Â£1,000 worth of 18-carat gold.
From February the gold replicas will be hidden for the public to find and keep.

Clues for the treasure hunt will be disguised in five paintings which will be on display at the Arts Centre.
Dominic Mason, 20-21's exhibition officer, said the clues would vary in difficulty, but one would be so hard to crack that the gold may not be found.
"As a legacy for the project ,this painting will remain on display in the North Lincolnshire Museum with the associated golden artefact remaining hidden for the public to find one day," he said.
Bristol-based artist Luke Jerram said: "I like the idea that ancient objects that were once hidden beneath the earth and were discovered and displayed at the museum are now being re-hidden."
The exhibition, funded by the Lottery and Arts Council England, will run from 18 February until 29 April.
