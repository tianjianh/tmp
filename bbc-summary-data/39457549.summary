Dozens of men brandished weapons including a hammer, knives, iron bars and threw chairs at the Bangladeshi Community Centre, in Harehills, Leeds.
Police said officers attending the meeting in May 2015 were left in a "dangerous and intimidating situation".
Six men involved in the violence, including the man who wielded the hammer, were jailed earlier this week.
Det Supt Pat Twiggs said the violent scenes were "absolutely appalling".

"Against a background of tensions around the centre's hierarchy, a large number of people went to the meeting intent on causing violence, with some having hidden weapons around the building ready to use," he said.
A local community police officer and two PCSOs soon found themselves vastly outnumbered, Det Supt Twigg said.
"Despite that, they did everything they could to protect people and restore order, and put themselves in between those who were fighting until other colleagues arrived."
Det Supt Twigg said 32 people had convicted of a range of offences.
The final six men, including Shamin Hussain, who is seen in the footage wielding a hammer, were given jail terms on Wednesday.
Hussain, 40, of Hares Mount, Chapeltown, was jailed for six years after being convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of an offensive weapon and violent disorder.
Syed Ahmed, 51, of Ellers Road, Chapeltown; Thuhel Ahmed, 40, of Cowper Street, Chapeltown; Shumon Abedin, 49, of Holt Rise, Adel; Rofique Islam, 47, of Potternewton Mount, were each given eight months for violent disorder.
Abdul Hasan, 32, of Hill Top Mount, Chapeltown, was convicted of possession of an offensive weapon and was jailed for eight months.
