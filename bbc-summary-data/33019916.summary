The Grade II listed Scenic Railway rollercoaster, badly damaged in an arson attack in 2008, was due to be the centrepiece on 19 June.
The refurbishment of the park - which originally opened in 1920 - has cost Â£18m and began in September.
The funfair, once home to Europe's largest big wheel, was bought by Thanet council in 2013.
Susan Marsh, honorary secretary of the Dreamland Trust, said the delay in the rollercoaster's completion was "disappointing", but "only a blip".
"We don't have an exact date at the moment [when it will be ready], but it will be as fast as it possibly can be," she said.
"The delay is in respect to the trains and restoration of the trains, because these are quite unique features.
"When the arson attack happened a few years ago they were very badly damaged."
She said she did not know whether the operator would provide a refund to people who have already bought a ticket.
