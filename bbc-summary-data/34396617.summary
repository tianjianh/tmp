A new campaign has been set up to protect historic swimming baths across the country.

Historic Pools of Britain wants indoor and outdoor pools to be recognised for their roles in local communities.
It is headed by Gill Wright who has led the campaign for 12 years to save Victoria Baths in Manchester.
"We aim to give a national voice to historic pools all over Britain and build a picture of the state of the nation's swimming heritage," she said.
In December, more than 95% of 3,330 people who answered a consultation request backed reopening the Broomhill open-air swimming pool in Ipswich.
The 50m pool with diving boards and a children's pool opened in 1938, but was closed by owners Ipswich Borough Council amid claims it was too expensive.
In east London, Haggerston Baths, which has been boarded up for 15 years and is among the 10 most-threatened Victorian buildings, was put up for sale in June by Hackney Council.
The campaign will document the historic swimming pool buildings in the UK as no central database or archives exist.
It also wants to engage in joint campaigning and lobbying, funding applications for threatened pools.
Ms Wright was at the forefront of the campaign to save Victoria Baths in Manchester which won Â£3.4m in the BBC TV's Restoration series in 2003.
She said the baths still needed more money to complete the restoration plans.
