The bodies of Peter and Jean Tarsey, both 77, were found at their villa on Sunday, the Guardia Civil said.
A Spanish police spokeswoman said friends visited the couple, thought to be originally from west London, because they had not been seen for a few days.
The Foreign Office said it was "ready to provide consular assistance".
A Guardia Civil spokeswoman said: "They [the friends] found the door was open and there were no signs of a break-in.
"The couple, who had been living in Spain for 18 years, were found dead with gunshot wounds on the sofa.
"The Guardia Civil is now awaiting the results of post-mortem examinations and investigations continue."
Mr Tarsey was a former British Olympic diver who competed in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics for Great Britain and represented England at the Commonwealth Games in 1954 and 1958.
Xalo is in the province of Alicante on Spain's south-eastern coast and is part of the Costa Blanca, a popular tourist destination.
