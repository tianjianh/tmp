Matt Taylor gave Rovers a second-half lead with a powerful header from Liam Lawrence's corner.
Lawrence turned from provider to scorer 22 minutes later as he struck home an exquisite 25-yard free-kick before Taylor netted a second header soon after following Chris Lines' corner.
Cristian Montano could have added a fourth, but Callum Preston saved well.
Rovers move up a place to third in the table on goal difference following Plymouth Argyle's 2-1 loss at Devon rivals Exeter City, while Crawley stay in 16th place.
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"We came to a team who are in form and have momentum with them and have got a goalscorer who has 25 now and we added to our own downfall conceding the goals we did.
"It was three set-pieces and we normally pride ourselves on being a decent set-piece side.
"I'm proud of the group and we've had so many things that have hindered us this year, for example the numbers, the training ground and I am not making excuses but it's been a tough year.
"I am just pleased after 40 games hopefully we are not near that bottom two and we haven't been in that bottom two all season."
