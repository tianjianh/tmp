A minute's silence has been held before all Premier and Football league matches to mark the 30th anniversary of the Bradford City fire.

Fifty-six fans died in the blaze at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985.
It is thought the fire started accidentally after a spectator dropped a lit cigarette under a wooden stand.
England manager Roy Hodgson and FA chairman Greg Dyke laid a floral tribute at the ground before Bradford's League One win over Barnsley.
A new book claims the fire was just one of at least nine blazes at businesses owned or associated with former club chairman Stafford Heginbotham.
The judge who led the inquiry into the fire said claims it may have been started deliberately were "nonsense".
The book has been written by Bradford fan Martin Fletcher, who lost his brother, father, uncle and grandfather in the fire, which broke out during Bradford's match against Lincoln City.
Mr Dyke said he found the allegations "very hard to believe".
The silence was held before the date of the 30th anniversary in order to coincide with Bradford City's last home game of the season.
