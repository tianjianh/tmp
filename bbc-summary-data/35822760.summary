Wallace, 21, has been with the League One side since January and has scored once in 14 appearances.
"We have watched Jed closely at Millwall, and he has enjoyed a very positive impact on the team with his performances," Wolves head coach Kenny Jacket told the club's website.
"We're now keen to get him back and make the step up and bridge the gap to the Championship."
Wallace began his career with Portsmouth before signing for Wolves last May. He will return to Molineux on Thursday having made seven appearances for the club so far.
