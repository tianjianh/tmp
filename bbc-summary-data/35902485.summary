Bradley Fewster's seventh goal of the season gave the Minstermen the lead when he swept in Luke Summerfield's cross from three yards.
Boyle received his second yellow card for simulation in the Orient penalty box as York were reduced to 10 men.
Lloyd James fired in from 15 yards to equalise as Orient took advantage of the depleted home side to earn a point.
Orient remained eighth in the table, just one point outside the play-off places, with York still next to bottom and now nine points from safety.

"Throughout the match there were so many errors from him (the referee), pure and simply because of his fitness.
"Keeping up with play, you could see he wasn't fit enough to get around in certain areas and the decisions that went against us today weren't acceptable..
"We were one man down, up against it, but the players should take great pride, specially the way we went about it in the first half."
Leyton Orient player-boss Kevin Nolan told BBC Radio London:

"On another day we could have come away with a comfortable victory, but when you start like that and give teams a 1-0, it's so much more difficult.
"I thought we showed a lot of character, so I'm delighted with that, but we've got to start showing it for 90 minutes because I don't think we have over the last three to four games.
"In the second half, certainly, we dominated them from start to finish."
