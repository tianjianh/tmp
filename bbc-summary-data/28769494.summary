The 25-year-old made the announcement on BBC Breakfast, while appearing with her fellow bandmates.
"I've always wanted to be a part of the show - it looks like so much fun and the costumes are just gorgeous. I can't wait to get started," she said.
The dancing series returns to BBC One in September.
"Like so many little girls, I used to take dance lessons when I was in primary school and I really love dancing but this is going to be so different from anything I have done with The Saturdays," Bridge said.
"I'm used to being more relaxed, but I'm going to have to think about things like fingers and where my head is.
"That's making me really nervous because I think people will assume 'she'll be fine' but I've never done that before."
Her bandmate Rochelle Humes has previously taken part in the show - first in 2010 as part of a Children in Need special and then again last year for the Christmas edition.
Bridge first rose to fame, alongside Humes, in 2001 at the age of 12 as part of pop group S Club Juniors, amassing six top 10 singles in four years.
In 2007, the pair joined The Saturdays and, as part of the five-piece girl group, have scored four top 10 albums and 13 top 10 singles including Up, Ego, Missing You and number one hit What About Us.
Bridge will compete against 14 other celebrities for the coveted Strictly glitterball trophy.
Tess Daly will return as the main host of the show, alongside Claudia Winkleman after Sir Bruce Forsyth stepped down in April.
