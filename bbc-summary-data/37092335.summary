The crash involved a Peugeot van, a Vauxhall Zafira and a Porsche all travelling eastbound.
It happened at about 13.30 BST on Monday, near the junction with the A1079 at Grimston Bar, North Yorkshire Police said.
The Porsche driver, a man in his 40s, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has since been released on police bail.
Six people from Bradford - a man, a woman and their four children were in the Vauxhall.
The woman and three children had serious but non-life-threatening injuries. The 11-year-old, from Bradford, was pronounced dead in hospital.
The Porsche driver suffered minor injuries, as did the driver of the Peugeot van.
The Peugeot and the Zafira were thought to have been stationary in heavy traffic, police said.
Officers have issued an appeal to anyone who may have dash-cam footage to get in touch.
