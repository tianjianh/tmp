Five more men charged over Dundee 'football disorder'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five more men are to stand trial accused of trying to fight rival football fans on the day of a match between Dundee United and Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four men from Dundee appeared in court earlier this week, and five from Aberdeen now face the same charges.
Anthony Steppie, Euan Stevenson, David Gowans, Kennedy Miskimmons and Scott Steppie all appeared at Dundee Sheriff Court to deny inciting public disorder on 13 December.
They will stand trial later this year.
The nine men all face charges under the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act, of engaging in behaviour likely to incite public disorder by forming part of a disorderly crowd and repeatedly attempting to engage in violence with rival fans.
Those offences are said to have taken place in Dundee's Main Street and Church Street.
Mr Stevenson, 20, faces a further charge of assaulting an unknown male by kicking him on the body in Church Street, while Scott Steppie, 21, is accused of assaulting an unknown male in Caldrum Street by punching him on the head.
They, along with Anthony Steppie, 49, Mr Miskimmons, 39, and Mr Gowans, 21, are banned from attending any matches involving Aberdeen FC as a condition of their bail.
Cameron Healy, Lemmy Milne, Alexander Middleton and Grant Fender appeared on identical charges earlier this week, and were released ahead of trial in July on the condition they do not attend any matches involving either Dundee club.
Aberdeen won the SPFL Premiership match 2-0.
