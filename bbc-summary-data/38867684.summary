Gareth Williams' side started the day with a narrow 14-12 win against France after Ethan Davies scored late on.
Morgan Williams scored a hat-trick as Wales pulled off a surprise 28-15 win against back-to-back series winners and Olympic gold medallists Fiji.
In their final game, Wales drew 7-7 with Samoa to finish top of Pool B.
The day marks a turnaround for Wales, after the disappointment in Wellington a week earlier, where they were beaten by Canada and made just the Challenge Trophy semi-final.
