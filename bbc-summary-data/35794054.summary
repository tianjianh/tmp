Australian GP: Why Melbourne is such a great place for a race

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Melbourne is an awfully long way to go for a motor race but, somehow, if any other grand prix were to start the season, it would just not be right.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"The Australians really know how to put on a party and this one hits the spot in just about every way.
"There's the festival atmosphere. The pleasant temperatures (even the occasionally mixed weather can be a blessing). The location in a relaxed yet buzzy city.
"The paddock, with sun chairs laid out on grass behind the garages, provides a beautifully convivial atmosphere for old acquaintances to be reunited after three months apart.
"Even the track, albeit not the greatest in the world, provides just the right combination of action and drama to kicks things off nicely.
"Mix all that with the excitement and anticipation that marks the start of any Formula 1 season, and it is hard to beat."
Andrew Benson, Chief F1 writer
