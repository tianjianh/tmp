McGregor, 23, has previously been in Gordon Strachan's squad and has scored four goals in his past five club games.
Strachan will name his selection on Monday and McGregor will be the seventh Celtic player in the squad if his six team-mates keep their places.
Scotland beat Slovenia 1-0 in March and are fourth in Group F.
Celtic's Craig Gordon, Kieran Tierney, Scott Brown, James Forrest, Stuart Armstrong and Leigh Griffiths all started that match at Hampden.
Scotland trail Slovenia by one point and are two points off Slovakia in the race for qualification for the 2018 tournament in Russia.
England lead the group on 13 points, with a four-point advantage over Slovakia. All six teams in the group, which also includes Lithuania and Malta, have five fixtures remaining.
