A coffee shop which is said to be the smallest in Birmingham has opened in a red telephone box.

Jake's Coffee Box is located in a phone box in Eden Place, near Colmore Row.
A charitable trust called Thinking Outside The Box was granted planning permission to turn the phone boxes into kiosks and they have now been put up for rent.
Jake's Coffee Box, which is run by Jake Holier, is the first person to rent one of the Birmingham phone boxes.
He said: "I wanted to bring something different to the city. The red boxes are iconic to our image as Brits.
"I've got a coffee machine and some sausage rolls. There is nowhere to sit in the telephone box. All my customers are going to be commuters."
Thinking Outside The Box has already overseen a similar scheme at Brighton's Pavilion Gardens, where two phone boxes have become units selling coffee and ice cream.
