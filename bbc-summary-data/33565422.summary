[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pembrokeshire council appoints new chief executive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pembrokeshire council has appointed a new chief executive after months of controversy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council's head of paid service, Ian Westley, replaces Bryn Parry-Jones who quit last October after a £277,000 severance deal was agreed.
It followed a row over cash payments in lieu of pension contributions which the Wales Audit Office said were unlawful.
He had been Wales's highest paid council chief, earning almost £200,000. His successor will be paid £130,000.
It also emerged the council had been leasing a Porsche sports car for Mr Parry-Jones at the cost of £2,368 a month.
The former chief executive had used "underspend" from his car leasing deal in previous years towards the lease for the car.
The council paid £8,600 to cancel the contract for the Porsche Panamera when he left his post.
