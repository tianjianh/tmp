[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 2-0 Barnsley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City kept their Championship play-off hopes alive by beating Barnsley at Carrow Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacob Murphy fired in his 10th goal of the season from inside the box to give the Canaries the lead at the break.
Adam Hammill, Angus MacDonald and Marley Watkins all went close for the visitors after the restart.
Norwich then stretched their lead thanks to MacDonald's own goal to leave them five points behind sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday.
Victory means caretaker boss Alan Irvine has now claimed four points from a possible six since the departure of Alex Neil.
The hosts dominated the early proceedings, with Jonny Howson and Alex Pritchard both being denied by Barnsley keeper Adam Davies.
After Hammill had a goal ruled out for a clear offside at the other end, winger Murphy gave the Canaries a deserved lead moments before the break when, having being picked out by Cameron Jerome, he drilled a shot low and into the corner of the net.
Hammill was unlucky to not get a strong enough flick on Andy Yiadom's cross to make it 1-1 after the restart and MacDonald saw a close-range effort well saved by Michael McGovern from the resulting corner.
But, after Steven Naismith fired over for the Canaries with just the keeper to beat, they doubled their lead in fortunate circumstances as an effort from Murphy deflected off MacDonald into the net.
Jerome and Howson then went close to adding a third as Norwich coasted to three points.
Norwich caretaker manager Alan Irvine:
"I was asked to take charge for two games and I have done that. I haven't heard anything more about what happens going forward, but I should imagine I will be speaking to someone soon to find out what happens next week.
"If that is to be my last game in charge it was a good way to finish - and the win certainly makes it interesting as far as the play-offs are concerned.
"Being five points behind sounds a lot better than being eight points behind - and as I said last week there are still plenty of points to play for."
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom:
"The take-away message from that game is hit the target, score goals.
"There were plenty of positives to take away from it, but if you are going to get anything in this league you have got to be clinical in front of goal.
"It's frustrating, but there is still plenty to play for. We will keep striving to get that perfect performance and obviously want to win as many games as possible between now and the end of the season."
