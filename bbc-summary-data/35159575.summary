Maghaberry prison: Follow-up inspection at Europe's 'most dangerous jail'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inspectors return to Northern Ireland's high-security jail on Monday, two months after Maghaberry prison was labelled the most dangerous in Europe.

A report by Criminal Justice Inspection and Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons in England and Wales in November said the County Antrim jail was in crisis.
The report described it as unstable and unsafe for prisoners and staff.
More than 20 inspectors will spend the next two weeks assessing what improvements have been made.
They hope to publish their findings before May.
The report published in November was the most critical ever about a prison in Northern Ireland.
At the time Nick Hardwick, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, said the jail was "the most dangerous in Europe".
He described it as a "very worrying and disturbing public institution" and said Charles Dickens could write about Maghaberry "without batting an eyelid".
Brendan McGuigan, of Criminal Justice Inspection, said he was concerned that if the issues identified were not addressed as a matter of urgency, there could be "serious disorder or loss of life".
Stormont's Justice Minister David Ford and the director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Sue McAllister, were shocked by the level of criticism.
In an unprecedented move, the inspectors announced that they would go back to the prison this month to check on progress.
The follow-up inspection starts on Monday morning, as inspectors from Criminal Justice Inspection and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons return to the site.
They are being joined by members of the independent health watchdog the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA) and the Education and Training Inspectorate.
The inspection report published two months ago was so bad there is an expectation that things can only get better.
The Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Prison Service have both insisted that is the case.
They said there have been dramatic improvements in Maghaberry since the last time the inspectors paid a visit.
They will hope the inspectors agree.
