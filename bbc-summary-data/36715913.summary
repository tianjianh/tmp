Smyth earned sprint doubles in both Beijing and London but changes to the competition programme mean he will only race in the T13 100m in Brazil.
After his T37 800m triumph in Beijing, McKillop won two gold medals in London.
However, the International Paralympic Committee's programme changes mean he will be restricted to the 1500m in Rio.

The squad for the Games which take place between 7-18 September includes four other Northern Ireland competitors.
Tyrone shooter Phillip Eaglesham has been selected while County Antrim pair Cormac Birt and Jordan Walker join Armagh's Ryan Walker in the football squad.
Overall, the Ireland team will compete across nine sports in Rio.
McKillop and Smyth's athletics team-mates will include Orla Barry who earned a bronze medal in London while Noelle Lenihan and Niamh McCarthy will also have high hopes of challenging for podium places.
Irish Minister of State for Tourism and Sport Patrick O'Donovan officially announced the team at Dublin City Hall on Tuesday morning.
"It is a tremendous honour for each of the 44 athletes who have been selected to represent Ireland at the Rio Games and they can all be very proud of that achievement," said the minister.
Ireland's Paralympic performance director Dave Malone said that a target of eight medals for the team "is achievable".
"The team is ready to achieve great personal and collective success at the Games," said Mr Malone.
"We also anticipate a large number of finals from the team, and we are seeking career best performances from as many of the team as possible on the biggest stage of all."
The first group of Irish athletes will depart for Brazil on 23 August, with a holding camp taking place in Uberlandia, just over 600 miles from the Olympic host city.
