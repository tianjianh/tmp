About 40 firefighters, some using a hydraulic platform, tackled the blaze in Hainge Road, Tividale, after an emergency call at about 08:30 BST.
The service said the fire was at the Sprite Leisure site which makes furniture for restaurants and pubs.
Richard Wood, commander at Dudley fire station, said the cause of the fire was being investigated.
Crews set up a decontamination post because of asbestos on the roof.
