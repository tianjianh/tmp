Six fire crews were sent to deal with what one eyewitness called a "great ring of fire" on Carn Brea at Redruth on Tuesday evening.
About 200 people called 999 reporting the 230 sq ft area of gorse affected on the Pool side of the land.
The flames were brought under control at about 23:30 BST.
A police spokesperson said officers had also been called due to "members of the public driving up to look at the fire and causing access problems".
Charles Bickford, chairman of Carn Brea Parish Council, described it as a "terrible thing to happen".
