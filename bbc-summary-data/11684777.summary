The 49ft creation, full of fireworks, will be the centrepiece at Edenbridge Bonfire Society's parade and display.
The effigy is clutching a five-year contract under one arm, with a holdall of cash in his other hand.
Rooney signed a new deal with his club last month having previously said he intended to leave.
Up to 15,000 people are expected to see the effigy, dressed in full football kit, go up with a bang on Saturday.
Charles Laver, of the bonfire society, said Rooney had been chosen as this year's guy after he made front-page news over allegations about his private life and his loyalty to Manchester United.
He said: "I hate football myself so I'm quite happy to burn a footballer."
Past celebrity guys have included Cherie Blair, Gordon Brown and Russell Brand, while last year an effigy of glamour model Katie Price was burnt at the stake.
