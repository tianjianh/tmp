Plans have been unveiled for a major expansion of a Ministry of Defence (MoD) base in Telford.

Telford and Wrekin Council believes the proposals for MoD Donnington could create up to 700 new jobs.
Donnington provides logistics support for the Army, handling military equipment and weapons.
The local authority said it was putting together a planning application for a one million sq ft (93,000 sq m) development at the site.
The council said it had been in talks with the MoD over the past 18 months to turn Donnington into one of the main support depots.
Telford and Wrekin said the plans were still at a very early stage, and depended on winning investment from the MoD.
Councillor Bill McClements, responsible for finance and enterprise, said it was a great opportunity for both the MoD and the local economy.
"It's looking good and we're very optimistic," he said.
"Potentially it safeguards over 1,000 jobs and can bring in between 500 and 700 new jobs, plus extra jobs and investment in the supply chain.
"We're removing any barriers. We're offering incentives, we're offering to train and even help to build it."
Mr McClements said the planning application was expected to be submitted before the end of the year.
In a statement, the MoD said it was too early to talk about job opportunities and that it was also in talks with a number of other councils.
The MoD said the negotiations were part of a project to rationalise its procurement and logistics operation.
