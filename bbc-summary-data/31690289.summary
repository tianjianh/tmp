Coins get new Queen pic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new picture of the Queen to appear on coins has been unveiled.

It's the fifth coin portrait to have been created during the Queen's reign.
It was unveiled in a special ceremony in London and coins carrying the new design will also begin being made from today.
But it may take a little while for the coins to get into your pockets - new coins tend to go to cash centres and banks first.
