Ninety-four guns have been found by police in Northern Ireland in the last three years.

Ulster Unionist Policing Board spokesman Ross Hussey said the figure was given to him by the chief constable.
Mr Hussey said the guns found included two handmade 'zip guns', 40 shotguns, 26 handguns, six sub-machine guns and 10 assault rifles.
He said some were the "firearms of choice of terrorist groupings".
"The question in my mind is what other guns are in the arsenal of the terrorist or criminal fraternity in Northern Ireland?" he added.
"We have seen only too recently murders on the streets of Belfast which indicate guns are easily obtained by those who wish to terrorise the community.
"Let us hope the judiciary treat anyone found with illegal guns as potential murderers and sentence them accordingly."
