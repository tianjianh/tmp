[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man who illegally stored 40,000 tonnes of waste is jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who amassed an illegal waste mountain, estimated to weigh about 40,000 tonnes, has been jailed for eight months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Millen, 51, of Murston, near Sittingbourne, Kent, pleaded guilty in August to depositing controlled waste without a permit.
The mountain included soil, concrete, bricks, waste wood, plastic and metal.
Mr Millen did not respond to repeated warnings from the Environment Agency, and instead continued to add to it.
During legal proceedings, Mr Millen disposed of 70% of the waste, but the rest remains.
The Environment Agency told Maidstone Crown Court that the 40,000 tonnes would cost about Â£3m to dispose of lawfully.
