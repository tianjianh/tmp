Women's football edging out in east Belfast

From the Euros to Carl Frampton to Jonathan Rea's success in motorcycling, it has been a year of sporting triumphs for Northern Ireland.

But what about East Belfast Ladies FC? Never heard of them?
The team only formed 18 months ago and entered their first league last year, but despite their inexperience, they did the double in their first season, winning the Northern Ireland Women's section 2 league and cup.
Moreover, they didn't form because of any particular passion for the sport, but because their then head coach, John Spence, wanted to do something about the lack of recreational groups for women in the area.
The group has mixed abilities. Leanne Watter joined because her husband encouraged her, and despite never having played football, was named 'Player of the Year' by her fellow teammates.
"I always enjoyed playing football in the back garden with my son," she said.
"I started at 31 years of age.  I couldn't take a proper throw-in when I started, but with pure determination and learning, I could take one by the end of the year."
Many of the players do not have access to childcare in the evenings, so they bring their children along to the training sessions.
Trish Neil travels as far as Larne every week, just to attend training and be part of the team.
"I wanted to play somewhere that is sociable and fun," she said.
"I don't think I've missed very many training sessions all year, I really enjoy it and I bring the kids up with me. I've played for a few different clubs - in Ballymena and in America - but everyone works so hard, we all want it so much."
Leanne's husband Stephen Watter is the clubs assistant manager, but this year he is stepping into the role of manager, taking over from John Spence.
"In the first couple of months the turnout was great, but the football wasn't," he said.
"There were lots of different abilities and levels, so we took a few hammerings at the start.
"It was hard to keep the morale up, but once we got used to it, they were training a few times a week.
"They were dedicated and the enthusiasm was there, so the experience just followed naturally."
In a short time, the club has risen to prominence in the community.
Emma Shaw doesn't play football, but attended a community event about education in working class areas and she ended up helping the club behind the scenes.
"Within the last 23 months, we've taken a lot of courses, including autism awareness, first aid, community development and facilities management training," she said.
"It's not just about football, it's about what football can do for the community. We want to be more than a club and that is the aim for the team."
Stephen Watters said there are "so many talented girls out there in Northern Ireland, who don't even realise they are good footballers".
"I'd encourage all girls out there, even if you have a wee bit of an inkling that you would like to play football, try it out, find the time, and go out and enjoy it," he added.
