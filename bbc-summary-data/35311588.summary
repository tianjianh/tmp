[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lowestoft third crossing proposals sent to government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals for a third water crossing in Lowestoft that had previously been ruled out have been submitted to government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new road would cross Lake Lothing between the two existing bridges, linking Peto Way and Tom Crisp Way.
Suffolk County Council had ruled out this option last year, saying a crossing closer to the Bascule Bridge would be the most "cost effective".
It said "public enthusiasm" and "additional studies" led to the change.
Work could begin on the crossing, that could cost up to £90m, within two years.
The council had previously backed an alternative bridge after potential crossings were researched in western, central and eastern locations by engineers WSP.
Former Waveney MP Bob Blizzard, Labour, had said residents were "furious" with the decision.
In September, following a visit by David Cameron, the options were reassessed, with a feasibility study commissioned.
The central option submitted to government in an outline business case will follow a north/south route from a new roundabout on Denmark Road.
Peter Aldous, Conservative MP for Waveney, said: "The preference for a central crossing reflects improved data, while also acknowledging public enthusiasm for this particular location."
Much of the cost of the new bridge would come from central government.
Mark Pendlington, chairman of the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, said the document was "a robust and compelling business case".
The council has also submitted plans for a new crossing at the waterfront in Ipswich, costing between £80-£90m.
It is considering two options, and currently favours one that includes the construction of three individual bridges - linking the east and west banks of the River Orwell.
