Councillors have voted to shut Plas Madoc - despite opposition from 2,000 people - as part of a bid to cut spending by Â£45m over five years.
Protesters meeting on Thursday evening said they had not been given enough time to draw up alternative options.
The closure decision will still need approval from full council next week.
Committee members of the the Save Plas Madoc Leisure Centre Campaign urged people at the meeting to lobby their local councillors to voice concerns ahead of next week's vote.
The council has said the community could run the centre, but supporters said that even extending the deadline to the end of June for interested parties to come forward with propositions is too little notice.
The meeting at the Air Products Social Club, Acrefair, heard the campaign is consulting a barrister about the possibility of a judicial review of the council's decision.
A council report outlined opposition to the closure saying the leisure centre is regarded as a "valued resource that contributes towards health and wellbeing and a focal point for the local, deprived, community".
However, the report said the council faced big budget cuts and a Â£2m bill in maintenance costs at its leisure facilities, including Wrexham's town centre Waterworld swimming baths and gym.
Among those trying to save Plas Madoc include former Wales footballer Robbie Savage, who played five-a-side at the centre as a boy.
