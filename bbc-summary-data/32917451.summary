[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new chief executive of Edinburgh city council will take up his post at the end of July after councillors unanimously approved his appointment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Kerr, who will take over from Dame Sue Bruce, expects "major challenges ahead".
But he said it would be a "tremendous honour" to lead the council.
Mr Kerr, who began his career with the district council in his home town of Falkirk, has been chief executive of Cornwall Council since October 2013.
He once represented Great Britain as a 400 metres runner.
Andrew Burns, Edinburgh city council leader, said: "I'm delighted that Andrew Kerr's appointment received unanimous backing from councillors today.
"It was clear from the recruitment process that he has the qualities required to take on the role and I look forward to working closely with him to shape the continued success of our city."
Mr Kerr said: "This is a tremendous honour and a fantastic opportunity to lead one of the most high profile local authorities in the United Kingdom.
"There are undoubtedly major challenges ahead with increasing demands for council services and reducing budgets but I will do my utmost to ensure that the council continues to work hard for the city and everyone who lives, works, visits and invests here.
"Clearly, a great deal has been achieved in Edinburgh in recent years, and I am looking forward to working closely with elected members, officers and our partners to ensure that we build on those successes."
