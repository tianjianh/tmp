[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe booked their place in the second round of the EFL Cup after beating Notts County 6-5 on penalties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The shoot-out was a fitting way to settle an end-to-end affair which finished 3-3 after extra-time on a night of torrential rain and plenty of goalmouth action.
Scunthorpe looked to have had the game wrapped up in normal time and again during the extra half hour, when goals from Duane Holmes and Paddy Madden respectively had put them in front.
But each time Notts fought back to level, with defender Shaun Brisley forcing home at the second attempt to make it 2-2 minutes into stoppage time, before Ryan Yates smashed in his side's third goal with just three minutes to play.
Earlier, a close-range finish from Nottingham Forest loanee Jorge Grant in the 23rd minute had seen the Magpies draw first blood, although Scunthorpe were much better after the break, with Madden bringing them level from the penalty spot.
In the shootout, both teams scored their first five penalties, but after Holmes had put the Iron 6-5 ahead, County's Matt Tootle was denied by Matt Gilks.
