Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony has told BBC World Football that there is no truth in the rumours he wants to leave Manchester City.

The 27-year-old questioned manager Manuel Pellegrini's decision to drop him in December and has since been linked with a return to Swansea.
"I'm happy at the club, all this speculation is not true," he said.
"I have a contract so I'm happy and I think I'm at one of the top clubs in the United Kingdom."
Bony left Swansea to join City for Â£28m on a four-and-a-half-year deal in January 2015.
He has scored eight goals in 23 games for the club this season, but has been used as a substitute since leading striker Sergio Aguero returned from injury in December.
Bony added: "I have no regrets about joining Man City.
"We play in the Champions League and we're one of the top clubs in the world. I'm happy here and I can just say I'm blessed."
