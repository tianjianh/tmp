The midfielder has helped the Blues to Co Antrim Shield success while a league title could be won on Saturday before an Irish Cup final against Coleraine.
Mulgrew got the nod ahead of Blues team-mate Roy Carroll and Crusaders defender Howard Beverland.
Paul Smyth made it a Linfield double by winning the Young Player award.
The teenage forward has caught the eye since a first senior game for the Blues in 2015.
Mulgrew made his Linfield debut in 2005 and has made nearly 500 appearances for the Windsor Park club.
It is the first time the 30-year-old has won the annual award and he could pick up more silverware in the next couple of weeks.
Linfield are two points clear of Crusaders going into Saturday's final game against Cliftonville before the Irish Cup decider the following weekend.
