[SN]TITLE[SN]
Roma 1-0 Napoli

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Radja Nainggolan scored a brilliant late goal as Roma beat Champions League rivals Napoli - handing Juventus the Serie A title in the process.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Napoli needed to win to keep the title race going but Roma proved too difficult an opponent to overcome.
The hosts are now within two points of second-placed Napoli, who occupy the final automatic Champions League place.
Nainggolan's 89th-minute winner was a fine, curling effort from outside the box from Mohamed Salah's lay-off.
Roma legend Francesco Totti, whose future is uncertain, was a late substitute and was involved in the build-up to the goal on his 598th Serie A appearance.
