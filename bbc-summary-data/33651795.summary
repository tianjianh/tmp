A cinema, restaurants and shops, as well as public space in the form of an amphitheatre are included in Princesshay Partnership's proposals.
John Grinnell, of the partnership, said: "It's an extremely complex project and there's still a long way to go in planning and design terms."
A public consultation was held on its initial plans last November.
"We're really pleased to submit an outline application, which is an important step in unlocking the true potential of this gateway to Exeter," Mr Grinnell said.
"As the region's best shopping and leisure scheme, Princesshay is a fantastic asset for the city and we're committed to improving it even further, whether that's by bringing in great new brands and restaurants, or working with the council to regenerate the bus station site."
The Princesshay Partnership is a joint venture between the Crown Estate and TH Real Estate.
