[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mouse droppings found at Birmingham Bullring Burger King

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burger King has been fined £12,000 after mouse droppings were found at a Birmingham branch during a planned inspection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Health inspectors found the fast food restaurant in the Bullring had evidence of "mouse activity throughout the premises", including food preparation areas.
Parent company, Caspian Food Services also had to pay £1,389 in court costs.
The branch has since been re-inspected and given a top hygiene rating.
Caspian Food Services pleaded guilty at Birmingham Magistrates' Court to four offences under the Food Safety and Hygiene Regulation after being prosecuted by the city council.
Inspectors found mouse droppings in the food preparation and storage areas, as well as evidence of inadequate cleaning and food exposed to risk of contamination.
The premises was closed on 2 February 2015 as there was deemed to be "an imminent risk to public health" and reopened two days later.
A further unannounced inspection was carried out in June by environmental health officers, after which Burger King was given a Food Hygiene Rating of five - the maximum score.
