Paul Clement: Manager quells Swansea City 'anxiety' fears

Manager Paul Clement has denied Swansea City's players are getting anxious in their battle to stay in the Premier League.

The Swans have gone five games without a win to leave them two points adrift of safety.
Clement described his side's performance in the 1-0 defeat at West Ham as "very poor" and hopes for a response at Watford on Saturday.
"It was only West Ham where anxiety was there for everyone to see," he said.
"I can't say that was the case against Tottenham or Middlesbrough. You have to hope it's a one off and you move on from it quickly."
Swansea were held to a home goalless draw by fellow strugglers Middlesbrough before they were beaten by three late Tottenham goals.
Forward Fernando Llorente missed those two games but returned as a second half substitute in the West Ham defeat after recovering from an ankle injury.
The Spain international, Swansea's top-scorer with 11 goals, is set to start against Watford on Saturday.
"It's good for the team because he's been such a focal point when we've needed to play into him and when the ball goes wide," Clement added.
"He's such a threat on the crosses. You look back on our goals, a lot have come from the wide positions.
"We're not a team that has electric pace in the front line. We have to play to our strengths and he is one of them."
