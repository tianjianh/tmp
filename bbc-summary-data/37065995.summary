British record holder Muir, 23, looked to be in medal contention at the start of the final lap but dropped off the pace with about 200 metres remaining.
Kipyegon's time of four minutes 08.92 seconds meant she finished ahead of Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba (4:10.27) and American Jennifer Simpson (4:10.53).
GB's Laura Weightman finished in 11th.
"I went for the win," said Muir. "It's not every day you find yourself in an Olympic final. I was in great shape but the last 150 metres was not quite in me.
"I gave everything and I'm proud of how I ran."
The early stages proved to be a highly tactical affair, with many of the favourites sitting back, and Muir led after two laps.
"I expected it to be a slow start and then for Kipyegon and Dibaba to come round," added Muir. "I expected to have to react. I followed them round but I couldn't hold on."
Paula Radcliffe, women's marathon world record holder:
"These races can be difficult to navigate. Sometimes you can react sometimes you can't.
"Laura Muir just didn't quite have what she thought she had in that final lap."

Steve Cram, BBC athletics commentator:
"Poor Laura Muir. She went with it but Kipyegon and Dibaba are so good. They make you go so hard.
"Muir's chance of a medal went with those two. She went for gold but gave up her chance of hanging around and picking up a medal.
"Sometimes if you go for gold you come away with nothing at all."
