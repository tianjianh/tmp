[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors have agreed in principle to a 10% cut in funding for an event billed as Scotland's biggest free music festival.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council provided Â£54,000 towards Youth Beatz this year when it was headlined by former X Factor winner James Arthur.
However, with increased pressure on finances, a potential cut of 10% or 20% was being considered.
The Nithsdale area committee agreed in principle to reduce funding by Â£5,400.
The festival has been held in Dumfries for several years and repeated attempts to charge for entry have always been rejected.
This year 12,000 free tickets for the event at the town's Dock Park were given out.
A report to councillors indicated that a reduction of 10% in funding from the council could be accommodated through a reduction in the scope of the festival and an increase in external support.
It said that if more significant cuts were to be considered they could have a greater impact on the event.
