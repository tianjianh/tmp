David Davis: Birmingham City midfielder signs new three-and-a-half-year contract

Birmingham City midfielder David Davis has signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with the Championship club.

Davis, 25, has made exactly 100 Championship appearances for Blues since signing from West Midlands rivals Wolves in August 2014.
He spent five years on the books as a professional at Molineux,
During that time he played 61 times, as well as being loaned out to Darlington, Walsall, Shrewsbury Town, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Chesterfield.
Davis's new deal, tying him to St Andrew's until the summer of 2020, follows the re-signing of Craig Gardner from West Bromwich Albion, ending a busy week of activity for Blues boss Gianfranco Zola in his midfield department.
The Italian is open-minded about the future of Diego Fabbrini, who was signed by predecessor Gary Rowett from Watford in a £1.5 million deal a year ago.
Despite being brought in for only his second start of the season against Newcastle last Saturday, Fabbrini is prepared to move on in the hope of regular first-team football.
"In his mind he wants to go and maybe try somewhere else," Zola told BBC WM. "But he has a future here if he is willing to work at his game and work hard at some issues."
"I know where he could be. But I cannot do anything unless he wants to do that. Then he can be a player who, wherever he goes, he plays."
Zola is close to abandoning his plan to bring in Slovenia international Rene Krhin from La Liga side Granada.
Although Blues had agreed a £2m fee with the Spaniards, Krhin returned without signing after attending last weekend's FA Cup third-round 1-1 draw with Newcastle United.
"It's gone very quiet," said Zola. "We wanted the player, but the player is taking too much time and we need to move. We have waited more than we should.
"To be fair that, position was not a priority. Stephen Gleeson and Robert Tesche have done well so far."
