[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The annual Care of Police Survivors (COPS) service was held at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire.
A roll of honour of police officers who have died on duty over the past year was read out, along with readings by family members.
Force representatives laid remembrance wreaths.
Jan Berry, chairman of COPS, said: "The Service of Remembrance is a chance for us all to remember those no longer with us - and also to celebrate the memories we have of them.
"It is a culmination to a weekend of 'healing, love and life renewed' and is all part of the COPS mission - to help rebuild shattered lives."
