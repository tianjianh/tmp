Six Nations 2016: England lose injured Devoto & Beaumont

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ollie Devoto and Josh Beaumont have been withdrawn from the England squad ahead of Saturday's Six Nations match against Ireland because of injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northampton's Luther Burrell replaces Devoto, who was concussed in Bath's defeat by Wasps on Saturday.
Beaumont sustained a dislocated shoulder while playing for Sale Sharks against Worcester Warriors on Saturday.
The number eight is unlikely to play any further part in England's championship campaign.
