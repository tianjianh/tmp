Addiction experts and users have told Newsbeat they feel let down.
But health officials across the UK say there are services and the funding out there to help cannabis addicts.
Lee, who asked us not to use his full name, says his habit got so bad he started dealing and ended up in court.
Here one addict shares his story.
"I was about 13 when I started. Everyone was doing it. It was a social thing.  It just escalated there onwards.
"I started smoking more. At around 15. I was then smoking every day.
"Looking back, when I was 18, I realised I had a real problem with marijuana.
"I found myself smoking even though I didn't want to be doing it.
"Physically it drained me, it made me very unhealthy. It made me very yellow in the face, it made me very unwell.
"Mentally it made me feel worthless, I thought everyone was better than me.  I didn't want to show that, but inside I was a broken man. It was really bad.
"I wouldn't even be thinking about it and I would be smoking cannabis. I just couldn't stop. My life wasn't worth living without cannabis.
"I tried to quit myself and I thought I could do it. I went to Egypt on holiday to try to quit.
"However within one hour of landing I was sitting on my balcony crying because I'd picked up cannabis in a foreign country, in a dangerous place and I was smoking.
"That was when it hit me that I am really, really, really powerless over my addiction. I am powerless over cannabis. No matter how far I go, where I go, who I am with, it doesn't matter.
"I'd be able to find it in the Antarctic, I really would because I was deep in my addiction and nothing would get in my way.
"My using took me to in excess of Â£100 a day and it got completely out of control. I would smoke before work, during work, after work, I would lie to people just so I could be on my own smoking.
"I wasn't eating and I was just over five-and-a-half stone. Eating got in the way of my smoking and so would hygiene. I would go a week without having a bath or shower.
"I was dealing. It started off small because my using got to the extent where I couldn't afford it myself.  It got bigger to the point where I was dealing an awful lot.
"I was raided by the police for dealing cannabis. That was my rock bottom.
"It was at that point that I really had to look at myself because I couldn't quit cannabis.
"I needed help and so I reached out for help and I got it with the 12 step programme at MA (Marijuana Anonymous).
"I currently stick to that to this day.
"I remember going to crown court every three weeks and the solicitor saying 'pack a bag because it's not looking great'.
"I was thinking I was going to be sent to prison. A very, very scary time for me. I got an 18-month suspended sentence.
"I've had to deal with my consequences and that's fine.
"I go to these meetings to talk about my feelings. It's somewhere I can offload this stuff to people who will not judge you.
"They will simply listen to you and offer you advice and it's your choice. This is a choice that I had to make to get help.
"It hasn't been easy. But my life today standing here with nine months sobriety is an awful lot better than it was in my using. Today I care about things and I care about people."
