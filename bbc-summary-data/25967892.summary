[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Comedian Jo Brand has been awarded an honorary doctorate by Canterbury Christ Church University.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brand was given the honour in a ceremony at Canterbury Cathedral for her work in raising awareness of mental health issues.
She worked in psychiatric nursing for 10 years before her career in stand-up comedy blossomed.
Brand, who grew up in the county, said she was "very flattered and honoured" to receive the award.
She added: "I used to be a psychiatric nurse, but I think even in this day and age, when people are becoming much more liberal-thinking than they used to be, people with mental health issues still really suffer from the negative opinion of most of the general public."
Prof Rama Thirunamachandran, the university's vice-chancellor, said: "Jo has achieved great success, leading the way for female comediennes.
"However, it is through her public standing, and her work, in raising awareness of mental health issues and challenging the stigma around mental illness where she has achieved true impact."
