[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The American started the final round two shots ahead of Paul Casey but as the Englishman fell back, Watson maintained his challenge.
He had two birdies in his first three holes and ended with a round of 66 for a 25-under total
American Patrick Reed was second, three shots behind, with Rickie Fowler third.
Watson, the two-time Masters champion, only came into the field after Australian Jason Day withdrew.
The tournament, hosted by Tiger Woods, featured an exclusive 18-man field and although it offered world ranking points, it is not an official PGA Tour event.
