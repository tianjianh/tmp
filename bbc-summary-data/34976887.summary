Visser's third of the afternoon sealed a bonus point and a third home win in three Premiership matches for Quins.
Captain Danny Care and replacement Jack Clifford were on hand to add the hosts' other tries as fly-half Nick Evans kicked 11 points.
Front row replacement Halani Aulika scored a late consolation try for bottom of the table Irish.
Watched by new England head coach Eddie Jones, winger Visser scored the only try of the first half.
The 28-year-old Scotland international broke clear of two tackles before crossing under the posts. Nick Evans added the conversion and just the one penalty before the interval.
That came after Ross Chisholm had been denied in the corner by Alex Lewington's diving tackle.
Both Sam Twomey and Ollie Lindsay-Hague were withdrawn early for Harlequins after suffering knocks in the opening 20 minutes.
London Irish, winless and without a point from their opening six games, were handed a late blow as captain Matt Symons was forced to withdraw through illness, and they were second best after the break.
Quins captain Care, who signed a new contract at the club on Friday, raced clear for the second try after the interval before Visser added the third - and his second - bursting onto an inside ball.
The bonus point was secured when Visser completed his hat-trick with 10 minutes remaining.
Irish's punishment was not over, though ,and back row Clifford scored a fifth try before Tonga prop Aulika scored the visitors' first points with the final play of the game.
Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea:
"We wanted to be ruthless, but also talked about being patient. Our boys looked unbelievably controlled. That's another step along the way of a long season, but we'll be right in it.
"It will be never ending this season but I'm excited and this win puts us in a very strong position. We look to be a very good place."
London Irish head coach Tom Coventry:
"There's not a lot we can take out of that. Harlequins were good. We were totally outclassed and I don't think we won any aspect of the game.
"Their momentum was good, they kept coming and created lots of opportunities."
