The event was so successful officials had to limit access to the Rallyfest stage at Kinmel Park following issues at Chirk Castle on Saturday.
World champion Sebastien Ogier kept his lead to clinch victory at the finish line in Llandudno on Sunday.
Elfyn Evans from Dolgellau won the WRC2 class, saying: "It feels great".
"We're thrilled with the response and interest in this year's new-look Wales Rally GB," said Andrew Coe, chief executive of the event organisers, International Motor Sports.
"Moving the event to north Wales has proved a huge success and we're seeing unprecedented spectator numbers lining the forests and roads of every stage."
However, he said it led to some fans being unable to get access to the Chirk Castle stage on Saturday.
"We're aware that many of these were existing ticket holders and for that we apologise," added Mr Coe.
"The venue's car parks simply reached capacity and with the nature of a rally taking place in largely remote areas there was simply no alternative."
This year's rally saw the race headquarters move from Cardiff to Flintshire, to a purpose-built Â£250,000 site at Queensferry.
The organisers hoped the move would attract new fans to the event from nearby cities in England, such as Liverpool and Manchester.
Welsh driver Elfyn Evans from Dolgellau stormed clear to win the WRC2 class race.
Speaking after crossing the finish line, the 24-year-old son of Welsh rallying legend Gwyndaf Evans said: "It feels great ... a fantastic car and great experience.
"I don't know about next year yet. We've had a few disappointments but the team has worked hard."
