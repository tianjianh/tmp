Welsh language centres will succeed, says Alun Davies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New government-funded centres to encourage people to learn and use Welsh will succeed, the Welsh language minister has said.

Alun Davies told BBC's Cymru Fyw website ministers would not become a "permanent banker" for the 10 centres.
The Welsh Government has spent more than Â£2.4m on them since 2014.
Cardiff's centre had a difficult first year, following the closure of its crÃ¨che, uncertainty over the future of its bar and struggles to pay its rent.
"I want to move away from the negative discussions," Mr Davies said.
"Often it does not reflect what is actually happening.
"I'm confident we can work together in the future and ensure the success of each centre."
Mr Davies - who did not rule out stepping in if centres faced difficulties - added he would be open to establishing new centres if the demand was there.
"My door is wide open to see if we can develop ideas in the future," he said.
"But I don't want to see the government running these centres or being a permanent banker - I see the government's role as being in the background and not as a manager."
