Det Insp Mark Pearson from North Yorkshire Police said both assaults happened in the early hours of the morning.
"At the times these incidents happened, and in that part of the city, there's a good chance bar and door staff were clocking off or having a break, or revellers were making their way home after a night out," he said.
"I'd appeal to these people in particular to carefully jog their memories of the dates in question."
