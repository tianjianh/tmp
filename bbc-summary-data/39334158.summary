The freight train was pulling 38 wagons, when seven of them partially derailed.
A Network Rail spokesman added: "We are working closely with GWR and South West Trains to put in place contingency plans... including diverting London-West of England services via Bristol.
"No injuries have been sustained but there is significant damage to track and equipment.
"The derailment is significant with the line currently blocked and likely to remain out of use for at least the next 48 hours."
