School inspectors say 45% of children in part of Kent are still attending underperforming primary schools.

In 2014, Ofsted found Medway was at the bottom of its league tables for the number of pupils - 9,500 - going to primary schools rated good or above.
After a recent re-inspection, Ofsted found Medway Council's work with weaker primary schools had not driven improvement quickly enough.
The authority said it was beginning to see the impact of improvements.
Ofsted director for the South East, Sir Robin Bosher, said: "I welcome the recent school improvement work, which has started to show early benefits in the number of schools judged good or better in Ofsted inspections.
"However, much of this is too recent to see its full impact.
"I urge the council to use the information, resources and the powers they have to effectively target, support and challenge schools to rapidly improve.
"The longer a child spends at an underperforming school, the more likely their chance to fulfil their potential diminishes."
Mike O'Brien, Medway Council's portfolio holder for children's services, said the improvement could not be achieved "overnight".
He said: "We are beginning to see the impact of real progress and positive change in Medway.
"And we are pleased that inspectors also found that head teachers, school leaders and governors are starting to see real change for the better.
"But there is still much more to do. We will act on Ofsted recommendations immediately and we will continue to put children's education at the heart of everything we do."
A Department for Education spokesman said: "Ofsted's review of Medway's school improvement services is clearly disappointing but we are pleased to see the council is now taking action to address the identified shortcomings.
"We are already working closely with the council to tackle underperformance in maintained schools and will consider Ofsted's findings further.
"We have consistently shown that we do not hesitate to take swift action to improve poor schools."
