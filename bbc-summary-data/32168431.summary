Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, a mother-of-three, was killed in Tuesday's collision on The Kingsway.
Richard Jones, of Swansea Business Improvement District (BID) group, said "ambassadors" will give safety warnings to the public from next week.
BID has funded the project.
Mr Jones, who runs Moda Collections on The Kingsway, said the ambassadors will stand in front of the nearby NCP car park on Union Street.
He said: "We will have ambassadors there, only at peak times, on Fridays and Saturdays, just warning people to give way to traffic."
Following Sgt Lucas' death Swansea council announced it is to stop traffic from travelling in an eastbound direction on the road.
They are also to install barriers on the road's central reservation and is changing the traffic flow in the bus lane "as quickly" as possible.
The current system has two lanes of normal traffic travelling west on one side of the road, with two lanes of public transport - one going east and one west - on the other side.
