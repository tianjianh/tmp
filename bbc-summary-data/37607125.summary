Luke Hyam: Ipswich Town midfielder suffers knee injury setback

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town midfielder Luke Hyam has suffered a setback in his recovery from a knee injury that is likely to keep him out for at least eight weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hyam was injured during Town's pre-season friendly against Cambridge and surgery had initially looked likely.
The 24-year-old recovered enough to put the operation on hold, but his symptoms returned and he has had the surgery.
However, striker David McGoldrick and defender Adam Webster have returned to training following injury.
