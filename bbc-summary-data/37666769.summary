Archie Darby, aged four months, died after being attacked in Colchester, Essex, on Thursday afternoon.
His brother Daniel-Jay Darby, who is 22 months old, is still in hospital.
Essex police and crime commissioner Roger Hirst said the dog was "owned by the aunt of the children".
He confirmed the woman "works for police" but could not clarify in which position and for which force.
She has been named by other media outlets as 31-year-old Clare Ferdinand.
Mr Hirst also said the family pet - believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier-type - "didn't have any history" of aggression and "wasn't at all vicious".
The boys' mother was left with minor injuries after the attack in a house in Harwich Road. Police were called there at 15:10 BST on Thursday.
"It doesn't seem real that our little Archie Bum has gone to heaven and our little Daniel is in intensive care because of a tragic, tragic incident involving a dog attack," she said in a statement along with the boys' father.
"We have lost our gorgeous little four-month-old baby and our beautiful 22-month-old boy is currently being treated for his injuries.
"Heaven has gained a beautiful little angel and he will be greatly missed by us all and our other little soldier is still fighting strong."
