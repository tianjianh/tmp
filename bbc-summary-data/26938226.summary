Sheffield Half Marathon: Water Direct 'not paid' for water

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The water firm that was blamed for the cancellation of the Sheffield half marathon claims water supplies were not delivered because it had not been paid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Water Direct said race organisers had made an order but the contract stated payment had to be made before delivery.
In a statement it said that despite sending reminders to organisers no payment was received.
Race organisers said the claim conflicted with their information and an investigation was still under way.
The event, on Sunday morning, was called off after organisers said they were "let down" by Water Direct because it had failed to deliver supplies.
Despite the cancellation many of the 4,100 entrants who had gathered at the race's starting line still ran it.
Water Direct, which has supplied water for the event for the last two years, confirmed organisers had placed an order on the 21 March but it refuted suggestions it had "let them down".
In a statement, it said: "After amending their requirements a number of times they did indeed place an order on 21 March accepting our offer, the terms of which, as always, clearly state that full payment is required in advance of delivery.
"It is that payment that confirms the contract and triggers our process of scheduling the assets for delivery.
"In the absence of that payment, despite our reminding them of the need to pay, the scheduling did not occur."
The company added as a gesture of goodwill it has offered to provide water services free of charge for next year's event.
Organisers have launched an investigation into the circumstances which led to the cancellation of the event.
