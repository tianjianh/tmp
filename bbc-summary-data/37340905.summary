Glastonbury organisers have said they will not hold an event at another site during its "fallow" year in 2018.

There had been speculation the festival could be held elsewhere following remarks made earlier this year by founder Michael Eavis.
Eavis previously said he "didn't really want to have a year without a festival", and claimed the event could be held somewhere else in 2017 or 2018.
Tickets for next year's event go on sale in October, it has been confirmed.
In a statement on the Glastonbury Festival website, the organisers said: "We will be taking our next fallow year in 2018, in order to give the farm, the village and the festival team the traditional year off.
"There are no plans to hold an event at another location in 2018."
The music festival is held on the Eavis family's Worthy Farm in Somerset, south-west England, and traditionally takes a break every six years so as not to cause damage to the working fields.
The last fallow year was 2012.
In June, Eavis had told the BBC he was "talking to Longleat" as it was his "favourite site" for a new festival.
He had added that hosting it at Worthy Farm meant dealing with 22 different landowners, which "wasn't easy".
Next year's festival will take place from 21 to 25 June, with the first batch of tickets, for those buying coach packages, released on 6 October.
General tickets will be released three days later, at 09:00 BST on 9 October.
Last year's initial release of 120,000 tickets sold out in just over half an hour.
The highlight of the music calendar, this summer Glastonbury featured performances from headliners Adele, Coldplay and Muse, who rocked the Pyramid stage, festooned with a giant lightning bolt in honour of David Bowie.
