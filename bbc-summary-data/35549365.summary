Posh lost the fourth-round replay after a 1-1 draw in 120 minutes.
"It was tough on the boys. If you ask me hand on heart who was the better team over the 120 minutes, I'd have to say us," said Westley.
"The inches you need to win through in those situations weren't quite with us - perhaps we didn't take our chances - but so many positives."
Jon Taylor had put Posh ahead early in the second half at the Abax Stadium, but Baggies midfielder Darren Fletcher smashed home to take the tie to extra-time, where neither side could find a winner.
And with the Premier League team leading 4-3 in the shootout, Posh striker Lee Angol had his spot-kick saved by Ben Foster to take Albion through.
Westley told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "It was a cruel way to go out, but it's a test of nerve and a test of character. When you're young you're always liable to come up short against a very experienced group of players.
"Our lads will learn a lot, they'll grow as players and as individuals."
Westley's side are eighth in League One and the second-highest scorers in the Football League.
"It's a great opportunity, we're on the verge of the play-offs," he continued. "We've been up there in the top six and fallen out and we've got work to do, we know that.
"We've got a lot of games to win but we do believe we can win those games.
"We're gutted we're not going to compete in the fifth round of the cup, but that's behind us now. Now it's about making sure the end of the season is not a forlorn one."
