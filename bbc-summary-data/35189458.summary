A life-size cast iron sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley has been felled for the second time in just over two months following stormy weather in Dorset.

The artwork at Clavell Tower, Kimmeridge Bay, appears to have been sheared off at the ankles.
Sir Antony said he was "thrilled" when the sculpture toppled into the sea in September, calling it proof of its "dynamic relationship with... nature".
The life-size figure was part of a commission entitled "Land".
It was created to mark 50 years of UK building conservation charity Landmark Trust.
John Bickerton, owner of Lulworth House B&B, found the statue during a walk with his family on Saturday.
He said: "We were sprinkling my mother's ashes on the far side of the bay before going round to take a family picture with the sculpture.
"We quickly realised it wasn't standing and when we got there could see it had sheared off at its thinnest point - the ankles. This time it looks like it might be fatal."
The BBC has asked the Landmark Trust to comment.
