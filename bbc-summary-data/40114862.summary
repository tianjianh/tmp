[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Practice for the Isle of Man TT continued to be disrupted when Wednesday night's session was severely curtailed by adverse weather.

Most riders had completed only one lap when proceedings were brought to a halt because of visibility problems.
Prior to a halt being called, Ian Hutchinson bettered his Superbike speed of Tuesday night by posting a lap at 128.987mph on his Tyco BMW.
Suzuki-mounted rider Michael Dunlop was again close behind on 127.228.
Yorkshireman Dean Harrison was third fastest with 126.257 on board his Kawasaki.
Manxman Dan Kneen moved to the top of the overall Superstock leaderboard thanks to a lap of 125.18 on a BMW, followed by Lincolnshire rider Peter Hickman (124.90).
Lee Johnston recorded the best Supersport speed of the week so far with 122.16 on a Padgetts Honda.
Clerk of the Course Gary Thompson was forced to cut short the night's action because the emergency 'air med' helicopters were deemed unable to fly amid the deteriorating conditions.
After the leading riders finished their initial lap, it was announced that riders would be permitted to practice at full speed up to Ramsey, but would then be taken in groups across the Mountain behind a travelling Marshall at a much-reduced speed.
This proved impossible however as the weather continued to get worse.
Saturday and Monday's practices had to be cancelled because of poor weather, with the action finally getting underway on Tuesday evening.
Practice is scheduled to continue on Thursday and Friday nights.
