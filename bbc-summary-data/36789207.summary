Cousins made 136 appearances for the Addicks following his debut in August 2013, having first joined the club at under-13 level.
The versatile Greenwich-born 22-year-old can also play at right-back or in the centre of defence.
"I felt this was the right time for me to move on," Cousins said.
"For it to be to a massive club like QPR is a real pleasure for me."
Rangers boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told the club website: "He's young, he's hungry, he's got Championship experience and he's got great potential to keep on improving at QPR.
"I am absolutely delighted he's a QPR player and can't wait to start working with him."
