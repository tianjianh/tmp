The 36-year-old striker will end his 18-year Ireland career in a friendly against Oman at Dublin's Aviva Stadium.
Keane has scored 67 goals in 145 appearances for his country.
"It has been an emotional week, it has been surreal. I have dreaded this day for a long time, but it is the right time for me," Keane said.
"To the fans, it has been an incredible journey and something I will never forget. Wednesday night will be very emotional.
"All I ever wanted was to do my best for my country. The defining moment of my career was being given the Ireland captain's armband at the age of 26."
Keane made his international debut at the age of 18 against the Czech Republic in 1998.
The LA Galaxy frontman, who has also played for Wolves, Coventry, Inter Milan, Leeds, Tottenham, Liverpool, Celtic, West Ham and Aston Villa, added: "I have played for many, many teams. I have put many, many jerseys on, but the Irish one always seems to fit me the best.
"For me, it was always a comfort blanket, coming back with the national team. It has been my second home."
