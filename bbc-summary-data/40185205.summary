Two-time Paralympic champion Peacock, 24, missed out on the 2015 World Championships through injury and will look to recapture the 100m title he claimed in 2013.

Britain won 31 medals in Doha two years ago, including 13 golds, finishing fourth in the medal table.
London will be the first time the event has been held in the same city and in the same summer as the World Athletics Championships, which run from 4-13 August.
Six-time world champion David Weir is not included after withdrawing from British Athletics following a fallout with coach Jenni Banks, and double T11 100m and 200m Paralympic champion Libby Clegg misses out with an injury.
Cox, 26, who has multiple sclerosis, won gold medals in track cycling and athletics at Rio 2016, but has focused her training on athletics this year before her defence of her T37 100m title.
Cockroft, 24, won world gold in the T34 100m, 400m and 800m two years ago, a treble she repeated in Rio last year.
Whitehead, 40, can become a four-time T42 200m world champion in London, while Jo Butterfield will be given the opportunity to defend her club throw titles in the F51 and and Aled Davies his shot title in the F42 .
T38 sprinter Sophie Hahn, who has cerebral palsy, can win her third individual 100m world title, despite only being 20.
Paralympic champions Hollie Arnold and Aled Sion Davies are among nine athletes from Wales included.
