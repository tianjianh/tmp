They slip 14 points behind thanks to on-loan Rangers midfielder Andy Murdoch's winner 11 minutes from time.
Queen of the South goalkeeper Robbie Thomson denied Jason Cummings, Anthony Stokes and John McGinn.
And, with 11 minutes to go, Murdoch found space inside the box and scored with a powerful shot.
With Rangers winning 2-0 at home to Raith Rovers, second-top Hibs look likely to have to settle for a place in the promotion play-offs.
Falkirk moved to within a point of Alan Stubbs' side with their 0-0 draw away to St Mirren.
Stubbs declared himself "baffled" by the outcome in Dumfries, the third time in seven days he felt his side "could easily have had three points".
"It is a sore one to take because we completely controlled the game," he told BBC Scotland. "We had chances but unfortunately we haven't taken them.  I think they had one shot at goal.
"Obviously that makes it more difficult to go up automatically as champions now.  But our ambition is still to go up and we still have a good chance of doing that.
"We still have a good chance in the cups as well, so all is far from lost."
