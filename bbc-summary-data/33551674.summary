Forecasters first issued the alert on Wednesday for the Western Isles.
It has now been extended to also cover Wester Ross, Sutherland, Argyll, Lochaber and parts of Tayside and central Scotland.
Play at the Open golf championship at St Andrews was suspended on Friday morning due to rain.
Forecasters said winds could gust to speeds of 50mph, while heavy rain has also been forecast for Saturday.
The warning covers from 01:00 on Friday until 21:00 on Saturday.
Argyll and Lochaber could see the heaviest rain.
The Met Office said: "A rather vigorous area of low pressure for the time of year, will bring a combination of strong winds and heavy rain to parts of Scotland.
"The worst of this arrives in two separate episodes - a six to nine-hour period of heavy, thundery rain overnight into Friday, and then slightly less intense but more persistent rain setting in later Friday and lasting well through Saturday.
"Total rainfall will typically be 25 to 50mm but with some areas, particularly over high ground, receiving more than 80mm over the two days."
