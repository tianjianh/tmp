The Addicks sit 23rd in the Championship, six points from safety.
"The season has been a major disappointment but from the adversity we have got to find something to look forward to," he told BBC Radio London.
"If we are able to get ourselves out of trouble it will be a success. We have to look at it as almost like a trophy for us to stay in the league."
The 33-year-old added: "I have been in this situation before and managed to stay up on the penultimate day and it was one of the triumphs in my career."
After a promising start to the campaign, which saw the club sitting third in the table after a four-match unbeaten run, Charlton have endured a season of struggle.
The south-east London club are on their third head coach this season and off the pitch supporters have held a series of protests calling on owner Roland Duchatelet to sell up.
However, Jackson believes current boss Jose Riga is capable of preserving their second-tier status after the Belgian guided the club to safety in his first spell in charge at The Valley, in 2014.
"Jose has brought a calmness because of his previous tenure at the club," the midfielder said.
"He has experience of it and what it took before and he is trying to implement that again.
"The situation is a bit more serious this time around as we are cut adrift a little bit.
"There are enough games and enough points to play for, so we are not about to down tools and give up. You have seen teams put runs together and get out of trouble."
Charlton, who have won one of their last 14 league games, travel across London to face Fulham on Saturday afternoon (15:00 GMT).
