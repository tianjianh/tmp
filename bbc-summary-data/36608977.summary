Birmingham-born Turner made only one appearance for the Bluebirds last season, but played in five games on loan for League One side Coventry City.
Details of the length of the 28-year-old's contract have not been disclosed.
"He's a good, experienced centre-half and someone we have admired for a few years," Brewers manager Nigel Clough told the club website.
"He wants to get playing again and competing again after a frustrating time with injuries."
Turner is Burton's first signing since they won promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time in the club's history last season.
