[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An SNP councillor is being investigated after allegedly sending anti-Islamic texts to a Muslim colleague.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dundee City councillor Craig Melville is reported in the Daily Record to have sent a number of messages to an unnamed woman within the party a day after the Paris terror attacks.
He has now been suspended from his role as an aide to SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie.
A spokeswoman for the SNP said the party "will not tolerate" Islamophobia.
In one message, Mr Melville is reported to have referred to the SNP's international development minister, Humza Yousaf, who visited the Greek island of Lesbos in October to see the plight of Syrian refugees.
An SNP spokeswoman said: "The SNP condemns Islamophobia in the strongest possible terms and we will not tolerate it in our party.
"Craig Melville has been immediately suspended from the SNP and from his employment."
Mr Melville is said to have confirmed that he will co-operate with any investigation.
