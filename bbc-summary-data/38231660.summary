Adam Nelson scored the game's only goal for the East Region Super League outfit on 86 minutes, after the first meeting finished goalless.
Clyde will play Stirling Albion after hammering Arbroath 5-0 at Broadwood.
And there were victories for Albion Rovers and Berwick Rangers in Scottish Leagues One and Two respectively.
Peter MacDonald scored two penalties, with David Gormley also bagging a brace as Barry Ferguson's Bully Wee overcame Matt Flynn's red card to thump Arbroath.
Scott McLaughlin scored Clyde's second.
Meanwhile, Rovers' victory at Glebe Park helped them climb to fifth in the League One table.
Ross Stewart struck after Willie Dyer had given Brechin a 25th-minute lead when Albion goalkeeper - also called Ross Stewart - could not hold his shot.
But the sharp-shooting Stewart got the visitors level six minutes before the break when he took in Ross Gilmour's pass. And he won it with a drilled finish with 20 minutes remaining.
Jordyn Sheerin missed out on a hat-trick as Berwick's win left 10-man Stirling Albion second-bottom in League Two.
Dylan Bikey got Stirling going with six minutes gone, as he controlled Willie Robertson's pass and slotted beyond Kevin Walker. The lead lasted barely a minute, though, as Greg Hurst drilled in at the other end to bring Berwick level.
Back came Stirling and Bikey in particular, his 23rd-minute effort from the edge of box putting his side back in front. It was 2-2 come the break after Sheerin converted from the spot when Stirling were penalised for a hand-ball in a crowded box.
Sheerin then won it with nine minutes left before he missed another penalty, Chris Smith denying him, with Darren Petrie dismissed for a second bookable offence.
