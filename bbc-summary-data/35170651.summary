Seven newborn puppies have been found abandoned in a crate in Swansea, three days before Christmas.

The RSPCA was contacted by a dog walker who found the puppies in Penlan on 22 December at about 08:30 GMT.
The dogs, three females and four males and thought to be a rottweiler cross breed, were only a few days old and their eyes had not yet opened.
RSPCA inspector Gemma Cooper said they were "soaking wet and hungry" and would have died had they not been found.
"These poor pups are too young to be without mum and demand around the clock care," she said.
"We are thinking about naming them Holly, Ivy, Angel for the girls and then Noel, Sprout, Pudding and Blitzen for the boys."
