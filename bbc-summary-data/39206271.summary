A Wales Office minister has told MPs he is confident a Swansea city deal will go ahead despite the sacking of Lord Heseltine as a government advisor.

The former deputy prime minister lost his five advisory roles after voting against the government in the House of Lords over Brexit on Tuesday night.
He had been due to visit Swansea today in his role advising on a proposed Â£1.3bn investment deal for the region.
Minister Guto Bebb said he was "confident" the deal would go ahead.
During Welsh Questions in the Commons on Wednesday, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts had asked the minister "what hope we have of securing similar deals for the rest of Wales if experts are axed at the whim of an insecure executive fearful of parliamentary sovereignty?"
In reply, Mr Bebb described the Swansea region city deal as a "bottom-up agenda", adding that Lord Heseltine contributed "significant expertise" at a "challenge' session.
"I am confident we will have a city deal for the Swansea city region," he said.
"We will have further growth deals for Wales as a result of the work that this government is doing to ensure that Wales benefits from investment in the same way as this as any other part of the United Kingdom."
A UK Government spokesman said: "Lord Heseltine provided useful input to the Swansea City Deal project.
"However the decision over his role as government adviser does not impact on the city deal.
"We will keep working to ensure we meet the Secretary of State for Wales' ambition to turn a good proposal into a great one."
Lord Heseltine told the BBC he felt "great disappointment" to be sacked as an advisor, but defended his rebellion on Brexit, saying Europe was the "transcending issue of our time".
