Chelsea Ladies' Women's Champions League hopes were all but ended as they lost 3-0 to Wolfsburg in their first ever game at Stamford Bridge.

Hungary midfielder Zsanett Jakabfi's hat-trick gave the German side control of the round of 32 tie.
Chelsea, who are currently second in the English top flight, were second best throughout the first leg, watched by a crowd of 3,783.
Wolfsburg, last season's finalists, host the second leg on 12 October.
Having won the competition twice since 2012-13, Wolfsburg's array of world-class internationals were always going to pose a threat but they were aided by poor Chelsea defending before the break.
Goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl and England left-back Claire Rafferty - who scored two own goals as Chelsea lost 4-1 on aggregate to Wolfsburg in the last 16 last season - both hesitated with a long ball and Jakabfi pounced to scoop the ball over Lindahl for the opening goal.
An unmarked Jakabfi headed in a second and Norway's Caroline Graham Hansen could have made it 3-0 before half-time, as the German side dominated.
Jakabfi completed her hat-trick with a calm finish after a swift counter attack just after the break and it would have been 4-0 but for a fine double save from Lindahl later in the second half.
Chelsea Ladies manager Emma Hayes told BBC Sport:
"To be completely outdone by a German team is nothing new for an English club. It's happened forever.
"Even though I'm disappointed I can zoom out and say, 'what do we really expect to happen when you get Wolfsburg at this stage?' They've got the experience on this stage and we're still learning.
"I'm a competitor so it absolutely kills me that we haven't produced something. We're better than that.
"We're playing for pride (in the second leg) because I think it's fair to say, at 3-0, the tie is as good as over."
Wolfsburg manager Ralf Kellermann told BBC Sport:
"I didn't expect that we would win this highly. We came here with a lot of respect. I'm very happy with this result.
"With a lot of games that we have seen them play, Chelsea would be at the top of the Bundesliga and I don't think they've reached the level they can achieve in this game.
"On Saturday we have got a cup game so that's when I'll be resting a lot of players. We are not through yet."
