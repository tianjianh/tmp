Video assistant referee confusion in Dutch Super Cup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Feyenoord won the Dutch Super Cup despite having a goal ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR) in bizarre circumstances.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With Feyenoord leading 1-0, Vitesse forward Tim Matavz appeared to be fouled inside the box but referee Danny Makkelie did not stop play.
Feyenoord broke quickly and scored but Makkelie used VAR to award the penalty to Vitesse and rule out the goal.
Vitesse equalised from the spot but went on to lose 4-2 on penalties.
Former Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones was Feyenoord's hero in the shootout, saving the first two spot kicks.
The match had finished 1-1 in normal time, with Jens Toornstra putting Feyenoord ahead inside the first 10 minutes and Alexander Buttner converting the controversial penalty.
VAR can only review incidents relating to goals, red cards, mistaken identities and penalties.
The technology can be used while the ball is in play, but not while either team is in an attacking position.
