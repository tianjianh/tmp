Raith Rovers 0-1 Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Halliday's goal a minute from half-time was enough to keep Rangers eight points clear of Hibernian at the top of the Scottish Championship.

The midfielder made sure there was nothing the officials could misinterpret as he celebrated his sixth goal of the season at Stark's Park.
This was his first game back following a controversial dismissal after hitting the target against Morton last month.
In truth Rangers' seventh win in row should have been more comfortable.
Raith, who remain on fourth place on goal difference, have now failed to score in their last five matches.
An indication of the squad strength Gers manager Mark Warburton has assembled to ensure Rangers return to the Premiership this season saw Â£500,000 signing Michael O'Halloran start on the bench.
He was joined there by Nicky Law and Dean Shiels as the manager made two changes to the side that beat Falkirk at Ibrox, with Gedion Zelalem and Halliday both returning.
The early signs were far from promising for Rovers - who had Leicester City's on-loan striker Harry Panayiotou on the bench - as Rangers pulled them apart with superior pace, movement and almost total control of the ball.
Martyn Waghorn might have had a first-half hat-trick with a bit more composure in front of goal, while Barrie McKay forced Kevin Cuthbert into a sharp save.
Halliday's free-kick from the edge of the area after 28 minutes deflected off the defensive wall and bounced clear of a post.
But the home side's luck finally ran out just before the interval when they failed to cope with a great overlap down the right by James Tavernier.
The full-back burst his way to the bye-line before pulling back a cross that Halliday drilled into the net from six yards, scant reward for the visitors' dominance.
Raith pressed a higher line after the break with Panayiotou adding a more physical presence up front in the final half-hour.
The St Kitts and Nevis international even had the ball in the net with 20 minutes left, but Lewis Toshney - back from injury - was penalised for a barging into an opponent when setting up the chance with a powerful header.
Rangers created far fewer chances in a surprisingly flat second-half display, the away fans saving their loudest cheer for the introduction of O'Halloran.
The high-profile signing from St Johnstone arrived for his debut on the hour and showed characteristic pace with one run and cross that found no takers.
