Police made a public appeal for help tracing the teenager after she was last seen at a youth club at the city's Wesley Methodist Church last Friday.
She was later seen getting off a train at Bournemouth at about 21:30, which led to the force working with the Dorset force.
Hampshire Constabulary said the girl was found "safe and well" in Dorset.
