Ex-Scarlet Jones played 47 internationals and was interim attack coach for Wales during 2013.
The 36-year-old spent five years as Scarlets attack and skills coach and was head coach at Rotherham.
"I'm excited to carry on the work of the previous RGC coaches and at the opportunity to develop even more talented youngsters," said Jones.
RGC is a Welsh Rugby Union development region based in north Wales and will play in the new look, 16-team premier division kicks off in September.
"It's a big challenge, because the Principality Premiership will be a big step up, going up against experienced semi-professional and in some cases, professional regional players," added Jones.
"But I hope I can help to make RGC an established Premiership side that can continue on its remarkable journey."
