Ronan Hughes' family had been critical of what they said was police "inaction" after the 17-year-old revealed what was going on.
Gerard and Teresa Hughes said a Nigerian gang demanded more than Â£3,000 from their son.
They then sent images of him to his friends on social media.
The family were accompanied during Thursday's meeting by Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O Neill and Francie Molloy.
Afterwards Ms O'Neill said there were lessons to be learned from how the case had been handled.
"Coming from such a tragic event there now appears be a step change in how such cases will be dealt with," she said.
"For instance Facebook previously waited three to four days following a complaint from a police service to remove a page. The Hughes family were given reassurances that any such pages will now be removed immediately following such a complaint.
"Further to this the family were informed that the PSNI have now issued guidance to all its officers as to how to deal with such cases and will be increasing training in this field.
"It is clear that this is a growing area for crime and needs to be focused on."
Ms O'Neill said the Policing Board had asked for details and the PSNI had also referred the case to the Police Ombudsmans office.
