Victoria Station has been closed since Salman Abedi killed 22 people and injured 116 at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May.
One of the entrances for the arena is within the station which has remained sealed off by police since the blast.
Northern Rail said services at Victoria Station will resume on Tuesday.
Liam Sumpter, regional director at the rail operator, said: "All other train operators that use Manchester Victoria Station will be operating a full timetable of services.
"Our thoughts remain with everyone affected by this terrible attack.
"Our team at Victoria are ready to welcome people back to the station."
Services provided by Northern, TransPennine Express and Metrolink will resume at the station on Tuesday.
