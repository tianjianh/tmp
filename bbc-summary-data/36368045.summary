The National Trust recently invited tenants to rent out Parc Farm on Great Orme in Llandudno for just £1 a year.
On Wednesday, the first of the many applicants will get to visit the farm, fields and buildings at the remote coastal site.
Would-be shepherds would need to help protect Great Orme's fragile landscape.
It has rare habitats and species - some of which the charity said exists nowhere else on Earth.
The National Trust said its announcement the farm was to be let had sparked enquiries from across the world and at one point saw staff dealing with more than 100 enquiries an hour.
National Trust general manager William Greenwood said: "The volume of interest has been incredible.
"People clearly want to give nature a helping hand and ensure this special place is healthy, beautiful, rich in wildlife and culture and is enjoyed for ever for everyone.
"It seems to have really caught the public's imagination, and we're really looking forward to welcoming some of those potential applicants to Parc Farm for the official viewing day, to give them a taste of just what that one pound buys."
The National Trust bought parts of the iconic Great Orme headland, including Parc Farm and its associated grazing rights, in 2015.
Mr Jones said the tenant needed to be a "very special person" with excellent shepherding skills, prepared to work hard and share how they look after the landscape with the Great Orme's many hundreds of thousands of visitors.
He added: "And while it may be called Parc Farm this tenancy is no walk in the park, it will involve long hours, and a lot of hard work in a landscape which is exceptionally exposed to extreme weather."
