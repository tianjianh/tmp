Montrose 3-1 Elgin City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling Montrose dominated League Two leaders Elgin City en route to a 3-1 Links Park victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Templeman and Gary Fraser struck either side of half-time for the impressive hosts.
Adrian Mallagaray put the game well beyond Elgin five minutes later with a tap-in, courtesy of another good ball from Templeman.
Neil Martyniuk put through his own goal with a misplaced header late on, but it would not spoil Montrose's day.
