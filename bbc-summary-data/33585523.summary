Paramedics and police were called to an address in the Fern Bank area of Nelson, Lancashire, in the early hours.
The 45-year-old victim was taken to Blackburn Royal Infirmary, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.
The small tablets are described as turquoise and in the shape of a shield. Police are warning people not to take them.
A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: "We are urging anybody in possession of similar tablets to hand them into us to prevent anyone else from falling ill or any potential further deaths."
