US Sgt Bowe Bergdahl 'shouldn't face jail', hearing recommends

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A US army hearing has recommended that a sergeant who was held captive by the Taliban and later charged with desertion be spared a prison sentence, lawyers for the soldier said.

The army officer presiding over Sgt Bowe Bergdahl's case also recommended he face a lower-level court martial, according to the lawyers.
The proposal has not been confirmed by the US military.
Sgt Bergdahl was released in a controversial prisoner swap last year.
He was captured by the Taliban after leaving his post in 2009 and later charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy.
His release - in exchange for five Taliban commanders - drew fire across the US political spectrum as running contrary to policy against negotiating with terrorists.
If, as suggested, he faces a lower-level hearing, the maximum punishment would be limited to a reduction of rank or bad conduct charge, Sgt Bergdahl's lawyer Eugene Fidell said.
At present his charges carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Without confirming the decision, the US Army said "we continue to maintain careful respect for the military-judicial process, the rights of the accused, and ensuring the case's fairness and impartiality".
