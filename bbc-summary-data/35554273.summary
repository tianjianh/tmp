Six Nations 2016: Wales v Scotland iconic moments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spare a thought for Scotland when they come to Cardiff in the Six Nations on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fresh from a seventh consecutive defeat against England in the Calcutta Cup, they face Wales, who they have not beaten in eight games since 2007.
To put that in perspective, it is a winning run better than anything Wales could do against Scotland in the 1970s.
Wales coach Warren Gatland's only loss to Scotland came when he was in charge of Ireland.
He has a perfect record against the Scots with Wales and his words of comfort for Kiwi compatriot Vern Cotter might have a hollow ring to the Scotland coach, who has yet to steer them to a win in the Six Nations.
"He's made them hard to beat," said Gatland.
"And when a team is hard to beat, it only takes a lucky bounce or a referee's call and you're suddenly winning."
But this is a match of landmarks and broken records, and has not always been as one-sided as it is these days.
For inspiration, this current crop of men in blue need to look at the team of 1982.

They visited Cardiff seeking a first win since 1962 - and ended that 20-year barren spell with a display of counter-attacking rugby which left Wales grasping at thin air.
Scotland scored five tries to one in a 34-18 win that condemned Wales to the wooden spoon. It was their first home defeat in the Five Nations since losing to France in 1967 - a run of 27 matches including 26 wins and a draw.
It ended the golden era - and heralded a period of dominance for Scotland over Wales.

Gareth Edwards scored two tries in the 35-12 hammering of Scotland in 1972.
Nobody remembers the first because his second was a classic.
Fed by Mervyn Davies from a maul near his own 22, Edwards broke down the blind-side and 70 metres, two kicks-ahead and a spectacular dive into the mud in the corner later, the great scrum-half had scored one of the great Five Nations tries.
Later, comedian Spike Milligan proclaimed: "they should build a church on the spot!"
Within a year, Edwards scored an even more famous try for the Barbarians against the All Blacks at the opposite end of the same ground.
Annus mirabilis - or a half-tidy year, if you are Welsh.
Scotland outscored Wales by three tries to one in Cardiff back in 1986.
But Scotland's place kicker Gavin Hastings had an off-day while Wales full-back Paul Thorburn entered the record books.
The Neath man kicked five penalties but, like Edwards in '72, only one sticks in the memory...

That's because it went over from - to be precise - 70 yards, eight and a half inches.
That's what youngsters would call 64.2 metres and remains the longest successful place-kick in a Test match.
It helped Wales to a 22-15 win.
There are Scots who still cannot understand how they failed to win in Cardiff in 2010 and, in all honesty, many Welsh share that view.
In Wales it's known as the Shane Williams match.
Trailing 24-14 with three minutes left on the clock, Wales scored a try from Leigh Halfpenny.
Scotland, already down to 14 men with Scott Lawson in the sin-bin, then had Phil Godman yellow-carded for a professional foul and Stephen Jones kicked the penalty to equalise.
Restarting with 13 players against 15, Scotland ran out of numbers as Wales attacked and Williams dived over between the posts.
