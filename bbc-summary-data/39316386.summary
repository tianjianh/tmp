[SN]TITLE[SN]
Criminal probe into Iraq cases lawyer Phil Shiner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A criminal investigation into a disgraced lawyer who brought false claims against Iraq War veterans has a number of "lines of inquiry", the National Crime Agency (NCA) says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phil Shiner was struck off after being found to have acted dishonestly in bringing murder and torture claims against British war veterans.
A file on Mr Shiner, from Birmingham, has been passed to the NCA by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.
He was declared bankrupt on Tuesday.
The Daily Telegraph reported that the NCA director general, Lynne Owens, had written to a former Conservative minister to say there were a "number of lines of inquiry".
An agency spokesman said: "The NCA has previously confirmed that it is in receipt of a file from the Solicitors Regulatory Authority. As you might expect, that provides lines of inquiry for the NCA to consider, however, we cannot comment further."
He had denied or partially admitted the charges which were found proved against him by a panel of the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. He was struck off in February.
