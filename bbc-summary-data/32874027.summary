[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lincolnshire police were called to Twyford Woods, near Bourne, on Saturday where they came under attack from missiles.
The A1 was closed while police cleared the site with the last reveller leaving late on Sunday evening.
Of those arrested, 19 people remain in police custody with 24 charged, bailed or cautioned.
Police were called to the site following reports of loud music and anti-social behaviour but came under attack from several hundred of the 1,000-strong crowd.
Bottles and other items were hurled at police as they tried to clear the site and one officer was hit by a car.
Ch Supt Stuart Morrison defended the force's actions after criticism for failing to take strong enough action at the same site in 2012.
"We are happy that the decision to try and close this event was the right one," he said.
"It was not legal, it was not safe and it caused an inconvenience to people."
Officers also seized a number of vehicles along with sound equipment and generators.
