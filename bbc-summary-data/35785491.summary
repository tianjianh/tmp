The 25-year-old will be eligible to play for the Dons if they reach the League Two play-offs.
Former Arsenal trainee Murphy has scored three goals in 14 appearances for the Latics this season.
The ex-Dagenham & Redbridge front man also spent time on loan at Crawley Town earlier in the campaign, netting nine goals in 16 outings for the Reds.
"With Bayo Akinfenwa suspended and Tom Elliott struggling, we were down to two strikers," Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told the club website.
"Rhys has had several clubs after him so we thought it was the right time to strike."
Meanwhile midfielder Christian Toonga, who featured five times for the Dons this season, has left the south-west London club by mutual consent.
