Police have launched an investigation following the find in an area off the A198, near the entrance to Gosford House in Longniddry.
A member of the public called the emergency services when they made the discovery at about 18:30 on Sunday.
Det Supt Pat Campbell, of Police Scotland, said: "The recovery will be a painstaking process."
He added: "We are in the very early stages of this investigation, to recover the remains, identify the deceased and inform their family, and establish the circumstances of the death.
"I would not wish to cause any unnecessary distress to families or anyone who is waiting for news of a missing loved one, and my officers will be in contact with the next of kin of any person who becomes relevant to the investigation.
"The area where the remains have been found, including the A198, will remain cordoned off whilst we conduct our inquiries and I would like to thank the public for their patience during this time."
