Tries by Alex Cuthbert and Rey Lee-Lo, converted by Gareth Anscombe, gave the home team a six-point half-time lead.
Ali Price's try brought Glasgow to within a point, but they could not turn pressure into points.
Stuart Hogg and Peter Horne had crossed in the first half for Warriors, who picked up a losing bonus point.
The result lifts Blues to second place in the Pro12 table behind Ulster after registering wins in their first three league games for the first time ever.
A first half that lived up to the pre-match billing as the battle of the big attackers was followed by an attritional second period as the Blues withstood a powerful Warriors onslaught.
Rory Clegg's missed conversion after Price's try proved to be costly as Danny Wilson's team held out and then opened a four point lead with Shingler's 76th-minute penalty.
Glasgow reclaimed possession from the restart, but could not clinch the vital fourth try.
Both teams went into the game boasting 100% records with Glasgow searching for a third consecutive bonus point win after a 41-5 triumph at Connacht and a 33-25 defeat of Leinster.
But it was the home team, fresh from a thrilling 24-23 win in Munster, who made the early running.
Anscombe's two early penalties were followed by Cuthbert's first touchdown of the season as the home team opened a 13-0 lead.
But a Blues forward pass from the restart gave the visitors their first genuine attacking position and Hogg dashed over after good work by Lee Jones.
Centre Horne then took advantage of slack Blues defence as Warriors turned a 13-point deficit into a one-point lead within 10 minutes.
But the see-saw dipped the other way as Josh Navidi made ground before slipping a sweet pass out of the back of his right hand for Lee-Lo to score a crucial try on the stroke of half-time.
Price benefited from some slack defence for his try, but the Blues gave nothing else away after the break.
