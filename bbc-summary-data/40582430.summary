This follows Walton agreeing a new four-year contract with the Seagulls.
It will be the 21-year-old's fifth loan move in the past three seasons, with Albion having the option to recall the England Under-21 international.
"Following the departure of Matt Gilks it was clear we needed reinforcements," Wigan boss Paul Cook told the club website.
"Christian has a bright future and we're delighted he's come to us."
Of the loan deal, Brighton manager Chris Hughton told Albion's club website: "This is a good move for all concerned - both clubs and the player. Christian needs to be playing regularly, and Wigan offer him the opportunity to do that in League One."
