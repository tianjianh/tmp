Bird, who will play for Hampshire for three months, last played a Test in 2013 and has missed out on the England and West Indies touring parties.
"I've missed out on the Ashes touring party but I am on standby for those two tours," Bird told BBC Radio Solent.
"The bonus is if I'm doing well and I'm over here then if someone gets injured then hopefully I get the call-up."
The 28-year-old has three Test caps for Australia and says he is anticipating his first experience of county cricket when Hampshire face Sussex in his side's season opener on Sunday.
"It's a good opportunity for me to come over and play country cricket and I am looking forward to getting stuck in," he added.
"I'm looking to contribute and help Hampshire win games of cricket. With them being promoted to Division One this year, we're looking to go well and I'm hoping to play my part, take a few wickets and that's all I'm focused on."
Bird, who says he is over the back injury which prevented him playing for Northants last year, added he may be open to extending his stay past at the Ageas Bowl the initial three months and has been impressed by what he has seen from his new team-mates.
"I'm focusing on the next three months and hopefully if I can, I can play a further part in the season," he said.
"I'm not centrally contracted so these decisions I can make myself. The Australia summer is my priority so I'd like to see how my body is going.
"Hampshire are quite strong, the top order is very strong and we have a couple of good bowlers so we just need the confidence to believe we can do well in Division One."
