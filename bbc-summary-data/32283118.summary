Bristol strip club warned over schoolgirl adverts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Bristol strip club has been criticised for using images of women dressed as schoolgirls in its advertising.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Urban Tiger was told to drop the images as a condition of being granted a new licence from Bristol City Council.
The authority described the campaign on leaflets and social media as "highly irresponsible" and promoting the "view of schoolgirls as sexual objects".
Nightlife Bristol, which owns the club, has not commented on the adverts.
The firm also owns another club, Temptations, which was given the same condition as part of its licence.
Adam Bond, from the council's safeguarding unit, said: "Urban Tiger's promotion of these events will serve to reinforce the notion that schoolgirls can be viewed in a sexual way and as sexually available."
The club has been told to cease using the advertising - which featured a St Trinian's night where dancers dressed as schoolgirls - as part of its new licence to operate from the council.
The event took place last September.
Sally Lewis, the head of the council's safeguarding board, added the council had given the club a "very clear condition".
"In order to maintain their licence they have to comply with that condition," she said.
Dr Helen Mott, from equality group the Fawcett Society, said there was a "real problem" with schoolgirls being "sexualised" and "abused".
"What we're not seeing is that adverts cause that abuse but if you've got a sexualisation of children through adverts it does help to create the context where schoolchildren are being seen as sexual objects."
Dr Mott added the club had deliberately linked its advertising to films such as St Trinian's.
"The club has consciously chosen to promote their sexual entertainment with a link to a school - albeit a fictional school."
