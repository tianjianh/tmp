The Flying Scotsman is expected to make its run to the south coast despite suffering a mechanical problem.

The locomotive was unable to run from York to London on Thursday. The run was made with a diesel engine instead.
The National Railway Museum said: "We are hopeful that Flying Scotsman will make its eagerly awaited tour."
It is due to leave London on Saturday morning, run through the Thames Valley to Salisbury then make a round-trip via Southampton.
The museum said the locomotive had suffered "a mechanical problem with its injectors", which had been fixed by engineers.
British Transport Police (BTP) have warned those planning to see the train to keep off the tracks.
During its inaugural journey in February, it was brought to a standstill several times after reports of people trespassing on the track.
Exact timings of the Flying Scotsman's tour are not being published in a bid to reduce the chances of people standing on the track in an effort to get as close as possible to the locomotive.
Built in Doncaster in 1923, Flying Scotsman pulled the first train to break the 100mph barrier in 1934.
The National Railway Museum in York bought the locomotive for Â£2.3m in 2004 before work got under way on its decade long, Â£4m restoration.
