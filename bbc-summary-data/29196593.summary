The 59-year-old Australian, who won the Open in 1986 and 1993, posted a picture of himself recovering at a US hospital.
The former world number one, who last week posted a photo of himself cutting back a small tree, tweeted: "Working with a chainsaw ALWAYS be respectful of the unexpected.
"I was one lucky man today. Damaged but not down & out. Still have left hand."
Norman, nicknamed The (Great White) Shark because of his distinctive blond hair and aggressive style of play, led the world rankings for a total of 331 weeks in the 1980s and 1990s.
As well as his major wins at Turnberry and Royal St George's, he finished runner-up in two US Opens, a pair of US PGAs and three Masters.
In 1996 he famously blew a six-shot lead at Augusta to hand victory to England's Nick Faldo.
