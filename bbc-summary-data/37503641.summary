[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff man who stabbed a neighbour on his own doorstep has been jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Pike, from Ely, murdered father-of-four Clint Simms, 39, in an alleged feud between the pair, Cardiff Crown Court heard.
Pike was woken by father-of-five Mr Simms allegedly kicking the front door and shouting through the letter box.
Pike stabbed him in the chest as soon as he opened the door, the court heard.
Pike, who had previously been jailed for four years for wounding, denied murder and claimed he was acting in self defence during the incident in March.
Prosecutor William Hughes QC said: "Despite all the valiant attempts of the medical team, Mr Simms died shortly after being stabbed by Mr Pike."
Police found Pike mopping up blood outside his house.
The court heard that Pike picked up two knives and stabbed Mr Simms through the chest with one of them, claiming that Mr Simms was trying to rob him.
But Judge Eleri Rees QC said: "There was no evidence of this and the defendant's actions were grossly disproportionate."
Speaking after the verdict, Mr Simms' family said: "Our memories are of a good father, son, brother and grandfather who was needlessly taken from his family and friends, a young man with his whole life ahead of him."
