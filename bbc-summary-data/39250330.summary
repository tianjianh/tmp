Direct flights between the Isle of Man and Belfast will resume on Monday.

All direct flights were cancelled on Saturday, after the "virtual airline" Citywing went into liquidation.
Some passengers who flew to Belfast on Friday were left stranded, and had to buy new flights via English airports to get home.
Eastern Airways will take over the route and run a daily service to the Isle of Man with an onward connection to Newcastle.
Katy Best, commercial and marketing director at Belfast City Airport, said: "We're delighted to secure an airline of the pedigree of Eastern Airways on a route that is vitally important to both the Northern Ireland and Isle of Man communities.
"To have filled the void left by Citywing in less than 48 hours is testament to the potential that Eastern Airways recognises in the route."
Citywing also operated a route between Cardiff Airport and Anglesey under a public service contract with the Welsh Assembly government.
On Saturday night, the Welsh government confirmed that Eastern Airways would also take over this service.
Citywing said the decision to go into liquidation had been taken after an airline which operated flights on its behalf had its permission to fly suspended.
Van Air Europe faced the action after an incident last month at Ronaldsway Airport in the Isle of Man.
