Trevor Lawlor, 32, raped one of his victims in view of her toddler son, a jury at Manchester Crown Court heard.
He was only prevented from raping another woman when her boyfriend unexpectedly returned to the house.
Lawlor, of Tetlow Street, Manchester, was also jailed for six years in Ireland in 2004 after raping a woman in "similar circumstances", a jury heard.
In the early hours of 10 July last year, Lawlor entered a property in Newton Heath and woke his victim while she was in bed lying next to her young son.
He threatened to slit the woman's throat if they made a noise and assaulted her before his victim's partner returned and chased him away.
Fleeing in his underwear and T-shirt, Lawlor knocked on the door of a woman living nearby. She let him in after he claimed he had been kidnapped and needed to escape his attackers.
He followed her upstairs, where her young son was standing in the hallway.
Lawler - who was under the influence of alcohol and drugs - tried to bear-hug the woman and pushed her against the wall before she managed to free herself and grab her son.
Lawler followed her into her bedroom and punched her in the face while she was carrying her child, causing them both to fall backwards on to the bed.
The victim placed her child to one side as Lawler continued to punch her, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.
He threatened to kill her and swore and shouted at the toddler before raping the woman and then escaping.
The victim alerted a neighbour who retrieved the toddler, who was blood-soaked and appeared to be traumatised and "in a daze".
Lawlor, originally from Dublin, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing.
He was jailed for a minimum of 10 years.
Det Con Steve Darragh, from GMP, said: "Lawler is without doubt one of the most vile and reprehensible human beings I have ever investigated."
Hunter Gray, defending, said Lawlor expressed his remorse to the victims.
