Campaign to stop children being killed on farms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign to stop children getting killed on farms is being run to coincide with the school holidays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been organised by the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland.
Since 2000, 11 children have died on farms in accidents involving things like farm machinery and slurry gas.
There is a new radio advertisement and talks are being delivered in schools to reinforce the message about the dangers on farms.
David McKay and his wife, Sarah, mind eight grandchildren under the age of seven on their busy County Antrim farm.
He is an agricultural contractor and has lots of heavy machinery coming and going every day.
The children are restricted to a walled garden and the gates leading to the farmyard are alarmed.
"It's a big worry for us, that's why we have the children's farm toys. We bring them up and show them all the dangers," Mr McKay said.
"We have all the gates closed off and we've beams on them and the wife will be there. If she hears one of the beams going off she knows there's some of them out through the gates.
"They usually stay in, they know the rules, they're not allowed out. Safety is number one now."
At Carnaghts Primary School near Ballymena, where two of Mr McKay's grandsons are pupils, principal Ian Henderson has around 25 farm families.
They make up the bulk of the 100 children at his school.
He is very conscious of the farm safety message and builds it into his school curriculum.
In February, when slurry can be spread again after the winter, he creates literacy work sheets that highlight the dangers.
"They were revising capital letters, full stops, commas etc and the content of the work sheet was around the dangers of slurry and slurry gas and associated dangers of machinery," he said.
"So you were learning about the dangers at a very important time of the year and, at the same time, learning about punctuation."
Chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, Keith Morrison, said the dangers "cannot be overstated".
He said farms were "becoming one of the most dangerous playgrounds for children during the summer months".
Farmers are under pressure to get work done during a busy period with the added risk of contractors operating potentially dangerous equipment, he said.
Two guides area available. One is aimed at children and the other is and one for adults.
