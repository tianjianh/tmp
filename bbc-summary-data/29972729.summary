Ola Jordan's husband James has attacked Strictly Come Dancing producers in a rant on Twitter.

It's after a report in the Daily Mail which claimed she was bullying her partner Steve Backshall.
James Jordan claims the BBC is tired of Ola's popularity, is trying to turn the public against her and says bosses are trying to get Steve Backshall to dance with someone else on the Strictly tour.
The BBC says it will not be commenting on the claims.
James Jordan, 36, began tweeting on Saturday afternoon after a trip to the gym.
He said: "I will start by saying that @The_OlaJordan is very upset about the article. Even if it's not true, lots of people do believe what they read.
"The source said BBC are fed up with @The_OlaJordan's popularity and are trying to turn the public against her. NICE...
"Apparently @SteveBackshall has been advised not to tweet about it because it will draw more attention."
Jordan also claimed that the professional dancers were scared to speak out and that former Strictly pro Artem Chigvintsev didn't return for the current series because he was fed up with the way he was being treated.
He also criticised the show's executive producer Louise Rainbow.
"For those of you that think I am making things worse for @The_OlaJordan, how can I make it worse when she's cried to me since Thursday," he wrote.
".@The_OlaJordan knew about this story 2 days ago and I was there when she cried on the phone to the BBC asking them to stop it. They didn't.
"I was good friends with one of the old strictly producers. And was told BBC leak stories just to get more people interested.
"All of the pros have MASSIVE issues with the way they are treated but I understand why they are scared to speak out! Pros are the best."
Jordan also makes other claims about the way he says Strictly Come Dancing treats its stars.
"One of the pros on the show had to get lawyers involved because BBC told them they HAD to change the colour of their hair.
"Last year I also heard bosses slagging off one of the pros in Blackpool when they were in the bar drinking. Unnecessary.
"Plus the pros work really really really hard and still get SHOUTED at when trying their hardest with the pro numbers."
James Jordan left Strictly Come Dancing this year after being offered a reduced role on the show.
It's not the first time he's criticised the show since leaving.
In September he said producers had started telling the professionals what to wear and how to theme their dances, calling it insulting.
He also claimed on Twitter last month that the BBC had called him saying they'd been told by a taxi driver that he was planning to sabotage a Strictly Come Dancing live show.
