Glamorgan were heading for a bigger advantage in Bristol when all-rounder Graham Wagg, on 55, was forced to retire with an arm injury.
David Lloyd struck a mature 99 off 120 balls as the Welsh side were bowled out for 330, while Craig Miles and Josh Shaw claimed three wickets apiece.
Cameron Bancroft and Graeme van Buuren saw the hosts to 60-1 at stumps.
Wagg returned from hospital with no fracture diagnosed, but severe swelling to his forearm meant he was unable to bowl in the final session.
Gloucestershire's Liam Norwell, who is missing for a second match, is still waiting for a diagnosis of a medical condition which is affecting the feeling in his hand.
Glamorgan all-rounder David Lloyd told BBC Wales Sport:
"I'm disappointed not to get over the line, but it's nice to keep contributing to the team. We've got ourselves a lead and hopefully we can take a few early wickets.
"Graham Wagg's injury wasn't ideal, but those things happen in cricket. It was a nasty blow. The swelling came up straightaway. He's a tough one so, for him not to be able to carry on, he must have been in quite a bit of pain.
"The confidence of getting your first century means you know how to go about your innings and the pressure's off, but hopefully I can keep on doing well for the team."
