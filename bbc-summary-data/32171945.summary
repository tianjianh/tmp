Police said the drugs found in Mullaghbawn on Wednesday were thought to be worth Â£275,000.
The find was made as part of an international drug trafficking investigation, a spokeswoman said.
The men, aged 32, 40 and 53, are expected to appear before special court sittings in Newtownards and Newry on Saturday.
They have been charged with various drugs offences, including conspiracy to supply cannabis.
Police said the arrests were made as part of an international investigation into the supply of 'skunk' cannabis in Northern Ireland.
The PSNI is the lead investigator in the operation, which involves officers from the Italian police and the National Crime Agency.
