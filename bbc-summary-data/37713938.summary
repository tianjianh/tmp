Nintendo has revealed that its next games machine will be a handheld, portable device that doubles up as a home console.

Previously code-named NX, now named the Nintendo Switch, the device looks like a tablet computer with controllers that attach to its sides.
The device was revealed in a short "teaser" video posted on YouTube.
One analyst said the device could be Nintendo's "last shot" at selling a home console.
"The Wii U was a car crash, basically," said Paul Jackson of the Ovum consultancy.
"They fudged the communication and confused everybody with the controller and what the screen was for.
"As a result it sold about a tenth of what the original Wii sold."
The Wii U was rapidly outsold by Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, although Nintendo has enjoyed success with its handheld 3DS device.
The new Switch console can be seated in a dock to play games on a television or used as a stand-alone portable device.
Games will be delivered on small cartridges - a nod to older Nintendo consoles.
Mr Jackson said it was no surprise the new device was a "bit of both" console and handheld.
"Two of the most successful consoles ever are Nintendo's portable devices - both the Gameboy and DS sold more than 100 million each."
Nintendo has announced that leading games studios and publishers such as Activision, Bethesda, EA Games, Sega, Ubisoft and Warner Brothers had signed up to produce software.
However, Mr Jackson said Nintendo would need a strong roster of games to launch its console.
"On the software side, they need the big Mario game, the Zelda game, the Metroid game - front and centre, exclusive to Switch and available at the same time as the console.
"In the past they've got that wrong - and if you have a lousy launch, suddenly you're in the wilderness for a few years."
Nintendo has already announced that its highly-anticipated title Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be released on the Switch.
However, it is yet to reveal the technical specifications of the device, which is due to be released in March 2017.
