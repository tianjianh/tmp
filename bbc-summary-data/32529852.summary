[SN]TITLE[SN]
Demolition order for £4m Bath apartment block

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An apartment block in Bath built with a "blatant disregard" for planning rules must be demolished, councillors say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £4m Upper Oldfield Park development is on conservation land and the local authority says it bears little resemblance to the scheme it approved.
The dimensions of the building were found to be taller and wider than was agreed when permission was granted and an enforcement notice has been issued.
Owner Landmark Developments Ltd said it would appeal against the order.
The company's Margaret Favager said she "did not understand the decision" as she had trusted her advisors and cooperated fully with planning officers throughout the process.
Councillors voted in favour of issuing a demolition order at a meeting where it was said they needed to send "a strong message" on planning laws in a World Heritage site.
A two-storey Edwardian villa was demolished to make way for the five-storey block of 14 flats.
