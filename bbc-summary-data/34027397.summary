[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The space probe Cassini has sent back its latest pics of Saturn's moon Dione.

The planet Saturn has 62 moons around it and Dione is the fourth largest at around 700 miles wide.
The space probe was almost 300 miles away when it captured the shots.
Cassini has been touring Saturn for 11 years and sending images back.
But these pics of Dione are extra special - they're the last the space probe will send of this moon.
Next year the probe will head through Saturn's rings and the year after it will be made to self-destruct.
