[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Farai Kambarani, 26, was convicted of the attempted murder of social worker Ruth Nayamazana, who he wrongly blamed for not letting him see his child.
Luton Crown Court heard his victim, who he also punched in the head 10 to 20 times, still lives in fear.
Kambarani was given a 22-year jail sentence with a three-year extension on licence.
The court heard Kambarani, from Wolverhampton, shunted a car into the back of Ruth Nayamazana's vehicle in Saxon Gate car park in Milton Keynes on 22 August last year.
When she got out, he repeatedly punched her in the head.
In the witness box, the 34-year-old said he pulled out a small knife and used it against the side of her throat.
She said: "I was screaming. I thought he was going to cut my throat. The blood started gushing out."
Kambarani, a former carer for elderly people, was also convicted criminal damage and stalking his former partner.
The court heard Kambarani fled to the UK from Zimbabwe in November 2014 after being arrested and tortured. He began a relationship with another woman in Wolverhampton.
Later his wife and child moved to the UK. In June last year, he became angry when she moved in with her uncle and his wife in Milton Keynes.
Sebastian Gardiner, defending, said: "Fortunately, her life was not endangered. She spent three days in hospital and made a full recovery."
He accepted the attack had caused serious psychological difficulties for the victim.
Judge Philip Bartle said: "You became fixated with Ruth and saw her as an obstacle to you seeing your daughter. There was no justification for that."
