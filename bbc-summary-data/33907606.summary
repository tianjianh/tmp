[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lifeboat crew and coastguard personnel have made extensive searches of the Cromarty Firth following a report of red distress flare.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of RNLI Invergordon had suspected the Perseid meteor shower was to blame for the call-out at 02:05.
But the theory was ruled out after two witnesses described what looked like a flare falling from the sky.
Nothing was found in the searches and the lifeboat volunteers were stood down by about 04:15.
The meteor shower reached the peak of its activity overnight.
