Torquay United 2-3 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yemi Odubade scored twice for Maidstone in a pulsating win at Torquay United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gulls were undone by a dreadful opening 20 minutes as Odubade pounced for the away side after Aman Verma had given the ball away in his own area.
Then, when a free-kick was deflected into the path of Liam Enver-Marum, the striker made no mistake, beating Brendan Moore with a fierce shot.
Nathan Blissett changed the half-time team talks, scoring after Luke Young opened up the chance with a clever through-ball.
Odubade collected a poor header by Lathaniel Rowe-Turner to make it 3-1, despite an initial save by Moore, before Dan Sparkes jabbed in to respond quickly for Torquay.
