New Zealand have dropped Jesse Ryder and Doug Bracewell from their squad for the second Test against India for going on a late-night drinking session on the eve of the first Test.

Coach Mike Hesson said team officials had lost confidence in the pair.
Batsman Ryder, 29, only recently returned to the squad after two years out, including a six-month drug ban.
If a player was to have a beer with their meal before a game, we don't have an issue with that at all. But there's a big difference between that and what occurred the night before the Test match
"Both Jesse and Doug did not prepare themselves well for the Test match and we're very disappointed," said Hesson.
"We need to make sure that all our players prepare themselves accordingly for Test cricket, and at the moment we don't have confidence that that's the case.
"We're dealing with grown men. If a player was to have a beer with their meal before a game, we don't have an issue with that at all. But there's a big difference between that and what occurred the night before the Test match."
Ryder quit international cricket in 2012 citing personal problems.
During his absence he was left in a medically induced coma after being attacked as he left a Christchurch bar.
He was also suspended for six months after testing positive for two banned stimulants.
However, he was brought back into the fold in December 2013, claiming he was "more motivated than ever to perform for New Zealand".
Ryder and all-rounder Bracewell were not in the starting team for the first Test in Auckland, which New Zealand won by 40 runs.
The second Test of the two-match series starts in Wellington on Friday.
