Cerberus appoints receivers over Wilson Group loans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cerberus has appointed receivers to a number of properties associated with the Belfast-based Wilson Group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The US investment fund bought the entire Northern Ireland loan book of Nama, the Irish government's 'bad bank', in 2014 for more than Â£1.2bn.
Among them were loans advanced to the Wilson Group's property development arm.
Receivers have been appointed to 15 properties held by five different companies.
The properties are mainly housing development sites in greater Belfast.
The companies involved are Wilson Developments (NI), Adela Properties, Holywood Homes, Dunsany Developments and Whitechest.
Colliers International is acting as receiver in all cases.
The Irish Times has reported that receivers have also been appointed to a Wilson firm in the Republic of Ireland, Ballybay Estates.
That company owns a development site in Rathoe, County Carlow.
Company accounts indicate that the firms have combined borrowings of more than Â£30m, although Cerberus is not the only lender.
The Wilson Group also owns a number of nursing homes, but they are not affected by the receiverships.
Cerberus has appointed receivers or administrators to a number of its borrowers.
However, it has been able to reach sales or refinancing deals in relation to the majority of the former Nama portfolio.
