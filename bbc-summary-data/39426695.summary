[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield United 2-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leaders Sheffield United defeated bottom club Coventry City but were made to wait for promotion from League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Blades would have secured a top-two finish with a victory over the Sky Blues if Fleetwood had lost at Oxford.
However, Fleetwood's 3-1 win means the Blades still need three more points and Chris Wilder's side will go up if they win at Northampton Town on Saturday.
Leon Clarke and John Fleck, both former Coventry players, scored to send their old club closer to relegation.
Three days on from winning the Checkatrade Trophy at Wembley, Coventry could not extend their three-game winning run in all competitions and they will drop into the fourth tier for the first time since 1959 if they lose at home to Peterborough on Saturday.
Striker Clarke turned in Fleck's cross to open the scoring with 20 minutes remaining, and midfielder Fleck's solo effort made the game safe.
Wilder will return to Northampton, the club he left to take charge of Sheffield United in May 2016, for the first time on Saturday and an away win will be enough for the Blades end their six-year absence from the second tier.
