Their 2-0 win over Sunderland left Hull needed a point at Crystal Palace on Sunday to maintain their survival bid.
But the hosts won 4-0, much to Clement's relief.
"Credit to the players for showing the form they have over the last four games to pick up 10 points from a possible 12," Clement told Swans' website.
"They deserve to be where they are - playing in the Premier League again.''
Clement took over in January with Swans bottom of the table with only 12 points from 19 games.
He added: "I am very proud of what we have achieved in the second half of the season, especially when you put into context where we were when I arrived.
"It's been a collective effort from everyone connected to the club; so congratulations to the players, backroom staff, club staff and definitely our supporters for their help in getting us over the line."
The Welsh club will host West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, 21 May in the season's final round of games.
"I honestly thought it would go down to the last game of the season," added Clement.
"I'm not complaining it hasn't gone to the last game as I predicted.
"And I'm sure the fans will feel the same way after everything they've been through this season.
"Our supporters have been amazing. It's been tough for them at times, but they've stuck with us all the way and I'm delighted for them more than anyone.
"I'm looking forward to enjoying the last game of the season with them at the Liberty on Sunday. It should be a fantastic atmosphere.
"We will be aiming to finish the season strongly and reach 41 points. Then we can look forward and make sure we are stronger next season.''
