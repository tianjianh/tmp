It is understood Mr Wilmot, a father-of-two, had been walking home from Dunstable, where he had been watching the FA Cup Final on Saturday afternoon.
Mr Wilmot's partner of 24 years, Tania Banks, said: "I just can't believe that he's gone and the circumstances [in which] he's gone.
"We're just angry at the situation... and how something like this could happen."
The Health and Safety Executive has been informed about the incident, police said.
