Morris, 18, agreed a two-and-a-half-year professional contract with the Canaries in December 2013, having won the FA Youth Cup earlier that year.
He also has England Under-18 honours.
"It's an opportunity I'm relishing," Morris told BBC Radio Oxford. "I'm just looking forward to Saturday. That would be my competitive debut, so hopefully I get a goal to show for it."
He added: "My aims are to play well, get goals and get Oxford as far up League Two as I can. I'm just looking forward to showing what I can do and get my name out there.
"It's a big club and I would have been silly not to take this opportunity. I'm just looking forward to hit the ground running."
