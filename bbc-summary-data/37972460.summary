The 16-year-old Italy Under-17 striker replaced goalscorer Mario Mandzukic with six minutes left.
Juventus' win took them seven points clear of second-placed Roma, who face Atalanta on Sunday.
Sami Khedira, Mandzukic and Hernanes scored the goals for Juve, who are chasing a sixth Serie A title in a row.
Vincent Thill became the first player born in 2000 to play in France's Ligue 1. The 16-year-old, who has already won seven caps and scored a goal for Luxembourg, played eight minutes for Metz against Bordeaux in September.
Jack Aitchison, also born in 2000, scored on his Celtic debut - with his first touch - on the final day of last season against Motherwell.
Last season, Callum Styles became the first player born in this millennium to feature in the Football League. Unfortunately for Bury, he was not registered properly and they were deducted three points.
Back in April, West Brom's Jonathan Leko was the first player to play in the Premier League born in 1999. Nobody born later has played in the division yet.
