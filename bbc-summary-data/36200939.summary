The crash happened on the A205 South Circular in Tulse Hill, Lambeth, on Wednesday morning.
The driver was treated by paramedics after suffering a hand injury, police said.
Southern Railway said lorries hit the bridge roughly twice every month, causing cancellations and severe delays.
Road closures were in place and drivers were asked to avoid the area.
A spokesman from Southern Railway said: "The bridge was hit by lorries four times in September and has since been struck twice every month, causing more than 147 cancellations and delaying trains by over 73 hours in total."
The situation is so serious at Tulse Hill that Network Rail has now assigned response staff to monitor the bridge on location at peak times every week.
It has also installed a large steel protection beam, the large "low bridge" banner and CCTV.
