[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Independent councillors at Highland Council expect to formally set up a new ruling administration next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last month, the Liberal Democrats walked out of the SNP-led coalition that had run the local authority since 2012.
Following days of talks, the council's Independent group has taken steps to form a new administration.
The matter will be debated by councillors and be the subject of a vote at a special meeting on Thursday.
SNP councillors have said that they will support the new administration "on certain issues".
