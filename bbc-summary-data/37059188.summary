The report was commissioned by former PM David Cameron in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election fraud scandal in 2015.
He said the review had heard evidence that in a London borough at the general election someone arrived at the polling station with 500 postal votes.
"I'm very worried - I don't believe political parties should touch or handle in any way a completed ballot paper," he said.
