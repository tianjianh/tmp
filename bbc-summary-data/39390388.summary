Solihull Moors 0-2 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kundai Benyu's brace strengthened Aldershot's National League play-off hopes with victory at Solihull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old Ipswich loanee, who this week agreed to extend his stay with the Shots until the end of the season, opened the scoring with a low drive from distance into the bottom corner.
Benyu struck again after the break to double his tally, capping a blistering counter-attack by finding a yard in Solihull's box and finishing superbly.
Benyu's heroics extended Aldershot's winning run to four games and gave them a two-point cushion over the chasing pack in fifth place.
