Students who lost work in the Glasgow School of Art (GSA) fire are showing new work made possible through a special programme set up to help them.

GSA established a Phoenix Bursary scheme to help those affected by the blaze which ripped through its iconic Mackintosh building in May last year.
Of the 100 students given grants, 90 are exhibiting at the Reid Building.
The show has paintings, video work, multi-media installations, sculptures, interactive pieces and photography.
It will open to the public on Friday.
An investigation by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service concluded the fire was caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam.
The report, released in November, said the gases ignited as they came into contact with the hot surface of a projector in Studio 19.
In the aftermath of the blaze, GSA launched a Â£20m fundraising drive to pay for the restoration of the Mackintosh and its contents.
The art school confirmed earlier this year that Glasgow-based Page\Park Architects would lead the restoration project.
