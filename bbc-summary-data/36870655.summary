First Leeds bus workers call off strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bus drivers and other workers for First Leeds have called off a planned strike following a revised pay offer from the firm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Unite union previously said 1,000 of its members planned to walk out from 02:00 BST on Tuesday.
It said members would now vote on the revised pay offer.
Drivers have already held two 24-hour strikes, with Unite claiming they earn Â£2 less an hour than other First drivers in the region.
First Leeds has disputed the union's claim of a difference in pay.
The company originally offered a 38p per hour rise, frozen until May 2018, which Unite described as "insulting".
Details of the current offer have not yet been released.
Earlier, Unite and First Leeds representatives met in a bid to resolve the dispute.
First Leeds later announced on its website the industrial action had been called off and a normal service would be operating.
