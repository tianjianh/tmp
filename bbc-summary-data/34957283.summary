The tree was felled early on Sunday morning at Rochford prompting council chairman Heather Glynn to issue an appeal for help on social media.
Local people came to her aid and by 10:00 GMT the tree was back in place and the Christmas lights restored.
Ms Glynn said she was in despair when the discovery was made but is now looking forward to the switch-on.
"Thanks to an amazing community spirit, and acts kindness from some truly wonderful people, the tree is back up," she said.
"Fortunately the lighting event was not until the afternoon and people were determined not to let the vandals beat them," she said.
Festival organiser Pete Tobit said: "It was an act of mindless vandalism. Nothing stolen, just cut down.
"I have arranged all the entertainment for the Rochford Lights for a number of years and could not believe what I saw this morning.
"Thankfully, there are quite a few community spirited people in Rochford who just turned up and offered their services to reinstate the tree and lights.
"It certainly has restored my faith in community spirit."
