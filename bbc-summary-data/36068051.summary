Viktorija Golubic, ranked 129th in the world, had kept Switzerland in touch with the Czechs thanks to two singles wins, but she and Martina Hingis went down 6-2 6-2 to Pliskova and Hradecka in the decider.
"It was sensational the way they played," said Czech captain Petr Pala.
"The key was the depth of our team today. It gave me more opportunities to make the doubles team. It is a great feeling for the camp. The sprit is there, everybody wants to win the cup."
The final will take place in France, with the venue yet to be decided, on 12-13 November.
