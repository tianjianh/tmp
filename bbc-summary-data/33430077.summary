The 26-year-old Pole, finalist in 2012, used her craft and guile to overcome American Keys 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-3.
Radwanska, the 13th seed, edged a tight first set and secured the decider with the only break after the heavy-hitting Keys, 20, responded.
She will next face Spain's 20th seed Garbine Muguruza, who beat Timea Bacsinszky 7-5 6-3.
"It couldn't be any better. I'm so happy," Radwanska told BBC Sport.
"It was very tight, point by point, game by game. Serve was the key so one break and there you go."
Top seed Serena Williams will face world number four Maria Sharapova in the other semi-final.

Radwanska was the steadier player during an enthralling match, as Keys hit 48 winners and 40 unforced errors. In contrast, the Pole's tally was 13-7.
The American saved three set points in her final service game of the first set, but went long off both wings in the tie-break as Radwanska won it 7-3.
Keys, the 21st seed, improved in the second set and a fortunate net-cord allowed her to break in the eighth game.
There were several spectacular rallies in the deciding set with little to choose between the players until, serving at 3-4, Keys allowed a floating backhand to drop in, double-faulted and netted a forehand.
Muguruza saw off Timea Bacsinszky in straight sets to reach the last four of a Grand Slam for the first time.
A single break was enough to give the Spaniard, 21, the first set before her backhand overpowered the 25-year-old Swiss 15th seed in the second set to clinch a 7-5 6-3 victory.
"It is just amazing. I am so happy. It was a very tough match and I am just so excited. The last game was very intense," said Muguruza, who beat Angelique Kerber and Caroline Wozniacki in her previous two matches.
"It is very hard to make the last four of Wimbledon, so to achieve this I am very proud."
She is the first Spanish woman to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1997.
