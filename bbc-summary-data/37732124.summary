[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boy who raped nine-year-old boy 'affected by gay porn websites'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A boy who was 11 when he raped a nine-year-old searched the internet for "gay rape", "gay porn" and "gay rape porn", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Now aged 13, the boy also sexually assaulted two other boys aged seven and 11.
A judge told the youngster he was concerned he "may have been affected by material available to you [online]".
The boy, from Blackpool, was given a four-year sentence at Preston Crown Court.
Judge Mark Brown said the boy, who earlier pleaded guilty to rape and sexual assault, would have received a considerably longer sentence if he had been an adult.
He said the boy was not "experimenting sexually" but rather was "obtaining sexual gratification or pleasure" by assaulting the children.
The nine-year-old victim had been sexually assaulted in his bedroom "on a number of occasions over a period of some time" and rapes had also taken place, the court was told.
Judge Brown told the boy it was "a terrible and dreadful thing you did to him and I hope you appreciate it should never have happened."
The court was told that while on bail, the boy had committed another assault.
The court heard that a pre-sentence report indicated the boy was a "high" risk for committing further offences and he would be subject to notification requirements under the Sexual Offences Act upon release.
Virginia Hayton, defending, said her client "clearly needs help and support" but had been using his time in custody productively.
She said there were "concerns about his upbringing" but conceded he was aware of his actions and his "desire outweighed the knowledge and remorse of what he was doing".
Judge Brown said he would be "failing" in his "public duty" if he did not send the boy into custody for his "terrible crimes" but hoped people would understand he must have regard for the boy's future and welfare.
"I must have in mind all that I know about you - your capabilities as a young person, and in particular your future, your welfare and the prospects of reform and rehabilitation", he said.
