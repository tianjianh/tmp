The 24-year-old tighthead will join the Premiership side, who play their home games in Coventry, after seeing out the rest of the season in the Pro12.
Moore, who has won 10 Ireland caps and been part of the past two Six Nations triumphs, missed last autumn's 2015 World Cup through injury.
"I am excited about the challenge ahead in the Premiership," said Moore.
"However, up until the move I am fully committed to Leinster and I would like to thank everyone here as well as the Leinster fans for the support they have shown me."
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young and his coaching team have first-hand experience of Moore's talent, having faced them in the European Champions Cup this season.
"Marty has already proven his international pedigree with Ireland and, at only 24, he has plenty of years ahead of him to continue his development and become a top-class tight-head," said Young.
"We already have talented tight-heads at the club, but his addition will strengthen the depth we have in this key position."
Moore is Wasps' first signing for next season, although they have already announced that stand-off Alex Lozowski will join Saracens.
Wasps released Samoan international tighthead prop James Johnston earlier this month to allow him to join Worcester Warriors.
