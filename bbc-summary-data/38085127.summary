The colt was discovered alive alongside a toilet, bath and other rubbish on Meadow Lane in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, at about 20:20 GMT on Tuesday.
Nearby farm owner Tony Perrin said the "skinny and scrawny" horse was "kicking its legs but couldn't move".
The RSPCA, which is investigating, said the foal died before a vet could attend and the body has been removed.
Mr Perrin, who was called by police to assist, told Mansfield Chad: "It was awful - when I arrived it was still alive.
"This is the second time this has happened down here."
The 64-year-old said the injured foal must have been left after 18:00 GMT by whoever illegally dumped the rubbish.
Derbyshire Police said it had received a call from a member of the public who found the horse and contacted the RSPCA.
An RSPCA spokesperson said: "As our nearest available officer was 80 miles away dealing with an emergency, we requested that police send officers to the scene.
"Sadly, the officers later informed us that the colt - which we believe had suffered from a broken neck - died of his injuries before a vet could attend.
"The body was left at the site overnight and an RSPCA officer attended the following day to investigate the circumstances in which he was dumped at the scene.
"We would like to hear from anyone who may know where this horse came from or who may have seen anything suspicious in the area to contact us."
