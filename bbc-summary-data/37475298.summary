Red Arrows pilot death: Ejector seat firm to be prosecuted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ejector seat firm will be prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over the death of a Red Arrows pilot in 2011.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flt Lt Sean Cunningham, 35, was injured after being ejected from a Hawk T1 jet while on the ground at RAF Scampton.
The parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the South African-born airman died in hospital on 8 November.
The HSE will prosecute Martin Baker Aircraft Ltd for an alleged breach of health and safety law.
Inspector David Butter said: "We have conducted a thorough investigation and consider there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to bring a prosecution."
Martin Baker Aircraft Company Ltd, of Lower Road, Higher Denham, near Uxbridge, is to appear at Lincoln Magistrates' Court, at a date to be confirmed, to face a section three charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act.
The alleged breach is Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, which states: "It shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety."
HSE investigated the incident following a number of separate inquiries including those by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the civilian and military police, the Military Aviation Authority and the Military Air Accident Investigation Branch.
