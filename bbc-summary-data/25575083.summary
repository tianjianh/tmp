A 12-year-old schoolgirl who posed for "selfie" photos with Prince William says it was a dare from her mum.

Madison Lambe, of Boston, Lincolnshire, took the snaps during a visit to Sandringham on Christmas Day to watch the Royal Family walk to church.
Following the service the Duke of Cambridge came over to her and when asked for a photo he replied "you can't beat a good selfie on Christmas Day".
"He didn't seem bothered that I asked him, he was really nice," said Madison.
"It was sort of a dare from my mum to ask the Queen or him for a photo," added Madison, a pupil at Boston High School.
"I took down some flowers and there were a lot of other children there. When William got down to where I was stood I asked him if I could have a picture and he said 'yes'.
"Then he said 'right, you can't beat a good selfie on Christmas Day'.
"I didn't really expect it. It was a really good experience."
The prince posed for two photos with Madison, appearing to pout slightly in the second.
Last month Prince Charles posed for a selfie with a boy during a visit to Stevenage, Hertfordshire.
