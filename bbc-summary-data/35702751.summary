The 20-year-old left-arm seamer has played two Tests, nine one-day internationals and 10 T20s for the national side.
Mustafizur will be available for the whole tournament, subject to his commitments with Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League.
He will become the first Bangladesh international to play for Sussex.
"He is a cricketer with incredible ability and is currently one of the bright young talents of world cricket," Sussex head coach Mark Davis said.
"His unorthodox bowling variations make him a very difficult customer to bat against, and he will be a brilliant addition to our team."
Mustafizur, who has taken 27 wickets in 20 T20 matches at an average of 16.11 and has an economy rate of 5.66 runs an over, will also be eligible to play for Sussex in the One-Day Cup.
He is in the Bangladesh squad for the ICC World Twenty20 in India, which begins on 8 March.
Sussex previously signed New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor as their overseas player for the first half of the 2016 season.
