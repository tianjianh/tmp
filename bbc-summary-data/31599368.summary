Star Wars superfan auctioning off rare figures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most collectors would probably tell you they couldn't put a price on their beloved collectables, but Craig Stevens probably had to re-think that one.

The Star Wars superfan made £15,000 selling a single Boba Fett figure, and now he's selling another 15 rare items.
Craig Stevens sold the pristine, unopened bounty hunter toy at auction house Vectis last month.
Now the next batch of his galactic goods are expected to fetch between £28,000 to £40,000.
The most highly valued item this time is a Palitoy FX-7 medical droid from The Empire Strikes Back.
A similar item sold last year for around £8,400.
What makes his profit margins seem more out of this world, is that the Boba Fett figure would have set you back £1.50 in 1980.
If you're reading this thinking it's a no-brainer for Craig, he agrees.
He said: "I'm living in a rented flat in my home town. You think to yourself, 'I'm in a flat and I've got a box of figures worth as much as a house'.
"There's no contest really."
He might even be able to run to a swimming pool - he's got 10,000 more items in his collection of Star Wars memorabilia.
