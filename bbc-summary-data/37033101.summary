Emma Fairthorne, from Bournemouth, posted a video on social media after her daughter Georgia, suffered head injuries while on holiday in Wales.
The video, filmed outside University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, has been viewed more than 900,000 times.
She urged parents to "just take care" and ensure their children wore helmets.
Georgia Fairthorne had been on holiday in Pembrokeshire when she suffered a traumatic head injury after coming off her skateboard.
She was transferred to hospital in Cardiff where she underwent surgery for a bleed on the brain.
On Saturday Ms Fairthorne posted a video in which she said:  "I wish as a mum, I had provided her with a helmet, I'm just praying the best possible outcome happens for her - I don't know what quality of life she's going to have if she makes it through the next few days."
She urged parents to "Please guys, just take care - get them helmets when they are on their scooters and skateboards. It only took that one second."
Another video posted on Tuesday, she said her daughter was stable and "showing some really encouraging signs".
