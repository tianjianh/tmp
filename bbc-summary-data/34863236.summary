Some 148,976 cars rolled off UK production lines last month, down from 150,060 in the same month last year.
But, for the 10 months to end-October, production was still running at its highest since 2005, driven by exports.
Overseas demand rose 1.5% in October year-on-year, but domestic demand fell 8.3%.
About 80% of UK car production went for export, according to the figures.
"Despite a small drop in overall output last month, the industry has delivered a robust performance so far this year, particularly in terms of exports," said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive.
"Given the slowdown we've seen in several key global markets in recent months, UK automotive manufacturing still remains in a strong position."
For the year so far, production is at 1,318,452, up 2.8% on the figure of 1,282,080 in the same period for 2014.
On Tuesday, Europe's trade body for the car industry, the Association of European Carmakers, reported that car sales across the EU slowed sharply in October from the month before.
Analysts suggested that buyers may have been put off purchases while they awaited the outcome of investigations into how carmakers report emissions data, sparked by the discovery that VW cheated emissions tests.
