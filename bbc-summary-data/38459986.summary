The 36-year-old former Wales international was released by Rotherham last season and joined the Mariners on a short-term deal in September.
Collins, who played in the Premier League with Sunderland and Stoke, has scored once in 15 outings so far.
"It's just nice to be out there, playing football and enjoying it at my age," he told the club website.
