[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County 3-0 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The rejuvenated Tom Ince scored twice for the second game in a row but missed two penalties as Derby County cruised past bottom-of-the-table Rotherham United for a third successive win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ince's weak 15th-minute spot-kick was easily saved by Lee Camp but he tapped in the rebound for the opener.
Darren Bent's sweet low strike made it 2-0 and an unmarked Ince knocked in the third Rams goal after the break.
The winger then won his second penalty but was denied a hat-trick by Camp.
A fourth Derby win in six under head coach Steve McClaren never looked in doubt from the moment Ince was fouled in the box by Darnell Fisher and scored on the follow-up past former Rams goalkeeper Camp.
After Bent smashed in a second four minutes later, the hosts had numerous chances to add to their lead against a Millers side woefully lacking in confidence and quality.
Alex Pearce had a header saved and Will Hughes shot over the bar when well placed, and the chances still came after Ince made it 3-0.
But Rotherham, who managed just one shot on target and still have only one Championship victory this season, were spared further embarrassment.
Derby manager Steve McClaren: "We didn't start well, once we got the goal we settled. We could have scored more and we created chances.
"Five or six games a go we were wondering if we would ever score, but now we are creating chances and credit to the staff.
"We could have scored four, we missed a penalty but the clean sheet was important. Progress was made. We are not the full package, there is still a lot of work, but I am still encouraged by the response of the players."
Rotherham manager Kenny Jackett:  "We are still struggling to find a defensive set-up that can keep us competitive.
"We started the game pretty well in the first 20 minutes, we had a lot of it, we had the ball and made inroads but then we gave two very poor goals away on the break when we were in good positions.
"The second half was similar, we were playing in and around our box and then gave away a very, very poor third goal away. The key moments took the game to them.
"The outstanding statistic which is disappointing again is the goals against column. It's frustrating when you lose the game. The better side won, I can't say that wasn't the case. We started the game and gave them two goals, which is disappointing."
