Jersey Neolithic monument vandals apologise for graffiti

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vandals who wrote "kill" and "die" on an ancient monument in Jersey apologised after a heritage group posted pictures on Facebook.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Mont Ubé Dolmen, a Neolithic passage grave, was originally built about 3,500 BC and 2,800 BC.
Societe Jersiaise posted the photos on Saturday and soon "had a very brave admission" from those responsible.
Jersey Police said it had received a formal complaint and would be investigating.
Archaeologist Robert Waterhouse said dozens had come forward to offer help in removing the paint.
He said: "It was absolutely wonderful to find so many messages of support; we are rather touched by it.
"Mont Ubé is one of my favourite Dolmens and it was upsetting to find it damaged but I was encouraged to find a lot of people share my view that it is a wonderful place."
He said they could not take people up on the offer as the stones would need specialist treatment as the paint was "stuck on and difficult to remove".
