The 55-year-old woman was struck by the HGV near the junction of Horseferry Road and Millbank, close to Lambeth Bridge, at 09:30 BST.
The emergency services, including the air ambulance, were called but the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.
The 40-year-old lorry driver stopped at the crash site but was not arrested, Scotland Yard said.
A Transport for London (TfL) spokesman said it was the fifth cyclist death on the capital's roads this year.
Leon Daniels from TfL said: "We are truly saddened that a cyclist has lost their life.
"Our sympathies are with family and friends. A full investigation into the incident will be carried out."
A post-mortem examination will be held in due course.
