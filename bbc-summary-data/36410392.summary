Despite losing the cup final to Canada in the last round in France, Australia finished the series 14 points ahead of New Zealand.
They are the first Australian team - male or female - to win a Sevens Series championship.
England, who will comprise the majority of Great Britain's team for the 2016 Olympics, finished fourth in France.
They were beaten 22-5 by New Zealand in the cup third place play-off at Clermont-Ferrand and finished fourth in the overall standings.
Head coach Simon Middleton said: "We've got players who have played consistently well throughout the year and a really strong squad to take to Brazil. There's a lot of competition for places, including among those still back home."
The Women's Sevens Series was played across five countries, with Australia winning in Dubai, Brazil and the USA, and England winning in Canada.
Women's sevens will make its Olympic debut in Rio this summer.
