The pavilion and green from Billingham's John Whitehead Park are to form part of the 1950s town in Beamish open air museum.
Once it is complete, visitors will be able to try their hand at bowls and discover stories of the popular leisure pursuit and wider community life.
The Â£10.7m 1950s development will also include an original house, shop and cinema from the era.
Beamish is also seeking people's memories of the bowling pavilion, and staff will be attending an open day at the Billingham Bowling Club on Sunday.
Geraldine Straker, of Beamish, said: "We'll be telling the story of life in the region's tight-knit communities, and clubs such as this played an important part.
"We really want to hear people's memories of life in the 1950s, particularly any early memories of the bowling pavilion, and this will help shape the stories we share at Beamish."
