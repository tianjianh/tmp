Robin Hollyson, 31, from Luton, was sentenced to 24 years in prison last year, at Bristol Crown Court.
The trial heard he was filmed abusing a baby as part of a gang of seven paedophiles, who streamed some attacks on children over the internet.
He killed himself in his cell after he was taken off suicide watch at Horfield prison in Bristol, the BBC understands.
Last year's trial heard the gang raped and assaulted a baby, a toddler and a young child, between 2013 and 2014.
Other members of the gang were from Manchester, Hampshire, Somerset, Wiltshire, East Sussex and East Yorkshire.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said Hollyson, who had changed his name to James King, had been found unresponsive in his cell last Friday.
"Prison staff attempted CPR and paramedics attended, but he died in hospital on Sunday," he added.
"As with all deaths in custody, the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation."
