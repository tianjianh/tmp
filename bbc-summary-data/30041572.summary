He had to pull together a group of children and celebrities to record and perform a single for Children in Need.
The choir are singing a cover version of Avicii's smash hit Wake Me Up, and it is doing well in the UK music charts.
Some of the celebrity singers include CBBC's Radzi Chinyanganya, Bake-off presenter Mel Giedroyc  and Strictly meanie Craig Revel Horwood.
Ricky caught up with Gareth to find out how the rehearsals are going.
