The son of Arthur Jones, 73, described the news as "deeply upsetting", although the man's body has yet to be formally identified by authorities.
Mr Jones, a keen walker with 40 years' experience, had not been seen since 19 June - two days after he arrived on the Greek island for a holiday.
His family thought he could have gone out walking by himself and may have been taken ill.
"The last six weeks have been terribly stressful, difficult to cope and hard to think straight," said Jeff Jones, from Prestatyn, who had visited Crete to search for his father.
"It is deeply upsetting and a big shock to finally receive some news but it comforting to know he was doing something he enjoyed.
"We as a family would like to thank everyone for their support, help and contribution in a quest to find my father since he went missing six weeks ago."
Family and friends flew to the island to help search for the pensioner and were later joined by North Wales Police.
Det Chief Insp Gareth Evans from North Wales Police said although the body had not been formally identified there were personal possessions which led authorities to believe it was that of Mr Jones.
He said the man's body was found "sitting under a tree" which followed the theory that he had gone out for a walk and "suffered some form of medical episode" and had then sought shelter or shade.
"The fact that the body has not been found for six weeks highlights how difficult it is to search that area. It is very open countryside," said Mr Evans.
"It's a very sad day for the family ... but it gives them some answers as well."
The alarm was raised when Mr Jones did not board his plane home on 24 June.
Official searches focused on the area between his hotel and a nearby war cemetery where he signed the visitors' book.
A Facebook campaign to Find Arthur attracted support from over 3,000 people and Prime Minister David Cameron also pledged to do "everything he can" to help find Mr Jones.
