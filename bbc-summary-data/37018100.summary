[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 1-0 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster sealed their first win of the campaign thanks to a 1-0 success over Cambridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Marquis made amends for an early penalty miss by heading the only goal of the game for Rovers.
Victory is just Doncaster's fourth of the calendar year, while Cambridge remain winless this term.
Rovers were given a golden chance to open the scoring after 10 minutes when Marquis was felled in the box by Sean Long.  Marquis stepped up to take the spot-kick but saw his blasted effort kept out by the legs of Will Norris.
Doncaster rallied from that setback with Andy Williams, Marquis and Tommy Rowe all kept at bay by the busy Norris.
Cambridge looked toothless in attack but were keeping the shop shut at the back.
Play was halted for around 10 minutes midway through the second half whilst a replacement assistant from the crowd was found.
Rovers responded well despite that needless distraction and after 74 minutes Marquis corrected his earlier mistake when he headed home Matty Blair's precise cross.
