John Travolta defamation case dismissed by judge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judge has dismissed a defamation case against actor John Travolta, filed by a man who wrote a book claiming he had sexual encounters with the star.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Randolph's book, You'll Never Spa in This Town Again, was published in Februrary.
Randolph claimed Travolta and his lawyer defamed him by spreading false statements about his mental health, to persuade people not to buy it.
Travolta's lawyer Martin Singer had called the legal action "absurd".
Judge Malcolm Mackey at Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed Randolph's defamation case, which centred on a letter Singer wrote to the website Gawker.com, in response to a story about the planned book.
The judge's reasons for the dismissal were not disclosed. However, CNN reported he had found part of the letter to have free speech protection under US law.
Randolph's book was published three months before two unidentified male masseurs filed sexual assault cases against Travolta.
They both swiftly dropped their cases in May, after doubt was cast over the details of their alleged encounters.
Pulp Fiction star Travolta has always denied the claims made against him.
The 58-year-old actor has been married to actress Kelly Preston since 1991.
The couple have two children. Their teenage son Jett died in 2009 during a family holiday in the Bahamas.
