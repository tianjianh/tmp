The service, which runs on Friday and Saturday nights, launched on 19 August last year with two lines running. It has run on five lines since December.
The eight millionth journey on the Night Tube is expected to take place this weekend as the service marks its one-year anniversary.
The mayor's office says 3,600 jobs are supported by the Night Tube.
Sadiq Khan said it had been a "huge success" which had "significantly" boosted the night time economy.
The most popular stations are Leicester Square, Oxford Circus, Brixton, Liverpool Street and Stratford.
226,641
Entries and exits on 17 December, the most popular night
153,250 Entries and exits a night on average
6,995 Average number of entries and exits per night of the busiest station, Leicester Square
65 Average number of entries and exits of the least popular station, Fairlop
BBC London has analysed data from Transport for London (TfL) on how many people entered and exited each Tube station every half an hour between 19 August and 18 February.
It shows that:
The service cost Â£20.5m to run in the financial year of 2016-17.
It was first proposed in November 2013 by former mayor Boris Johnson and was due to begin in September 2015.
But it faced a difficult start as a series of strikes over pay delayed trains by nearly a year.
Dates when the Night Tube opened on different lines:
Mr Khan said: "No one could have predicted just how successful the Night Tube would be."
Val Shawcross, deputy mayor for transport, said City Hall were now looking "at how we can move ahead" including expanding to other lines.
The service is due to run on part of the Overground later this year, but Ms Shawcross suggested it could open on the Circle and District "when they've finished their upgrades in the 2020s".
The Night Tube has had some complaints over increased night noise near Tube lines but Ms Shawcross said TfL was "actively working" to reduce complaints.
