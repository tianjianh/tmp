[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering PC Dave Phillips has accepted his driving caused the officer's death but said he did not intend to kill him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old father-of-two died after being hit by a pick-up vehicle in Merseyside on Monday.
Clayton Williams, 18, "extended his apologies" to the officer's family, in a statement from his solicitor after a preliminary hearing.
Mr Williams was earlier remanded in custody at Liverpool Crown Court.
He is due in court again on 22 October.
Mr Williams' solicitor Andrew Egerton issued a statement which said:
"Mr Williams has accepted that his actions and his driving caused the death of PC Phillips. He is adamant that he did not drive at the officer and that he did not intend to injure, let alone kill, him.
"He extended his apologies through the police to PC Phillips' young family. It is now time for the judicial process to take over, and we would ask that all bear in mind Mr Williams' right to a fair trial."
It also added he felt the media coverage has not given the full picture in the case.
Mr Williams, of Wheatland Lane, Wallasey, is accused of murdering the father of two, attempting to wound another police officer, aggravated theft of a motor vehicle and burglary.
A second man, Phillip Stuart, 30, of Mayfair Court, Oxton, has been charged with burglary and aggravated taking of a vehicle.
He was also remanded in custody until 22 October, when he is due to appear at Liverpool Crown Court for a preliminary hearing.
PC Phillips, 34, was killed as he attempted to use a tyre-puncturing" stinger" device to stop a vehicle in Wallasey.
