Manager Brendan Rodgers now has two trophies in his debut season, following League Cup success in November, and has a Scottish Cup semi-final with Rangers to look forward to.
Unbeaten in all domestic games, the Celtic class of 2016-17 are already in record-breaking form.
Here are a few of the key numbers behind their successful league defence.
No Scottish champions have gone unbeaten since the 19th Century. Celtic (1897-98) - P18 W15 D3 L0 - and Rangers (1898-99) - P18 W18 D0 L0 - both managed the feat, but those campaigns were less than half the duration of the current one.
In the SPL/Premiership era, Celtic lost once in their 2013-14 and 2001-02 successes.
In season 1967-68, both winners Celtic and runners-up Rangers were beaten just once.
The longest unbeaten league sequence in the modern age is 32, set by Celtic in 2003-04. The current side have played 30.
Celtic set a remarkable record of 62 unbeaten league games from 1915-17, although that is some way behind Steaua Bucharest's 106 (1986-89).
The previous record was SEVEN set by Rangers in 1928-29 and equalled by Celtic in 2013-14, both over 38-game campaigns like this one.
Paris Saint-Germain set a new European mark last season when they finished 31 points clear in Ligue 1, bettering the 29-point margin of victory Celtic managed in 2013-14. Rodgers' side are currently 25 points ahead of Aberdeen in second place.
The Scottish record is 103 points, set by Celtic in 2001-02, Martin O'Neill's second season in charge, with Rangers 18 points adrift.
Only Welsh side Barry Town AFC have completed a top-flight campaign with more; 105 in 1996-97 and 104 in 1997-98.
Juventus, Real Madrid and Barcelona are the other European sides to have hit 100 or more in a term.
If Celtic can keep on winning, there are a possible 110 up for grabs this time.
Celtic will need to average three goals a game over the home stretch to reach the 105 they scored in 2003-04.
The current league average is 2.7 goals per game without a single blank return.
In 1966-67, under the legendary Jock Stein, Celtic netted 111 goals in 34 Division One games, returning an eye-watering 196 in all competitions on their way to a domestic treble and European Cup glory.
This record can only be equalled if Craig Gordon doesn't let another goal in.
Between them, Celtic pair Fraser Forster and Lukasz Zaluska kept 25 Premier League shut-outs in 2011-12.
England keeper Forster established a league record of 13 consecutive clean sheets, with the run finally ending on 1,256 minutes.
Celtic have conceded 18 goals in their 30 league games so far.
Close but no cigar. This season's run came to an end with a 1-1 draw at home to Rangers on 12 March. The record stands at 25; set by Celtic in 2003-04.
The European best belongs to Benfica, with 29 across two seasons from 1971-73, while Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb managed 28 from 2006-07.
Scott Sinclair banged in a hat-trick against Hearts to overtake team-mate Moussa Dembele by one in the Scottish Premiership scoring charts.
They each have a long way to catch the SPL/Premiership era record of 35 set by Celtic hero Henrik Larsson in 2000-01.
Motherwell's William MacFadyen 52 goals in 1931-32 may never be beaten.
Again, Celtic are chasing a record of their own, with 33 games won in the 2001-02 season.
A 100% run from here on in would take the champions to 36.
If Celtic were to go on and lift the Scottish Cup, it would be the club's fourth domestic treble. Rangers hold the world record with seven clean sweeps.
Still some way to go to reach the Old Firm benchmark of NINE set by Celtic (1965-74) and equalled by Rangers (1989-97) and nowhere near the European best of 14, held jointly by Latvians Skonto Riga and Lincoln Red Imps of Gibraltar.
And where did Rodgers' reign begin?
That's right, with a 1-0 defeat away to the Red Imps in July, a result widely seen as the worst in the club's history. That seems like a long time ago now.
