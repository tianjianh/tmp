The project, funded by Eastbourne Borough Council, will see the Devonshire Park venue redeveloped over the next three years.
A show court will be built along with new practice courts, changing rooms and medical and media facilities.
It was also announced that Eastbourne will stage the Aegon International tournament for at least 10 more years.
The grasscourt tournament regularly attracts the elite of the women's game, with past winners including Justine Henin, Kim Clijsters, Monica Seles and Martin Navratilova.
Teenager Belinda Bencic lifted the trophy last year with a 6-4 4-6 6-0 victory over Agnieszka Radwanska in the final.

Starting next year, the site will co-host the long-standing Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Premier event with a men's World Tour 250 tournament in the same week.
"We are thrilled by Eastbourne Borough Council's substantial investment into Devonshire Park to keep this iconic venue as one of the very best in the country," said LTA chief executive Michael Downey.
"We are also delighted to enter into a brand-new 10-year hosting agreement with the site, ensuring that world class women's and men's tennis will be here until at least until 2026, guaranteeing our loyal fans the best possible entertainment experience."
