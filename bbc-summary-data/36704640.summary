[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesex openers Sam Robson and Nick Gubbins both fell after good starts to give Yorkshire a boost on a rain-hit second day at Scarborough.

The visitors had reached 87-0 when Robson top edged Jack Brooks to Will Rhodes for 40 and Gubbins soon followed, lbw to Rhodes, for 43.
Middlesex were 130-2 when bad light and rain ended play early after tea.
Earlier, Yorkshire moved from 291-5 to 406 all out, with Gary Ballance taking his score on to 132.
The left-hander added 26 to his overnight 106 not out before he and Azeem Rafiq both went in the same James Franklin over, to leave Yorkshire 334-8.
But late cameos from wicketkeeper Andy Hodd (37), Steven Patterson and Brooks took the reigning county champions past 400.
Robson and Gubbins, both averaging more than 60 with the bat this season, brought up their sixth half-century stand but were both out in the space of 16 balls.
Stevie Eskinazi and George Bailey steadied things in a gloomy final session interrupted twice by the weather, before the players went off at 17:50 BST and did not return.
