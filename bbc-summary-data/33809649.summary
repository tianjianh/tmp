A Swedish pilot had to prise open a toilet door with an axe, after a drunk passenger refused to leave the cubicle.

The man, who was in his 50s, locked the bathroom door 10 minutes before the Nextjet's flight from Stockholm was due to land in the northern town of Ornskoldsvik on Wednesday.
He was repeatedly asked to return to his allocated seat in order to comply with safety regulations.
But he refused to co-operate, prompting the captain to intervene.
He grabbed the axe and used it to pry open the door so he could remove the man.
"He definitely did not smash down the door, it's not as dramatic as one might think," police chief Kerstin Svedberg told AFP.
The passenger was not taken into custody, but is suspected of violating Swedish aviation laws.
He could face a fine or up to six months in prison if convicted.
