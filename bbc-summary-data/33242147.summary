'Careful now': Waterford council bans bad language from parks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It would be enough to bring a bout of scandalised swear words from the lips of Father Jack Hackett.

A council in the Republic of Ireland has decided new laws are needed to clean up its parks - and the mouths of park users.
Waterford City and County Council is not just cracking down on litter and anti-social behaviour.
It has banned cursing in a bid to prevent the air around its green spaces from turning blue.
New byelaws have put the stopper in any shouts of Fr Jack's favourite phrases.
The move is reminiscent of Craggy Island's most famous residents' attempts to give up various vices for Lent.
Drinking, smoking and rollerblading are all strictly banned from the park. Even vaping, or using e-cigarettes, is not allowed.
Likewise, barbequing, flower picking and flying model aeroplanes are illegal.
According to the new laws, anyone caught indulging in the above, perhaps while swearing up a storm, is liable to get slapped with a 1270 euro (Â£900) fine and kicked out of the park, Bishop Brennan style.
So is Waterford set to put a legislative bleep on public expletives or is it just a flippant attempt to get people to park their potty mouths?
Councillor Lola O'Sullivan says it's more about the spirit, rather than the letter, of the law.
"The 'no cursing' rule is creating a lot of headlines," she said. "But that law has come about simply because you might have a group of teenagers who are in the park and are loud and using bad language.
"In fact, it might be the only time they use bad language, because they are out of the house.
"So we want to put up a sign that says 'no cursing, no smoking' among other things.
"I know in other cities, including Belfast, they have signs in their parks with a list of rules and regulations. So it'll be like that.
"Waterford doesn't have any more anti-social behaviour problems than anywhere else - we just want to encourage people to be respectful in the parks."
The Fine Gael council member said the new byelaws came about because the amalgamation of two councils - Waterford City and Waterford County - required a review of the legislation.
It passed through council unanimously, she added, and "nobody mentioned" the no swearing law during a six-week public consultation.
Still, are these laws enforceable? And what about accusations that this is another instance of the 'nanny state' telling people how to behave?
"Well, look, you're not going to have people hiding behind bushes, trying to catch people out when they say the odd swear word," she said. "The police are not going to bring someone up to court over something like that."
She added that the laws are for extreme cases.
"Say you were to pick one flower from the park, and present it to your other half," she supposed. "It's no problem. But say you pick every flower you can carry and presented them to your work colleagues.
"Well, they'd love it, but you'd be in trouble then."
In fact, the councillor suggested a tongue-in-cheek additional measure that could be used to curb any gratuitous grubby language.
"We should consider using swear boxes at the entrances and exits of the parks, get people to donate for any curse words. Maybe that would help us keep the parks respectful."
