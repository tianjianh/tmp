[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old former Ireland international played for Wigan and Hull FC before joining Widnes in 2012.
"It's an injury that kept coming up. We explored every opportunity to make it better," he told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"My body has taken that much of a hammer things haven't recovered as well as they should have done."
O'Carroll, who has played 149 Super League games for Widnes, including six this season, played for Ireland in two Rugby League World Cups and won six caps for his country between 2007 and 2013.
