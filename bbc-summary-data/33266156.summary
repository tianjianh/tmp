Police said they received a report on Wednesday from a concerned mother who said her daughter and her best friend had admitted taking the drug.
Both had lied to their parents about staying at each other's houses, and were found "showing abnormal symptoms" on their return.
Officers have posted a message on Facebook warning people to be vigilant.
The message from Greater Manchester Police's north division reads: "We are currently working with the parents and the school liaison officer to obtain intelligence about who sold the ecstasy to the young teenagers.
"Please can all parents be aware if their child is acting suspicious."
