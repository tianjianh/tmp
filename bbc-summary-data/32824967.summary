A football pitch on the Western Isles has been recognised by Fifa as one of eight remarkable places to play the game in the world.

A match played on the field in Eriskay has been filmed for screening in the football governing body's new museum in Zurich in Switzerland.
The Fifa World Football Museum is due to be opened to the public next year.
Eriskay is renowned for a shipwreck that inspired the book and film Whisky Galore.
Martin Macaulay, manager of Eriskay FC,  told BBC Alba the playing surface was "well bumpy. It's just all over the place.
"One time we had five corners, now we are down to four corners."
But he added: "It is unique with its views of Eriskay. It is a nice place."
Eriskay's other claim to fame centres on the SS Politician, which ran aground off the island on 5 February 1941.
Its cargo included more than 250,000 bottles of whisky.
Author Compton MacKenzie used the grounding of the ship as the basis of his book Whisky Galore in 1947, and an Ealing comedy followed in 1949.
