Pete and Andrew both love to surf, but got fed up of sharing the ocean with tonnes of rubbish.
They decided it was time for a clean-up, and have invented a 'sea bin' which is specially designed to float on the surface of the ocean, and vacuum up the rubbish.
And it's not just surfers who will benefit - rubbish in the ocean can cause much more serious problems for sea-life.
Experts say that animals like turtles, dolphins, whales, and sea birds are all at risk because of the litter.
The inventors are hoping that their creation can help to protect the environment, and make oceans a nicer place for everyone.
