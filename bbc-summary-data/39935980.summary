Mother admits hiding dead baby in Grimsby drain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother has admitted hiding her newborn baby in a drain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The infant was found wrapped in three bin bags and a towel by a plumber working at a property in Scartho Road, Grimsby, in February 2016.
Sinead Connett of Constables Way, Hertford, pleaded guilty before town magistrates to concealing the boy's birth between 6 and 13 August 2013 and secretly deposing of his body.
The 28-year-old will be sentenced at Grimsby Crown Court next month.

The court heard neighbours had complained about trouble with their drains and called a plumber, who discovered the boy in a garden drain.
A post-mortem examination revealed the baby had been carried to the third term and the head was fractured, but the cause of death could not be ascertained.
The prosecution told the court that when Connett was questioned by police she had told them: "I'm the mother of that child".
She has been released on bail until sentencing.
