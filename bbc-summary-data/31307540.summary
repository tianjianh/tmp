Social housing in £5.8m Welsh government grant boost

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The push to build more homes for rent in the social housing sector is getting another £5.8m in Welsh government cash.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The money is on top of £58m already allocated for 2014-15 to a sector which covers more than 230,000 homes.
The new money should mean a further 70-90 houses become available for renting across Wales.
The extra cash for each county ranges from just over £700,000 in Cardiff to nearly £111,000 for Merthyr Tydfil.
Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it would make "a real difference" to people's lives and also act as "an economic stimulus" for growth and jobs.
