Nadal broke the 21-year-old Khachanov's serve three times in the first set as he completely dominated his opponent.
The second set was a tighter affair, with Khachanov finally holding his serve but still being broken in the third game.
Nadal had to save a set point in the third to force a tie-break, but the French Open champion triumphed in two hours and 14 minutes.
Victory means Nadal has not dropped a set in his past 10 Grand Slam matches, winning 28 completed sets in a row.
If he reaches the final then he will return to the top of the world rankings for the first time since June 2014.
"For a while I played fantastically," Nadal told the BBC. "The first set and a half was a great, great level - then it was a little bit tougher.
"I'm happy about almost everything."
The 31-year-old will play Luxembourg's Gilles Muller in the fourth round, who earlier beat Britain's Aljaz Bedene.
Nishikori lost 4-6 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 3-6 to 18th seed Bautista Agut in three hours and 21 minutes on court three.
Bautista Agut has never gone beyond the fourth round at a Grand Slam, while Nishikori is yet to go beyond the last 16 at Wimbledon.
Croatia's seventh seed Cilic, who beat American Johnson 6-4 7-6 (7-3) 6-4, will face Bautista Agut in round four.
Play was suspended for bad light on court two with American Sam Querrey leading 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-5 on serve in the fifth set.
