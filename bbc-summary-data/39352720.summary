Around 70,000 people deaf people in the UK have British Sign Language as their first language.
One school in London is teaching it as part of their regular lessons.
We caught up with Ashley Kendall who is a presenter and ambassador for the British Deaf Association charity and his interpreter Adrian Bailey.
He told us what he thinks about about the idea of all children learning sign language, and his own experiences growing up at school.
