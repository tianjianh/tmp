[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 12-year-old pupil at Wolfreton School in Willerby fell into a lake near Meymac in the Massif Central region on 21 July.
She died in hospital the next day.
In a police statement, the family said details of her funeral would not be made public as they "try to come to terms with their loss".
"The family wish to thank friends and the wider public for the support they have received during this difficult time, but request that their wishes for the details of Jessica's funeral arrangements not to be made public are respected.
"The family wish to grieve privately as they try to come to terms with their loss. They therefore respectfully ask that those who have not been formally invited to the funeral do not attend."
Jessica was one of 24 students and three staff on a five-day trip to the Club Correze adventure centre in France.
It is believed she became trapped under an overturned pontoon, which she and a group of children were jumping from while swimming.
