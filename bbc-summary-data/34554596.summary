Bus services in Wales could be dramatically cut as a result of the UK government's spending review next month, it has been warned.

Bus use has been falling across the UK since 2008 but the drop has been sharpest in Wales.
The Welsh government puts Â£25m a year into supporting bus services - a quarter less than in 2013.
The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said the level of cuts could be "devastating".
"If the cuts are of the scale of what's been mentioned by George Osborne - we're talking 25 to 40%," the WLGA's transport spokesman Andrew Morgan said.
"You take 40% of funding away from non-protected services like bus services then we're talking about probably another three, four, five per cent of all bus services in Wales will end up being withdrawn."
Kevyn Jones, managing director of Cardiff-based bus operator New Adventure Travel, said about half the routes he ran received some subsidy, but he expected the numbers to reduce in the future.
"The subsidised services are dwindling each year. There's less this year than there was last year and the same each year for the last five years we've been operating them," he added.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: "These grants are intended to supplement local authorities' expenditure on bus services and it is a matter for them how that funding is allocated.
"Under the concessionary bus travel scheme local authorities are responsible for determining the reimbursement rate for bus operators and for ensuring that operators are no better and no worse off."
