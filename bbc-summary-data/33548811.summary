A hospital placed in special measures two years ago has improved its A&E performance, new figures show.

Medway Maritime treated at least 95% of A&E patients within the government target of four hours in four out of 13 weeks to 28 June.
In the other nine weeks up to 28 June, at least 90% of A&E patients were seen within the four-hour target.
In the week to 26 October 2014 the hospital was England's worst performer, treating only 75% within the target.
Chief operating officer Morag Jackson said the hospital trust was pleased but not complacent.
"Care for our patients is better within our emergency department but we have got more work to do improving other areas across the hospital," she said.
She said the hospital was working with a team of doctors and nurses from Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital in London and was halfway through an 18-month improvement programme.
Medway NHS Foundation Trust was one of 11 in England put into special measures on 16 July 2013.
Theresa Murray, Labour Party member of Medway Health and Scrutiny Committee, said the new chief executive Lesley Dwyer had rationalised nine action plans from nine inspections plans into a recovery plan.
"It was clear in the inspections that there was a real disconnect between management and the clinical staff," she said.
"I think that's the key to the advancements that have been made recently."
Rehman Chisti, Conservative MP for Gillingham and Rainham, said Medway Maritime and been given £13m to increase A&E capacity and £6m to cover the busy winter period.
An extra £10m had also gone to Medway Clinical Commissioning Group to improve GP services.
"This is an optimistic outlook rather than a short-term fix," he said.
"I am very confident the changes they are making will have a lasting effect."
