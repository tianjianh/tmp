[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland prop Rory Sutherland and scrum-half Nathan Fowles have signed new two-year contracts with Edinburgh, tying them to the club until May 2019.

Sutherland is currently recovering from a groin injury sustained in the autumn.
The 24-year-old, who turned professional with Edinburgh in 2014, won his three Scotland caps last year.
Fowles, 23, previously played for Sale Sharks and Preston Grasshoppers and joined Edinburgh in 2015 but is yet to feature at senior international level.
He has played for England Under-20s but qualifies to play for Scotland through his grandfather.
"I feel that the club is moving in the right direction and there's a lot to look forward to in the next few years," Fowles told Edinburgh's website. "I'm delighted to be staying.
"We're developing well as a team, in the way we want to play the game and the speed we want to play at, which is exciting for the players and fans."
And Sutherland said: "Everything is moving forward and I'm really happy to be a part of the team for another two seasons.
"There's a good feeling around the club just now and I feel that this is the right place for me to stay to take my rugby to the next level and try to continue being involved in the Scotland set-up."
Sutherland and Fowles follow flanker Hamish Watson, 25, in committing himself to Edinburgh until 2019.
