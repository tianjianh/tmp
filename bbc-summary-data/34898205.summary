"Horrific" dental problems have been identified by a dentist visiting Calais migrant camps.

Jonathan Gollings, from Wimborne Minster, Dorset, described "miserable" conditions in which about eight people a day arrived with abscesses.
Working with the charity Dentaid, he said he saw patients "back-to-back" during a day-long visit.
He is now helping to supply the camps with dental equipment and arrange for other dentists to travel there.
Some of the people, who are living in camps known as "the Jungle" on the edge of the French town, have attempted to cross the Channel into England.
Mr Gollings said his team carried out treatment, such as removing teeth and providing fillings, out in the open.
"We didn't stop all day, there were back-to-back people with really horrific dental needs.
"The conditions out there are really horrific. It's cold, it's wet and very miserable," he said.
He said many of the people in the camps had other ailments, such as injuries and chest infections, and asked him and a colleague for help.
"These are normal people escaping conflicts from various areas," he said.
"It's just a case of being able to go over there and express the fact that we do care for them and love them and want to help."
Mr Gollings said now they have equipment in Calais he and other dentists can take it in turns to visit for weekends to provide treatment.
