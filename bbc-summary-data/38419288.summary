The 20-year-old will now remain at The Valley until the summer of 2019.
Aribo featured for the Addicks' Under-23 side last season and has made a total of four appearances since making his first-team debut in October.
"Joe is like a young Patrick Vieira with his leggy range, quality and appetite to get around the pitch," boss Karl Robinson told the club website.
"Charlton have a rich history of developing young players and I'm sure he's got the ability to get to the top."
