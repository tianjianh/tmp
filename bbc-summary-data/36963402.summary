"It was set up as a legacy event from London 2012 and to rise to the top echelon of professional men's cycling after such a short period of time is truly outstanding."
The first London-Surrey Classic was held in 2011, as a test event for the London 2012 Olympics, and subsequent races have been based on the course used for the London Games.
The UCI has expanded the number of WorldTour races from 27 to 37, with the Tour of California becoming the USA's first event on the calendar.
