[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men threatened G4S security staff with weapons inside Santander on West Princes Street, Helensburgh, at 00:30.
They then made off in an "unknown direction" with a cash box.
The suspects are described as being of medium height, medium build and were wearing blue overalls and masks at the time of the incident.
Det Insp Douglas Wilson, who is leading the investigation, said: "Our inquiries are at an early stage following this calculated robbery of a cash box in West Princes Street.
"The employees were placed in a state of fear and alarm as two men entered the premises of the bank, threatened the men with weapons and then made off with the cash box in an unknown direction.
"A substantial investigation is under way to trace the men responsible."
Det Insp Wilson said that "a dedicated team" was working on the inquiry at Helensburgh police.
CCTV footage is being studied from the area and officers are conducting door-to-door inquiries.
"At this time we are seeking the assistance of the public to come forward with any information which could help our investigation," the detective said.
"It is possible that someone has seen or heard a disturbance at the Santander bank on West Princes Street. You may have seen men running off from the scene, or heard the sound of cars travelling at speed.
"You may not think the information you have is valuable to us, but any information can make a real difference. As part of our larger investigation, your assistance could be critical in tracing the persons responsible."
