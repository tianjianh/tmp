A Â£40m sports centre and 560 flats are planned for the site of the 1930s King Alfred Centre in Hove.
Under the proposals, the current building will be demolished and replaced by a number of structures including an 18-storey flat block.
Computer-generated images of the structures were revealed on Tuesday.
"Our proposals incorporate world-class leisure and community facilities set to benefit local residents, together with outstanding new mixed tenure residential properties in this enviable location on the Hove seafront," said Duncan Innes, from developer Crest Nicholson.
The scheme, which will include 20% "affordable housing", will be subject to further design development, public consultation and planning permission.
About Â£8m of council money will go towards the sports centre, which will include three swimming pools - one with changeable depths, a 120-station gym, a sports hall with space for eight badminton courts, three-rink indoor bowls, a sauna and a cafe.
Brighton and Hove City Council leader Warren Morgan said it was "vital that we move forward with the much-needed and unavoidable replacement of the ninety-year old facility".
