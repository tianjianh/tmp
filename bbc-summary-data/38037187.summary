'Fart' in parliament: Row blows up in Canada

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A row has blown up in the Canadian parliament - over the word "fart".

When Conservative MP Michelle Rempel accused the government of treating the province of Alberta "like a fart in the room" over jobs, Green Party leader Elizabeth May took exception.
However, it was not the accusations of inaction which riled Ms May.
"I heard her say a word I know is distinctly unparliamentary, and I think she may want to withdraw it," the shocked Ms May said.
"The word was f-a-r-t," she continued, spelling it out clearly so as not to repeat the offending term.
Ms Rempel, who has represented Calgary Nose Hill since 2011, became equally incensed.
"Is my colleague actually serious? I just gave an impassioned speech about Alberta jobs, and that's what the leader of a political party has to say? No, I don't withdraw it."
Ms May was not letting it go, however.
"Decorum is important, and respect is important in this place," she scolded.
Unsurprisingly, the row has caused great hilarity on social media - especially in light of the political upheaval taking place just across the border.
"With all eyes on Trump's destruction of US politics and civil society, a silent but deadly political scandal in Canada," tweeted Josh Greenberg, director of one of Canada's leading journalism schools.
