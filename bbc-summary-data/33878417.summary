Lindsey Swift, of Barnsley, said the man sang a "sarcastic" rendition of pop song Big Girl (You Are Beautiful) as he drove past.
In the letter on Facebook, the 26-year-old told the driver if he was offended by seeing her running "try driving with your eyes closed".
She said: "I wanted to have my say."
"Normally I don't get militant about these things, idiots are idiots," the letter continued.
"However, I can see why comments like these might put a person less confident than me off from running, and that is shameful. Everyone starts somewhere.
"[But] if my fat arse running (quite slowly I might add, I was shattered) offends you and spoils your journey, try driving with your eyes closed, into a lamppost."
Ms Swift, who is training for a 10km (six miles) run, said she was heckled near Barnsley on 6 August.
She said: "It was quite an embarrassing situation.
"Usually I'm not easily hurt, but my boyfriend was running a little bit ahead of me and so he stopped and I had to explain the situation to him. It was quite intimidating.
"Because he drove past I did not have a chance to respond to him in person.
"Everybody has an opinion about health and things like that but some things, like my body, are not public property and I do not think anybody has the right to make comments like that."
She said she had received numerous messages of support since posting the letter on Friday.
Clare Wright wrote: "Well said Lindsey. You're doing fab! It's awful. I hate running round where I live because of the hecklers!"
Chloe Standish said: "Well said Lindsey!! You keep going girl you're doing brilliant!! And you're beautiful inside and out."
