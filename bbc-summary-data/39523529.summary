[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 1-0 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Woking kept pace with their National League survival rivals with a 1-0 win over Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors almost caught the nervous hosts cold, with a dangerous Andy Halls cross creating early problems before Oliver Norburn went close from distance.
Chris Holroyd saw a spectacular overhead kick crash back off the crossbar just before the break as the hosts continued to be pushed back.
But Gozie Ugwu got the vital breakthrough for Woking after 61 minutes, firing home from the spot after Kane Ferdinand was brought down in the box, and the win keeps them out of the drop zone on goal difference.
