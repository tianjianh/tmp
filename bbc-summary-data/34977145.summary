A new housing development on the site of BBC Wales' Broadcasting House in Llandaff, Cardiff, has moved a step closer.

Councillors have granted outline planning permission for the proposed scheme, which includes up to 400 new homes.
The development went before the council's planning committee in July.
Outline planning permission has now been granted after a document was signed securing community benefits.
They include the commitment to build affordable housing as part of the development.
Work on the new homes is expected to start on site in 2019 after BBC Wales moves to its new building in the city centre.
Gareth Hawke, land director for housebuilder Taylor Wimpey South Wales, said: "Our development will combine a mix of private and much-needed affordable homes, car parking and public open space, with the first properties expected to go on sale in early 2020, following the BBC's relocation and subject to the approval of 'reserved matters' planning applications dealing with detailed design."
