The lottery operator said the winner had not yet decided whether to go public or keep their identity secret.
The ticket was for Friday night's draw, and is the latest in a string of EuroMillions wins in the UK.
In March Richard and Angela Maxwell, from Lincolnshire, won £53m, and in June an anonymous UK ticket holder won £93m.
The largest UK win was £161m, won by Colin and Chris Weir from Scotland in July 2011.
On Wednesday Camelot said a £191,161 prize from the 1 August Lotto draw had not yet been claimed.
It said the ticket was bought in Perth and Kinross, and asked players to "check and double-check their tickets".
