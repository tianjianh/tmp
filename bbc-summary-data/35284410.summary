[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wessels has made 177 appearances for Notts in all forms of the game since joining in 2011 following his departure from Northamptonshire.
The 30-year-old who is also Notts' back-up wicketkeeper, scored 1,033 runs in first-class cricket last season.
"He's a terrific role model for our younger players." director of cricket Mick Newell told the club website.
"He's a good team man, he bats at six, he bats at one, he bats at three, he bats all over the place and does his job very efficiently.
"He also fields at slip & short-leg and and he keeps wicket when Chris Read's not around."
