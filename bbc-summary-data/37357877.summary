Swansea City 1-2 Manchester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vincent Kompany suffered an injury scare on his return as Manchester City eased past Swansea in the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kompany - back after a five-month injury lay-off - left the field by his own choice in injury time after City had made all three substitutions.
Gael Clichy's fourth goal in English football had put City in charge before Aleix Garcia swept home a second.
Swansea's record signing Borja Baston missed several chances before Gylfi Sigurdsson scored a late consolation.
Belgian centre-back Kompany sat out Euro 2016 and had not played since injury forced him off in City's Champions League semi-final defeat by Real Madrid on 4 May.
"The doctors are speaking with him, but hopefully it is not a big, big problem. We're going to wait for the result," said City manager Pep Guardiola.
"Once they scored the goal, after I said: 'What happened?'. They said that Vincent had gone to the locker room. Hopefully, it will not be a big problem. We will have to wait. If he's injured, he's injured. He cannot stay on the pitch."
"It's not easy after a long, long time without playing. Defensively, he was so strong - he played really good."
Both sides rang the changes for this game but City showed they have the depth to compete in all competitions  - despite Guardiola scoffing at the notion of winning four trophies - with the likes of Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta and John  Stones restored by the Spaniard.
Swansea made eight changes themselves, and starts for the likes of Jay Fulton and defender Kyle Naughton, as a winger, gave their team an experimental look.
A close first half saw chances limited, but City surged ahead after the break through Clichy's deflected goal and might have added to Garcia's smart second after Jesus Navas' pinpoint cross.
City twice came close to gifting the Swans a goal, but Borja was denied by Willy Caballero either side of half-time, before Sigurdsson's late consolation effort from close range.
Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin:
"It is not a good moment for us. Little things are going against us, we are missing chances.
"Manchester City are a very good team, even though they changed their players around. But I am optimistic, as I saw my team play a good game.
"This is my job. With my experience, I know football is like this. it does not bring any added pressure for me. I have to work with my players, my staff and to pick up better results."
