Thirty-five firefighters were called to the fire which started at 04:30 GMT at Malvern Tyres in Richmond Walk.
The fire is now under control and no-one is reported injured but nearby residents were asked to keep their windows closed to avoid the fumes.
The cause of the fire is being investigated, said Devon and Somerset Fire Service.
Resident Steven Grimshaw, who was woken at 05:30 GMT, said: "There was thick black smoke and lots of popping noises.
"A large fire had started in the tyre warehouse and there was lots of black smoke billowing into the sky."
Devon and Somerset fire spokesman Paul Bray said: "After the fire started it made rapid progress through the building and shortly after, the roof and a wall collapsed.
"Fortunately we were able to stop it spreading to the next-door building which contains bottled gas."
He said that the wind had blown most of the smoke out to sea.
