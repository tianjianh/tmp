Father-of-two James Edwards was rescued by colleagues and members of Torridon MRT in the Fisherfield Forest mountains, in Wester Ross, on Saturday.
He was airlifted to hospital by a coastguard helicopter.
Dundonnell MRT said the thoughts of the team were with Mr Edward's wife and their two young sons.
The team said: "This was an immensely difficult rescue for us as a team as the casualty was a fellow team member, James Edwards.
"We are all completely numbed by this outcome."
Dundonnell MRT provides rescue cover for an area of more than 2,600 sq miles (6,733 sq km), and includes 41 mountains of Munro height.
