Foo Fighters were joined by members of Queen and Led Zeppelin as they began a series of rescheduled gigs in the UK.

The band were forced to cancel several dates, including Glastonbury, earlier this year after frontman Dave Grohl shattered his leg falling off stage.
"We came back for you!" he declared as Saturday's show began in Milton Keynes. "We waited a long time to be here."
The star performed the two-and-a-half-hour set from a giant, motorised throne, as his leg continues to heal.
The concert, at Milton Keynes Bowl, was the first of two to be moved from London's Wembley Stadium after the star's accident in June.
During the show, he apologised to fans for the delay.
"It's been about eleven weeks since the incident. The last thing I wanted to do was cancel shows. I hate cancelling shows.  I'm sorry for making you wait so long."
He then vowed to play an extended set, asking: "Who's gonna lose their voice first? Not me".
Later on, the band were joined by Queen's Roger Taylor and Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones to play Under Pressure.
"I don't know if ya'll have ever seen a super group? Well, This is a super-duper group," joked Grohl.
"Let me just tell you that the Foo Fighters, right now, are living out our rock'n'roll fantasy."
He duetted with drummer Taylor Hawkins on the song, a number one hit for Queen and David Bowie in 1981.
The Foo Fighters were two songs into their set at the Ullevi stadium in Sweden in June, when Grohl mistimed a jump on to a ramp and fell into the gap between the stage and audience.
"I think I just broke my leg," the singer told the crowd as he lay on the ground. He finished the show, but later cancelled several European tour dates, including a headline set at Glastonbury, on medical advice.
He then designed his ornate throne as a way of ensuring the band could continue to play, while ensuring his leg was kept stationary.
Unveiling it at a concert in Washington DC, Grohl told the audience he had designed it in hospital while "high as a kite" on painkillers.
"I can't just sit on a stool like Paul Simon or whatever, I have to make it look cool," he explained. The result was a chair that "shoots lights and smoke out of it and looks like a UFO with guitar necks stuck in it."
Playing in Milton Keynes, Grohl felt confident enough to get to his feet during the song Monkey Wrench, telling the crowd: "I'm getting better now, I'm gonna dance with you."
The band play the stadium again on Sunday, and Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh on Tuesday, before resuming the North American leg of their world tour.
