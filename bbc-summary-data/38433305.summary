[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-0 Port Vale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham boss Stephen Robinson is under increasing pressure after his side were held to a goalless draw by managerless Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Latics dominated long spells but they remain bottom of League One and without a win in 10 games.
Vale's Ryan Taylor wasted an early chance before Oldham produced a counter-attack which ended with Freddie Ladapo being denied by visiting goalkeeper Jak Alnwick.
The hosts squandered a gilt-edged opening after 26 minutes as Ladapo was left with only Alnwick to beat, but the on-loan striker dragged his shot wide from 10 yards.
Vale went close through Sam Kelly, whose well-struck volley brought a fingertip save from Connor Ripley.
After the break Ladapo's latest attempt to break the deadlock saw him fire off target after good build-up play.
Vale were rescued by Alnwick in the 68th minute as he made a fantastic one-handed save to claw out Carl Winchester's header.
Ripley palmed away Taylor's late free-kick but Alnwick had the final say by touching Billy McKay's shot against the post.
