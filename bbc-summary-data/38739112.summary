Bird flu found at Preesall pheasant farm, says Defra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bird flu has been found in pheasants at a farm in Lancashire, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK's chief veterinary officer said H5N8 avian flu has been discovered in the breeding pheasants in Preesall.
Public Health England (PHE) said the risk to humans was "very low". A 1.8 mile (3km) protection zone has been set up around the farm.
Defra said a number of the 10,000 birds at the farm died with the rest culled.
A full investigation is under way to determine the source of the infection, said Defra.
The Food Standards Agency said it was clear bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers.
There have been a number of outbreaks of the virus including one at a farm in Louth, Lincolnshire in December.
Earlier that month, poultry keepers were told to keep their birds inside for 30 days to protect them from a highly-infectious strain of avian flu in Europe.
The H5N8 bird flu strain has been found in poultry and wild birds in 14 countries including Germany and France.
