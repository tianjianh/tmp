The 26-year-old left-back was hurt in Saturday's pre-season win over German club Karlsruher.
The Hammers said Cresswell would see a specialist "early next week" when a decision would be taken on whether surgery would be required.
Cresswell, who joined from Ipswich in 2014, played in 37 league games as West Ham finished seventh last season.
