The 21-year-old victim was attacked as she waited for a train on a platform at Melton station near Woodbridge in July 2016.
Sam Duncan, of Alan Road, Ipswich, had denied the charge. He was convicted after less than two hours of deliberations by jurors at Ipswich Crown Court.
He is due to be sentenced in April.
The court heard Duncan grabbed the woman and as she waited on a platform at 21:45 BST on 19 July 2016 and told her "you're going to get it tonight", but she managed to push him away.
She then boarded the train to Ipswich and spoke with the guard who called police.
During his trial, Duncan was accused of lying repeatedly and inconsistencies, but he told the court: "Why would I want to make something up?
"It's not a story, it's the truth. Nothing happened."
Det Insp Ian Trantum, of British Transport Police, said: "The victim's statement was extremely detailed and provided us with a very clear description of the offender.
"This was a frightening and extremely upsetting experience for this young lady who demonstrated extraordinary bravery and courage.
"I would pay tribute to her commitment to bring Duncan to justice.
"The community can be safe in knowing that this predatory and aggressive man is now facing a jail sentence."
Duncan, who was also found guilty of exposure, had previously admitted exposing himself in 2014 and was undergoing rehabilitation.
