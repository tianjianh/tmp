The Bosnia-Herzegovina international is bidding for full match fitness after recovering from a hernia injury but is unlikely to start against QPR.
The visitors are without midfielder Jordan Cousins, who will miss the rest of the season with a quadricep injury.
On-loan winger Kazenga LuaLua is back in training after an ankle injury but is still a doubt for the visitors.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol:
"We move into Friday after a good performance that was much desired against Wolves. Friday is going to be really, really important.
"If we can get a win, it really puts everybody else on the back foot, we'll claw another couple in and hopefully we'll push away as well.
"It is a massive game. I'm sure the players will give their all. We want to look ahead of us and make sure we overtake a couple of people, with Forest and Burton only a point ahead of us.
"Even QPR, six points ahead of us, if we beat them, we cut that gap to three points. That's really important. The more people we draw into it, the better."
