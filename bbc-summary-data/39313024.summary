Lincoln City 3-1 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln City fought back from a goal down at the break to overtake National League leaders Forest Green Rovers and go top of the table on goal difference.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers led when Christian Doidge fired in his 23rd goal of the season.
But two goals in six second-half minutes put the Imps ahead, Lee Angol's angled strike levelling matters and a Marcus Kelly own goal making it 2-1.
Sam Habergham's free-kick sealed victory for the hosts, who have three games in hand on second-placed Rovers.
Rovers defended solidly in the first half and were good value for their lead courtesy of Doidge's sliding low effort from close range.
But the Imps upped the tempo in the second half, showing the passion and intensity which characterised their astonishing run to the FA Cup quarter-finals.
The equaliser came when a long ball saw Angol outmuscle Mark Ellis, who went down under the challenge, and shoot across goal into the bottom corner.
Kelly's unfortunate intervention made it 2-1 when he could only head Habergham's driven left-wing cross into his own net.
And Habergham's long-range free-kick somehow eluded Rovers goalkeeper Sam Russell and found the bottom corner to complete the scoring.
