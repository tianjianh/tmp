Officers were called to reports of a robbery in Grove Road, Kings Heath, Birmingham, just after 22:00 GMT on Sunday.
West Midlands Police says two men threatened a woman before driving off in her white Mercedes A-Class car. The woman was shaken but not injured.
Officers say a dedicated operation is in place to address a recent spike in car robberies in the area.

The men are described as black, with one about 5ft 10in (1.8m) tall, of slim build and wearing a green and white mask.
The car - registration KW65 AXK - has black wing mirrors and black alloy wheels, police said.
Last month a woman was attacked in Kings Heath with a stun device during a carjacking - the sixth such attack in as many days.
Det Sgt Toni Holl, from the investigation team at Bournvillle Lane police station, said: "We have a dedicated operation in place to address the recent spike in car robberies and have arrested several people.
"Four of those - including two youths aged 14 - have since been charged and put before the courts.
"We do not believe Sunday's incident is linked to these offences."
