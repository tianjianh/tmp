Campaign for statue honouring achievements of Middlebrough women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign has been launched to build a statue honouring the achievements by women of Middlesbrough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are currently seven statues in the Teesside town, all of which depict men.
They include D-Day VC soldier Stan Hollis and footballers Brian Clough, George Hardwick and Wilf Mannion.
Campaigner Emma Chesworth said: "Woman are very often ignored and erased from history."
She added: "A statue is a very visible and powerful symbol and there are some fantastic women who have lived and are living in Middlesbrough.
"Their achievements are incredible, but they haven't been recognised publically."
The team behind the campaign said a statue could be paid for through fundraising and lottery grants.
Ellen Wilkinson, the town's first female MP, and Mary Jaques, founder of its first cottage hospital, have been suggested as deserving of a permanent memorial.
Elected mayor Dave Budd has backed the plan.
He said: "It's a great idea and, like many great ideas, I wonder why no-one thought of it before."
A list of candidates will be published in May with a public vote following.
