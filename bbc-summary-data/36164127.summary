A nature reserve famous for its herons and bitterns is celebrating its 50th anniversary.

The Attenborough Wildlife Reserve near Nottingham, run by the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, is home to one of the UK's largest heronries.
Conservationists have worked to restore reed beds in the hope of providing bitterns and herons with a safer place to breed.
The reserve was opened by Sir David Attenborough in 1966.
Wildlife ranger Tim Sexton took on a challenge in 2015 to identify more than 1,000 different organisms at the reserve within one year.
Mr Sexton said although there were many successes over the past years, the reserve was still in danger of losing some species, such as cuckoos, skylark, meadow pipits and common blue butterflies.
Nottinghamshire wildlife artist Michael Warren will be exhibiting artwork at the nature centre during the anniversary, including 14 commissioned pieces featuring Attenborough and other Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust reserves.
A dawn chorus walk is planned for the anniversary weekend along with a nature walk.
