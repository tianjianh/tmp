The overnight theft of 100 yards (91m) of cable, between Walsall and Rugeley Trent Valley, was noticed at the start of services on Saturday.
Services were disrupted until the afternoon with passengers having to use replacement buses in the meantime.
A Network Rail spokesman said thieves risk serious injury or death and their actions can cost the taxpayer a lot of money in repairs and compensation.
"We continually seek to develop ways to protect the network from thieves and work with the British Transport Police to prosecute anyone caught carrying out metal thefts," they said.
