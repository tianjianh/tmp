[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Musician Roy Harper has expressed anger at delays in the legal system after being cleared of sexual abuse allegations dating to the 1970s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In February the folk-rock singer was acquitted of indecently assaulting a girl aged 16 in 1980, but a jury failed to reach verdicts on other counts relating to a second complainant.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided to drop the remaining charges.
It said it had decided there was not "a realistic prospect of a conviction".
Mr Harper, 74, of Rossmore, County Cork, Ireland, attended Worcester Crown Court to hear that the CPS had decided to offer no evidence against him.
Mr Harper, formerly of Marden, Herefordshire, said he was upset at the length of time it had taken to prove his innocence.
He said he had lost his livelihood after being informed of the allegations in February 2013.
Mr Harper said: "The psychological and personal cost to my wife and myself has been enormous, and in addition to that the financial cost is hugely unfair.
"Despite coming out of this without a blemish on my name, I nonetheless cannot recoup my costs, and that's left me incredibly angry.
"I'm now going to restart my working life where I left off nearly three years ago."

Mr Harper said "at the beginning of this process" that he was "innocent of these allegations".
He said: "This case should never have gone as far as this or taken so long to resolve."
The CPS said in a statement: "We keep all our cases under constant review and in this case it was decided that based on the strength of the evidence there is no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction.
"We will be meeting with the complainant and her family in order to fully explain our decision."
