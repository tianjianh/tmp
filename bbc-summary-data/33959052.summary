A post-mortem examination has revealed that a buzzard that died in the Borders was killed by a shotgun.

The wounded bird was found at the side of the road between Heriot and Innerleithen on 24 July.
It was taken to a local vet but had to be put to sleep due to the extent of its injuries.
Tests have now shown that the bird was hit by pellets from a shotgun and the Scottish SPCA is appealing for information  about the incident.
An undercover inspector said: "A post mortem revealed the buzzard had been hit with a shotgun, with a pellet in its head and damage to its wing.
"As the bird did not die outright it would have suffered a great deal of pain and distress.
"We believe this was a deliberate act which would constitute an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981."
The charity said its inquiries so far had not produced any leads and urged anyone with information to get in touch.
