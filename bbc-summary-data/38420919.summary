Three alpacas have been seriously injured in a dog attack in a field in the New Forest.

The three animals were each mauled around the neck area by at least one dog in their field in the eastern part of the forest on Thursday.
They were treated by vets and underwent surgery for their wounds. They are all now in a stable condition.
Hampshire police confirmed officers had been called to the scene following the attack and were investigating.
An alpaca in the same field had also been the victim of a dog attack earlier in the year.
The owner, Susan Sears, has farmed the animals for six years and has a herd of about 80 animals which are bred for their wool.
"It's devastating.  We've bred these animals and get to know them individually - they've all got their own characters," she said.
She has set up a crowdfunding appeal to help raise money for the animals' treatment.
