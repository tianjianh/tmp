[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leonard, who was born Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, had four Top 40 UK albums with the band from the late 1960s.
He recently returned to his home town with his long-term partner Mary.
Friend Kevin Allen, who directed the film Twin Town, said: "Deke was a true gentlemen of acid rock and he had a fantastic presence on stage."
Man toured across Europe and America and could include Frank Zappa among their admirers.
As well as working as a radio and television panellist, Leonard was a regular guest at the Laugharne Festival.
Mr Allen added: "Deke was such an interesting, gentle and lovely person and he was part of a dying breed - he'll be really missed."
Another friend, Paul Durden, who co-authored Twin Town, said: "I am really very sorry for both Mary and his daughter Kate. It is very sad news.
"Deke was an old mate, who I had known since the '60s. He was an elder statesman of rock music and was a brilliant man himself."
Leonard's bandmate, Micky Jones, died in 2010 at the age of 63.
