The Environment Agency has issued a severe weather warning for Jaywick forecasting rain, strong winds and potential flooding, which is expected to peak on Friday lunchtime.
A rest centre at Tendring Education Centre in Clacton has been opened to provide shelter.
Ch Insp Cole said: "Acting on all the professional guidance, a decision has been taken to evacuate the homes in Jaywick to ensure the safety of all residents.
"My officers will start calling at all residences in Jaywick this afternoon, to advise them that from 07:00 tomorrow we will be transporting people out of the town to the rest centre.
"We will also advise that from 16:00 they can of course self-evacuate and make their own way to the rest centre or to another place of safety outside of Jaywick.
"This decision has not been taken lightly and has been made in the best interests of all residents to ensure their safety until the severe weather passes."
