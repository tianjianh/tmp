The 30-year-old, who won gold at the 2012 Olympics, is now expected to challenge Uruguay's WBA world lightweight champion Cecilia Comunales.
Taylor, from Bray in County Wicklow, has won all five of her bouts since turning professional in October 2016.
She hopes to have a world title fight in Dublin in the autumn.
Taylor dominated from the start as she again impressed and Meinke was on the backfoot throughout.
The fight was scheduled for 10 rounds but the referee stepped in to end the contest in the seventh with Taylor securing another comfortable victory.
