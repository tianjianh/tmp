The prime minister and his wife attended the Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara in Gravesend on Saturday.
He took part in the nagar kirtan (procession) and was given a tour of the Gurdwara, which is thought to be one of the largest outside India.
It was Mr Cameron's first visit to Kent during the general election campaign.
Vaisakhi is the Sikh New Year festival and is one of the most important dates in the Sikh calendar.
It also commemorates 1699, the year Sikhism was born as a collective faith.
Up to 10,000 people were expected to take part in the festivities, which saw a procession set off from the temple at about 11.30 BST and then make its way through the town before returning to the Gurdwara.
Gurjit Bains, of the Gudwara's executive committee, said: "This will be our biggest ever. Every year we've grown, we've got people from the Medway towns and some of our stallholders are from Birmingham as well so it's a big mix of people.
"There are not only people from the Sikh community here, they're from all walks of life.
"We have so many people who are not Sikh coming [to the celebrations] and it's really, really nice to see that."
