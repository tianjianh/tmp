Radio Derby editor Simon Cornes said: "Colin spent so much time here working on his programmes that we thought it would be really fitting to name the building after him.
"It will mean a great deal to everyone here to come to work each day in Bloomfield House."
The presenter also lent his name to the Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal which has raised more than Â£152,000.
