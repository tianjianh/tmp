Colchester United 4-1 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kurtis Guthrie scored a hat-trick as Colchester thrashed Carlisle to secure a fifth successive win and move them into the League Two play-off places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colchester took an 11th-minute lead through Chris Porter, who headed home Brennan Dickenson's cross from six yards.
Carlisle goalkeeper Mark Gillespie parried Craig Slater's shot, while at the other end Charlie Wyke fired wide.
The Cumbrians levelled in the 28th minute when Shaun Brisley's header looped over Sam Walker following Macaulay Gillesphey's cross to the far post.
But five minutes later, Colchester restored their lead when Guthrie curled a delightful shot past Gillespie from the edge of the area after Carlisle had failed to deal with Slater's cross.
Jason Kennedy had an effort ruled out for offside after Walker had foiled both Brisley and Nicky Adams.
But Guthrie blasted home Colchester's third five minutes after the break after Porter had cleverly dummied Slater's delivery.
Guthrie's shot crashed against the crossbar before he completed a fine hat-trick in stoppage-time, tapping home after Gillespie had saved Denny Johnstone's effort.
