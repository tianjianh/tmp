Ireland v Bangladesh: Tri-series opener in Dublin curtailed by rain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's opening game in their home tri-series against Bangladesh at Malahide in Dublin on Friday had to be abandoned because of rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Having been 9-2, the Tigers recovered to 157-4 after 31.1 overs when play was halted in the early afternoon.
The umpires admitted defeat at 16:45 BST following persistent rain.
Three Peter Chase wickets had left Bangladesh in a degree of trouble on 70-4 before Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah produced a 87-run partnership.
Tamim was unbeaten on 64, with Mahmudullah four short of his half-century, when play was stopped.
William Porterfield's decision to make the Tigers bat looked an obvious call on the green Malahide track and Chase, playing on his home ground, gave his team a wonderful start.
Chase had Soumya Sarkar caught behind by wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien and then dismissed Sabbir Rahman for a duck with Tim Murtagh taking the chance at third man to leave Bangladesh struggling on 9-2.
A 38-run partnership between Mushfiqur Rahim and stand-in skipper Shakib Al Hasan steadied the Tigers before both quickly departed as Barry McCarthy joined Chase among the wickets.
However Tamim and Mahmudullah gladly accepted the width on offer from Ireland's bowlers with the latter hitting five boundaries - including one six - in his knock.
With the weather the winner, Ireland will focus on Sunday's match against New Zealand at the same venue.
The series sees the Irish continuing their countdown towards possibly being handed Test status next month.
Bangladesh have their full Champions Trophy squad in Ireland while, in contrast, New Zealand aree without a number of regulars because of Indian Premier League commitments.
The Kiwis will be captained for the first time by Tom Latham, while uncapped Central Districts fast bowler Seth Rance and Northern Districts all-rounder Scott Kuggeleijn are both included in the squad.
Ireland's games against New Zealand will see home coach John Bracewell up against his native country, for whom he featured in 41 Tests and 53 one-day internationals during his playing career, later coaching the national side between 2003 and 2008.
