[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Gregory, 79, of Brockfield Park Drive, Huntington, York, was a curate in Wandsworth when he indecently assaulted the girl, then aged under 13.
Police were contacted by the victim in 2012 who said she had been abused by him between 1969 and 1971.
Gregory was found guilty of two counts of indecent assault by a jury at Kingston Crown Court.
As well as working as a curate in Southfields, Wandsworth, Gregory also held positions in Hastings, Chichester, York and the Isle of Man as a vicar.
Det Con Aaron Vardy, of the Met's Sexual Offences Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said: "Gregory abused his position as a figure of trust and authority."
He added: "I would urge anyone else who may have been a victim of Gregory's abuse to make contact with the police."
