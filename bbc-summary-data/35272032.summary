A 40-year-old man was found lying seriously injured in Rowan Street, Blackburn, at about 04:45 on 1 January.
Police said they now believed the attack took place at a nearby property and involved one assailant who was known to the victim.
The 22-year-old is due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Monday. The victim has been released from hospital.
Ch Insp Stevie Dolan, of Police Scotland, said: "Having recently met with members of the public and councillors from Blackburn, I'm aware that there were concerns within the local community about this incident.
"Whilst it remains the case that the victim was seriously assaulted, I would like to reassure the local community that our inquiries have revealed that the incident was not as first understood.
"This was initially reported to have been an unprovoked attack by three men within the street.
"Our inquiries now suggest that the assault was not committed in a public place, and that the victim and the suspect are known to each other.
"Officers will continue to conduct patrols in Blackburn in relation to other ongoing issues, and I would encourage members of the public to speak to officers if they have any concerns."
