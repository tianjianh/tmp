The Daily Mail claimed a £10m offer was made to owner Owen Oyston despite him stating the club was not for sale at a recent public meeting with fans.
Oyston was heckled throughout over the way the club is being run.
"The owners of the club have received no approach whatsoever, from any investor or third party," said a statement.
The Blackpool Supporters Trust launched a £16m bid to buy the club July 2015 but Oyston, whose son Karl is chairman, eventually ended those takeover talks.
The Seasiders, who will play in the fourth tier for the first time since 2000-01 this season, have also announced the signing of midfielder Danny Pugh.
The 33-year-old former Manchester United trainee joins on a free transfer after his release by Bury and has signed a one-year deal, with further 12-month option.
"He brings a wealth of experience to the team and will be a strong, vocal presence in the middle of the park," said boss Gary Bowyer.
