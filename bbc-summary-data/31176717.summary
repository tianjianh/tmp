Six Nations 2015: Coaches and players on England win in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England coach Stuart Lancaster said his side's 21-16 victory over rivals Wales in Cardiff will have no bearing on the World Cup pool game between the sides later this year.

Tries from Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph plus 11 points from George Ford's boot helped England overturn an eight-point deficit at half-time.
The teams will meet at Twickenham in August in their Pool A World Cup group.
"There's a lot of time between now and then," Lancaster told BBC Sport.
Wales led 16-8 at half-time but England mounted a strong comeback, scoring 13 unanswered points after the interval.
And Lancaster added: "We put ourselves in a bit of a hole although we dug ourselves out."
"You've got to give England credit," said Gatland, whose side face Scotland at Murrayfield on 15 February.
"I thought we were reasonably comfortable at half-time, but they played really well in the second half. We've lost the first game of the Six Nations and we have to get back on the horse."

"We needed to get a foothold in the game in the second half and couldn't do it.
"England deserve a lot of credit for the way they played. They outplayed us in that second half and deserved to win for the way they played in the closing 20 minutes."
"We went quietly about our business beforehand when lots of people were writing us off.
"I think we can be very satisfied with what we've done."
The Harlequins player also explained why he had been reluctant to lead his side out on to the pitch before the game kicked off and deliberately kept his players waiting in the tunnel:
"We wanted to have a bit of control. We didn't want to play any tricks or mind games, we just wanted to go out when they did.
"The referee didn't make us go out. We waited in the changing room and then in the tunnel together for as long as possible.
"When the referee said it was time to go, we went. We weren't going to be told to go out 10 or 15 minutes before they came out."
The Wasps captain said England had shown character to battle back.
"You can either go into your shell or you can show a bit of character.
"A couple of things didn't come off in the first half, but we stuck to the game-plan. There's a lot of talent in this group."
The scorer of one of England's two tries described the outcome as "incredible".
He added: "There's no greater feeling to come here to Wales and win against probably one of our greatest rivals.
"The first game is massive and to get off to a winning start is huge for us."
Ford, 21, kicked three penalties and one conversion in what was only his third Test start.
"The performance, especially by the pack, was outstanding. We felt comfortable in the first half but had a bit of poor start."
