Allisia Burton, 15, runs the Peedie Bun Box in Kirkwall using a small wooden honesty box at the end of her road.
She makes a variety of home bakes, some of which raise money for the Macmillan cancer charity.
However thieves stole the contents earlier this week and a small Christmas tree beside it was vandalised.
Allisia said: "I'm disappointed that someone stole the contents of The Peedie Bun Box.
"Luckily this has never happened before, but I did not expect this in Orkney.
"I love baking and Macmillan is a really worthwhile charity so I'm going to carry on.
"Thank you to everyone who has been honest and supported me."
Macmillan Cancer Support said in a message to Allisia: "Allisia, you are a very kind soul. Thank you for your hard work.
"Don't let this upset you. Sending you all our love."
