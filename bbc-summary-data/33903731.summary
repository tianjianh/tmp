The 10 and 12-year-old boys were spotted off Tenby Castle beach by an RNLI lifeguard on Tuesday.
The pair, who are not strong swimmers, had abandoned their rubber rings and were trying to swim back to the beach.
But lifeguard Jonathan Morris paddled out to them on his board and brought them ashore.
RNLI lifeguard supervisor Celyn Owens said: "This incident shows how dangerously unpredictable the sea can be.
"One minute the boys were comfortable and in their depth, then all of a sudden they were pulled out quickly in the rip current.
"We advise people to always swim at lifeguarded beaches."
