[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The last residents of St Kilda are among more than 2.5 million Scots' names uploaded to the Scottish government's family history website.

The 36 people were evacuated from the archipelago in August 1930, ending thousands of years of continuous habitation of the islands.
The names appear among the latest release of Valuation Rolls on genealogy site ScotlandsPeople.
St Kilda lies 40 miles (64km) west of North Uist in the Western Isles.
The last islanders, who lived in 16 houses, were evacuated at their request after life became too difficult.
Tim Ellis, registrar general and keeper of the records of Scotland, said: "The 16 householders listed on St Kilda in 1930 are just a few among more than 2.5 million names, but they stand for a traditional way of life that was about to end when the remaining islanders were evacuated.
"The Valuation Rolls we are putting online now span three quarters of a century from the earliest in 1855 and allow people to discover more about Scots almost 20 years after the Census of 1911.
"They are an invaluable resource for researchers to explore when investigating family and local history."
