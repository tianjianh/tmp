BBC management 'aware' of Stuart Hall's sex abuse on premises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of BBC management in Manchester were aware of paedophile Stuart Hall's "inappropriate sexual conduct " in his dressing room, a report has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It said "rumours" circulated within the Piccadilly Gardens office and it was "likely" he "could have been prevented from committing criminal offences".
The ex-presenter, 86, was jailed in 2013 after admitting indecently assaulting 13 girls - one as young as nine - between 1967 and 1985.
The BBC said it had "failed victims".
Trust chairman Rona Fairhead said the corporation had "turned a blind eye, where it should have shone a light. And it did not protect those who put their trust in it".
Victims of Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall will feel let down by the Dame Janet Smith report and will see it as "an expensive whitewash", according to a lawyer representing them.
Dame Janet Smith's review, set up in 2012, examined how Jimmy Savile and Hall carried out campaigns of abuse over decades while at the BBC.
Hall's sexual behaviour at the BBC
The report found 21 females, the youngest aged 10, were assaulted by Hall at the BBC between 1967 and 1991.
Young female visitors to BBC Manchester were jokingly referred to as "Hall's nieces" who had come for "elocution lessons", it said.
It also referred to Hall's "laddish sexuality, characterised by risque banter and often unwanted tactility".
There was "no evidence" BBC staff were aware that the girls involved were under-age, and "no-one complained to management", it added.
Hall, formerly of Wilmslow, Cheshire, had previously worked for BBC Radio 5 live and presented the BBC's regional North West news programme.
The former regional North West TV manager, Ray Colley, "took Hall to task" about rumours of inappropriate sexual conduct in his dressing room in 1970, the report said.
Had Mr Colley then taken the "basic steps" to monitor Hall's behaviour "it is likely he could have been prevented from committing the criminal offences", the former Appeal Court judge's report said.
There was no evidence people had "direct personal knowledge" of his sexual conduct in his dressing room, it added.
In the report, Dame Janet said: "In my judgment it must have been apparent to [Mr Colley], in the light of Hall's response and obvious lack of protest about such a serious issue, that the rumours relating to the period before he arrived were founded on fact.
"Therefore, at that stage, Mr Colley must have been, at the least, aware (without direct personal knowledge) that Hall had, in the past, engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct in his dressing room."
The report said there were "cultural factors" at the BBC that stopped people reporting upwards, "particularly when they related to talent".
Savile and Hall made "sorry reading" for the BBC and the inquiry found "disturbing things", the report said.
BBC culture "made it difficult to complain or rock the boat" and an "atmosphere of fear" still existed in the BBC to this day, it said.
However, it said no organisation could be "completely confident" that it did not harbour a child abuser.
During the inquiry, Mr Colley was contacted and said he "made it clear that sex on the premises was unacceptable".
His response in the report said: "Nobody ever told me that Stuart Hall was having improper sex in his dressing room or any sex in his dressing room.
"Patently, it should not have happened. If it did happen and I'd been told about it, it would have been sorted. I was more than able to sort Stuart Hall. I did not fear him in any way. He was not essential to my operation."
As part of Dame Janet Smith's review, Dame Linda Dobbs received evidence from people against whom Stuart Hall admitted inappropriate sexual conduct in connection with his work for the BBC, and provided her findings to the inquiry.
BBC staff failed to report the disgraced presenter indulging in "inappropriate sexual conduct" partly because he was seen as an "untouchable" celebrity, the report found.
Liz Dux, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon Lawyers, which represents 168 victims, said: "All the Savile and Hall victims have ever wanted from this report is truth and accountability.
"Despite millions having been spent on the inquiry, my clients will feel let down that the truth has still not been unearthed and many will feel it is nothing more than an expensive whitewash."
Ms Dux added: "It is unfortunate that Dame Janet had no power to compel senior managers to give evidence, giving the impression that the whole picture of who knew what has not been revealed."
Another solicitor representing victims said the report was "positive" in terms of truth, but fell "a long way short of what we wanted" in terms of "accountability".
