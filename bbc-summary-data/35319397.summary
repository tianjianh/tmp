Cotterill took over in 2013 and won the League One title and the Johnstone's Paint Trophy in his second season.
The 51-year-old has previously managed Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Notts County, Burnley, Stoke, Cheltenham Town and Sligo Rovers.
He leaves City, who host leaders Middlesbrough on Saturday, in 22nd position, two points from safety.
The team have failed to win in seven matches.
Assistant manager John Pemberton and Wade Elliott, boss of the club's under-21 side, will take interim charge.
It is only 256 days since Cotterill led Bristol City to their first league title since 1955.
Club chairman Keith Dawe said last season's success "will live in the memory for a long time" but added: "Sadly, since the highs of last March and May things have not gone our way on the pitch.
"The club's aspiration is to ultimately become a Premier League club and this decision has been made to achieve our overall strategy for growth and player development."
Cotterill had held a news conference earlier on Thursday to look ahead to Saturday's game against Boro.
He had discussed the club missing out on the signing of Bolton striker Zach Clough.
