[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) has been fined Â£586 for driving a car owned by the force which had two bald tyres.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Salmon, who lost his PCC post in elections last month, has confirmed the court's decision.
In a statement on Facebook, he said he failed to check the condition of the tyres when he collected the pool car from police headquarters last October.
Mr Salmon said he accepted the fine and three points imposed by the court.
He added that he was "judged by the same laws as everyone else".
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said in March that it was investigating Mr Salmon over the offence.
Mr Salmon responded at the time that he would co-operate fully with the investigation.
It followed a referral to the IPCC by the Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Panel.
In his statement, Mr Salmon said: "On 1 October 2015 I collected a shared pool car owned and maintained by Dyfed-Powys Police from the force's headquarters. Before driving the car I did not check the condition of the tyres.
"The next day whilst I was driving the car there was a blowout of a tyre. On subsequent examination the car was found to have two tyres that did not have sufficient tread to comply with the requirements of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations.
"I'm judged by the same laws as everyone else. Since the car was maintained by the police and in regular use by a number of staff I assumed it would be in good working order. I was wrong. I should have checked the tyres.
"As a result, I committed two offences of using a motor vehicle with defective tyres and I accept the penalties imposed by the court."
