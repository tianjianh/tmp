The 26-year-old finished in 44.074 seconds as Dutch skater Rianne de Vries secured gold and Italy's Martina Valcepina won silver.
Earlier, Gilmartin had finished eighth overall in qualifying over the longer distance, ruling her out of the final.
She said: "There is more to work on tactically. I have more to give."
