RHI scandal: Department declines to give information on participants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Department for the Economy has declined to disclose information about participants of the botched RHI scheme, despite telling boiler owners it would be "freely available" to the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officials said that under the rules, it could provide detailed information about their installations.
The information did not include the names of claimants.
However, it did involve location, technology type, installation capacity, accreditation date and subsidy.
Those involved in the scheme were told that by signing up to it, they were consenting to the publication of the information.
Economy Minister Simon Hamilton has written to political parties asking if they would support the publication of the names of those who took up the RHI scheme.
In a letter to Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt, Mr Hamilton said he was "of the view" that recipients' details should be published in "order to be as open and transparent as possible about how public money is being spent".
He said a balance would need to be struck between the "significant public interest" and the departments' obligations to protect participants confidentiality and privacy under data protection legislation and the scheme's own privacy policy.
He asked for a response by Tuesday 10 January.
Mr Nesbitt said he was "surprised" to be asked the question given that the UUP had consistently said the names should be published.
The Department for the Economy is currently taking legal advice about whether it can publish a list of the participants.
The RHI scandal has been centre stage in politics in Northern Ireland over the past month, with the resignation of Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister bringing the issue to a head.
Former First Minister Arlene Foster set up the RHI scheme in 2012 when she was enterprise minister in an attempt by the Northern Ireland Executive to encourage production of heat from renewable sources rather than fossil fuels.
But flaws in setting the scheme's subsidy rate left it open to abuse as claimants could earn more cash the more fuel they burned, with the overspend estimated to be about Â£490m.
The BBC asked the department for information about the scheme's participants on 17 December and, almost a month later, it declined to provide it.
If the information and a list of the participants were to be published, it would allow the identification of those who got into the scheme during the spike in applications in November 2015  - just before the subsidy level was dramatically reduced.
Almost 900 applications were received in the months leading up to the change, as officials moved to cut the subsidy level.
Former Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) minister Jonathan Bell, who was in charge of the department at the time, alleged that DUP special advisers had tried to delay the changes.
That has been denied by the former first minister Arlene Foster and by the advisers named.
Mr Bell, a member of the DUP, has been suspended by the party.
