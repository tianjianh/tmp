Celtic manager Ronny Deila insists his side will be more clinical against Motherwell on Saturday than they were in their goalless draw with Dundee.

The stalemate was only the second time in 23 games that the defending champions have failed to score.
"Everything is in our hands, so now we must get ready for Saturday as that is the most important thing," said Deila.
"Every time we play, there is pressure on us to win, but that's what we want to do and we'll be ready on Saturday."
Celtic's failure to win means Aberdeen can narrow the gap at the Premiership summit to two points by beating Hearts at Tynecastle on Friday.
"It was a frustrating night," Deila told BBC Scotland. "We had a clean sheet and that was positive, but offensively we should have created a little bit more.
"The last pass was not good enough and we had a couple of chances when, if we maybe played an extra pass, we would have been alone with the goalkeeper.
"But we had enough chances to win the game. Having said that, we have to work on creating more at Motherwell."
Erik Sviatchenko was taken off in the second half with a thigh injury that will be assessed with a scan on Wednesday, but the defender is a major doubt for the trip to Fir Park.
Midfielder Tom Rogic will be available, though, after missing the match at Dundee with a head injury.
Dundee manager Paul Hartley was delighted with a result that keeps them in the race for a top-six place.
Partick Thistle's win over Dundee United means Hartley's side need to win at Hamilton Academical on Saturday if they are to make sure of that.
"I thought the players were brilliant tonight," said Hartley. "The organisation, concentration levels and discipline were excellent.
"Celtic didn't cause us too many problems and we dealt well with everything they threw at us and we had a couple of chances at the other end.
"Craig Wighton had a good chance, Kane Hemmings had a good chance and Rory Loy hit the post, but it was a great point for us."
Top scorer Kane Hemmings was forced off at the interval with a dead leg and he faces a race to be fit to play at New Douglas Park.
