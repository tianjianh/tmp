'Commuting burglar' could be in Kent, police say

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A smartly-dressed "commuting criminal" being hunted by six police forces may now be in Kent, detectives have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Knights, 38, is suspected of using trains to move around the South East, committing burglaries.
Police investigating crimes in Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Kent, Essex and London are looking for him.
A Â£2,500 reward has been put up for information that leads to his arrest and conviction for at least one of the offences.
It is thought he is stealing cash and jewellery to fund a gambling addiction, police said.
Thousands of pounds worth of jewellery has been stolen during more than a dozen break-ins that Knights is suspected of being responsible for since June last year.
He is described as white, about 5' 8" with ginger hair and blue eyes.
Anyone with information on his whereabouts is urged to contact police.
