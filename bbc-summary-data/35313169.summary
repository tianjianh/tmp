[SN]TITLE[SN]
Government to cut measures from university governance bill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has agreed to cut controversial measures from a bill aimed at strengthening the governance of higher education.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Angela Constance confirmed amendments would be made to the Higher Education Governance Bill at stage two.
Opposition parties had voiced concerns at measures which would have given ministers power to make changes on governing bodies and academic boards.
Ms Constance said the government had "listened to stakeholders".
The bill sets out that universities should have elected chairs, modernised governing bodies and academic boards, and an enhanced definition of academic freedom.
As drafted it contains two sections saying ministers could modify the composition of governing bodies and academic boards, which Ms Constance said would be removed.
She also said the bill would be "strengthened" by removing obligations to limit numbers of academic boards or senates to 120, altering remuneration provisions and including a model for the election or appointment of the most senior lay members of governing boards.
Opposition members had voiced worries that increasing ministerial power over universities could lead to the Office for National Statistics reclassifying them as public bodies, potentially affecting their charitable status.
The education secretary said she did not agree with this, but said the moves were aimed at alleviating "any lingering doubts" about ONS reclassification.
She said: "We want every voice on campus to be heard and for the university sector to be more open and transparent.
"The Higher Education Bill aims to do just that, without affecting universities' autonomy or the current role of rectors in those universities that have one, and presents no threat to their financial wellbeing."
Scottish Labour said it supported the bill in principle, but MSP Iain Gray said the legislation as drafted "fails on many levels".
He said angst over some provisions could have been avoided had the bill been drafted properly, saying Labour would "give this bill the nod, but we will be shaking our heads at the incompetence."
Scottish Conservative MSP Liz Smith said there was no evidence to justify the need for the bill, questioning how the role of rector would fit in to the proposals.
She said the bill did not promote good governance of higher education institutions, saying it could undermine the foundations and principles of a sector which had thrived for hundreds of years.
Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur welcomed the removal of the two controversial sections, saying ministers should not be "playing chicken" with the ONS over reclassification.
He also argued against the need for the bill, saying it should just "vanish altogether" instead of being amended.
