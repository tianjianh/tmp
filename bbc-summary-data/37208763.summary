Measuring almost 23ft (7m) in diameter and titled Museum of the Moon, it has been created by Bristol-based artist Luke Jerram.
The artwork went on show to visitors at the Lakes Alive festival in Kendal.
Mr Jerram used images from NASA to create the installation, where each centimetre represents 5km of the moon.
He said: "Different cultures around the world have their own historical, cultural and religious relationships to the moon.
"So depending on where the Museum of The Moon is presented in the world, its meaning and interpretation will shift.
"As the artwork tours, new compositions will be created and performed by a range of established composers and musicians, so adding to the museum's collection.
"Like the moon, this artwork acts as a cultural mirror that allows us to observe and contemplate cultural differences around the world."
The floating artwork, that is illuminated and accompanied by music from different composers, was created in partnership with the University of Bristol and the UK Space Agency.
It is also due to visit Belgium and France in the coming months.
Lakes Alive ends on Sunday.
