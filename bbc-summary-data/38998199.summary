Championship clubs have agreed "in principle" to use goalline technology from the start of next season.

Clubs agreed to the decision on Thursday and it will be presented at the EFL annual general meeting in June.
The Premier League started using Hawk-Eye technology in 2013 and it is already used in the play-offs.
"This decision is about providing officials with as much support as possible," EFL chief executive Shaun Harvey said.
The system notifies the referee if the ball has crossed the goalline via a vibration and optical signal sent to the officials' watches within one second.
Goalline technology is currently used in the Premier League, Serie A, Ligue 1, the Champions League, the World Cup and the European Championship.
Queens Park Rangers boss Ian Holloway called for the Championship to start using the technology after his side were denied a goal at Blackburn earlier this month when replays showed the ball had crossed the line. The R's went on to lose the match 1-0.
