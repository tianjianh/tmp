[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel McMullen, 29, was stabbed numerous times to the legs, arms and chest at his home on Beech Court in Workington, Cumbria, on 7 January.
Two of the stab wounds "penetrated his heart and lungs which proved to be fatal", Carlisle Crown Court heard.
Calvin Patrickson, of Newlands Gardens, pleaded guilty to murder and was remanded for sentencing on 28 April.
Stuart Pattinson from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "This is a tragic case of a night out with friends ending with devastating consequences.
"It was the prosecution case that following a disagreement, the two men made amends.
"However, soon afterwards Calvin Patrickson carried out a pre-meditated attack by arming himself with a knife from the kitchen which he used to stab Daniel multiple times.
"Patrickson showed little or no remorse for his actions at the time."
Mr Pattinson said  he hoped the plea offered the family and friends of Daniel McMullen "a sense that justice has been served".
