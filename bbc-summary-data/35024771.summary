Monarch has said passengers have been booking their trips later since the terror attacks in Paris and Sharm el-Sheikh.

The airline's chief executive Andrew Swaffield said bookings had dropped off in the immediate aftermath but were now recovering.
Monarch's flights to Sharm el-Sheikh are still suspended and it does not expect them to resume before next year.
The comments came as Monarch returned to profit for the year to 31 October.
Mr Swaffield told BBC Radio 5 Live that customers were "booking closer to departure" in the wake of the attacks.
He said: "They're booking in pretty big numbers and there's no lack of interest, but they're not booking quite so far out because they're waiting to see what the world has in store.
"That will probably last a little while and then things will get back to normal again."
Luton-based Monarch expects annual profits to exceed £40m after cost cuts helped to achieve a turnaround.
Mr Swaffield said: "The key for us has been the £200m of costs we took out of the business during what was a pretty thorough restructuring during 2014."
Monarch streamlined its network and fleet, modernised its working practices and benefited from lower fuel prices.
The company made a loss of £94m in the previous year.
