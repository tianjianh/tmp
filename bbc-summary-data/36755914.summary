It was the first all-French doubles final at Wimbledon and the second Grand Slam the pair have won together.
Herbert and Mahut won the US Open title in 2015 and were runners-up at last year's Australian Open.
Mahut is famous for taking part in the longest professional match in tennis history, losing to John Isner at Wimbledon 2010 in a first-round singles that lasted 11 hours and five minutes.
