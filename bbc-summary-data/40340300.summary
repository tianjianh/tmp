Pearce, 29, missed the majority of the League One campaign last season through injury, but returned for the last five games as the Addicks went unbeaten.
"I want to keep progressing and be at a progressive club and I believe Charlton is the right place for me," he said.
The former Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Leeds defender made 24 appearances in all competitions last season.
