[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"We're back where we belong," stated Celtic's chief executive Peter Lawwell after the Champions League group stage draw in Monaco.

Certainly, being drawn against Barcelona in Group C, along with Manchester City and Borussia Monchengladbach, had a familiar look about it.
When Celtic line up against Barca at the Nou Camp on Tuesday, it will be the ninth time the teams have met in the Champions League.
Before that, the clubs played one another in the Fairs Cup in 1964 and in the Uefa Cup in 2004.
From those 12 matches, Celtic have registered two wins to Barca's seven, with three games drawn.
Here's a reminder of how Celtic have fared against their illustrious opponents in Europe's premier competition.
Celtic favourite Henrik Larsson returned to his old stamping ground in the colours of Barcelona to end his former club's unbeaten home record in the Champions League.
Deco put the visitors ahead and the impressive David Marshall saved a Ronaldinho penalty kick.
Chris Sutton slid in an equaliser for the hosts but Ludovic Giuly's deflected shot put Barca back in front before second-half substitute Larsson's coolly finished third.
Celtic: Marshall, Agathe, Balde, Varga, McNamara (Sylla 80), Petrov, Lennon, Thompson, Juninho Paulista (Sutton 45), Hartson (Valgaeren 63), Camara. Subs Not Used: Douglas, Pearson, Lambert, McGeady.

A strong defensive display by Celtic, guided by Martin O'Neill, earned them a Champions League draw at the Nou Camp, but it was not enough to reach the knockout stages.

Celtic rarely threatened but John Hartson prodded in a Stiliyan Petrov free-kick on the stroke of half-time to level.

The Spanish side got off to a perfect start when Xavi Hernandez flicked the ball over Artur Boruc and into the net after only two minutes.

The visitors led after the presence of Georgios Samaras helped force Javier Mascherano to divert a Charlie Mulgrew free-kick into his own net.

What a thrilling night for manager Neil Lennon and his Celtic team.
Victor Wanyama's header past Victor Valdes from a corner had given them a first-half lead.
And though Barcelona pressed for an equaliser, substitute Tony Watt came off the bench to give Celtic a cushion in the closing minutes.
Lionel Messi tapped home in injury time, but Celtic held on to inflict Barca's first defeat of the season.

Match report
Celtic had captain Scott Brown sent off as Barcelona, missing the injured Lionel Messi, avenged the previous season's defeat in Glasgow.
Cesc Fabregas was the match-winner, heading in with 15 minutes left.
Despite enjoying 82% possession across the game, the breakthrough for the Catalans only arrived after Brown had been shown a straight red card for kicking out at Barcelona forward Neymar.
Brown flailed a foot that caught the Brazilian on the arm and, despite Celtic protestations, he was dismissed.

Match report
Barcelona handed Celtic the harshest of Champions League lessons by producing a near-perfect display to equal the visitors' heaviest European loss.
Gerard Pique opened the scoring and Barca added two more goals late in the first half through Pedro and Neymar.
Brazilian Neymar, a £49m summer signing from Santos, added two more before the hour mark to complete his hat-trick.
Cristian Tello completed Celtic's misery, with Georgios Samaras's late headed goal scant consolation.
The result meant Neil Lennon's side finished the Champions League group stage with their lowest-ever tally of three points.
