[SN]TITLE[SN]
Republic's finance minister agrees to be quizzed on Nama

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has agreed to answer questions from the Republic's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) about the sale of the National Asset Management Agency's Northern Ireland portfolio.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nama sold the portfolio to a US investment fund for £1.2bn in 2014.
There have been a series of allegations about impropriety in the sale process.
The invitation to Mr Noonan was made following the Comptroller and Auditor General's report into the sale.
Mr Noonan said he had decided to accept the invitation.
"I intend to reply by letter to the Committee of Public Accounts to confirm this and to request assurances from the Committee that the proceedings of the Committee will be conducted in line with its terms of reference."
Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ yesterday, PAC chairman Sean Fleming had assured Mr Noonan the committee's questions would focus strictly on the mechanics of the sale process and his involvement in it.
"He is one of the links in the chain in relation to this sale process," said Mr Fleming.
"He was involved in correspondence personally; he was involved in personal phone calls on the matter.
"I do want to assure the minister... we will not be straying into governmental decisions; policy issues by the department."
