Murray, 29, came through an even first set via a tie-break, but found himself a break down early in the second.
But Edmund, who will rise into the top 50 after beating Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut to make the least eight, then lost three straight service games to allow his compatriot through.
Murray will face Spain's David Ferrer in the last four.
It was a heartening performance from Edmund, who hung tough with Murray in the first set despite failing to win a single point off the Scot's first serve.
The 21-year-old Yorkshireman, who was ranked outside the top 100 in February, was edged out in the tie-break and then ran out of steam after a promising start to the second.
Murray has lost just once in 11 Tour level meetings with other Britons, going down in straight sets to Tim Henman in Bangkok in September 2006. He beat Edmund at the Aegon Championships quarter-finals at Queen's earlier this year in their only previous meeting.
The other semi-final will see Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov play Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic of Canada.
Dimitrov ended the challenge of Spanish second seed Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals with a 6-2 6-4 victory.
It is the first time Dimitrov has beaten the 14-time Grand Slam champion and he is aiming to reach his third final of the year.
Raonic advanced after a 6-4 6-4 win over Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta.
