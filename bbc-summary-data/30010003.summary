[SN]TITLE[SN]
Councillors raise no object to nuclear archive at Wick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland councillors have raised no objections to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority's (NDA) plans to build an archive centre near Wick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The building would store information and records related to the Dounreay experimental nuclear power plant on the north Caithness coast near Thurso.
Dounreay is being decommissioned at a cost of Â£1.6bn.
The NDA has notified Highland Council of its proposal to site the archive near Wick Airport Industrial Estate.
The brownfield site had previously been occupied by the RAF. A planning application for the project has still to be submitted.
Highland Council's north planning applications committee has noted the NDA's plans.
