Bangor University seek help with sex life of lugworms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Citizen scientists" are being asked to look out for signs of passion in the lugworm community.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bangor University is asking beach walkers to help fill knowledge gaps about the environmental conditions required for Arenicola marina - or lugworms - to mate.
Experts say they spend their lives burrowed so opportunities to find a mate are limited.
They are a vital source of food for birds and fish and can be used as bait.
The males release sperm which collects on the surface of the sand - when the tide comes in, it is washed down into the burrows of the females and fertilises her eggs.
Specific environmental conditions are needed to trigger the release of the sperm and the egg at the same time and very little is known about the process.
One 'Spermwatch' event is being held at Llanfairfechan, Conwy county, on Saturday.
