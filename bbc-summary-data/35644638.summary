The corporation's biggest ever campaign event on 21 June will see representatives of both sides of the debate questioned by voters at the London concert venue.
There will also be a young voters' show from Glasgow on 19 May and a special edition of Question Time on 15 June.
Voters go to the polls on 23 June to decide whether the UK stays in the EU.
The debate at the 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena will be hosted by David Dimbleby, Mishal Husain and Emily Maitlis, with the Glasgow event presented by Victoria Derbyshire.
David Dimbleby will also moderate the Question Time programme, which the BBC said would feature "one senior advocate from each side".
