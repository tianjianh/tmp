A police officer was injured during Friday's raid on the four-storey building in Bangkok, where guns and drugs were also found.
Thai police suspected the building in the Phra Kanong district was being used as a passport-forging operation.
The UK Foreign Office said it was looking into reports that one of the men could be British.
"We are seeking further information from the local authorities following reports that a British national has been arrested in Thailand," a spokesman said.
All three men have been charged with offences including concealment of a body, obstruction of justice and possession of fraudulent passports, the deputy police chief spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said.
They are also charged with possession of drugs including ketamine and crystal meth.
A court date is yet to be set.
Speaking about the raid, Col Phathanacharoen added: "We managed to find a big freezer... the body was chopped into different parts. It was concealed in many rubbish bags."
He said he did not know the gender of the victim at this stage.
