The first of four public meetings will take place in the Isle of Man later to highlight a series of changes being planned for the Manx constabulary.

The constabulary reorganisation comes at a time of reduced budgets and "challenging financial targets".
The meeting at St Andrew's Church Hall, Douglas, at 19:00 BST will focus on the capital, Onchan and Braddan.
Chief Constable Gary Roberts will attend, along with the Home Affairs Minister, Juan Watterson.
Mr Watterson said: "This is an opportunity for us to explain the police modernisation plans in more detail and to listen to people's views and concerns".
The meetings are being organised by the Police Consultative Forum (PCF), an independent body made up of community representatives.
The next is planned for 14 August in the Castletown Civic Centre and subsequent meetings for the the north and west will take place next month.
The Isle of Man constabulary plans to close two police stations and cut the number of police officers.
The 11% job cut brings the number of Manx officers down from 236 to about 210.
