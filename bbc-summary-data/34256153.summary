Cumbria nuclear site pylon plans on public display

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals to build more pylons in Cumbria are going on public show.

The lines would connect a proposed nuclear power station at Moorside, near Sellafield, to the electricity network.
National Grid wants to install large pylons along a corridor from Carlisle to Moorside, then down to the Furness Peninsula and under Morecambe Bay to emerge near Heysham, Lancashire.
Campaigners are concerned about the impact on the scenery and want cables routed offshore or underground.
Friends of the Lake District said: "The pylons are the height of Nelson's Column and would be a dreadful addition to a national park currently engaged in a bid to win World Heritage Status.
"This is not a case of preventing infrastructure development going ahead.
"There is an opportunity for everybody to benefit if we can persuade government and National Grid that they can achieve the connection of the power station without compromising the natural beauty of the Lake District."
National Grid said: "This design will change and evolve in the coming months as we take into account different environmental and land-use issues that will influence where a new connection can be built.
"We're working with landowners, councils and specialist groups to get more information about land-use issues that will inform the design of our proposals.
"In addition to this ongoing dialogue, we're continuing to engage with local communities and individuals in the coming months."
A series of public events has begun, starting in Egremont, with the final one on 29 October in Heysham.
