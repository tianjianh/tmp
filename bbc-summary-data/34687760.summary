The 46-year-old Scot has played eight times in the biennial matchplay event against the United States.
"I'll put my hat in the ring and see what happens," she told BBC Scotland. "Obviously, it would be a great honour.
"It would be a dream to be a captain and if you are lucky enough to do it in your own country then I imagine that's just a great feeling."
Matthew made her Solheim Cup debut in 1998 but did not feature at Loch Lomond in 2000, the last time the competition was staged in Scotland.
Gleneagles hosted Europe's successful defence of the Ryder Cup last year and, in 1998, was the scene of one of Matthew's six Ladies European Tour victories.
"I was lucky enough to win the WPGA Championship at Gleneagles, so I have great memories from being there," she added.
Matthew played in this year's tournament, held in Germany in September, which was won 14½-13½ by the American team.
The US surged back from 10-6 down to take eight-and-a-half points from 12 singles to regain the title they last won in 2009.
However, the contest was marred by controversy over the issue of the non-concession of a short American putt in the fourballs.
"In every Solheim Cup, there have been little niggles here and there, but it's perhaps been blown up by the rise of social media," said Matthew.
The 2017 event will take place at Des Moines in Iowa.
