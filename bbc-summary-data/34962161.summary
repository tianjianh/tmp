MoneyConf, a finance and technology event that took place in Belfast last June is moving to Madrid from next year.

It was organised by the team behind WebSummit which has grown to be one of the biggest technology conferences in Europe.
About 1,000 exhibitors, from large organisations such as Amazon and Google to smaller start ups, set up at T13 in the Titanic Quarter.
Mike Harvey, head of strategic communications at Web Summit, said: "Belfast was an amazing venue, and the welcome our attendees received in the city was world-class.
"Unfortunately, for future growth, we have decided to move to the larger international hub of Madrid."
Gerry Lennon, chief executive of Visit Belfast, said the ability of international speakers to get to Belfast had been an issue.
"Access is the next issue for us to crack, particularly air routes to Asia, Germany and Scandinavia," he said.
"We have the venue with the Waterfront Hall, we have good links to the UK and those international links have to come next."
This announcement comes after 42,000 people attended WebSummit in November which was held in Dublin for the last time.
From next year, Paddy Cosgrave from WebSummit and his team are moving that event to Lisbon.
