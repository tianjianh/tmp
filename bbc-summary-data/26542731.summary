A Bristol-based artist is hoping to raise the funds to create a 90m (295ft) waterslide in the city centre.

Luke Jerram wants to install a temporary slide in Park Street in May, using plastic sheeting and hay bales.
The Park and Slide project is expected to cost £5,621 and is currently raising money through a crowdfunding site.
Mr Jerram said: "We got a £10,000 donation yesterday but we think they'd tried to donate £10 and added too many '0s', so we need to check it out."
The scheme, which has so far raised nearly £1,400 officially, is being proposed as part of Bristol City Council's Make Sundays Special programme.
Planned for 4 May, it will involve closing Park Street to traffic with just the giant water chute linking Clifton with the city centre.
"Its steep incline and prominent location makes it perfect for the slide site," said Mr Jerram, who has worked on a number of large-scale public interactive projects including the street pianos installations.
"And this massive urban slide will allow people to slide down Park Street and experience their city in a completely new way."
Last year, a 50m chute was successfully tested at Ashton Court with the backing of the council.
But Mr Jerram is hoping the Park and Slide will give people an even more "unique and memorable once-in-a-lifetime experience".
He said: "Imagine if there were permanent slides right across Bristol: linking Clifton with Hotwells; Cotham with Stokes Croft.
"But this is our city and maybe it's up to us to shape its future."
