Midfielder Bostwick, 29, was placed on the transfer list by League One Posh at the end of last season and has signed a two-year contract at Sincil Bank.
Winger Anderson, 20, spent last season on loan with the Imps and has agreed a three-year deal.
The pair could face their former club in a friendly on Saturday.
Lincoln boss Danny Cowley told the club website: "Very infrequently I am surprised by football. But I have to admit that to acquire the signature of Michael Bostwick was beyond my wildest expectations for our football club.
"To be able to bring in a top League One player who won various individual awards at Peterborough last year represents outstanding business on our part."
