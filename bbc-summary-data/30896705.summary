Nearly £32m should be spent on protecting Isle of Man towns from coastal flooding, a report has found.

The government-commissioned report focuses on the seven sites deemed most at risk of harbour flooding, and lists a range of solutions for each.
New sea defences being considered for Castletown, Douglas, Laxey, Ramsey, Peel, Port St Mary and Gansey include raising harbour walls and tidal gates.
All seven towns experienced coastal flooding during storms in early 2014.
Infrastructure minister Phil Gawne said the report would help in making informed decisions on any future investment.

The report by UK-based specialists JBA Consulting outlines a range of options for each site with the total cost of preferred options estimated at £31.8m.
Its findings will be presented to Tynwald Members later this month.
Mr Gawne said local communities will play a key role in the Department's decision-making process on long-term solutions.
"Improving our coastal defences at a number of different sites would represent a significant investment, so there must be full community engagement", he said.
High tides are forecast for 22, 23 and 24 January and 20 and 21 February 2015.
The government said it would deploy 20,000 sandbags to mitigate the risk of flooding in coming weeks.
