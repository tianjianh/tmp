What is a Black Moon and can I see it?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stargazers are in for a treat on Friday night - there will be a Black Moon, but what is it and will you be able to actually see it?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Moon goes through a cycle of phases and usually once every calendar month a New Moon occurs - that's when the Moon seems to disappear entirely.
But don't worry, it's still there, we just can't see it clearly.
However, every few years two New Moons occur in the same calendar month - and that's what's known as a Black Moon.
The next Black Moon for people living in the Western Hemisphere of the Earth - including us in the UK - will take place on the night of Friday 30 September and early hours of Saturday 1 October.
In the UK it will be around 1.11am Saturday morning.
But as it's a New Moon, when the Moon seems to disappear entirely, you can't actually see it!
However, for stargazers it will give a clearer sky than usual because there's no moonlight. That means they can spot the other beauties of the night sky.
