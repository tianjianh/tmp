Wendy Willson claimed to have been violently attacked in her King's Lynn home just days before Christmas 2013.
The inquiry into her false claims cost police Â£70,000 to investigate, Norwich Crown Court heard.
Willson was convicted of perverting the course of justice and fraud after trying to claim Â£6,000 from insurers.
Although she originally claimed nothing had been stolen during the incident, it later emerged she had failed in a bid to claim from an insurance company.
Detectives told the court a total of 76 officers had worked on the case throughout January and February 2014.

Willson was jailed for five months for perverting the course of justice and given another month for fraud.
She claimed two men broke into her Spenser Road home by forcing a conservatory door.
They supposedly forced into the kitchen where she was attacked, hit with a metal bar and punched in the head which caused her to fall against a unit knocking her unconscious.
Det Sup Paul Durham said: "Willson deliberately fabricated this extremely serious incident for her own personal financial gain.
"She has done a real disservice to genuine crime victims."
