New head coach Pierre de Bruyn expects Leicestershire to challenge on all fronts in 2017 and is excited by their "explosiveness" in white-ball cricket.

South African De Bruyn, 40, has replaced Andrew McDonald and is confident he can build on the Australian's success.
McDonald transformed a team who had not won a Championship match for two years into promotion challengers.
De Bruyn said the top four was the minimum aim in red-ball cricket.
"If you end up in the top four in September then you have a very good chance of promotion, when you can really turn the heat up," he added.

"In white-ball cricket, if you look at that T20 unit there is no reason why we cannot be at Finals Day.
"We have a fantastic signing in Luke Ronchi and the explosiveness and skill levels we have in the squad is phenomenal. We can definitely raise the bar.
"And in 50-over cricket we need to back our gameplan and we need to understand that it is a format that is much longer than you think and we need to be very clever.
"I break all the formats up into what will be a good season, but ultimately we need to have a much better season than previously."
Leicestershire begin their season with a home County Championship match against Nottinghamshire, which begins on Friday.
