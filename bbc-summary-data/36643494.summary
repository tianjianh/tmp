Parrot squawk 'evidence' in murder trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prosecutor in Michigan is considering whether the squawkings of a foul-mouthed parrot may be used as evidence in a murder trial.

Glenna Duram, 48, has been charged with murdering her husband, Martin, in front of the couple's pet in 2015.
Relatives of the victim believe that the pet African Grey, named Bud, overheard the couple arguing and has been repeating their final words.
The local prosecutor says it's unclear if the bird can be used as evidence.
"It is something we are going to be looking at to determine if it's reliable to use or if it's information we need," Newaygo Country prosecutor Robert Springstead told the Detroit Free Press.
Mrs Duram is accused of shooting her husband five times before turning the gun on herself in a failed suicide attempt.
Mr Duram's ex-wife, Christina Keller, now owns Bud. She believes that he has been repeating the conversation from the night of the murder, which she says ends in the phrase "Don't shoot!", with an expletive added.
His parents agree with her.
"I personally think he was there, and he remembers it and he was saying it", Mr Duram's father told local media.
His mother, Lillian Duram, added: "That bird picks up everything and anything, and it's got the filthiest mouth around."
Mr Springstead said it is unlikely the bird could be called to the stand to testify as a witness during a trial.
