The 51-year-old was with her grandson on a Route 133 bus on Brixton Road, Lambeth, when he was targeted.
A woman who was already on the bus approached the youth and tried to stab him with a large knife, police said.
CCTV footage has been released of the failed stabbing attempt at about 12:30 GMT on Boxing Day.
The boy suffered a minor cut to the stomach before the attacker left the bus and ran towards Oval.
Police described the attacker as an Asian woman, aged between 20 and 30, wearing a headscarf with a kangaroo print.
