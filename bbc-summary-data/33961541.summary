One-Day Cup: Alex Hepburn shines for Worcestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Hepburn marked his debut with 4-34 as Worcestershire finally broke their One-Day Cup duck with an eight-wicket win over Leicestershire at New Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seam bowler Hepburn was one of three 19-year-olds in the home side.
They had Leicestershire 98-8 before Clint McKay (42 not out) and 18-year-old Zak Chappell (31) put on 74.
They were eventually all out for 172 and Worcestershire eased to 176-2, with Tom Fell (60no) and Joe Clarke (51no) sharing an unbroken stand of 98.
It was a dismal batting performance by Leicestershire's top order before McKay and debutant Chappell came together in the 29th over, with spinner Saeed Ajmal (3-33) providing the main support for Hepburn.
The result was never in doubt after Tom Kohler-Cadmore (31) and Daryl Mitchell (22) launched the reply with a stand of 56, and Fell sealed the win with a boundary off Rob Sayer with 18 overs to spare.
Leicestershire have only one group game left, against Somerset on Tuesday, to register their first win of the competition, while Worcestershire, who had lost their five previous matches, complete their involvement away at Derbyshire.
