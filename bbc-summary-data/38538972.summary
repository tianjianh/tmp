[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol City 2-3 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City took all three points against Bristol City in a pulsating Severnside derby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A brilliant shot from Cardiff's Anthony Pilkington with five minutes left completed a fine fightback.
The home side went ahead when a Joe Bryan effort hit the bar, but bounced in off Cardiff goalkeeper Brian Murphy.
Pilkington equalised from the penalty spot. Tammy Abraham put Bristol City back ahead before Kadeem Harris header levelled and Pilkington won it.
All the action at Ashton Gate came in the second period after a cautious first-half out of keeping with the usual intensity of this fierce rivalry.
Bristol City dominated the opening 45 minutes, but failed to carve out a clear-cut chance. Indeed it was Bluebirds' midfielder Peter Whittingham who came closest as his shot deflected over with nine minutes gone.
But the game burst into life on 51 minutes when Bryan's superb 20-yard volley hit the Cardiff bar, but bounced into the net off the back of goalkeeper Murphy.
Neil Warnock's men were handed a lifeline on 74 minutes when Joe Ralls was brought down in the box and a penalty was given. Pilkington made no mistake from the spot.
It precipitated a flurry of late goals which the earlier mundane action had hardly indicated.
Tammy Abraham put Lee Johnson's side back ahead with a close-range finish, but on 82 minutes Cardiff were level again as substitute Harris headed home.
And three minutes later Pilkington let loose a fantastic 25-yard strike to hand the Welsh club all three points.
It meant Cardiff have done the double over Bristol City this term having beaten them in the Welsh capital in Warnock's first game in charge after taking over as boss in October.
For the hosts, the slide continues. Johnson's side have now lost seven games on the trot, equalling an unwanted club record.
