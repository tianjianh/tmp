[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ship captain pleads guilty to being drunk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ship captain has pleaded guilty to being drunk while in charge of a vessel carrying 11,000 tonnes of petroleum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sandro Carnemolla, from Italy, was found to be double the legal limit on 6 July as the MV Quercianella was leaving Eastham docks in Merseyside.
The 53-year-old was given a suspended sentence of four months in jail and fined Â£1,000 at Liverpool Crown Court.
The court heard the captain had an "exemplary record" but had been drinking after a "stressful day".
Prosecutor Rob Jones said Mr Carnemolla believed an onboard pilot had used his mobile phone on the bridge, which is not allowed.
The pilot in turn thought the captain, from Port Sala, Sicily, was drunk and called the police, who then breathalysed and arrested Mr Carnemolla.
Anthony Berry QC, defending, said that although there were two first officers on the bridge who could have manoeuvred the vessel, Mr Carnemolla was guilty because he was officially in charge.
He added the captain had his last drink more than two hours before the incident happened at the Queen Elizabeth II locks in Wirral.
