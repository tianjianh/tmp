[SN]TITLE[SN]
Motorists fined on Coppergate, York, to be refunded

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fines issued to more than 12,000 motorists for using a York street at restricted times will be refunded, City of York council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Penalty notices totalling more than Â£385,000 were given to drivers in Coppergate.
However, the Traffic Penalty Tribunal said errors in the signage meant the restrictions were not enforceable.
The council's executive said those fined would be written to and advised of their right to apply for a refund.
Motorists will be given until 31 March 2016 to submit their claims.
Council leader Chris Steward said: "This is fundamentally about justice and giving people the money back where something has not been right."
Fines were issued after an automatic number plate recognition system was installed on Coppergate in August 2013 prohibiting its use during certain hours.
But the scheme was abandoned in 2014 together with a trial closure of Lendal Bridge after both were found to be unenforceable.
The council said the revenue from fines had been ring-fenced in the budget in case refunds had to be made.
It is estimated the cost of administering the refund process for Coppergate will be about Â£40,000.
