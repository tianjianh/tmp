Police have appealed for witnesses after a toddler was assaulted with a boiled egg in Moray.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 16-month-old boy was playing in a garden in Forres when a man entered the garden and threw a boiled egg which knocked the child over.
PC David Baird said: "This is particularly despicable - an object has struck a defenceless young toddler.
"Thankfully the child wasn't injured as a result, however, he and his mum were left shaken and very upset."
It happened in the Califer Road area at about 13:15 on Easter Sunday, 16 April.
PC Baird added: "I would like to appeal to the public to think back to Easter Sunday and try to remember if they noticed anyone acting suspiciously in the Califer and Culbin road areas at this time.
"I would also like to stress that this is an extremely serious matter and I would urge anyone who knows anything about this incident to get in touch with police.
"The assault of a baby is completely unacceptable and rest assured we will take every measure open to us to find whoever is responsible for this.
"A tall male described as approximately 6ft 4in in height, wearing a black, hooded sweatshirt with the hood up, blue jeans and black trainers with distinctive blue eyes may have vital information that could assist us with this inquiry."
