Harry Martin, 18, from Membland, Newton Ferrers, was last seen on 2 January.
A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said the body had not yet been formally identified.
Friends and family started a new search for the teenager earlier on Saturday, with more than 130 people signing up through a Facebook page.
Mr Martin, who police said was a photography student, was last seen by his father leaving his home and walking towards a coastal path at about noon on Thursday 2 January.
Insp John Livingstone, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the body was found in Carswell Cove in the Noss Mayo area by members of the public searching in canoes and kayaks at about 10:40 GMT.
He added that Mr Martin's family had been at the waterside when the body was brought ashore.
The police said formal identification would take place early next week.
Police, the Dartmoor Rescue Group, coastguards and members of the public were all involved in searches.
Extensive searches of a 20-mile stretch of coastline, 10 miles either side of Harry's home, have been carried out.
Earlier in the week 400 people attended a church service for the teenager.
On Saturday the Reverend Anne Legge, said it was "yet another sad day for this community".
She added: "But it marks the start of a different kind of journey. We are now in some ways relieved a body has been found.
"So many people have been searching for what seems like such a long time now."
Mr Martin had recently started a course in film and TV production at Greenwich University in London but had been back home visiting his family for Christmas when he went missing.
