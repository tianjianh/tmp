[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welling ended their run of five successive defeats with a draw at Halifax in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicky Wroe volleyed over for the hosts following Marek Rodak's weak punch, before the Welling keeper did well to save from Richard Peniket.
Kingsley James put the Shaymen in front when he reacted quickest after Rodak could only parry Connor Hughes' shot.
But Kadell Daniel curled an effort past Sam Johnson late on to secure a point for Welling.
