[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three further outlets of troubled retailer Ness Clothing are to close in the coming week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Administrators at BDO have said the stores in Dundee, Glasgow (Buchanan Galleries) and the Livingston Designer Outlet are to go.
Four other outlets - Aberdeen, Cambridge, Bath and Ilkley - closed on 15 January.
BDO partners James Stephen and Matthew Tait were appointed joint administrators in December.
The company, based in Edinburgh, is an independent women's fashion and accessories label.
Prior to entering administration, it operated 10 stores in Scotland and five stores in England, plus four concessions.
The company employed 105 people.
James Stephen said: "Despite Ness Clothing's improving sales figures nationally over the last 12 months, a challenging trading environment has significantly affected the long-term viability of these three outlets.
"We are left with no option but to cease trading these stores. Regrettably, all staff at these stores will be made redundant.
Mr Stephen said all remaining Ness Clothing stores would continue to trade, with all staff retained, while a sale of the business is finalised.
