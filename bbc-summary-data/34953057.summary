The 34-year-old victim, who is five months pregnant, suffered a broken arm and leg but her unborn baby was unharmed in the crash in Salford, Greater Manchester Police said.
A spokesman said: "Words were exchanged and the driver drove off."
Details have just emerged of the crash, on Monday on Bury New Road.
The woman was carried "a short distance" after she was hit by the white VW Polo or Golf, at about 19:30 GMT, as she walked towards Wellington Street West in Higher Broughton.
Appealing for witnesses, PC Mike Connolly said: "Thankfully the baby is okay.  However, the victim suffered broken bones in her right arm and leg and will undergo surgery soon."
