The two-week campaign, run in conjunction with other forces in north-west England, saw firearms left at police stations across the region.
Overall, more than 100 items - including handguns, rifles and shotguns - were passed to police in Wales.
An amnesty in 2014 netted a similar haul of about 100 bullets and guns.
"We are fortunate not to have a gun crime problem here in north Wales, but we do have a large number of legally owned firearms and other older firearms in people's possessions," said Ch Insp Richie Green.
"Unfortunately, these firearms can fall into the wrong hands and may end up being used in crime."
A blunderbuss is a muzzle-loading firearm, often considered to be an early form of shotgun.
North Wales Police said, while the April campaign had come to an end, anyone with firearms they want to surrender can still hand them over at the forces main stations, or contact officers on the 101 non-emergency number to arrange collection.
