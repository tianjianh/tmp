Organisers Glasgow 2014 said the Sierra Leone chef de mission knows where Mohamed Tholley is.
On Friday it emerged that athletes from the country were considering extending their stay amid fears over the Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa.
Two Sierra Leone athletes at the Games have been tested and cleared for Ebola.
Ebola has caused more than 700 deaths since February in an outbreak affecting four west African countries.
Mohamed Tholley had failed show to up for the men's time trial cycling on Thursday.
Glasgow 2014 have now said the Sierra Leone chef de mission knows where the "missing cyclist" is and stressed he was not missing.
Unisa Deen Kargbo said that legally Tholley could be in the country until September but he had not discussed leaving the village with anyone in the camp.
Sierra Leone's Samuel Morris and Moses Sesay have been tested for Ebola and cleared by doctors in Glasgow.
Sesay, 32, was admitted to a Glasgow hospital last week after feeling unwell and doctors tested him for various conditions, including Ebola.
The cyclist was given the all-clear and released from hospital in time to compete in the men's individual time trial at the Games on Thursday.
It later emerged that table tennis player Morris was also tested in Glasgow and given the all-clear.
Morris, 34, said he developed a fever two days after arriving at the athletes' village.
He said: "They took me to the general hospital. They tested me for Ebola.
"I thought it was ordinary malaria diagnosis. But they didn't say that. They thought it was just a change of weather."
Tholley's coach Winston Crowther said the cyclist may have had concerns over the Ebola outbreak, but did not rule out other reasons for him leaving the team camp, including economic factors.
On the issue of the team returning to Sierra Leone, Unisa Deen Kargbo said: "Athletes have come to me and said they don't want to return because of the Ebola situation.
"There have been discussions with back home to see what the final decision will be on that. I have a mandate to return the athletes on 5 August and that's what I'm working towards now."
Asked if the athletes could stay on in the UK, he said: "The UK government will have to decide if that's an option, but I don't know."
The athletes' village is due to close on Wednesday and is being decommissioned on Thursday and Glasgow 2014 said it would become a "building site" within a matter of hours.
Sierra Leone has declared a public health emergency after more than 200 people died from the Ebola virus.
The outbreak - the world's deadliest to date - was first reported in Guinea in February.
It then spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, and a person who travelled from Liberia to Nigeria died of the virus shortly after arriving in Lagos last week.
Ebola kills up to 90% of those infected but patients have a better chance of survival if they receive early treatment.
