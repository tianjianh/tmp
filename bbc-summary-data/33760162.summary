MoD to dedicate headstone to Bridgend WW2 RAF airman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stone will be dedicated to a RAF airman who was killed in World War Two after an appeal to trace his family.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Roy Penry Williams, from Bridgend, was on a mission to bomb the German town of Emden in July 1941 when his plane was shot down in the Netherlands.
A service is being held in the country to re-dedicate two new headstones to Sgt Williams and his five crew members.
The Ministry of Defence hope to invite his relatives, known to have links to the Llanllyfni area of Gwynedd.
The ceremony, organised by the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre, will take place in September at the airmen's burial place at Leeuwarden Cemetery, Netherlands.
