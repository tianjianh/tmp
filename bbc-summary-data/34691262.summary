[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jurgen Klopp suffered his first loss as Liverpool manager, seeing his side beaten by Crystal Palace at Anfield.

Defender Scott Dann nodded in the 82nd-minute winner, reacting quickest after Simon Mignolet parried his header.
The visitors took the lead in the first half through winger Yannick Bolasie, who swivelled inside the box to fire in after the Reds failed to clear.

Philippe Coutinho curled in Liverpool's leveller three minutes before half-time following Adam Lallana's flick.
But Liverpool-born Dann then inflicted a first defeat in 13 matches for the Reds, who were watched by former captain Steven Gerrard.
Palace moved above their hosts - and Liverpool's city rivals Everton - into eighth place in the Premier League, having ended a four-match winless run.
Palace are quickly becoming Liverpool's bogey team, inflicting damaging results on the Reds over the past three seasons.

In the the 2013-14 campaign, when the Reds were in the hunt for their first league title since 1990, Palace came back from 3-0 down by scoring three times in the last 11 minutes to dent their championship hopes.
Last season, the Eagles spoiled Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard's farewell appearance at Anfield, winning 3-1 as they completed a league double over their opponents.
This time, boss Klopp experienced his first defeat in seven games since taking over from Brendan Rodgers.
And, although Liverpool dominated possession and territory, Palace held firm defensively and posed a threat on the attack through the pace of Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha and Jason Puncheon.
With Liverpool returning from a near 5,000-mile round-trip at Russian side Rubin Kazan in the Europa League on Thursday, Eagles boss Pardew spoke to his players about the importance of making a fast start at Anfield to take advantage of any lethargy in the limbs.
And it looked like the travelling had taken its toll on the home side in the early exchanges.
The Reds made a slow start to the game as Palace pressed high and attacked with speed. The Eagles had 63% possession in the opening 20 minutes, making it count as Bolasie drilled in a finish after some sloppy Reds defending.
Liverpool eventually picked up the tempo, equalising shortly before the interval through Coutinho.
The Brazilian ran onto Nathaniel Clyne's right-wing cross inside the Palace area, bending the ball past Wayne Hennessey for his third goal in two matches.
It was a deserved leveller based on the pattern of play following Bolasie's opener, but the Reds were unable to push on and force a second-half winner.
Reds striker Christian Benteke came close with a header and, moments after Dann's goal, Hennessey denied Coutinho from the edge of the area with a fingertip save.
But, in truth, Liverpool did not test the Wales keeper enough. The Reds had almost 65% possession over the 90 minutes, but only managed to hit the target with four of their 22 attempts.
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: "Today is a bad feeling - it was not necessary to lose this game. We were the better team but for the first 15 minutes we were not on the pitch. We got the goal, we were awake, we started creating chances.
"But after the break, we gave them chances to cause us problems. Then we woke up again but couldn't make a goal. It feels so bad because it was not necessary. This was not enough for us - we can do more. We have to learn from this."
Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: "We came here with ambition. The worst thing that happened to us was scoring, we then lost the ambition. Liverpool came on to us.
"We went toe-to-toe against Manchester United and got a draw, we went toe-toe toe with Liverpool and got the win.
"Sometimes it is about our own belief. We have been unlucky in the last few games. We have started really well this year. We need to make sure we capitalise on that."
The international break. But when Klopp's squad returns they must regroup for a trip to Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday, 21 November.
Palace return to action a couple of days later, hosting second-bottom Sunderland at Selhurst Park on Monday, 23 November.
