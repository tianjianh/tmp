[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The opening of a new Edinburgh school, which was due to happen two months ago, has been delayed for a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new Boroughmuir High School will now open at the start of the new school year in August 2017.
Work is due for completion by April 2017, however pupils will not use the new facility until after the summer holidays, to avoid any exam disruption.
Contractor O'Hare & McGovern refused to explain what had caused the "unfortunate delay".
The city council will be seeking compensation from the contractors.
The new school site is near the Union Canal to the south, Dundee Street to the north, and Viewforth to the east.
The new building will house up to 1,165 pupils, and will replace the school's current building which is less than 500 metres away in Viewforth.
Paul Godzik, the City of Edinburgh Council's education convener, said: "This is understandably disappointing news for the whole school community and we certainly share their frustration at this fresh delay.
"We have made clear our displeasure at the way the project has progressed to date and will be seeking compensation in line with the terms of the contract.
"By postponing the opening until the start of the next school year, we can ensure pupils can sit their exams without the upheaval of moving into a new building.
"When staff and pupils return for the new academic year next August, they'll be embarking on an exciting new chapter in Boroughmuir's history, with a fantastic new teaching and learning environment to continue the school's first-class academic track record."
A spokesman for O'Hare & McGovern said: "The unfortunate delay was caused by a number of unforeseen circumstances, but we are confident Edinburgh will take delivery of a magnificent new educational facility in April."
