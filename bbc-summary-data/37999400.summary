BBC Western House, located next to New Broadcasting House in central London, will now be known as BBC Wogan House.
The Wogan family, who were on hand to see the building's new signage unveiled on Wednesday, said they were "extremely touched by such a wonderful gesture".
Sir Terry, who died in January, hosted the Radio 2 breakfast show from 1972 and 1984 and again from 1993 to 2009.
The much-loved DJ was last on air on Radio 2 in November 2015, presenting his Weekend Wogan show.
In a statement, the Wogan family said Radio 2 had been "such an important part of Terry's life".
"He spent so many happy years there doing what he loved - chatting and laughing with the listeners from his studio in BBC Western House every weekday morning," they said.
BBC director of radio Bob Shennan said Sir Terry had been "a much-loved Radio 2 personality".
"Each time we all walk through the doors of Wogan House we will be forever reminded of him - his warmth, wit and endless charm."
