Newport County: Boss Mike Flynn urges fans to 'keep believing'

Newport County caretaker boss Mike Flynn says fans should 'keep believing' that the Exiles can avoid relegation.

The Welsh club are one point adrift of safety with three games remaining after a 6-1 hammering at Plymouth that confirmed the Pilgrims' promotion.
Flynn now believes the Exiles are in a two-team battle with Hartlepool, beaten 2-1 at Orient, to remain in League Two.
"I am still very confident we will stay up, the boys have been unbelievable for me and this result is a blip," he said.
"It's a fight between us and Hartlepool. It is simple, we need to better Hartlepool's results and hopefully that will be enough.
"We could have played well today, drawn and Hartlepool won and we would be worse off. So I have to be philosophical."
The defeat ended a run of three successive wins, but Flynn says there is simply no time to dwell on the loss as the Exiles bid to avoid the drop having been 11 points adrift when they sacked manager Graham Westley in March.
"My job is to pick the players' heads up and that starts right now, this is not the time to play the blame game," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"There are three games left and we have to forget this and move on.
"This is the game I was always most worried about, but my message to the fans is to keep believing."
Flynn admits his side were simply outclassed by a rampant Plymouth, who Flynn is thrilled to be leaving behind.
"We had kept three sheets in a row, so I didn't see this coming in the manner that it did," he said.
"Plymouth are fighting as well and we came up short today against a very good Plymouth team. I am glad they are getting promoted and we won't have to play them again, because I've seen enough of them this season."
