The 14-year-old was found dead on the banks of the River Leven in Dunbartonshire on 25 August 1996. The killer has never been found.
Her mother contributed to the appeal which was broadcast on Monday night.
Police said some calls to the programme related to the identity of a hooded man seen near Caroline before she died.
Others were said to have offered information to the general inquiry.
The Crimewatch appeal was led by Det Supt Jim Kerr in a bid to generate fresh leads.
He said: "We have received a positive response following last night's appeal on the Crimewatch programme.
"More than 20 calls were received and the information given to police will now be followed up by the officers from the Homicide Governance and Review Team and I am hopeful that some calls could assist with the investigation."
Video contributions were made by Caroline's mother Margaret McKeich and the schoolgirl's friend Joanne Menzies, who was one of the last people to have seen her alive.
Mrs McKeich, 60, told the programme that she believed locals knew who was responsible for her daughter's death.
She said: "I would urge anybody to come forward, just to give me that peace and to give me closure.
Caroline, from Bonhill, was heading to meet her boyfriend in Renton, having spent an evening with friends, and took a short cut from shops along Dillichip Loan towards The Towpath and the Black Bridge.
On the Crimewatch programme, her friend Ms Menzies returned to the area where they parted for the final time.
Urging those with information to come forward, she said: "These people should now stand up and actually finally be counted as a human being and not hiding a sickening secret."
Police Scotland's Homicide Governance and Review team have begun a fresh investigation and forensic scientists are re-examining more than 300 items collected at the time of Caroline's death.
