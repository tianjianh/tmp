A Texas man is being held without bail after police say he shot and killed a sheriff's deputy as the officer refuelled his patrol car.

Police believe Shannon Miles targeted Darren Goforth at a petrol station near Houston because Goforth was in uniform.
Houston officials did not disclose a motive, but took issue with recent protests against police officers.
"This rhetoric has gotten out of control," Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman said on Saturday.
"We've heard black lives matter, all lives matter. Well, cops' lives matter too," he said. "Why don't we drop the qualifier, and say 'Lives Matter' and take that to the bank?"
Miles, 30, is black and Goforth, who was 47, was white.
The Black Lives Matter movement grew to prominence after a white policeman killed Michael Brown - an unarmed black teenager - in Ferguson, Missouri, last year.
The protest movement has continued to gain strength over the past year after several controversial police-involved deaths of black people including those of Eric Garner, Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland.
"It is time for the silent majority in this country to support law enforcement," said Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson on Saturday.
"There are a few bad apples in every profession but that does not mean that there should be open warfare declared on law enforcement.
"The vast majority of officers are there to do the right thing, care about community."
The Black Lives Matter movement responded to Mr Hickman and Ms Anderson, saying the group promotes peace.
"It is unfortunate that Sheriff Hickman has chosen to politicise this tragedy and to attribute the officer's death to a movement that seeks to end violence," Deray Mckesson, one of the group's leaders, said on Twitter.
Goforth was pumping petrol on Friday night when prosecutors say Miles approached him from behind and shot him 15 times. A surveillance camera filmed the incident.
Miles appeared in court on Monday as prosecutors laid out the case against him.
Prosecutors said ballistic tests show that Miles owns the weapon that killed Goforth and a witness placed Miles at the scene.
Miles was previously convicted of charges of resisting arrest and disorderedly conduct with a firearm. There is no evidence that he and Goforth knew one another.
