There was also a silver in Tokyo for fellow Welsh swimmer Georgia Davies in the 50m backstroke.
The British team left the Tatsumi International Pool having amassed 19 medals across the three-day event.
Wales' Dan Jervis had secured bronze in the 1500m freestyle on Friday, with Thomas winning her bronze on Saturday.
British Swimming head coach Bill Furniss said: "This tour has ticked all of the boxes.
"It's what we wanted to do - to travel east in year one of an Olympic cycle leading into Tokyo [the 2020 Olympic Games].
Find out how to get into swimming with our special guide.
"We had a tough camp in Thailand and then came into a really difficult competition, stacked with a great depth of Japanese talent.
"We knew we would have to swim the event in a compromised state, off the back of some very hard work, but we were very close to a 100% strike rate of our swimmers moving it on from heats to finals and I'm delighted by this.
"I'm pleased with how the team has coped with the travel and it's back to the UK now for a few days' recovery before phase two begins, the hard work continues and we head to the Seven Hills meet in Rome next month."
