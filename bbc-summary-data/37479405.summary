Celtic keeper Craig Gordon hopes extra homework on Brendan Rodgers' methods will pay off in his bid to reclaim a starting spot from Dorus de Vries.

Gordon, 33, could start Wednesday's Champions League group match against Manchester City after replacing De Vries at half-time against Kilmarnock.
The Dutchman suffered a chest injury but Gordon hopes he has done enough to persuade Rodgers to recall him.
"I spoke to him when he told me he was putting Dorus in the team," he said.

"I have not spoken to him since then but I have just gone away and tried to work and also do my homework on what he likes his goalkeepers to do.
"I'm trying to improve my game so when I go back in the team that I can maybe adapt more to what he's looking for.
"I'm still learning. I want to do as well as I can at the things he is looking for me to do and if I can do that and keep the standard of my play up, then I give myself a chance of getting a run in the team."
De Vries, 35, has started Celtic's last four Scottish Premiership games and their opening Champions League drubbing at Barcelona, conceding 12 goals in five outings.
Scrutiny of his form continued after the Dutchman was beaten by Kilmarnock striker Souleymane Coulibaly's 40-yard strike in the first half on Saturday.

Gordon, whose only action in the last month before Saturday was Celtic's League Cup win over Alloa, spoke to Rodgers again after the 6-1 rout about what he requires.
"He spoke to me at the end of the game on the pitch," the former Hearts and Sunderland keeper added on Celtic TV.
"He's looking for me to demand the defenders drop deeper to get on the ball.
"He wasn't happy with some of their positioning when I had the ball. It's little things like that that are going to help make sure we are all on the same page."
