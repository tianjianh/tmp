He won 56.5% of the vote of party members against Norman Lamb in the battle to succeed Nick Clegg.
Ms Williams, who had backed Mr Farron, said he had always been a "great friend" of Wales who understood the nation and its traditions.
She said she was "incredibly excited" to help him continue the party's fightback after its election defeat.
"I know he will communicate our liberal message with that human touch that's often missing in politics," said the Brecon and Radnorshire AM.
"Tim has always been a great friend of Wales. He understands our nation, its traditions and - crucially - the importance of the assembly elections next year to the Welsh political landscape.
"With thousands upon thousands of new members and a renewed sense of optimism for the British liberal cause, we are absolutely up for the fight."
The Lib Dems' only Welsh MP, Mark Williams, had also backed Mr Farron to be the party's new leader.
