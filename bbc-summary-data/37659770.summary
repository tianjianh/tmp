[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sinkhole measuring six metres (20ft) across has opened up in a road in a Greater Manchester town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chasm appeared in Heywood Road, Prestwich, overnight and is expected to cause "significant" delays for motorists.
A spokesman for United Utilities said it was caused by a "collapsed sewer."
The road has been partially closed in both directions to pedestrians as well as vehicles, a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.
GMP's Whitefield Twitter account posted advice urging people to "give the road a miss for the next week or so".
A fire service spokesman said local residents had heard "noises and grumbling" for about 45 minutes before the sinkhole appeared.
United Utilities said engineers had assessed the site and put temporary measures in place to keep the sewer functioning.
A spokesman said it was not clear how long it would take to repair the damage.
