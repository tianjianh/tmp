Researchers at Harvard University have created the miniature bot after studying the movements of both bees and puffins.
It is hoped the robots, which are slightly larger than a real bee, will eventually be able to help real insects in the wild, or be used for help monitor what humans are doing.
Watch this report to find out more about the robobee.
