The 26-year-old finished the 54-hole LPGA Tour event on Sunday at 18 under par for her second tournament victory of the season and 15th career title.
Ryu closed with a two-under 69, beating compatriot Amy Yang and Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn, after heading into the final round with a five-shot lead.
"Dreams come true," Ryu said on being world number one for the first time.
"I always dreamed about it. I cannot believe it. I didn't expect two good things coming together."
Britain's Mel Reid, who was two shots off the lead after the first round, finished at six under after carding a final round of 67.
