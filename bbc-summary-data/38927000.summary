Pictures posted on social media showed blacked-out streets, lit only by a handful of car headlights and torches.
The power outage hit the neighbourhoods of Schaerbeek, Evere and Saint-Josse,
Sibelga, the power company, and Elia, the network operator, confirmed there was a fault in the city's electricity grid and said power was gradually being restored to affected areas.
The power failure reportedly began at about 22.45 local time (21:45 GMT).
Traffic lights were reportedly knocked out in parts of the city.
The cause of the power failure is still unknown.
