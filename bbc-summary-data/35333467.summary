[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Chung Yai-Ho, from Glasgow, was last seen in his inflatable red kayak off Traigh beach near Arisaig at about 16.30 on Wednesday.
He had set off despite an off-duty police officer warning him not to go out because of squally weather.
Two lifeboats, coastguard rescue teams and helicopter and police search dog teams have been involved in the search.
The helicopter search was stood down on Thursday night but coastal searches from Mallaig to Gortenachullish continued on Friday and Saturday.
Mr Chung Yai-Ho is 5ft 8in tall with short dark hair and a beard. He was last seen wearing a black waterproof jacket, black waterproof trousers and a black buoyancy aid.
His car, a red 2003 Toyota Corolla, was found parked near to the beach and has been recovered by the police.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Over the weekend there will be continued searches co-ordinated by police based in Fort William.
"Local officers will be supported by specialist search teams and dog units. Further assistance will be provided by HM Coastguard and the Lochaber mountain rescue team.
"If anyone has seen Jason or has any information regarding his current whereabouts or movements prior to when he was last seen on Traigh beach, they are urged to contact police on 101."
