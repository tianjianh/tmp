A man has appeared in court after two police officers were injured in an attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair were hurt while attending a "domestic incident" in Aldershot in Hampshire on Tuesday, police said.
Simon Priest, 41, of Pegasus Avenue in Aldershot is charged with causing grievous bodily harm, attempted GBH and possession of a firearm.
He was remanded in custody by Basingstoke magistrates to appear at Winchester Crown Court on 15 March.
Mr Priest also faces charges of escaping lawful custody and theft of a police Taser.
One officer was discharged from hospital on Tuesday night while the other was moved to another hospital for "specialist treatment".
The force said many people were in the area at the time and appealed for witnesses to come forward.
Det Insp Sion Margrie said: "It is likely someone saw or heard what happened, or even filmed the incident on their mobile phones."
