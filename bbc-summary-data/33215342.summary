MSPs launch inquiry into quality of jobs in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs have launched an inquiry into the impact of the 2008 recession on the quality of jobs in Scotland's labour market.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Holyrood's economy committee is examining whether working conditions have improved or declined since the recession and subsequent recovery.
MSPs will look at how that has affected the health and wellbeing of workers.
They will also explore the impact of low wages and temporary or insecure jobs on the Scottish economy.
The committee will look at what the Scottish government and public policy makers can do to improve job quality and wellbeing.
Workers will be able to air their views through a survey which is being issued as part of the committee's call for evidence.
Committee convener Murdo Fraser said: "The Scottish economy is clearly on the road to recovery but it's important that as politicians we reflect on whether the 2008 recession has had a long-lasting impact on the quality of jobs in the labour market."
The Tory MSP said: "An increase of people in employment is always to be welcomed. However, this inquiry will delve into the issues behind the headlines and determine if job quality has improved.
"Issues such as low pay and zero hour contracts are high on the political agenda, but this inquiry wants to get to the bottom of their impact on the wider Scottish economy."
Deputy convener Dennis Robertson said: "Part of this inquiry is about hearing directly from people across Scotland who work in different sectors of the economy about what they value from an employer and if their working conditions have improved."
The SNP MSP said: "Along with other evidence, this will help us as a committee to determine the impact of employment practices on the Scottish economy.
"The health and social impact of employment practices is one the committee is particularly interested in hearing more about, particularly the impact of low pay."
