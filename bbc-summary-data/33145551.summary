The 27-year-old Polish man was discovered at a property in Brothertoft Road, Boston, on Saturday.
Three men, who were arrested on Saturday in Larkspur Croft, where a firearm was recovered, were bailed on Monday.
Chf Insp Paul Timmins, of Lincolnshire Police, said the shooting may have been planned.
"The investigation is at an early stage, however the incident does not appear to have been a random offence and I can now confirm that two outstanding suspects have been located and arrested," he said.
The man has been treated at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham.
