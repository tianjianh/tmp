It is the only change in side lying third behind leaders England and second-placed Ireland.
For Ireland, Jordan Larmour switches from wing to full-back with Jack Kelly back from injury at centre.
Fineen Wycherley comes in at lock and Gavin Coombes starts at flanker for the first time this campaign.
Botham, the grandson of England cricket legend Ian and ex-Cardiff wing Liam, has also played for Wales Sevens this season, committing himself to Wales for his career.
He drops to the bench as Lewis-Hughes comes into a side that scored eight tries in beating Scotland 65-34 in Cumbernauld in round three.
Wales began with a 27-5 in over Italy before a 37-21 defeat by England.
Wales coach Jason Strange said: "The most pleasing aspect of that game in Scotland was our style of play, which is our biggest focus as a team.
"We're starting to realise the way we want to play and the qualities we have as a side, so that's something else I want to come to the fore."
Ireland's campaign began with a 20-19 win over Scotland, followed by a 27-26 triumph against Italy and a 27-22 victory against France.
Ireland head coach Nigel Carolan said: "Wales have been going well in the competition, and despite a loss to England, they had a very big win against Scotland in the last round so they will be coming into this game full of confidence."
