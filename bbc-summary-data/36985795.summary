The Independent Paralympic Athletes (IPA) Team will appear under the Paralympic flag and will parade first at the opening ceremony on 7 September.
The team will stay in the Athletes Village, with travel and other expenses covered by the IPC.
A 10-strong refugee team will also compete at the Olympic Games.
"This is the moment to shine a light on the people with impairments affected, as well as highlight the broader situation," IPC President Sir Philip Craven said.
