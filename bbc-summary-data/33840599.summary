Plans to restore a Keighley park to its Victorian splendour have gone on public display.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
National Lottery funding of Â£3.5m was announced for the Cliffe Castle park restoration in 2013, with work due to start next year.
Bradford Council's plans will be on display at Cliffe Castle Museum for at least eight weeks.
People will be able to comment on the proposals which include a cafe, glasshouses, fountains and bandstand.
Created by mill owner Henry Isaac Butterfield in the 1870s, Cliffe Castle and its grounds were donated to the people of Keighley in the 1940s, with the mansion becoming a museum.
The restoration project will see many of the Victorian features in the park, which have been neglected, restored to working condition.
Councillor Imran Khan said: "The Cliffe Castle park project will complement the recent restoration of the Cliffe Castle Museum, recreating and rejuvenating a marvellous asset for everyone to enjoy."
