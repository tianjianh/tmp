[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the refugee crisis continues to unfold around Europe, thousands of migrants are making their way across the continent.

On the Greek island of Lesbos, a man collapsed as he waited to be registered by police outside a new registration centre.
Some eventually made it onto ships chartered to ferry people to the Greek mainland.
After arriving in Piraeus, families were bussed to a local metro station.
From Greece, many make their way north through the Balkans, before reaching Hungary, where Budapest's Keleti station has seen thousands of migrants passing through. Here, a young girl plays among donated shoes.
In the Hungarian village of Roszke, tensions ran high on Monday as a group of some 1,500 people waited for hours at a migrant collection point near the Serbian border to be picked up to be taken to a registration camp.
On Tuesday there were more scuffles as migrants tried to break free from police lines and were restrained.
Later, however, several hundred managed to leave the collection point and make their way along railway tracks towards the town of Szeged, accompanied by police officers.
For many, the goal is to reach Germany, which has said it can cope with large numbers of arrivals but also called for other EU states to play their part.
