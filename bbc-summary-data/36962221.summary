The 24-year-old Egypt international spent last season on loan at the Serie A club, making 34 league appearances.
Salah signed for Chelsea from Basel in January 2014 for Â£11m on a five-and-a-half year deal, and made his debut a month later against Newcastle.
After playing 13 Premier League games, he was loaned to Fiorentina at the end of the 2014-15 season and has remained in Italy since then.
