Former French Open champion Moya, 40, joined Raonic's team in January and helped the 25-year-old Canadian reach the final of Wimbledon in 2016, where he lost to Britain's Andy Murray.
Raonic, who also lost to Murray at the semi-finals of the Australian Open, ended the season at a career-high third in the world rankings.
He confirmed the split on Instagram and said the pair remain "close friends".
He wrote: "Thank you to Carlos Moya for helping me tremendously this year, alongside my team, to get the best out of me.
"Under Carlos' direction and tutelage I have played my best yet to date. We will no longer be continuing our coaching relationship but remain close friends. I wish him all the best."
Raonic also worked with three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe for the grass court season and during the ATP finals.
