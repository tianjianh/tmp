Three men who rescued a six-month-old girl from the River Severn in Shrewsbury have been honoured by the Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS).

The rescue took place on 13 February when the baby's pram fell into the water near Victoria Street.
James Williams and Andy Hill jumped in the river while Mickey Bramall fetched a lifebuoy before giving the youngster first aid.
The men were presented with RLSS certificates of recognition.
Di Steer, the chief executive of RLSS, said they were pleased to hear about the safe rescue of the baby and felt the three men involved deserved to be recognised in some way.
"It just goes to show how quickly a normal activity around water can turn into an awful incident and thankfully James, Mickey and Andrew's quick thinking prevented this accident turning into a tragedy. Well done to the three of them," he said.
The baby was being pushed by her grandmother at the time of the accident.
Mr Williams said: "We heard an almighty scream and shriek, turned around and saw the pram had gone over the edge.
"We instantly turned around and myself and Andy jumped straight into the river and Mickey went to get the lifebuoy."
Mr Williams said it was a struggle to remove the baby from the pushchair because she was strapped in but they managed to get her to safety.
The girl was taken by ambulance to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and has since made a full recovery.
