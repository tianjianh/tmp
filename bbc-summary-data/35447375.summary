The result means that Bolton move off the bottom of the Championship table for the first time since November as they have risen a place to 23rd.
Meanwhile Rotherham have slipped a place to 22nd and fall into the relegation zone for the first time in eight games.
It sealed a fine afternoon for Neil Lennon's side, who were ahead after just 65 seconds thanks to Spearing's opener, and controlled much of the first half prior to Burke's leveller.
Woolery, 21, who made his first start for Bolton in their 2-2 draw with Wolves, replaced Wellington Silva with 81 minutes gone and gifted the hosts a vital win with his first goal in senior football.
Bolton manager Neil Lennon:
"It's a great win and a really important win and it keeps us in touch now with some difficult games to come.
"I'm delighted, I don't think we played particularly well. We have played better and lost games so I guess we were due one.
"That's seven points from nine and that's as much as anyone can have expected under the circumstances."
Rotherham manager Neil Redfearn:
"We were the best side but if you missed gilt-edged chances, it always leaves you open.
"It's a frustrating situation because we are playing well. I felt for them [the players] because they put a shift in and they deserved more than that.
"It's tough to take because we deserved to win."
