Aston Villa have loaned striker Nicklas Helenius back to Aalborg after a disappointing season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old Denmark international signed a three-year deal last summer after moving from Aalborg for an undisclosed fee, but he now moves back to the Superliga club for a season.
He made six substitute appearances for Villa, scoring once against Sheffield United in the FA Cup.
His agent revealed in May Helenius was not in Villa's plans for next season.
