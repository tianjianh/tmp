Park maintained her advantage with a one-under round to move to 11 under par overall, while Great Britain's Charley Hull is tied fifth on five under par.
America's Gerina Piller and New Zealand's Lydia Ko, who was one of two players to make a hole-in-one on Friday, are tied second on nine under.
Great Britain's Catriona Matthew is out of medal contention in tied 26th place.
A round of 66 on Thursday had taken the 46-year-old Scot into the top 15 but a 77 on Friday, a round which included a triple bogey seven on the par four 12th, has left her on one over.
Hull, 20, dropped four shots in her last seven holes in a three-over-par 74 and needs a strong final round if she is to win Britain's second golf medal of the Games after Justin Rose's gold in the men's competition.
China's Lin Xiyu became the first female player to make an Olympic hole-in-one on the 154-yard par three eight - before Ko did likewise on the same hole.
Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn, who led after the opening day, has had to withdraw from the competition because of a knee injury.
