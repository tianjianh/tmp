Prime Minister David Cameron says he will meet the culture secretary to discuss a TV drama about a 1991 double murder in County Londonderry.

ITV's The Secret tells the story of convicted killer Colin Howell and Hazel Buchanan who killed their spouses and kept the deaths secret for 18 years.
The programme has been criticised by the daughter of one of the victims, saying it had left her traumatised.
A Labour Party MP raised the matter in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
Howell and Buchanan are serving jail sentences over the murders of Trevor Buchanan and Lesley Howell, whose bodies were found in a fume-filled car in Castlerock 25 years ago.
Police believed at the time that they had died in a suicide pact, but Howell handed himself in in 2009, admitting that he had gassed the pair with Buchanan's help.
Sheffield MP Louise Haigh said the victims' families were reliving the pain of their loved ones' killings as a result of the drama.
She added that "victims' voices should have a far greater role" in determining whether or not programmes based on real-life events should be made.
Lauren Bradford, a daughter of Lesley Howell, wrote an opinion piece in the Guardian after the first episode of The Secret was broadcast, saying its makers "trivialise the reality of these events and dehumanise the impact that it has on those involved".
She added that victims' families needed to have more rights "over their 'story' and the narrative of their loved ones".
Mr Cameron said he would discuss the programme with Culture Secretary John Whittingdale to see if there is anything "more that can be done" in similar cases.
Actor James Nesbitt plays Howell in the drama, based on a book by journalist Deric Henderson that details the murders and the years that followed.
In a statement, an ITV spokesperson said the scripts for the programme were based on an "exhaustively researched" book by a "highly respected journalist" and that extensive additional research had been carried out.
They said the families of both victims were informed of the production and given an opportunity to see it in advance of broadcast.
"ITV has a proud record of broadcasting award-winning factual dramas, based on or representing real events and people. These include Hillsborough, Bloody Sunday, The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, Appropriate Adult, Code of A Killer, The Widower, and The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies", the spokesperson said.
"We have never suggested that they (the families) approved or authorised the drama. We do believe that we have conducted the making and broadcast of this series responsibly, in seeking to minimise distress to family members, in so far as we were able to do so, given the subject matter."
