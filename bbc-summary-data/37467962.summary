The world number 18, seeded third, battled from 4-0 down in the tie-break to take the first set.
The 22-year-old then twice broke the world number 10 in the second set before sealing victory with an ace.
Pouille has risen from a ranking of 78 this year, and reached the Wimbledon and US Open quarter-finals.
"I'm really happy to win my first title here. I played well from the beginning,'' said the new champion. "Now I can rest and get ready for the China Open next week in Beijing."
