By the close, the benchmark FTSE 100 index was up 0.52% at 6,074.52, having been as much as 1.3% higher at the start.
On Friday, the index fell 2.4% after US jobs data fell short of expectations.
Mining stocks led the FTSE higher, with Antofagasta up 7.4% and Glencore adding 7.3%.
But with US markets closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday, investors were not expecting any lead from Wall Street later in the day.
Shares in AB Foods, owner of the low-cost fashion retailer Primark, fell 0.7% despite maintaining its full-year earnings forecast in a statement released on Monday.
On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.75% against the dollar to $1.5284 and also gained 0.57% against the euro to â‚¬1.3686.
