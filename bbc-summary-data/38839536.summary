Police assessing Kevin McLeod's death in Wick in 1997

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man's death in the Highlands 20 years ago is being looked at again by Police Scotland's specialist crime division.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin McLeod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. His death was treated as accidental, but his family believe he was murdered.
Northern Constabulary, the force that investigated his death at the time, was criticised for its handling of complaints from Mr McLeod's family.
Police Scotland said it was assessing information relating to the case.
A spokesperson said: "Officers from specialist crime division are currently assessing the information relating to the death of Kevin McLeod.
"We continue to engage with the McLeod family and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."
Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP, Gail Ross, has asked Police Scotland whether the assessment is to rule out or confirm crime was involved.
The new development in the case follows discussions between the McLeod family and Police Scotland's chief constable Phil Gormley.
Twenty-four-year-old Mr McLeod's family have consistently criticised police for not investigating his death as a murder.
In 2007, the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland said Northern Constabulary behaved with "institutional arrogance" in the way it handled complaints from Mr McLeod's parents, Hugh and June McLeod.
It ordered the then chief constable, Ian Latimer, to apologise in person to his relatives, which the senior officer did.
