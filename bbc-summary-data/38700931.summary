[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 1-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promotion-chasing Carlisle United saw their winless run stretched to five games after allowing 10-man Barnet to fight back for a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlie Wyke put transfer talk to one side to grab a first-half lead for Carlisle by scoring his 18th goal of the season, but John Akinde replied with a penalty for the Bees after the visitors had Simeon Akinola sent off.
The first clear-cut chance of the game came to Carlisle in the 16th minute when Nicky Adams produced a dangerous cross from the left which found its way to Jason Kennedy at the far post, only for the midfield man to scoop the ball high over the bar from inside the six-yard area.
The home side had a let-off when a snapshot by Barnet left-back Elliott Johnson had goalkeeper Mark Gillespie beaten only for the ball to bounce clear after hitting the post.
Carlisle promptly took advantage of their good fortune, grabbing a 29th-minute lead through Wyke, who prodded the ball home from close in after Josh Vickers in the Bees' goal parried Kennedy's initial effort.
Barnet were reduced to 10 men in the 66th minute when Akinola was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Michael Raynes.
But Akinde brought Barnet level in the 77th minute from the penalty spot after Tom Miller fouled Johnson.
Barnet seemed unaffected by being a man short and Akinde missed a great chance to give them all three points when he sliced over the bar from six yards after a defensive mix-up.
