Outer cladding fell from Oxgangs Primary School's 10-year-old building on Friday during high winds.
Structural engineers were called in to make the building safe but high winds on Monday have hampered works.
Officials will make a decision on Tuesday whether the school will reopen on Wednesday.
Edinburgh city council's head of schools Andy Gray said: "At the weekend structural engineers visited the school and inspected the building.
"Following their visit, remedial works continue to ensure that the entire building is safe.
"This work has been hampered by the strong winds today which means the school needs to remain closed on Tuesday.
"The weather forecast indicates the winds will abate to allow for high level works to take place on Tuesday. I am very hopeful the school will open on Wednesday, however there will be a site meeting on Tuesday afternoon to confirm the situation."
