Tranmere Rovers 0-2 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge's 2-0 victory at Tranmere lifted the visitors above the Merseysiders in the play-off places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half was closely contested, but the Daggers' Corey Whitely put his side in front with a vicious cross-shot that deceived Scott Davies in the home goal.
At the other end, Andy Cook fed James Wallace, who threatened to equalise, but his shot was well saved by Elliot Justham.
After the interval, Dagenham extended their lead inside two minutes. Oli Hawkins cemented his position in the top three of the goalscorer charts when he beat Davies at the end of a fine solo run - his 17th of a productive season so far.
