Jonathan Obika had the best opportunity of a tame first period but he could not put the visitors ahead as he somehow shot wide from six yards.
Home goalkeeper Reice Charles-Cook expertly kept out a curling Obika effort midway through the second half.
Coventry substitute Darius Henderson nearly won it in added time but his volley was saved by Tyrell Belford.
The draw leaves Coventry eighth, two points from a play-off spot.
Sky Blues manager Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: "The result is what it is. I thought it was a decent game of football.
"They're a decent side on a good run of form. It was frustrating that we couldn't nick the game.
"We had a few chances, and a great one at the end of the game. We'll take the point and move on to the next one."
