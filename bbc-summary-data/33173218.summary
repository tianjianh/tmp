Derby cathedral work uncovers medieval secret

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Renovation work to Derby Cathedral has discovered remains of the previous church, long thought lost.

The six-month, Â£670,000 project will upgrade heating and electrics, as well as seeing large areas repainted.
The 14th Century church was demolished and rebuilt in the 1720s and it was believed all trace of the older building had gone.
But builders have uncovered a piece of ancient brickwork which it is hoped can be put on display.
Cathedral administrator Rachel Morris said the building was in very poor condition at the start of the 18th Century and the vicar took a novel approach to securing its future.
"He decided to knock the church down completely, judging it was easier to fundraise for a new building than repairing an old one," she said.
"So we thought all of the medieval church had gone so its quite important to find that.
"We are in discussions with our archaeologist but we would like to have it accessible to the public in the future."
While the cathedral is open on weekends, it is shut Monday to Friday.
In what is believed to be a UK first, this had meant cathedral services being held in a Roman Catholic Church.
