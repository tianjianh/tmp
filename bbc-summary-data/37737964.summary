[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Garry Fleming's equaliser eight minutes from time gave Dumbarton a share of the points with fellow Championship strugglers Dunfermline Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pars had hit the bar through Kallum Higginbotham before Robert Thomson slotted in Joe Thomson's cross for the second-bottom Sons.
Second-half goals from Nicky Clark and substitute Joe Cardle appeared to set up the Pars' third win of the season.
But Fleming salvaged a draw as the Sons stay a point behind their visitors.
