[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia all-rounder John Hastings may be able to play in Worcestershire's opening County Championship game in April after successful knee surgery.

Hastings, 31, tore his patella tendon while playing for Australian side Victoria on 6 December.
Worcestershire had been looking to sign a replacement overseas player as cover for the first half of next season.
"He had the operation on Friday and the surgeon was delighted," director of cricket Steve Rhodes said.
"We know now that if the rehab work goes well, John will be available a lot sooner again to play more cricket for Worcestershire than had been originally anticipated.
"The best possible scenario is John manages to be available for the first game of the season in April - but we are not counting our chickens as it might be slightly later than that."
