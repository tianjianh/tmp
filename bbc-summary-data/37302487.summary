[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire are in a very strong position against Durham as they seek a third successive County Championship title.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 205-4, Durham lost six wickets for 38 runs as they slipped to 265 all out on day three at Headingley, with Jack Brooks taking 4-76.
The hosts, who did not enforce the follow-on, declared on 225-2 thanks to Adam Lyth (114 not out) and Alex Lees (88) adding 185 for the first wicket.
Brooks (2-21) impressed again as Durham fell to 39-3 in pursuit of 421 to win.
Yorkshire began the match trailing Division One leaders Middlesex by four points, although Somerset moved into second place - two points behind Middlesex - with a 31-run win over Warwickshire inside three days at Taunton.
Durham, who resumed on day three trailing by 255 runs, quickly disintegrated, although they did secure a second batting bonus point for the first time in six innings.
Lyth and Lees scored at more than four runs per over and, although Lees fell 12 runs short of a third Championship century of the season, Lyth went to three figures with a six off Ryan Pringle.
Durham lost Mark Stoneman for 10 to Brooks - his 50th championship wicket of the season - for the second time in the match and the same man accounted for Keaton Jennings for eight.
Jack Burnham soon followed for nine, lbw to Steven Patterson, who had spent most of the morning off the field with an injury.
