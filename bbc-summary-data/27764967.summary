BBC Wales economics editor Sarah Dickins joined an economist at a funfair in Rhyl, one of Wales' most deprived communities.
Professor Karel Williams, of Manchester Business School, says devolution has been "something of a non-event" in economic terms with Welsh ministers relying on growth from a trickle down from a booming south east of England.
He believes rather than powers Wales has been lacking in imaginative policy ideas.
"Some risk is justified because the mainstream orthodoxy of the last 30 years isn't working, it's time for a bit of boldness and imagination," he said.
