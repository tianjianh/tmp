Derbyshire police release counter closures timetable

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derbyshire Constabulary has released more information on when it will close most of its inquiry desks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In January, the force said it would cut the number of front counters from 16 to four as part of a property review.
On 12 June, seven offices will shut, with Bakewell and Derby's Assembly Rooms closing the day after. Three more will go by 18 September.
Senior officers said few people used the desks and the move would allow them to invest in other services.
The closures are part of the force's plans to make savings of up to Â£26m during the next five years.
The offices to close on 12 June are Glossop, Matlock, Clay Cross, Bolsover, Long Eaton, Cotton Lane in Derby and Swadlincote.
Ashbourne, Ripley and Ilkeston will close by 18 September, with exact dates to be announced nearer the time.
Only the counters at Buxton, Chesterfield and Derby's St Mary's Wharf and Pear Tree will remain open.
Assistant Chief Constable, Gary Knighton, said: "This will save us a significant amount of money which will go towards keeping people safe.
"The way people contact us has really changed, via the internet, phones and even scheduled appointments."
He emphasised only the front counters were closing and not the entire stations.
