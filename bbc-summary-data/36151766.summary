Tommy's Honour is based on a true story and focuses on Morris's turbulent relationship with his son, Tommy.
Morris was born in St Andrews, Fife, in 1821. He died there in 1908.
Shot entirely on location in Scotland, the film stars Peter Mullan as Morris, with Jack Lowden playing his son. The festival's opening night is on 15 June.
It is directed by Jason Connery - son of Sir Sean Connery, who is a patron of the EIFF.
Other Tommy's honour cast members include Ophelia Lovibond, Peter Ferdinando and Sam Neill.
Producer Keith Banks said the film was a "multi-faceted story" that had universal themes, including the father-son relationship, class struggle and love of a game.
"We are thrilled to be able to first showcase Tommy's Honour to a live audience at such a respected international gathering via our world premiere at EIFF," he added.
Mark Adams, EIFF artistic director said: "We are proud to be staging the world premiere of Tommy's Honour.
"It is a beautifully made film packed with memorable moments and terrific performances and reflects perfectly our intention to keep on bringing great Scottish projects to our audience."
