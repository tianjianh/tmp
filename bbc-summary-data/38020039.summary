[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Incorrect' postgraduate loans withdrawn from 68 students

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Loans were "incorrectly awarded" to 68 Welsh students and later withdrawn, the Student Loans Company has admitted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The students were told they would get funding for postgraduate courses at English universities beginning in September 2016.
One student told BBC Wales he was "devastated" when told of the mistake on the day his first payment was due.
Welsh Education Secretary Kirsty Williams called the situation "totally unacceptable".
The Student Loans Company (SLC), which provides finance for students across the UK, said loans of up to £10,000 had been mistakenly awarded due to "human error".
For the first time this year, the UK government offered loans for postgraduate students living in England.
Many Welsh students who had been following undergraduate courses at English universities applied for the loan through Student Finance England, part of the SLC.
The SLC said 68 Welsh students were told they were eligible and received letters of confirmation, but were informed later the loans had been "incorrectly awarded".
BBC Wales has spoken to three students who had the funding approved in August and September 2016 only to discover later there had been a mistake.
Toby Pitts, 21, from Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire, is studying for a master's degree in King's College, London, after spending three years as an undergraduate at another London college.
He was unsure whether he was eligible when he applied for the loan but his application was approved.
When the first instalment failed to appear in his account he phoned Student Finance England and was told he would not be getting the money after all.
"I was absolutely devastated," he said.
"I think I was very upset, understandably, to begin with and then very frustrated and that sort of turned to slightly more angry at the system that was in place and the way they hadn't even let me know."
Mr Pitts had already paid the first term's rent and was eligible to pay course fees.
He has borrowed money from his parents and taken up a part-time job in order to continue with the course.
"They've admitted they've made a mistake but there's no accountability at all which is really frustrating me," he said.
"All the burden, all the pressure of their mistake, has been put on me as a student which is wrong really."
Another student had to leave his postgraduate English Studies course at Manchester Metropolitan University when he was told he was not eligible for the loan after all.
James Sutherland, 23, is in the process of moving back to his home in Llanfair Caereinion, Powys, after what he said had been a "really awful" time trying to work out what to do.
His appeal was rejected and he said he feels like he had "almost been tricked into wasting a year".
"It's not so much that the appeal was rejected, it's that they don't seem to be taking any responsibility for the difficulties I had," he said.
"If I was told when I applied that I wasn't eligible, that would be fine - I could plan a year, I could find something to do.
"It's more that either they've changed the policy late and retrospectively applied it, or they haven't trained their staff whose job it is to advise students."
The SLC said that to be eligible for a postgraduate loan through the Student Finance England scheme, "students must have been ordinarily resident in the UK and islands for three years prior to the start of their course and most recently in England, for reasons other than the purpose of study".
Twenty of the 68 Welsh students who were approved for the loan received the first instalment of £3,300 but were then told they would not be receiving any further payments.
Another 48 were notified they had been incorrectly approved, before receiving any payments.
Former SLC chair Sir Deian Hopkin said the firm was running an "extraordinarily complex business" involving £80bn to £90bn, but admitted: "Maybe that's not a great excuse.
"It's not surprising that there are mistakes and the company has been, to be fair, struggling to get as good a system as it could to deal with this enormous complexity, which keeps on changing," he said.
The SLC said in a statement: "This occurred as a result of human error in the interpretation of the regulations when processing these applications.
"If a student believes that the decision Student Finance England made in relation to their funding application is incorrect they have the right to appeal."
Wales' Education Secretary Ms Williams said: "We have been in discussions with Student Finance England and the UK government urging them to provide help to those affected and make sure no-one suffers financially.
"As a result, the Student Loans Company has assured us that all available options will be used to compensate those who have suffered financial loss as a result of the error."
Welsh Conservative education spokesman Darren Millar said: "This is inexcusable bungling from the Student Loans Company, whose mistake has scuppered the plans for students already coping with the pressure of not being able to obtain support from the Welsh Government.
"They should be compensated as soon as possible for any losses incurred as a result of this incompetence."
The Welsh Government does not currently offer a similar loan for Welsh postgraduate students but it said it would introduce a scheme for 2017-18.
The recent Diamond review on student finance in Wales recommended postgraduate-taught Masters students should get the same level of support as undergraduates.
