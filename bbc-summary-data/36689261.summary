The 26-year-old forward spent two seasons at Rugby Park but was placed on the transfer list in May, with 12 months to run on his contract.
The former Bolton, Rio Ave and Bury player scored three goals last season.
"We will need big physical players and he fits the bill," said United manager Ray McKinnon. "He's a strong, powerful and quick player."
Obadeyi, capped by England at Under 19 and Under 20 level, has also had loan spells with Swindon, Rochdale, Shrewsbury, Chesterfield and Plymouth Argyle.
"I cannot wait to get started," he told the club website. "United are a massive club and they have great fan base. It was an easy decision to come here. The aim is to be pushing for promotion.
"This move is about playing football. I want a season of games behind me and at a club this size, it's a great opportunity."
