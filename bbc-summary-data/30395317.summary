In October, ministers announced Wales' 22 local authorities would be getting £146m less than this year.
The total block grant - covering 60% of council spending - would be cut by 3.4% to £4.12bn, Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews said on Wednesday.
Ceredigion faces the biggest cut at 4.5%, and Neath Port Talbot the lowest with 2.4%.
Several councils have begun consultations with residents as they decide which services will face the brunt of the savings needed.
Around 25% of council spending is covered by specific grants, and most of the remaining 15% by council tax, the Welsh government said.
