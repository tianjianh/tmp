About 200 people have gathered at a vigil for a seven-year-old girl who died when a bouncy castle she was playing on blew away.

Summer Grant, from Norwich, died in Harlow, Essex, on 26 March.
A two-minute silence was held at Harlow Town Park on Saturday, where candles were laid in the shape of two hearts as Summer's favourite music played.
Her uncle Shawn Grant thanked people for their "huge support" and said Summer would be "sending a huge hug".
Speaking at the vigil, held in the park where the tragedy occurred, Mr Grant said: "It really has brought the whole town together.
"We just thank everyone for their support, the messages, the donations, the teddy bears, just everything really. Thank you so much.
"I've tried to read every message on social media and like them all and possibly comment as well just to give that thanks on behalf of the whole family."
It is believed a strong gust of wind swept the dome-shaped inflatable that Summer had been playing on about 150m (492ft) across the park.
Paramedics were called but Summer died in hospital having suffered multiple injuries.
Two people, a 24-year-old woman and a man, 27, were later arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence and bailed until May, Essex Police said.
