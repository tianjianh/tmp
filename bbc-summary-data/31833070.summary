A range of other drugs in the same class including ketamine and crystal meth became legal on Tuesday after a court challenge.
The new legislation will officially be signed into law on Wednesday afternoon.
It will come into force at midnight meaning many drugs remain legal until then.
Members of the Dail, the main chamber of Ireland's parliament, passed the emergency legislation on Tuesday night.
The Seanad, the upper chamber, approved it on Wednesday afternoon, and now it will be passed to the Irish president to sign into law.
When the law comes into force at midnight, possession of drugs such as ecstasy and crystal meth will have been legal for around 36 hours.
In 2012, a Lithuanian man was prosecuted for possession of methylethcathinone, a substance once stocked by shops selling legal highs.
The government had put the drug on its list of outlawed substances the previous year, along with dozens of others.
The man brought a case to Ireland's Court of Appeal, arguing the outlawing of the drug was unconstitutional, because lawmakers had not voted in support of it.
The court agreed and on Tuesday morning it ruled methylethcathinone was not illegal.
This meant more than 100 drugs covered by the same section of law also became legal, including ecstasy, magic mushrooms, crystal meth and benzodiazepines.
It's legal to possess them but not to sell, supply, import or export them.
Laws relating to older, more established drugs such as heroin, cocaine or cannabis have not been affected.
Ireland's Health Minister Leo Varadkar said the government knew this might happen and had drafted emergency legislation in January.
He warned drug dealers they would be arrested if caught selling drugs and urged people to consider how harmful drugs were before considering taking them.
Newsbeat spoke to Ireland's police force, the Garda, and asked them what they would do if they found people in possession of drugs like ecstasy before midnight on Wednesday.
A spokesman said: "An Garda SiochÃ¡na will continue to enforce relevant legislation. Any person found in possession of a substance deemed illegal under legislation will be subject to prosecution."
