Almondsbury Parish Council is under fire over the future of the Hallen Centre - from which Hallen FC says it is being "evicted".
The council chairman said it had to seek new tenants to run the site who could pay the centre's running costs.
Some of those interested in taking on the lease were prepared to consider keeping the club on the site, he said.
About 100 people attended a council meeting on Tuesday to be told "expressions of interest" had been received from potential tenants who were "prepared to consider an arrangement to include Hallen Football Club".
Council chairman Cliff Hilliker said: "To make the centre viable, it has to pay for itself. We can't, as a parish council, subsidise what is effectively, a football club."
But he was shouted down by villagers who accused the council of having "got rid" of the club's management committee, which resigned last year, by making unreasonable demands in a new lease.
Mr Hilliker said the priority was to get a proper lease in place but the council wanted to make sure whoever took it over "makes it available to the people of Hallen".
The club has used the centre, at its Moorhouse Lane ground, for 21 years but the council said its auditors required it to have a formal tenancy agreement. Hallen FC has said it could not afford to sign a new lease that would have seen it covering more running costs.
It has refused to leave the site and the council wants vacant possession before it can get a new leaseholder.
Lee Fairman, of Hallen FC, said it was good to hear the council wanted the club to stay but he was concerned it was still seeking vacant possession of the building.
