Premier League predictions: Lawro v Death in Paradise stars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponents for the latest round of Premier League fixtures are actors Don Warrington and Kris Marshall, stars of detective comedy-drama Death in Paradise, which returns to the BBC this week.
Their first target is to beat fellow Death in Paradise star Danny John-Jules, who got seven correct results out of 10 to beat Lawro when he took him on 12 months ago.
But Warrington, who plays police commissioner Selwyn Patterson in the Guadeloupe-based show, is also hoping for a Manchester United win against Southampton.
"My heroes growing up were Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best," Warrington told BBC Sport. "But Best was my favourite. He was just a fantastic player."

Meanwhile, Marshall, who plays Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman, is an Aston Villa fan who grew up idolising Gary Shaw and the rest of their 1982 European Cup-winning team, but has rather less faith in the current side.
"It is much the same as the last couple of seasons - we can't score," Marshall explained. "We don't tend to concede too many but we can't score either. That means we will always be struggling and will probably finish 15th or 16th again."
The fourth series of Death in Paradise starts at 21:00 on Thursday on BBC One.
"There will be lots of fun, lots of sun... and lots of murders, with some nice hair," added Marshall.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.
In his FA Cup third-round predictions, Lawro got 13 results right out of the 20 ties he looked at, with two perfect scores for a total score of 17.
He was beaten by both his guests, Dave Beasant and John Aldridge, who played on opposing sides for Wimbledon and Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final.
Former Wimbledon goalkeeper Beasant got 14 results correct, including two perfect scores, for a total of 18, but Aldridge, who famously had his penalty saved as the Reds were beaten at Wembley, came out on top this time with 15 correct results, including five exact scores, for a total score of 25.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
