[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 1-3 Wolves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves moved five points clear of the Championship relegation zone with victory at Fulham, who missed the chance to climb into the top six.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ivan Cavaleiro turned in Helder Costa's cross from close range to give Wolves a half-time lead.
Andreas Weimann doubled their advantage with a left-foot shot from the edge of the box before Denis Odoi pulled one back with a deflected effort.
But Dave Edwards tucked home another Costa cross to seals Wolves' win.
Paul Lambert's side have now won their past three matches to climb to 16th after ending a run of seven games without a victory by beating bottom-of-the-table Rotherham last weekend.
With Sheffield Wednesday losing at home to Reading on Friday, a point would have been enough for Fulham to move into the top six.
But instead they remain just outside the play-off spots with eight games to play.
Wolves were a threat throughout and Ben Marshall forced a good save out of David Button before Cavaleiro tapped in after Costa dispossessed Ryan Fredericks - his first goal since scoring the winner against Bristol City on Boxing Day.
Fulham had chances too, with Sone Aluko and Neeskens Kebano going close, but Weimann made it 2-0 soon after half-time with his second goal in three games.
The home side replied almost immediately when substitute Odoi's deflected shot from the edge of the box looped past Carl Ikeme, but Edwards' close-range finish for this 10th goal of the season wrapped it up for Wolves.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"We started well, we moved the ball and we created some chances, but we made one very big mistake.
"The second half, we tried to take more of a risk, but they scored a second which killed us. It's not easy when you are two goals behind to get a good result.
"After playing well against Newcastle, it's part of football. We believe we can make one step and be in the top six before the international break."
Wolves head coach Paul Lambert:
"On Tuesday against Brentford we were outstanding, but today we surpassed that.
"I thought we played a terrific game, with intensity and a game plan that worked, and we looked a threat every time we went forward, against probably the best football team in the league.
"Helder Costa has been fantastic, I think he had a little spell where he went off the boil, but the last few games he's been at his best."
