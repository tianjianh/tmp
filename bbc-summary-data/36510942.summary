Striker Stamp, 37, will also be available as a player for the east Yorkshire club, who were promoted to the National League via the play-offs.
Housham was appointed last week following former manager Billy Heath's decision to switch to FC Halifax Town.
Stamp played under Housham at previous club Gainsborough Trinity,
"Darryn is a perfect match with Steve and he has that added bonus that he is still a quality striker," joint chairman Steve Forster told the club website.
