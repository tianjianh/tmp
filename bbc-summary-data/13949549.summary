Nigeria profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigeria's media scene is one of the most vibrant in Africa. State radio and TV have near-national coverage and operate at federal and regional levels. All 36 states run at least one radio network and a TV station.

There are hundreds of radio stations and terrestrial TV networks, as well as cable and direct-to-home satellite offerings.
Radio is a key source of information. International broadcasters, including the BBC, are popular. However, rebroadcasts of foreign radios are banned.
Television viewing is concentrated in urban areas. Legislation limits the amount of foreign programming that stations can show, and outlets cannot air foreign news.
The state TV says it reaches more than 90 million viewers. However, privately-owned Galaxy TV, Silver Bird TV and AIT are the market leaders in some cities.
There are more than 100 national and local press titles, some of them state-owned. They include well-respected dailies, tabloids and publications which champion ethnic interests. The lively private press often criticises the government.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Nigeria 111th out of 180 countries in its 2015 world press freedom index. Freedom House NGO says the authorities "regularly harass, intimidate, and attack journalists in the field".
Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, has threatened the media. In April 2012, it bombed newspaper offices in Abuja and Kaduna.
By 2014, 67 million Nigerians were online (Internetlivestats.com). Mobile phones are commonly used to access the web. Most internet users are young, educated and urban.
Facebook is the most popular social media platform; by June 2015 at least 7.1 million people were using Facebook daily. BBC Hausa's Facebook page is a popular destination.
