Northern Premier League club Moors qualified for the first round proper with a 3-0 win at Lincoln United, their fourth cup tie of the season.
There is a gap of 85 places between the two teams in the football pyramid.
"It would have been better if it was at home, but what a fantastic stadium to go to," Ainsley told BBC Tees.
"It's what dreams are made of - a team in League One against lowly Spennymoor Town and what an upset that would be if we make it.
"We're delighted just to be in the first-round draw, it's going to be a monumental occasion."
First-round ties are to be played over the weekend of 4-7 November.
