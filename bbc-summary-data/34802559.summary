[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the UK's biggest outdoor light festivals has returned to Durham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lumiere, which runs until Sunday, features 29 illuminated installations, from giant knitting to a huge 3D whale, splashing about in the River Wear.
A sound and light projection on the facade of Durham Cathedral tells the story of the birth of modern cosmology from the 12th Century to the present.
Thousands are expected to attend the event, which in 2013 brought an estimated Â£5.8m into the local economy.
The festival is produced by Artichoke and commissioned by Durham County Council with additional support from Arts Council England.
