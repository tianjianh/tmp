The teenager will join the Cottagers' development squad for the remainder of the season, having agreed a three-year contract with the London club.
Grimmer became the youngest Dons player when he made his debut against Rangers in April 2010, aged just 16 years, two months and 13 days old.
He made three first-team appearances for the Pittodrie outfit but has not featured during this campaign.
Fulham paid a fee of about Â£200,000 for the midfielder, who was under contract until the summer.
"We received full value on the training compensation side, while agreeing to further add on terms," chief executive Duncan Fraser told the club website.
"We made Jack an extremely good offer to remain at Pittodrie, having signed him straight from school.
We are beginning to see young talent moving south before they are fully developed with the teams they signed for as youngsters
"[Manager] Craig Brown emphasised that he would continue to be developed by being involved with the first team, with a view to him becoming a full first team squad member next season.
"There is a bigger issue for Scottish football here in that we are beginning to see young talent moving south before they are fully developed with the teams they signed for as youngsters.
"It is an issue we shall seek to raise with the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football Association to see what steps can be taken to safeguard our clubs' interests."
