Lee Fox, 35, and Jordan Thomas, 19, both of Abergavenny, died in the crash on the B4598 near Hardwick, on Friday night.
Mr Fox was described as a loving boyfriend and father, and Mr Thomas a "hardworking and loving lad".
Two men, aged 20 and 24, arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving have been released on bail.
Mr Fox's long-term partner Kim Russell said in a statement: "You touched everybody you met, always ready with a helping hand and a joke.
"You had overcome so much these last two years and had everything to look forward to. You may be gone from our sight but you will always be in our hearts."
Mr Thomas's parents Gary and Michaela, said their son, who was known to friends as "Bell", could never be replaced.
"He will be missed forever and always in our hearts. He enjoyed hunting, shooting and fishing and enjoyed life to the full all day every day," a statement from them read.
