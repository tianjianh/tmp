Nigeria coach Sunday Oliseh is mystified by Emmanuel Emenike's decision to retire from internationals.

The 28-year-old striker revealed this week he would no longer be available for the Super Eagles.
"When I first heard about it I made a phone call to Emenike to clarify the situation but there was no answer," Oliseh told BBC Sport.
"It's shocking and surprising because we've worked together in my first four matches as Super Eagles coach."
Oliseh added: "He is part of our rebuilding process and I did not see signs of misunderstanding or issues working with a great player like Emenike."
Reports had suggested Emenike would be left out of Nigeria's squad for next month's World Cup qualifier against Swaziland because he has not scored at international level for two years.
But Oliseh, who succeeded Stephen Keshi as coach in July, insisted there was no truth to the speculation.
"It's a figment of someone's imagination because it did not come from me," he said. "I've not spoken to any journalist about my squad or the World Cup game that will only take place in November.
"My coaches and I have been fully focused on the CHAN qualifier [against Burkina Faso], so I don't know where they got that [plans to axe Emenike] information from."
Emenike is the second player to announce his retirement from Nigeria's senior squad this month, following Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama - Nigeria's most-capped player - who quit after he was replaced as captain.
Emenike made his international debut in a friendly against Sierra Leone in Lagos in February 2011 and was top scorer at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, helping Nigeria lift the trophy.
He made 37 appearances for the Super Eagles and scored nine goals.
