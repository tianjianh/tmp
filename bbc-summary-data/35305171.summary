The Vale captain headed in Louis Dodds' sixth-minute right-wing cross.
Dodds almost doubled the lead shortly after as he shot against the post, while Robins striker Jonathan Obika had a shot well-saved by Jak Alnwick.
Fabien Robert went close with a volley after the break, but Rob Page's Vale held on to secure all three points.
Vale climb three places back up to 8th in the table, while Swindon remain 17th, six points clear of trouble.
Port Vale manager Rob Page told BBC Radio Stoke:
"We were far too sloppy in the second half, not clinical enough. It wasn't the best performance but sometimes you have to win ugly.
"Even on a bad day like we have had here really, we have proved we can still grind out results. Defensively, our discipline was outstanding.
"They have had all the possession. But, on another day, as stupid as it sounds, we might have won three or four nil. Our final pass was nowhere near good enough."
