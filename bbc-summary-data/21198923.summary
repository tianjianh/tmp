But the shortlist is dominated by surprise hit Camille Rewinds (Camille Redouble), which has 13 nominations.
The crowd-pleasing comedy follows a young woman who goes back in time to her teenage years.
Emmanuelle Riva - recipient of one of Amour's five Oscar nods - will be up for best actress at next month's Cesar ceremony.
So is Rust and Bone star Marion Cotillard, who has also been nominated for a Bafta for her performance.
Rust and Bone, about a whale trainer whose life is irrevocably changed by a tragic accident, has nine nominations in all.
They include citations for best film, best music and best director (Jacques Audiard).
Dark fantasy Holy Motors, which divided critics at Cannes last year, also received nine nominations, including best film and best actor (Denis Lavant).
The latter faces competition from Amour's Jean-Louis Trintignant, while Holy Motors' Edith Scob competes with Amour's Isabelle Huppert in the supporting actress category.
Ken Loach's The Angel's Share, Ben Affleck's Argo and Denmark's A Royal Affair are among the titles shortlisted in the foreign film category.
Some 3,400 people from across the French film industry took part in the voting process to determine this year's nominations.
The awards, hosted by actor and former Eurotrash presenter Antoine du Caunes, will be presented on 22 February in Paris.
The Academy Awards take place two days later in Los Angeles, two weeks after the Bafta Film Awards in London.
