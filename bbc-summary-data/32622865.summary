Ely College praised by DfE before 'inadequate' Ofsted rating

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "inadequate" school, placed in special measures by Ofsted, was praised for its "vision" just weeks earlier, it has emerged.

In March Ofsted said leadership, pupil safety and pupil achievement at Ely College were all "inadequate".
But it has now emerged a Department for Education (DfE) adviser praised the "strength" of leadership at the Cambridgeshire academy last October.
The DfE said it had since issued a warning notice to the school.
The National Union of Teachers (NUT) said the differing views of Ofsted and the DfE adviser highlighted how difficult it was to assess school performance.
The DfE adviser, acting on behalf of the regional schools commissioner, wrote to the school saying: "Our DfE visit to the College and meeting its leaders and governors fully endorsed the Ofsted and SEF (self-evaluation form) evaluation that leadership and management represent an overall strength.
"The vision of achieving together in partnership with students, parents, governors and the local community shines through all the college's practices, curricula and procedures."
But Ofsted's inspection in February found leadership and management, pupil safety, quality of teaching and pupil achievement were all "inadequate".
The school, which has nearly 1,300 pupils, is run by CfBT Trust, which oversees 19 academies and free schools.
Cambridgeshire County Council has safeguarding responsibilities towards the school.
Emails from Keith Grimwade, the council's service director for learning, were released after a Freedom of Information request. They reveal he told councillors the Ofsted report was: "One of the worst reports we have seen and is bound to attract a lot of attention."
Inspectors also raised concerns that "some younger students, those with disabilities or special educational needs felt unsafe" and that "some unaccompanied" visitors were not checked, posing "a risk to the safeguarding of students".
The DfE would not say whether it stood by the adviser's judgement.
In a statement, a DfE spokesman said: "Following Ely College's poor reported 2014 exam results, our education advisers informally visited the school in October to discuss the actions being taken to address underperformance.
"The advisers talked extensively to the school about its poor exam performance.
"We have since issued the trust with a warning notice, which requires the school to set out how it will improve standards.
"We expect all schools issued with notices to take effective and immediate action to ensure pupils receive the best possible education."
After the Ofsted report recommended Ely College be put in special measures, principal Catherine Jenkinson-Dix and others in the senior management team resigned.
Despite updating the name of the new head teacher, the CfBT Trust was continuing to claim its most recent Ofsted report rated Ely College as "good" until the error was highlighted by the BBC.
A spokeswoman for CfBT Trust said the error had been accidental.
The trust said its safeguarding team audited the college's procedures after receiving a draft copy of the Ofsted report adding: "The new senior leadership team at the school have begun implementing the recommendations."
Jon Duveen, Cambridgeshire secretary of the NUT, said: "There are concerns at the NUT about the quality of judgements and the consistency of judgements that are not being addressed at the moment."
The regional schools commissioner Dr Tim Coulson is yet to comment on the findings of the DfE adviser acting on his behalf.
