Tahir Nazir, 40, obtained a fake university ID card and trawled the internet looking for student nights so he could target vulnerable young women.
Fuelled by drink and drugs he followed and then attacked his victims, Manchester Crown Court heard.
He was sentenced on Friday after being found guilty of a string of sex offences at his trial in March.
The divorcee from Glasgow hired a car and embarked on a tour of university towns and cities in Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Oxford, Bristol and Cardiff.
The court heard an examination of Nazir's mobile phone found he had conducted internet searches for "high school girls" and "freshers'" week, particularly around Swansea and Cardiff.
In the early hours of 22 September a visitor to a shared house in the Cathays student neighbourhood of Cardiff awoke to find Nazir on top of her "very drunk" friend.
CCTV showed Nazir prowling the corridors of student flats trying doors in an attempt to find victims.
Other images showed him following a student into a building.
He was caught after sneaking into a student house in Fallowfield, Manchester, last November.
Several female undergraduates heard someone systematically going through the house, trying their locked bedroom door handles.
They called police who arrested him nearby.
Analysis of DNA linked him to a sex attack five days earlier at a block of flats in Hulme.
He was convicted of trespass with intent to commit an offence, sexual assault, attempted rape, and three charges of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence.
Judge Martin Steiger QC said: "His campaign involved taking detailed photos of premises where students lived, in particular entrances and access rooms.
"And finally it involved his posing as a student for which purpose he had obtained a highly convincing fake student union ID card."
He said he preyed on "drunken students hoping no doubt that they would not remember or would not complain about his conduct".
Nazir wrote a letter to the judge in which he "apologised to the victims and acknowledged the seriousness of his crimes", according to his barrister Richard Littler.
After the hearing, Det Insp Ian Bourne, from South Wales Police, called Nazir a "predatory offender".
He said: "South Wales Police takes all reports of sexual violence extremely seriously and a detailed forensic search of the house resulted in a DNA profile being obtained.
"This was only identified as Nazir's when, less than two months later, he brazenly committed a strikingly similar crime in Manchester.
"We would like to commend the courage of the victim and her housemates who all gave evidence at the trial at Manchester Crown Court.
"We would also like to thank the other witnesses who played a crucial role in assisting us in bringing this dangerous individual to justice."
