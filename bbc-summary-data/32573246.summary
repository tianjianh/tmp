Floyd Mayweather will go down as one of boxing's greatest fighters, says former WBC heavyweight champion Frank Bruno.

The American outclassed Filipino rival Manny Pacquiao with a unanimous points decision in Las Vegas on Saturday.
The boxing world was unanimous in praise of Mayweather, 38, following his victory at the MGM Grand and Bruno said he could fight on until he is 50.
And former undisputed heavyweight world champion Mike Tyson hailed him "invincible" after his 48th career win.
Tyson believes Mayweather stands alone at the forefront of boxing: "He controlled the fight, he has great endurance, he did a really good job.
"It's his era, his time. He is in invincible mode now - no-one can stand with him at this particular moment."
And he is getting better as he gets older, according to Bruno: "As a boxer you've got to admire him, he's got to go down as one of the greats.
"If you look at Mayweather and understand him and work him out, from 16 until now he hasn't changed in his attitude or whatever.
"I think he can go on until he's 50 in boxing because he's got the secret to looking after himself," Bruno told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.
Former world cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson was surprised by the margin of Mayweather's victory. He said: "He shocked me and shocked everybody because he stepped up another three, four, five levels and shut him out. It was a complete masterclass.
"The whole thing of boxing is hit and not be hit. That's what he did."
Amir Khan, who hopes to be Mayweather's next opponent, told Sportsweek: "It was a classy fight. The mistake Manny made was drop to Mayweather's pace.
"To fight Mayweather you have to stick to your own pace, and that's something a young fighter would do."
Four-time world champion Carl Froch was disappointed with the Filipino: "Was Pacquiao that poor or Mayweather that good?"
"Mayweather was sharp, accurate. I wanted to see more from Pacquiao, I am disappointed," the Nottingham fighter told Sky Box Office.
"I was a bit disappointed with Pacquiao saying he thought he won. You can see when you are getting beat and outboxed. The best man won."
Six-weight world champion Oscar De La Hoya had hoped for a little more action: "Call me old-school but I like the fans getting their money's worth by watching an action-packed fight.
"I'm just not into the boxing, running style. I like jumping out of my seat because a fight was existing."
Former world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan was not surprised by the manner of Mayweather's victory. "Mayweather was much too smart and quick for Manny. Just as I predicted - boringly one-sided," he tweeted.
