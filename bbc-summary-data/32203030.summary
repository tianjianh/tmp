Touring a brewery, David Cameron said his message to Welsh voters was "the plan's working - stick with the plan, stick with the team".
He said the Conservatives were creating jobs across the UK and warned a Labour government would "wreck the economy".
Labour suggested Mr Cameron should tell people depending on food banks the economic recovery was helping them.
Mr Cameron received a pie-making lesson from apprentices.
He said: "There's a very clear choice - stick with the Conservatives, who are delivering jobs and growth and a strong economy - or put it all at risk with Ed Miliband, which means higher taxes, it means more debt, it means more spending - more of the things that got us into a mess in the first place.
"Don't let Labour wreck the recovery and don't let them cut your pay by putting up your taxes," Mr Cameron added.
Responding, during a visit to a food bank in Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: "Maybe David Cameron and Nick Clegg should visit this food bank and tell (people here) that the economic recovery is benefiting them and their families.
"Because people on modest and middle incomes, many of them are still struggling".
Plaid Cymru economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth questioned whether the prime minister was talking about "the kind of economic growth we're feeling on the ground here in Wales".
"Too much economic growth now is based on low wages and part-time work," he said
UKIP's Colin Beckett said Mr Cameron "hasn't done badly on the economy" but on everything else "he's given us promises, promises and promises and he has not delivered".
Earlier, the prime minister was in Edinburgh and Belfast, and will end the day with an election rally in England.
Campaigning in Newtown, Powys, Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said: "However many economists' graphs say that GDP is growing, however many statistics might be published about the economy, unless you feel in your heart that your family is safer, your job is safer and you have more money in your pocket, it doesn't mean much to you.
"That's why it's the Liberal Democrats that prioritise tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes here in Wales and across the UK".
Also highlighting health matters, Mr Clegg said his party had been "at the forefront" of arguing that an NHS under pressure "needs the right resources".
"We've been told by the man who runs NHS England that it needs Â£8bn," he said.
"The Liberal Democrats are the only party in this campaign to spell out where we would find that money, and that would mean Â£450m extra for the NHS in Wales."
