Michael-Ryan Mansfield, 10, was left with a severe burn mark across his neck after riding into the rope near Alderman Blaxill School, in Colchester, on Thursday afternoon.
Essex police are treating the incident as assault.
His mother Kimberley Brand said Michael-Ryan's injuries could have been far more serious.
The rope was tied between a gate and the school railings.
Ms Brand, of the Shrub End area of Colchester, said: "He was very shaken. He is quite little and the rope threw him backwards.
"At first I thought he'd been in a fight. He came in sobbing his heart out. I saw his neck and it has got worse since it happened."
She said Michael-Ryan, who has two younger sisters and is a pupil at Gosbecks Primary School, was still in a lot of pain.
She urged those responsible never to repeat the prank.
PC Esther Butcher said: "Not only is this an act of complete stupidity, but could have caused the victim far worse injuries than he has been left with.
"Whoever is responsible may have thought this was simply a childish prank, but we are taking this matter seriously and treating it as assault."
Police are appealing for witnesses.
