The world number seven pairing beat Indonesia's Praveen Jordan and Debby Susanto 21-17, 22-20 in the mixed doubles semi-finals in Dubai.
They will face South Korea's Ko Sung Hyun and Kim Ha Na in Sunday's final.
Speaking about the win, Chris said: "It wasn't something we were aware of, but it's nice to achieve that."
It was the husband-and-wife team's fourth successive win over the Indonesians, while they will be looking for a first career victory over their South Korean opponents.
Currently second in the Race to Rio [Olympics] standings, the South Koreans have recorded wins at the Denmark and French Opens in recent months, and will start as favourites for the title.
Chris, who won a Commonwealth Games gold medal with Gabby in the mixed doubles at Glasgow 2014, added: "The Koreans are definitely an in-form pair right now, and have won a couple Superseries events recently.
"However, we are also feeling in good form and shape going into the final and the challenge of Ko and Kim really excites us."
Ko and Kim beat Hong Kong's surprise package Lee Chun Hei Reginald and Chau Hoi Wah 21-15, 20-22, 21-12.
The Adcocks reached the semi-finals last year of the season-ending showdown which features $1m in prize money.
Former mixed doubles pair Anthony Clark and Donna Kellogg reached the Superseries semi-final in 2008 and 2009.
Great Britain was represented in the men's and women's singles finals at the K&D Graphics Grand Prix in Orange, California.
Number two seed England's Rajiv Ouseph was beaten 21-19 21-12 by South Korea's Lee Hyun II in the men's final after a 21-18 21-13 victory over Thailand's Boonsak Ponsana in his semi-final.
Scotland's Kirsty Gilmour beat Thailand's Nitchaon Jindapol 21-14 21-8 in her semi-final and will meet China's Pai Yu Po in the final.
