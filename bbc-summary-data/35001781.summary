Nick Warren, 57, got into difficulties as he tried to reach his black Labrador in stormy conditions off Wellington Parade in Kingsdown, on Sunday.
He was rescued by lifeboat crews but died at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital, Margate, later.
Lisa Rogers described her father as "my mate" and said she wished he had thought of his own safety.
Mr Warren's former wife, Heather, said he was her "best friend" and his death would be a "big loss".
