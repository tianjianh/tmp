Appearing at Bradford Crown Court, the Sunderland winger also denied two charges of sexual activity with a girl aged under 16.
The 28-year-old from Castle Eden, County Durham, who has 12 England caps, was arrested in March 2015.
His case is due to be formally opened on Friday.
Kate Blackwell QC for the prosecution said the alleged incidents had taken place in or about the area of Castle Eden and Wingate.
Judge Jonathan Rose told the jury of six men and six women: "You may see reference to this in the press but it's the evidence in court that you will gather.
"This defendant has already pleaded guilty to two offences, you will hear more about them in detail when Miss Blackwell opens the case to you on Friday."
He said they must come to a decision on the remaining two charges.
"It will be for you and only you to determine if he is guilty or not guilty."
Mr Johnson, who was born in Sunderland, began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland for Â£10m in 2012.
