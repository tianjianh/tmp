Watford 0-1 Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An own goal by goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes gave Stoke City a deserved win as Watford were beaten at home for the first time since August.

Gomes was beaten when Charlie Adam's header following Xherdan Shaqiri's corner hit the base of the post before ricocheting off the Brazilian and rolling into the net.
If there was a touch of fortune about the goal, Stoke were full value for their victory against sluggish opponents who missed out on the chance to climb to sixth in the Premier League.
Watford had defender Miguel Britos sent off in the closing stages for a second yellow card after Gomes had saved well from Bruno Martins Indi, while Stoke's club-record £18.3m signing Giannelli Imbula also went close from 25 yards.
There was controversy at the end of a scrappy game as Hornets boss Walter Mazzarri appeared to ignore Stoke counterpart Mark Hughes' handshake.
Watford were unrecognisable from the side that beat Manchester United earlier in the season and had won three of their previous five games.
They had started the day eighth in the table and could have climbed above both Everton and Manchester United, for a few hours at least, with victory.
Yet the Hornets were shown more yellow cards than they had shots on target - long-range efforts from Daryl Janmaat and Etienne Capoue easily dealt with by Lee Grant.
The loss of Younes Kaboul to injury early in the match did not help Watford's cause but questions were again raised about their indiscipline.
Britos will miss Saturday's game at West Brom after his dismissal, while Jose Holebas, midfielder Valon Behrami and Nordin Amrabat were also booked.
In contrast to Watford's petulance, Stoke were organised and disciplined as they stopped their opponents from scoring at home for the first time this season.
The Potters were at their battling best as they overcame the loss of influential captain Ryan Shawcross and fellow defender Phil Bardsley to injury.
Imbula was making a rare start in place of suspended midfielder Joe Allen, yet this turned out to be one of their most comfortable games of the season.
Adam revealed after the game he might have committed a foul just before the winner was scored but Stoke, who were brighter and more creative, deserved their success and are now on a run of one defeat in eight league games.
Stoke City midfielder Charlie Adam on his header which led to the goal: "I think it was a foul really, I pushed him but we will take it - it's a great win.
"They had a couple of chances but when the three big lads come up front for the last 10-15 minutes, you get a lot of balls in the box and that's where you have to be solid.
"We are delighted with that, it's a good three points and we move on to next week."

Stoke boss Mark Hughes on Walter Mazzarri not shaking hands at the end: "I think he just forgot for a brief moment what we do here. You offer your hand win, lose or draw. In fairness, he came and apologised but I think he was told to."
On Stoke's win: "We were a little bit stretched in terms of personnel. I thought we worked really well and made it happen, I think that was the key. To a man they ran and made it work."

Watford boss Walter Mazzarri on the missed handshake: "I was very angry at that moment with the referee and the time he gave at the end. I went into the dressing room and gave Mark my hand. I forgot in that moment.
"But I was angry with the referee for not giving a lot of time and the decisions he gave. You have to look at the whole game - the fouls, the goal they scored and the yellow cards.
"Anyone can have a bad day. And this time, he had a bad day."
Watford are at West Brom on 3 December (15:00 GMT), when Stoke host Burnley.
