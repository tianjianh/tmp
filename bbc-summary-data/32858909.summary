North Kessock celebrates pier community buyout

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Highland village has celebrated one of Scotland's more unusual community buyouts with a ceremony and gala day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Residents of North Kessock, near Inverness, purchased the village's former ferry slipway from Highland Council.
It fell into disuse following the opening of the Kessock Bridge in 1982.
Organisers said at least 100 people attended the events marking the handover of the pier from the local authority.
Jim Prentice, of the North Kessock Pier Group, said it was a "fantastic" day.
The village's last Ferry Queen Evelyn MacDonald, who held the title in 1982, was piped in by her two sons and cut a ribbon to the pier.
Mr Prentice said it was hoped the structure could be put to greater use by visitors.
He said: "We have amenities here that could attract them - the hotel and the shop and the picturesque village itself.
"We get regular visits from canoeists and the pier is one of the few places that you can launch small boats off a trailer."
