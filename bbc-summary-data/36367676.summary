Portsmouth won't 'break bank' over Ben Davies and Danny Hollands deals

Portsmouth will not "break the bank" in their attempts to keep defender Ben Davies and midfielder Danny Hollands, says chief executive Mark Catlin.

Davies, 34, and midfielder Hollands, 30, are out of contract this summer and talks have started to re-sign the pair.
"It has to be the right deal for both the players and the club," Catlin told BBC Radio Solent. "We'll only get that deal when it suits both parties.
"They're both great lads who've had great seasons for us."
Pompey missed out on promotion from League Two following a play-off semi-final defeat by Plymouth.
Catlin said any new deals for Davies and Hollands would have to fit within the football budget.
"You can't be sentimental in football," he said. "You have to move forward and look to improve next season.
"I'm not saying that signing Ben and Danny wouldn't improve us but, financially, we've got a strict budget and it's whether or not we can accommodate them."
