[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A girl accused of attempting to murder a former friend at school was "motivated" by Batman villain The Joker, a court heard.

Another school friend said the girl wanted to emulate the character's self-inflicted mouth scars.
The victim, 15, was lured to a secluded part of the school in Hampshire before being stabbed by the defendant, Winchester Crown Court heard.
The accused denies attempted murder and wounding with intent.
The court heard the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, cut her face on either side of the mouth and turned up at school wearing a bandana on the day of the attack in April.
Speaking via a videolink, the friend said the defendant had talked about cutting her face like Heath Ledger's Joker from Batman film The Dark Knight.
The defendant sent her a message saying she did not care "if they blamed it on The Joker or Columbine, they didn't inspire me, they motivated me", she added.
Jurors heard the witness describe how she saw the defendant walk off "giggling" with the victim. The accused told her that morning she was going to attack the other friend, but she did not believe she would carry it out, the witness said.
The victim only suffered a superficial puncture wound to the chest near her heart when she was stabbed.
The friend also said the defendant sent her a message saying: "If the plan does fail I will say the voices in my head made me do it."
Prosecutors previously told the court the girl was obsessed by serial killers and school shootings and had plotted to kill her mother and brother in the months before the attack on April 25.
The defendant, who is now 15, has pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and possession of a bladed article on school premises.
The trial continues.
