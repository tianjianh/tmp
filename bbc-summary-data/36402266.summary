Probe after teenager in wheelchair struck by Twyford train

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation has started after a teenage girl was injured when her wheelchair was struck by a passing train at Twyford Station in Wokingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wheelchair was stationary and parallel to the tracks on platform four before it came into "multiple glancing contacts" with a passing freight train on 7 April.
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said the last contact pushed the wheelchair away from the platform edge.
The girl suffered a minor foot injury.
RAIB said it would conduct a full investigation focussing on the sequence of events which led to the accident and would consider how the wheelchair had moved into contact with the train.
The girl's mother told the RAIB she had applied the brakes on the wheelchair.
