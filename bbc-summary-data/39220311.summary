Bjelland, 28, has won 23 caps for his country and featured in both of Denmark's last two matches.
He played 90 minutes in the 4-1 win over Kazakhstan on 11 November and the first half of their 1-1 draw with Czech Republic four days later.
The Dane joined the Championship club from Dutch side FC Twente in 2015.
Bjelland is one of three England-based players in the squad, alongside Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen.
