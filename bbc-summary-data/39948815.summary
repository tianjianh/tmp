The Royal Navy said the exercise on a surface ship triggered a fire suppression system.
Emergency services were called to the naval base just after 05:30.
They were taken to the Royal Alexandria Hospital as a precaution. Their families have been informed, and an investigation has been launched.
A Royal Navy spokesman said: "We can confirm that there has been an incident on a surface ship alongside HM Naval Base Clyde this morning.
"A routine fire exercise triggered the fire suppression system, which resulted in a number of personnel inhaling a gas.
"Six personnel were taken to hospital as a precaution; all others were declared fit at the naval base's sick bay."
The Faslane base on the Clyde is home to the UK's fleet of Trident nuclear submarines.
