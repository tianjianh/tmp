The 2010 and 2013 gold medallist was given a four-year ban after testing positive for the diuretic furosemide.
The Professional Athletes Association of Kenya (PAAK) has called for more help in tackling the problem.
"Doping has not been accorded the seriousness it deserves by authorities in Kenya," a PAAK statement said.
The national governing body also banned 400m runner Joyce Zakary and 400m hurdler Koki Manunga, who tested positive for furosemide at the World Championships in Beijing in August, for four years.
There were also two-year doping bans for Agnes Jepkosgei, Bernard Mwendia, Judy Jesire Kimuge and Lilian Moraa Marita.
A total of 43 Kenyan athletes have now been banned for doping and all but three of them have tested positive in the last three years, including Rita Jeptoo, winner of the Boston and Chicago marathons.
The World Anti-Doping Agency recently announced that Kenya has been ordered to explain its doping controls.
