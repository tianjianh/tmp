Hull, 20, will compete alongside former British Open champion Matthew, 46, in the women's event at the Olympics, which begin on 5 August.
Masters champion Willett, 28, and US Open winner Rose, 35, will compete in the men's 72-hole strokeplay event.
"I will be so proud to be able to call myself an Olympian," said Hull.
Rio will be the third time golf has appeared at the Olympic Games, as it returns to the programme for the first time since St Louis 1904.
The top four men's players - Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy - have all withdrawn, citing concerns over the Zika virus.
Rose said competing at the Olympics would be "right there alongside the major championships", but that he could not compare the two.
"If I could fast forward 10 years I would like my career to read, 'Justin Rose: multi-major champion and Olympic gold medallist'," he said.
Captain Jamie Spence added: "Jack Nicklaus is my hero. He said he would walk to Rio to play in the Olympics and I feel the same way."
Team GB's chef de mission Mark England believes the four-person team is capable of doing "great things".
"Britain has a fantastic tradition in the sport and I know the team are excited to be part of a new experience for this generation of golfers," he said.
