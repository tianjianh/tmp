The African Greys also like to trill along to Laurel and Hardy, police said.
Known as Missy and Snoop Dogg, their repertoire of phrases such as "Giz a tickle", "Give us a big fat kiss" and "Hello fat girl" makes them easily identifiable, the Cleveland force said.
Owner Joanne Mason said she "couldn't breathe" when she realised the birds had been stolen.
She said: "The birds meant a lot to me, they were like my kids basically, and obviously when I came in and seen that somebody had taken them, my heart just sunk."
It is believed the birds were taken from Bransdale Road in Berwick Hills between Thursday and Monday.
Anyone who has seen them advertised for sale is asked to contact police.
