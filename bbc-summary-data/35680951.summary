Garcia carded a 67 and Scott a 66 to finish nine-under par at PGA National.
They are four shots clear of American Blayne Barber (69). Halfway leader Rickie Fowler is a shot back after a four-over 74. Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell is three-under following a 67.
Saturday's play went ahead without Jason Bohn, who suffered a heart attack on Friday after his second round.
Garcia briefly opened up a two-shot lead with a hat-trick of birdies from the third, where he missed from five feet for eagle, and also birdied the eighth to move to 10-under.
But former world number one Scott was not about to let the Spaniard out of his sights and followed his own birdie at the third with four more in succession from the sixth to reach the turn in just 30 shots.
Further birdies on the 12th and 13th took Scott three shots clear after Garcia had lipped out for birdie from three feet on the 12th and three-putted the next, only for the Australian to then run up a quadruple-bogey seven on the 15th.
Scott found the water twice on the first hole of the dreaded 'Bear Trap,' his tee shot coming up well short of the green and his third from the drop zone pitching on the back of the putting surface and rolling down into the lake.
However, the former Masters champion bounced back with a birdie on the 17th to regain the lead, before Garcia birdied the 18th to leave the good friends tied.
Scott told Sky Sports: "I feel really happy with where the game is at. Shame about 15 but that's this golf course - the Bear Trap got me today."
Northern Ireland's McDowell is still in contention six shots off the lead but knows he will need something better than his third-round 67 to take the title.
The former US Open champion said: "Anything can happen, but when you have the quality of guys like Garcia, Scott and Fowler at the top of the leaderboard it's tough to expect all of them to come back to you so I'm probably going to have to shoot a low number to have a chance."
