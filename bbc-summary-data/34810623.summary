Moseley Rugby Club to become Birmingham Moseley in 2016-17

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moseley Rugby Club have announced that they will rebrand as Birmingham Moseley for the 2016-17 season.

They currently play in the Championship - English rugby's second tier - and the change comes into effect from 1 June.
The Moseley club name has been part of the history of rugby union since 1873, said a club statement.
"The board felt the name change will assist significantly in identifying the location of the club to the wider public," added chairman Dave Warren.
