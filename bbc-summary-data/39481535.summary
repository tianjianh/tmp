Soldier 'slept next to body' after killing ex-girlfriend

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A soldier slept next to his ex-girlfriend's body after stabbing her to death, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jay Nava told his trial he was "filled with remorse and wanted to die" after stabbing Natasha Wake 11 times in the chest and neck in October.
The 27-year-old does not remember the fatal attack or where the knife in his hand came from, the jury was told.
A defence psychiatrist said he believed Mr Nava, who denies murder, suffered an "abnormality in mental function".
Winchester Crown Court heard Mr Nava, who was a serving soldier at Royal Citadel in Plymouth at the time of the killing, told the psychiatrist he could not remember stabbing 26-year-old Miss Wake, describing it as "all a blur".
Jurors were told the former couple had been arguing and drinking alcohol at her Bournemouth home on the evening of 1 October.
Mr Nava said he could remember hitting Miss Wake after she threatened to call the police, alleging he had sexually assaulted her. She then bit him, the court heard.
The next thing Mr Nava remembered was kneeling over Miss Wake's body and seeing the stab wounds, but he did not know where the knife in his hand had come from, the jury was told.
Defence solicitor Peter Griffiths QC said there was "no issue at all" that Mr Nava had stabbed Miss Wake 11 times and added it had happened "almost in a flash".
Dr Paul Warren, the psychiatrist for the defence, said Mr Nava told him he slept next to Miss Wake's body for "some time" after her death.
Dr Warren told the court he believed Mr Nava was suffering from an underlying narcissistic personality disorder which would have caused an "abnormality in mental function".
Mr Nava told the court there was "no excuse" for what he had done.
He said he "just wanted to get the children out" after killing their mother while they slept upstairs.
He admitted scrubbing the walls, wrapping Miss Wake's body in a duvet and hiding it in the cupboard under the stairs, so the children would not see.
The trial previously heard he was found by police attempting to take his own life at Hengistbury Head on 2 October, when Miss Wake's body was discovered.
The trial continues.
