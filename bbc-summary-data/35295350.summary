A psychologist at Kids Company has been suspended after she was found to have given illegal drugs to one of the charity's vulnerable young clients.

An employment tribunal heard Helen Winter gave MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy, to a client in a Vauxhall nightclub toilet in 2014.
The incident took place when Ms Winter bumped into two clients while on a night out with a teacher friend.
Panel chair Penny Griffith said her behaviour set a "deplorable example".
A Health and Care Professions Council panel suspended her for 18 months and she will find out on 10 February if she will be struck off.
During the four day hearing, the tribunal found all of the charges against her - including letting vulnerable people stay in her flat, testing positive for cocaine and taking MDMA in front of a client in the toilet cubicle at the club and giving her some of the drug - were "proven".
Ms Griffith said Ms Winter's clients were young people with "significant complex histories of trauma and abuse" and so it was particularly important to protect such a "vulnerable and fragile" group.
The psychologist said she would "no longer resort to the use of illegal drugs to deal with problems in her private life", said the panel chair.
The panel accepted she showed remorse and insight into her drug taking and concluded the "prospects of repetition were low", added Ms Griffith.
On the night in question, Ms Winter took MDMA with a colleague, teacher Nicci Shall, on a night out at Hidden club in Vauxhall in January 2014.
Later on that night in the club they saw two of the charity's clients and the events at the centre of the tribunal unfolded.
Her case marks the latest in a series of allegations against London-based Kids Company - founded by Camila Batmanghelidjh - which closed last year following claims it misspent public money.
The charity, now run by administrators, is also being investigated by police in the Met's Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command.
