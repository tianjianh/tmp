The first websites ending with the domain name .lgbt go online

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
.lgbt is now available as a domain name for websites.

The first site to have the address was OutNow Consulting, a company which help organisations on diversity marketing and research.
Pink News, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) news website, and a lawyer who specialises in LGBT issues are also early adopters.
Angela Giampolo said she was "honoured to be chosen" and was "proud to be a pioneer".
Pink News says nothing reflects their content more clearly than having a web address that ends with the letters LGBT.
"LGBT is one of the most defining and iconic [domains] of our time," says Roger LaPlante, who runs the company offering it.
He says the LGBT community now has an "internet address that embraces [their] full breadth and diversity" in a "protected, inclusive manner".
But not everyone is onboard.
In 2013 the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association said the domain would "damage the gay community".
They said it "would bring together the people living the gay lifestyle into a community - as if being gay were merely a lifestyle and not the expression of the essential nature of a gay person, and as if the gay community did not already exist".
.com is the most popular domain in the world.
.uk, which includes .co.uk, comes fourth with more than 10 million websites registered.
The company which manages .lgbt also runs the .info and .pink domain names.
