[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair, believed to be in their 20s, were discovered at the property in Debdale Avenue, Warndon, on Tuesday.
West Mercia Police said it first received a call raising concerns for the welfare of the woman, who had been reported missing, at about 15:00 BST.
Her death was thought to be suspicious, and the death of the male was being treated as "unsuspicious", the force said.
Police said they believed the incident was contained to the property and officers were not looking for anyone else.
Both the man and woman have yet to be formally identified.
Supt Kevin Purcell said the force was providing support to the families of the deceased.
