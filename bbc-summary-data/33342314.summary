[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said that he intends to re-enter politics and stand in parliamentary elections next month.

Mr Rajapaksa lost bitterly fought presidential elections to party rival Maithripala Sirisena in January.
Speaking in front of a large crowd of supporters in the south, Mr Rajapaksa said that he could not reject their clamour for him to stand in the vote.
But it is not clear which party the former president will represent.
Mr Sirisena, the new leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) which Mr Rajapaksa led for 10 years prior to his downfall, has ruled out appointing him as candidate.
The new president won the election pledging full-scale political reforms, but has faced resistance from lawmakers loyal to Mr Rajapaksa in implementing them.
Correspondents say that Mr Rajapaksa's decision to stand may harm Mr Sirisena's hopes for a new parliament sympathetic to his reform programme.
Mr Rajapaksa's decision to stand has been strongly criticised by some of his former party colleagues, and by opponents and human rights groups.
Tourism and Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake said that the people will put his name "into the dustbin of history".
In his speech on Wednesday Mr Rajapaksa said that he and his supporters "will contest and look to form the next government".
He did not say if he was aiming to become prime minister, instead choosing to invite "all political parties to join hands" with him for the 17 August vote.
The BBC's Azzam Ameen in Colombo says at least 80 of the SLFP's 127 MPs still appear loyal to Mr Rajapaksa.
It remains to be seen how many voters will back him.
