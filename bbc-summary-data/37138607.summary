Brentford had taken the lead in the second half when Lasse Vibe blocked keeper Keiren Westwood's clearance before firing into an empty net.
The Owls' David Jones was sent off for two bookings and Vibe was shown a red card for the same reason late on.
After both sides went down to 10 men, Hutchinson headed in the equaliser.
Wednesday dominated the first half as Bees keeper Daniel Bentley kept Steven Fletcher and Fernando Forestieri at bay with a string of fine saves.
Lucas Joao should have put the Owls in front when he managed to fire over the bar from close to the goal line.
After Vibe chased down a lost cause to put the Bees ahead, Brentford were in the ascendancy with Westwood blocking Scott Hogan's deflected shot with his legs.
But the visitors still looked dangerous on the break and finally equalised deep into added time as Hutchinson powered a header past Bentley.
Wednesday move up to 19th in the Championship table with Brentford 13th.
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"That was as bad as we have played in the first half. We were very poor, made basic mistakes all over the pitch and we were lucky they didn't bring their finishing boots.
"They were playing round us far too easily because we didn't press them high up.
"If you give players like they have that kind of space they will hurt you but we showed them far too much respect.
"We told them to get in their faces and once we did, we looked a different proposition."
Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal:
"I am not at all happy with a point. How can I be happy with a point when I counted at least seven clear chances in the first half?
"We have created enough chances in the last two games to win three or four but the way we created them with artistic play and good football was a positive thing for me.
"Even with 10 players we still created some unbelievable chances and I don't know how we didn't score. Then they score from a mistake and we have to accept that because it is part of football."
