[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The largely-desert country presents a cultural contrast, with an Arab-Berber population to the north and black Africans to the south. Many of its people are nomads.
In the Middle Ages Mauritania was the cradle of the Almoravid movement, which spread Islam throughout the region and for a while controlled the Islamic part of Spain.
European traders began to show interest in Mauritania in the 15th century. France gained control of the coastal region in 1817, and in 1904 a formal French protectorate was extended over the territory.
Mauritania is rich in mineral resources, especially iron and ore.
It is seen by the West as a valuable ally in the fight against Islamist militancy in the Sahel region.
Population 3.6 million
Area 1.04 million sq km (398,000 sq miles)

Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz took power in a coup in 2008, and was elected president the following year.
He gained another five-year term in June 2014 with almost 82% of the vote in an election boycotted by most of the opposition.
He is a key ally of the West and neighbouring states in countering Islamist extremist groups.
Mauritania has one of the most open media environments of the Maghreb region.
Internet access is unrestricted, with number of users reportedly exceeding 455,000 by 2014.
