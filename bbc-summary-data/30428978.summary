Rio Ferdinand lifts the lid on Fergie: 'He's the mafia'

Sir Alex Ferguson's famous hairdryer treatment was sometimes so explosive it left his players covered in spit.

"There was phlegm everywhere," said former England captain Rio Ferdinand, recalling one particular changing-room rant.
"It was against Bayern Munich. I didn't agree with some of his decisions and I was screaming in the tunnel.
"I sat down and he came over and absolutely unloaded on me," he said.
Several former Manchester United players, including David Beckham and Lee Sharpe, have revealed in the past what it's like to be on the receiving end of Sir Alex's temper.
But in an interview with Radio 1 Breakfast's Nick Grimshaw, where Ferdinand also tried out his news reading skills, he admitted the Scot has a caring side too.
"He had moments of rage like that, but at times what set him apart was the compassion he's got as well.
"If there was anyone ill in anyone's family he always find time and send flowers."
But it seems Sir Alex, Ferguson, who won 38 trophies in his 26 years at United, was less sympathetic when it came to his players' after-hours activities.
"I was injured in the first game I played in a pre-season game," Ferdinand said.
"Those first six weeks and I was going out because I wasn't playing. Just after I came back he said 'Rio how are you enjoying Manchester?' I said 'yeah it's good gaff I've just been to a few restaurants, a few quiet nights in.'
"He let me finish and went 'listen son, if you want to play for this football club for a long time, cut the rubbish out.'
"I thought, well he's the mafia. Everyone's telling him where I've been, what I've drunk and how much I've paid for stuff. It was unbelievable.
"He probably employed someone on social media when it all came out to make sure he was abreast of everything."
Sir Alex brought Ferdinand to Old Trafford from Leeds for Â£30m in 2002.
But the defender almost never turned out in a United shirt.
"I had offers to stay in London to go to Chelsea, but I needed to go to Leeds and leave London so I didn't go to every party I was invited to. I loved it when I was younger."
"It's different when you've got kids now. You get the fear factor of getting a hangover. I don't want that!"
