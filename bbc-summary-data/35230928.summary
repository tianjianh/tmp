The drugs were recovered in the north-western Galicia region, and are thought to have been be bound for a smuggling ring in the southern Costa Del Sol.
It is the largest seizure in the region for 17 years, police said.
Spain is a major entry point into Europe for drug smugglers from South America.
Giving details on the latest raid, police said "12 people were detained including those transporting the merchandise, who were Spanish, and the sellers and buyers of the drugs, who were Dutch and British respectively".
Of those arrested eight are Britons, the Sun newspaper reported.
Last month Spanish police discovered more than a tonne of cocaine disguised as wood and charcoal arriving on a shipment from Colombia.
In November, they announced the arrest of British man Robert Dawes, accused of running Europe's largest drug-trafficking network.
