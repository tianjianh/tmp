Port Vale have signed Scott Tanser from fellow League One side Rochdale on a deal until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old left-back becomes Vale caretaker boss Michael Brown's fourth January signing.
He follows the arrival of experienced winger Chris Eagles and two loan signings, striker Tyler Walker from Nottingham Forest and midfielder Callum Guy from Derby County.
Tanser made his Rochdale debut in a 1-0 League Two win over Plymouth in 2013.
Having previously been on the junior playing staff at both Blackpool and Burnley, he played 59 times for Dale, but did not feature over the second half of last season and has made just nine appearances this term.
Ahead of Saturday's trip to second-placed Scunthorpe, Vale are 15th in League One and six points clear of the relegation places, following the 2-2 home draw with 21st-placed Bury on 20 January.
