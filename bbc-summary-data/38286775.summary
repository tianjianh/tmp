The PSNI is to investigate claims made in a book about the murder of a former UDR soldier by the Real IRA.

David Caldwell died after picking up a lunchbox packed with explosives at a TA base in Londonderry in 2002.
A former soldier claimed in a recent book that the bombers were under surveillance in the days leading up to the attack.
That claim will now be reviewed by the PSNI's Legacy Investigation Branch (LIB).
Detectives from the LIB are said to be currently investigating more than 1,000 cases.
Mr Caldwell was involved in refurbishing activities at Caw army camp when he was critically injured in the Real IRA blast.
The 51-year-old father of four later died at Altnagelvin Hospital.
In a letter seen by the BBC, the PSNI have written to the DUP MP Gregory Campbell to confirm that a review will take place.
"The book's content is undoubtedly alarming for Mr Caldwell's family," the police said.
"PSNI Legacy Investigation Branch is currently considering whether other material exists which together with the book may create an investigative line of enquiry.
"Unfortunately we cannot give you a timescale for the work at this stage, as it needs to be sequenced with more than 1,000 cases that are currently within the remit of the LIB," the police added.
The PSNI also pointed out that since the original investigation into Mr Caldwell's murder, his case had been reviewed by officers from the Serious Crime Review Team but that "no further opportunities were found to exist at that time".
Speaking to the News Letter on Monday, Gregory Campbell said he was hopeful the investigation would be carried out quickly.
"I would hope that this process can be conducted as quickly as possible given the ongoing pain the Caldwell family suffer whilst they await the conclusion of the process," he said.
In October, members of David Caldwell's family met First Minister Arlene Foster and the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt to discuss questions raised by the book.
Mavis McFaul, his former partner, told the BBC at the time that the family wanted answers.
"It is pretty hurtful that some man knows details about Davy's death and couldn't come forward before this," she said.
"There's evidence the police have (more detail) and they're not releasing it until we get another inquest into the murder."
