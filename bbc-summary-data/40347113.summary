The 28-year-old scored 12 goals last term as the Seagulls won promotion back to the Premier League.
His previous deal was due to expire at the end of next season.
"Last season was probably the pinnacle of my career and I hope now we can establish ourselves in the Premier League and continue to improve together," he told the club website.
