Parashar Kulkarni's Cow and Company "succeeded in exploring serious issues in a way that can make us laugh", judge Gillian Slovo said.
Kulkarni, an assistant professor in Singapore, is the first Indian author to win the award.
The Â£5,000 prize rewards "the best piece of unpublished short fiction in English" by a Commonwealth writer.
Slovo added that the author had "conjured up a large cast and their way of life... and all in a few thousand words".
Kulkarni was presented with the award at Jamaica's Calabash International Literary Festival on Sunday by Man Booker Prize winner Marlon James.
