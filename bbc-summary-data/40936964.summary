[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cyclist accused of killing a woman by ploughing into her in a London street began shouting at her as she lay injured, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlie Alliston, of Trothy Road, Bermondsey, was 18 when he allegedly hit Kim Briggs as she crossed Old Street, east London, in February 2016.
The Old Bailey heard a witness saw the cyclist fly "through the air".
Mr Alliston, now 20, denies manslaughter and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving.
In court, prosecutor Duncan Penny QC read a statement from eyewitness David Callan who said he was walking in Old Street at about 12:15 BST when he heard a male voice calling.
"It made me look up immediately, just in time to see a collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian," he said.
Mr Callan said the crash caused the cyclist to fly "through the air" while the pedestrian "fell at the point of impact".
"The cyclist clattered to the ground further down the road but quickly sprang to their feet and shouted something at the pedestrian... who lay on the ground," the court was told.
Mark Wyeth QC, defending, suggested his client had the right of way as the lights on the stretch of Old Street were green.
He added that Mrs Briggs could have avoided danger by using a pedestrian crossing less than 10 metres away.
Jurors heard the 44-year-old HR consultant suffered "non-survivable brain injuries" and died in hospital a week later.
They were previously told Mr Alliston was using a bike which which had no front brake so was not legal to use on the road.
The court has been told crash investigators had concluded Mr Alliston would have been able to stop and avoid the impact if the bike had been fitted with two brakes.
The trial continues.
