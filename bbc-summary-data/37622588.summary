World record for Queensferry Crossing over Forth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Queensferry Crossing has set a new world record.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The centre tower deck has been recognised by Guinness World Records as the largest freestanding balanced cantilever in the world.
The record will not last long as it will disappear once the gaps between the towers are closed.
The bridge is due to open in May 2017. It was originally hoped it could open by December 2016. The project remains within its budget of Â£1.35bn.
Since last September each 16m, 750 tonne section of deck has been added piece by piece and the central tower deck fan is now fully complete.
Cabinet Secretary for the Economy Keith Brown said: "We can all agree the Queensferry Crossing is a modern marvel and a world-class feat of engineering.
"It's only fitting the bridge has been awarded a Guinness World Records title.
"This world-record breaking structure is all the more remarkable when you consider the extreme weather conditions often experienced out in the Firth of Forth, especially working up above the water between 60 metres and 210 metres high.
"Everyone who has worked so hard and skilfully to build this amazing bridge is a world record beater in their own right.
"It won't be long before the balanced cantilever disappears, when the small gaps between the towers are closed. But the record is still there to be beaten and the Queensferry Crossing will still be the tallest bridge in the UK and longest bridge of its type anywhere in the world."
