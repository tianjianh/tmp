Everton winger Yannick Bolasie will have knee surgery after scans confirmed he suffered serious ligament damage against Manchester United on Sunday.

The DR Congo international signed for Everton from Crystal Palace in a Â£25m deal in August, and has played in every game this season.
Bolasie, 27, injured the right anterior cruciate ligament in the 68th minute of Sunday's 1-1 draw at Goodison.
He now faces a fight to return before the end of the Premier League season.
Bolasie, who spent four seasons with Palace after joining from Bristol City in 2012, will miss his country's Africa Cup of Nations campaign, which starts in Gabon next month.
Before Bolasie's injury, Everton boss Ronald Koeman had previously spoken about his interest in taking Manchester United's Dutch forward Memphis Depay, 22, on loan in January.
