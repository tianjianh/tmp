Dartford Crossing drivers charged twice, says AA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some drivers using the Dartford Crossing between Kent and Essex are being charged twice due to glitches with the payment system, the AA said.

Online payments were introduced on the crossing in November when the toll booths were scrapped.
The AA said early teething problems had persisted and complaints from drivers paying online were not being resolved quickly enough.
Highways England said the vast majority of payments were processed accurately.
The AA said one customer had two payments taken for the same crossing in February. In an email, the driver said he had phoned customer services.
He wrote: "The chap I spoke to had a very poor attitude saying `yeah a lot of people have been getting this'."
Clive Turrell tweeted: "Twice I've credited my account online without it appearing on my account. When you call, staff haven't a clue."
Edmund King, the president of the AA, said: "The new scheme has undoubtedly eased the congestion at busy times but, for some, there is a new concern regarding the behind-the-scenes bureaucracy that accompanies this supposedly high-tech, non-stop tolling."
A spokesman for Highways England said: "The vast majority of the 100,000 chargeable crossings at Dartford made each day are processed accurately and smoothly.
"Given the scale of transactions from time to time errors will be made for which we apologise unreservedly."
