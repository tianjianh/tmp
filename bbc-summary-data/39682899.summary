Defender Tim Fosu-Mensah suffered a shoulder problem in that game and joins a lengthy injury list, which includes midfielders Paul Pogba and Juan Mata.
Swansea midfielder Jack Cork and defender Martin Olsson are expected to return after recovering from respective ankle and hamstring injuries.
Wayne Routledge is ruled out after having a hernia operation on Tuesday.
Simon Brotherton: "Manchester United's push for a top-four finish continues against a Swansea side who are currently two points from safety in their battle to avoid the drop.
"United equalled their longest ever unbeaten run in the top flight with Thursday's draw in the Manchester derby, making it 24 matches without defeat in the league.
"Holding them back has been the frustrating number of draws, which includes five of the last seven Premier League games at Old Trafford.
"Swansea's win over Stoke last week was their first in seven, giving them renewed hope of survival and they have enjoyed some success against this weekend's opponents in the recent past, winning on two of their last four visits."

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on what the squad lacked before his appointment: "I think they missed happiness, they missed trust, they missed belief and they missed this extra bit that brings resilience and brings you fight.
"And [now] they have it, so the group that will meet again on 9 July for next season is a stronger group. The new players, when they arrive, will find a group more ready to go for big things.
"But the reality is we are fighting to win the Europa League and fighting to finish fourth, so let's go."
Swansea head coach Paul Clement: "United have been playing Thursday and Sunday for many weeks now and they have an injury list which I'm sure the manager is not happy with.
"But we know it will not be easy. You always hope when you play a big team at their stadium that they have a slightly off-day and you have a chance."
Swansea need a win but, although they have beaten Manchester United home or away in each of the past three seasons, I don't see them doing it again on Sunday.
