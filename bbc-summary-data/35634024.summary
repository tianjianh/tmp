A man who "violently shook" his baby daughter to death has been found guilty of her murder.

Deimante Driukaite, born three months prematurely, died from significant brain trauma. She also had bruising to her face and body and fractured ribs.
Her 26-year-old father, Tomas Driukas, from Birmingham, denied murder but was convicted at the city's crown court.
Although he called an ambulance when she had breathing problems last April, he lied to medics, police said.

Deimante was treated in hospital but died a few hours later on 1 April, aged four-and-a-half months.
Police said Driukas, from Crantock Road in Perry Barr, shook her because she would not stop crying.
Det Sgt Nick Barnes, from the force's homicide team, said Deimante, who was just 55cm (21 inches) tall and weighed less than nine pounds, was "entirely vulnerable, requiring complete care, love and compassion".
"She had been injured on at least four occasions and had suffered multiple rib fractures caused by her tiny ribcage being squeezed," he said.
"She also had bruising to her face. The force required was well in excess of what would be expected in handling a baby of this size.
"The cause of her death was non-accidental head injury which had been caused by her being violently shaken."
Driukas has shown no "meaningful remorse" since her death, he added.
He will be sentenced on Tuesday.
A spokesman for the NSPCC charity said: "This was an horrific attack on a defenceless baby.
"There is no excuse for a parent to inflict such appalling injuries no matter what pressure they might be experiencing. Just a moment's loss of control can result in a tragedy like this."
