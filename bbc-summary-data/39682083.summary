Acting captain Ned Eckersley led the way with 70 not out as the Foxes reached 200-3 at the close.
Earlier, Colin Ingram made his highest Glamorgan score of 137, but his dismissal marked a turning point.
Clint McKay and Ben Raine ran through the Glamorgan tail to limit their first-innings lead to six runs.
Ingram's innings lasted 230 balls and included 21 fours and two sixes, showing why his return to full fitness after struggling with a knee injury could be so valuable for Glamorgan.
But Leicestershire made steady progress in the evening sun before Eckersley and Mark Pettini accelerated in a stand of 91 as batting conditions remained good.
Leicestershire captain Ned Eckersley told BBC Radio Leicester:
"It was good to put together a couple of partnerships, first with Paul Horton and then with Mark Pettini, because the game was in a tight position, and by no means are we ahead of the game - we're going to have to come back and do all the right things and hammer home the advantage.
"We're looking to win the game, and the aim will be to put ourselves in a position where we can make the call."
Glamorgan batsman Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport:
"It was nice to spend some time in the middle, I learnt a whole bunch in the first season I played here (2015), and I'm trying to use that at the moment.
"With the sun shining the bowlers ran in hard, the wicket was flattish in the afternoon but it would have been nice to get one or two more- we'll have a good rest and come out firing."
