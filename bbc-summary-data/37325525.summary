[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 0-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool's wait for a first home win of the season continues after their goalless draw with Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pools have yet to win in four games on home turf and rarely looked like winning this one either.
Lewis Alessandra, who had already had a shot deflected over, went close after 21 minutes. He tricked his way into the area but cut back onto his right foot and the shot was charged down.
Captain Billy Paynter then teed-up Josh Laurent for a volley but the midfielder could not keep it down.
The game lifted a gear in the second half and Pools thought they had scored when Nathan Thomas netted from a corner, but an offside flag ruled it out.
The Stags' first opening came on the hour mark as left-back Malvind Benning tricked his way forward and tried a low shot which curled wide.
Laurent was denied when his well-struck effort from 12 yards was tipped over the crossbar by Scott Shearer.
And Paynter should have put Pools ahead when he was played in by Thomas, only for the captain to lift his chipped finish over the bar.
At the other end, the dangerous Matt Green bounded in on goal but, as he picked his spot, Pools goalkeeper Trevor Carson stood tall to keep him out.
