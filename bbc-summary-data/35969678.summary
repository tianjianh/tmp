[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors led 28-0 at half-time as Jodie Broughton scored twice, while Vincent Duport, Krisnan Inu and Greg Mounis also went over.
Richie Myler and Willie Mason grabbed second-half tries, while Pat Richards kicked six conversions from seven attempts for a personal tally of 12.
Catalans are now two points behind league leaders Warrington.
The visitors took the lead when Mason's long run set up a free-flowing move for Broughton to go over, but Pat Richards put the conversion to the left of the upright,
Duport jumped over on the left-hand side and Inu set up Broughton for his second, with Richards converting both tries.
The hosts had a try overturned for a knock-on before Inu jumped first to a high-dropping ball for the visitors' fourth try and Mounis took advantage of poor Hull defending to score.
Richards added the extras on each occasion as Catalans opened up a 28-point lead.
Myler crashed over from close range for the first try of the second half, before things got worse for the hosts when Ben Cockayne was sin-binned for a professional foul.
Mason placed the ball on the line for a seventh try, while Tony Gigot had a try disallowed for a double movement.

Hull KR coach James Webster:
"This was a game too far for us. I know the other teams have had the same number of games in the same number of days, but we started below them.
"We've been up for the other games, but the dam burst for us. Some of the players haven't been in the environment before because they have been playing for West Hull or the under-19s.
"We now have nine days to prepare for the cup game against Oldham which will give us time to do some training on the pitch which we haven't been able to do lately."
Catalans Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"We have a good squad. I have never been worried about what people say about us.
"We want to keep on working hard for each other. Consistency is the key.
"We defended very well as a team. We are getting better and better and so is our technique.
"In the past we have been described as an offensive team but after the last two weeks I am glad to say we are a very good defensive team too."
