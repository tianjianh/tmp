Sri Lanka v England: Eoin Morgan fined for England's slow over rate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eoin Morgan has been fined 20% of his match fee for a slow over rate in England's one-day international defeat by Sri Lanka in Colombo on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stand-in captain faces a ban if found guilty of a similar offence in the next 12 months.
The rest of England's players were fined 10% of their fee after the fourth match of the seven-game series, which Sri Lanka now lead 3-1.
Morgan, 28, was acting as skipper in place of the banned Alastair Cook.
Cook was serving a one-match suspension for previous slow over rates in Sunday's six-wicket defeat.
