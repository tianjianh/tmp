[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former south Wales coking oven workers win day in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of former National Coal Board (NCB) coke workers have been told they can launch a legal challenge for compensation over illnesses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 350 workers and their families from south Wales, south Yorkshire and north Derbyshire claim dust and fumes led to ill health.
A judge at the High Court in London ruled on Tuesday that a group compensation case can go ahead.
The coking ovens were used to purify coal for iron and steel makers.
At its height, the coking industry in Wales extended to 13 plants, mostly in south Wales, and one in Shotton in Flintshire.
The ex-NCB workers are taking their case against the UK government, Coal Products Ltd and National Smokeless Fuels Ltd.
A separate compensation claim is also being lodged by workers who say they developed similar illnesses while working at British Steel coking ovens.
The High Court heard claimants have suffered from asthma, as well as skin and lung cancer.
The hearing was told that one of the issues for the judge who hears the case will be to decide whether their conditions were caused in the workplace or from cigarette smoking and whether the defendants had taken all reasonable steps to reduce exposure.
The next stage of the process will be to appoint a judge to hear the claims, with a case management hearing in November.
