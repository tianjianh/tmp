Workers at a juice-making factory in Somerset are staging a strike over sick pay and shift pattern changes.

Unite said its members at Refresco Gerber, in Bridgwater, were "angry" and "feel betrayed" by planned cuts.
The action is the first of 11, 36-hour strikes planned to take place over the next 10 weeks.
A Refresco Gerber spokesman said they were disappointed about the action as they had "worked hard to protect jobs and pay levels".
The juice maker produces supermarket-brand products for Waitrose, Asda and Tesco, and works with other brands including Innocent, Del Monte and Ocean Spray.
Unite said the strikes followed "a refusal by the company to fully negotiate the introduction of cuts to shift and sick pay and the imposition of new shift patterns".
The first stoppage began at 06:45 GMT and will last until 19:00 GMT on Wednesday.
The union said up to 430 members were expected to take part.
Roy Winter, from the union, said: "Loyal staff who have worked hard to make Refresco Gerber Europe's biggest juice manufacturer feel betrayed by plans to railroad through cuts to their pay, terms and conditions.
"They are angry that their modest working conditions are being torn up in a bid to squeeze every last drop of profit out of them."
However, the firm said it had spent four months negotiating with Unite which, on two occasions, had recommended its members accept the new terms.
It said the changes were necessary to remain competitive and secure the future of the business in the long-term.
"Over the last couple of months we have held positive one-on-one discussions with team members and 95% have chosen to accept the new employment terms. The majority of the workforce just wants to get on with the job in hand," said a spokesman.
