'Temporary' bank cash to be protected, Bank of England says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People who have large amounts of money in their bank accounts "temporarily" will be soon protected in the event of their bank going bust.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bank of England has announced that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is to be extended.
Until now, only the first Â£85,000 in an account has been protected by the guarantee.
But from 3 July, anyone who has up to Â£1m in their account for up to six months could also get compensation.
This could include people who have a lot of money in the bank because they have just sold a house - or who have received pay-outs as a result of "life events".
The following groups of people could also benefit:
Anyone claiming compensation under the new rules will have to prove to the FSCS that they had money in the bank temporarily.
The rule change follows a consultation by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which began in October 2014.
