Australia's ambassador to Indonesia has returned to Jakarta, five weeks after he was recalled in protest over the execution of two Australians.

Paul Grigson returned to Jakarta on Monday, the Australian government said.
His removal was the first time Australia had recalled an ambassador in response to the execution of its nationals by a foreign government.
Convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed by firing squad on 29 April.
At the time, Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the execution as "cruel" and "unnecessary".
Ministerial visits from Australia to Indonesia were also suspended in April but the government on Wednesday did not say if this decision had also been reversed.
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said in April the recall was intended "to register our displeasure at the way our citizens have been treated".
Chan and Sukumaran were the ringleaders of a 2005 plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin from Indonesia to Australia. They were arrested in Bali - along with seven others who received long jail terms - and sentenced to death.
As the execution neared a campaign was mounted by Australian officials to save Chan and Sukumaran, who had reportedly rehabilitated during their decade behind bars in Indonesia.
Several high-profile Australian politicians also appealed to Indonesia to spare their lives.
But Indonesian Attorney General Muhammad Prasetyo defended the executions, saying his country was fighting a "war" on drugs. President Joko Widodo also turned down clemency requests.
The impact of the recall was played down by Indonesian officials and last month Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said he expected Mr Grigson back within weeks.
"In one month they will be sent back to Jakarta," he said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Chan and Sukumaran were among eight people from several countries executed by firing squad on the prison island of Nusakambangan.
Brazil's government also expressed its "deep dismay" at the execution of one of its citizens, Rodrigo Gularte.
But the execution of a Philippine woman, Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, was called off at the last minute.
