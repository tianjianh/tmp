Birds back at Loch Garten for ninth season together

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two ospreys have returned to a wildlife reserve in the Highlands for their ninth breeding season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Female EJ and male Odin are the most successful breeding pair at RSPB Scotland's Loch Garten site near Grantown on Spey.
Over previous seasons 17 of their chicks have fledged.
EJ, who is 20-years-old this year, has been visiting the loch for 15 years and has reared 25 chicks over that time with Odin and other males.
Ospreys migrate from west Africa to Scotland to breed and can be seen hunting for fish from rivers and lochs.
