Gerrard, 34, plays his last game at Anfield on Saturday, against Crystal Palace, before joining Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy in June.
"It is not the only regret, I think it is the biggest," former England skipper Gerrard told Football Focus.
"I would love to say that I have got the full collection, it would be the icing on the cake."
Having made more than 700 appearances over 17 seasons, Gerrard ends his association with the Reds this summer, admitting his exit has "happened maybe slightly quicker" than he thought.
Last season, Liverpool could have clinched their first title since 1990 but fell two points short of eventual champions Manchester City, with Gerrard's slip against Chelsea contributing to a 2-0 defeat.
"You are always going to have incredible moments and you are also going to have some cruel lows as well," said Gerrard.
"I also look at other FA Cup finals that I have missed out on and the second Champions League final in 2007.
"Nobody's journey ever goes smoothly, mine certainly hasn't, but I am certainly proud of it and I wouldn't change it for anything."
Gerrard, who has signed an 18-month deal to play in the USA, leaves Liverpool having won the Champions League, Uefa Cup, two FA Cups and three League Cups.
"I think it will be emotional. I think it will be worst at the end of the game," added Gerrard, who is scheduled to play his final game for Liverpool at Stoke on Sunday, 24 May.
"I realise that come the end of the game when it is time to say goodbye to the supporters for the last time the emotions are going to kick in for real.

"I have never been in this situation before so I don't really know what it is going to be like.
"I want to try and manage it, try and control it but I also want the opportunity to say thanks to the people who have supported me for a long time."
