Alex Revell put the hosts ahead when he headed in Jonny Williams' right-wing cross in to the bottom corner.
Town midfielder Philip Billing was sent off only four minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute for a challenge on Jake Forster-Caskey.
But Wells collected Mark Hudson's header from Tommy Smith's long pass to lob the ball in and secure a point.
The result means the Dons stay 22nd in the Championship, six points above the relegation zone.
Karl Robinson's side created much the better of the chances, with Josh Murphy firing a pair of free-kicks wide in the second half.
The Terriers improved late on, and Wells scored his fourth goal in five games to extend their unbeaten run to three games.
MK Dons manager Karl Robinson:
"We could have been two points above the relegation zone if we had lost and Rotherham won. As it happens, rather than two we are six.
"I'm sorry if people are thinking 'why is he being so positive, the second half was rubbish' - the second half wasn't rubbish. We were nervous.
"Not many people know what it is like as a professional to be in an industry where there is nervous energy flying around. I back my players to the hilt - they were a bit nervous but everybody was."
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
"It feels positive. The first half was one of the worst we have played together - we didn't do anything we had spoken about before. We missed our fighting attitude completely.
"The reaction was great, especially with us going down to 10 men so quickly after half-time.
"We stayed in the game and sometimes it isn't negative when you get a red card because everyone comes closer together.
"It was a foul of course and a yellow card but not a red. We will appeal and see what happens."
