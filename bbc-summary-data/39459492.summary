An articulated lorry has been freed after becoming stuck for several hours in Cardiff city centre on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vehicle, which had been making a delivery, became wedged at the junction of Crockherbtown Lane and Park Place, close to the New Theatre.
After getting assistance, the driver was able to eventually manoeuvre the lorry free.
A Cardiff council spokesman said: "This wasn't your normal three-point-turn, it was more like a 23 point-turn".
There was no damage to the nearby buildings or disruption to traffic on major roads.
