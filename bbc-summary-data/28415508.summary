Net profit rose to $335m (Â£196m) for the period, up from $222m a year ago,
EA has also benefitted from the launch of gaming consoles, which has driven up demand for its video game titles.
However, the firm said it was delaying the launch of its title Battlefield Hardline from October to early 2015.
It said it was looking to make improvements to the game based on user suggestions and feedback on the test version.
Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the firm, said in a statement the firm was "testing and implementing several new features that will help to make Battlefield Hardline a game that players can enjoy for many years to come".
The firm also reported that its revenue from gaming on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, rose 18% to $120m during the period.
A large part of that growth was driven by the so-called "freemium" model - which offers free content but then charges users for additional digital goods.
EA said $105m of its mobile revenue during the period "comprised of digital extra content and advertising revenue, reflecting the shift to the freemium business model".
That was up 39% from a year ago.
"We continue to view mobile as a business with tremendous opportunity as the market is experiencing significant global growth in smartphones and tablets," Blake Jorgensen, chief financial officer of the firm said.
Meanwhile, its full game PC and console downloads were up 90% from a year ago to $71m.
