The Britain and his Brazilian partner, who are seeded second, beat Treat Huey and Max Mirnyi 6-4 7-5 at the O2 Arena.
The match ended on a disputed line call with Scotland's Murray challenging after a Mirnyi mis-hit was called in - replays showed the ball was out.
"I was not going to get bad, having maybe lost the match and not challenged that call," said Murray.
Earlier on Sunday, the Bryan brothers Bob and Mike defeated Marcelo Melo and Ivan Dodig 7-6 (7-3) 6-0.
The Americans will play Murray and Soares on Tuesday in their second matches in the Edberg/Jarryd group.
Murray and Soares are in contention to end 2016 as the number one doubles team in the world, but must overhaul French duo Nicolas Mahout and Pierre-Hugues Herbert.
"Our goal is just to try to win when we step on the court this week," said Murray.
"If it ends up that we're the number one team, that will be a huge achievement for us.
"If it doesn't work out that way, we'll still have had a great year, lots to be proud of, lots to look forward to going into 2017."
