[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fife-based interior fittings firm Havelock Europa has announced plans to shed about 50 jobs as part of a major shake-up.

The proposal, which affects 10% of the workforce, follows a review of the business led by new chief executive David Ritchie.
Havelock has also sold off its educational supplies arm Teacherboards.
The Kirkcaldy-based firm said the changes were designed to "right-size" the business.
It also said it was responding to the findings of a survey of existing and potential customers.
Mr Ritchie stressed that while clients were satisfied with Havelock's products, there were "one or two areas we have to polish up in terms of how we provide the service".
Havelock has been struggling in the face of reduced activity in retail, education and financial services.
Last year group revenue fell by more than £6m to £83.4m
Havelock's client list has included high street names such as Lloyds Banking Group, Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Primark, Virgin Money and House of Fraser.
It also operates in the education and healthcare sectors.
In a trading statement, the company reported that it expected results for this year to be "materially below previous guidance".
It said Mr Ritchie's review, launched after he joined in May, had identified "the need for immediate change".
The shake-up is expected to deliver annualised cost savings of £3m.
Other steps include the sale of Yorkshire-based Teacherboards to Sundeala Limited for a total of nearly £1.4m.
The cash will be used to reduce the group's net debt, which stood at £3.1m at the end of June.
Mr Ritchie said: "Our customer survey and review of the business demonstrates that these changes are necessary.
"We are rebasing the business to reflect the more competitive market place.
"No decision to reduce jobs is ever taken lightly, and we will do everything possible to support those colleagues affected.
"I am confident that the sale of our non-core business brings more focus to the group as a whole.
"The simplified business model will enable us to maximise the customer experience and allow us to continue to diversify our customer base and achieve future growth."
