Under the  City Deal scheme, certain powers are devolved from central government to local authorities.
The agreement will see £10m of funding provided to develop training courses for the renewable energy sector.
Minister for Cities Greg Clark described the deal as a "great breakthrough for the area".
Other initiatives include bringing business support services together in one place and simplifying and speeding up the planning process for major developments around the Humber Estuary.
Mr Clark said training workers was the key to attracting new businesses to the area.
He said: "What this City Deal is about is the businesses around the Humber, the councils around the Humber planning for the long term.
"What they're saying is that we now are are confident of attracting some pretty important employers to the area."
"But what we need to make sure is that they're going to have the workforce with the skills to be able to employ."
The region is awaiting final decisions on two multimillion pound renewable energy developments on both banks of the Humber Estuary.
Able UK is planning to spend £450m in Immingham building an international centre for renewable energy industries.
In Hull, plans have been approved for a £210m "Green Port" in the city's docks to manufacture and install offshore wind turbines.
