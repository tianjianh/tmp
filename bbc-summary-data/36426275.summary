Officers said the 75-year-old from New Forest was tricked into believing she was speaking to the Halifax fraud squad who said there had been fraudulent activity on her account.
She was asked to withdraw cash for collection from her home and to transfer money into another account.
Police have urged residents in the area to be vigilant.
Det Con Dave Wheeler said the victim was left feeling "very upset" and "shocked" by the incident which took place between February and May.
"Often victims are left feeling embarrassed and ashamed that they have fallen for these scams, but the fraudsters can be very convincing and will prey on those who they consider to be potentially vulnerable", he said.
Anyone who receives a suspicious call is urged not to give any details to the caller and contact the police, the force said.
