A judge told Mold Crown Court on Thursday that Malcolm Donaldson, 74, was "on the look out" for a victim.
Donaldson, of Caernarfon, was convicted of rape in February - he told the jury he was at home when the 24-year-old victim was attacked in Prestatyn.
The woman woke up semi-naked in a field with no memory of the attack. Donaldson's DNA was found on her body.
In a victim impact statement read out from behind a screen in court, the woman said she tried to kill herself after being raped.
She added: "It is something I am going to have to live with for the rest of my life.
"I can't see any future for myself. He has ripped my life apart."
The supermarket trolley collector claimed to be at home in bed when the woman was raped as she walked from her home to her boyfriend's house.
Mr Justice Wyn Williams said the description of the defendant as a predator was appropriate.
