The stand-off suffered the injury to his left knee playing for NRL side St George Illawarra Dragons during their defeat by Sydney Roosters on Tuesday.
The 28-year-old had been named in coach Wayne Bennett's 20-man squad on Monday for the game in Sydney on 6 May.
Scans showed "significant damage to the medial collateral ligament".
"For the next two weeks he will be in a brace," added St George Illawarra's head of athletic performance Nathan Pickworth.
"After those two weeks, we'll have a good indication of his return-to-play time frame but hopefully it will be somewhere around the six-week mark."
