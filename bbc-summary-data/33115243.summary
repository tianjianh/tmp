Martese Johnson was filmed being arrested near the University of Virginia where he is a student.
The video shows him pinned to the ground with blood streaming from his face as he accuses the police of racism.
Prosecutors said "the interest of justice is best served" by dropping the charged of drinking underage.
Speaking at press conference on Friday, Mr Johnson said he was "ecstatic" that the charges had been dismissed, and that the incident invigorated a desire to work for social justice.
The Virginia governor called for an inquiry following the arrest of the 20 year-old Chicago native by agents of the Alcoholic Beverage Control department (ABC).
The arresting officers are on desk duty until the review of the ABC is complete.
