It was to prove a baptism of fire for O's interim manager Andy Edwards, who stood in after Andy Hessenthaler was sacked on Monday.
With only 20 seconds on the clock, Orient captain Robbie Weir lunged in with a heavy tackle on Ben Purrington and was shown a red card by referee Charles Breakspear.
On 12 minutes, the table-toppers took the lead when David Goodwillie slipped a free-kick past a static home defence for Spencer to run on and slide the ball past keeper Alex Cisak.
Then O's midfielder Liam Kelly limped out of the game with an injury before Orient's problems were further compounded when their debutant defender Jens Janse saw red after being adjudged to be the last man when he brought down Jake Jervis.
The home side showed battling qualities against an Argyle outfit for whom Graham Carey was an influential playmaker.
However, the visitors failed to add to the slender advantage as Cisak parried away a Carey effort and then saved a close-range shot by Spencer.
Early in the second period, Nigel Atangana, who had replaced Kelly, was himself substituted after suffering a leg injury.
The one-way traffic continued after the break as the heroic Cisak prevented the visitors causing further damage producing outstanding saves from Spencer and Carey while a number of other Plymouth opportunities went sailing wide of the goal.
Argyle finally found the target again with six minutes of normal time remaining when Spencer crossed for substitute Donaldson to tuck the ball home from close range.
