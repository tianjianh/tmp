Police have returned to the scene of an attempted bomb attack on a police officer in Eglinton, near Londonderry, to appeal for information.

A bomb was found under a PSNI officer's car at Glenrandel on 18 June.
On Wednesday night, officers mounted checkpoints at various parts of the village and spoke to motorists and residents.
Leaflets with "detailed appeal points" were handed out to anyone who spoke to police.
The officer leading the investigation, Det Ch Insp Gareth Talbot, said: "It is surprising just how many people were out and about in the early hours of Thursday, 18 June in Eglinton.
"We want to make sure we have spoken to each and every one of them to ensure every possible piece of information has been fed into our investigation.
"This was an attempt to kill a police officer and his family. It also posed a risk to other residents and caused considerable disruption and upset to the local community."
He said police want to speak to anyone who saw individuals or vehicles in the Glenrandel area of Eglinton between midnight and 03:00 BST on Thursday 18 June.
"We are also interested in hearing from anyone who noticed anything unusual or suspicious in Glenrandel in the two weeks before 18 June," he added.
"Our inquiries are continuing. Five arrests have been made, vehicles seized and properties searched in various parts of Northern Ireland and in the Republic.
"We have conducted a trawl of CCTV and are continuing to liaise with colleagues in An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na [Irish police]."
The wife of the officer targeted is also a member of the PSNI.
A neighbour of the police officers said that the policewoman disturbed someone outside her house by knocking the window.
All five people arrested over the attack have since been released without charge.
