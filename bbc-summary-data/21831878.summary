New protection planned for historic Scottish shipwrecks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven sites of historic shipwrecks off Scotland could be given new protected status.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vessels involved include Dutch and Danish ships lost in Shetland's Out Skerries in the 1600s.
Also listed are what may be the 17th Century Scottish warship the Swan, off Mull, and a boat used to attack Lochaber's Mingary Castle in 1644.
The Scottish government has proposed making the sites Historic Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).
The sites are currently safeguarded by the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973.
Under the government's plans the wrecks' protection would transfer to the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. It would be the first time the MPA powers of this Act have been used.
The protection afforded by the Historic MPA designation can be used to safeguard individual wrecks of national importance, or a group of sites such as an important fleet anchorage or a battle site.
Historic Scotland and Marine Scotland worked with other organisations to draw up the list of seven sites.
Public views have now been sought on the proposals which involve the following wrecks:
Culture and External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the new protection could help people learn more about the wrecks.
She said: "It is important to safeguard our most important underwater heritage sites in the seas around Scotland so that they can be valued and enjoyed and I am pleased to announce our first Historic MPAs as a first step to achieving that aim.
"Historic MPAs provide protection based on the principle of sustainable use.
"We hope that visitors will have more opportunities to enjoy these sites on a 'look but don't touch' basis, and will also gain a better understanding of the importance of our marine heritage."
