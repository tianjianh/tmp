Dunbar Street Art Trail are holding the competition in Dunbar on Saturday 22 April to celebrate Earth Day.
The winner will be invited to participate in the World Stone Stacking Championships held annually in Llano, Texas.
The competition will feature four categories, including a children's competition.
James Page, Dunbar Street Art Trail co-founder, said: "Stone stacking is both art and meditation, using free materials found on beaches and in parks.
"You can create temporary artistic monuments for passers-by to enjoy."
Fellow co-founder Steven Hill said: "The importance of street art in our society is to bring attention and focus to art forms in a free and accessible way.
"Stone stacking is ideal because it's not only free to watch but it's free to try."
