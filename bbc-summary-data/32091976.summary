[SN]TITLE[SN]
Booze banned on Saturday Middlesbrough to York trains

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have issued a ban on rail travellers drinking or carrying alcohol on morning train services between Middlesbrough and York.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
British Transport Police are enforcing the dry trains following complaints of alcohol-fuelled anti-social behaviour.
Officers also said it would stop so-called "pre-loading" drinking before people reached their destination.
The prohibition applies on the Saturday 09:28, 10:28 and 11:28 services from Middlesbrough.
The 12:28 service is also subject to the same restriction.
Chief Inspector Derek O'Mara said: "There has been a noticeable increase in the number of complaints from passengers who have been travelling on these services.
"We have also seen an increasing trend of large groups of people from Teesside travelling down to York for the day to visit pubs and bars then returning in the early evening.
"A number of these people are pre-loading or bringing large quantities of alcohol with them to consume on the train prior to their arrival in York.
"Trains are not extensions of bars and clubs, they are used by everyone including families, young people and the elderly.
"Other passengers do not want to travel and be subjected to the drunk, intoxicated and often intimidating behaviour of others under the influence of alcohol."
