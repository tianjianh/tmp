Ben Turner: Cardiff defender could miss rest of season

Cardiff's Ben Turner could miss the rest of season with an ankle injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The centre-back, 26, injured ligaments in last weekend's 2-1 FA Cup loss at home to Reading and the Bluebirds fear he will be sidelined for 10-12 weeks.
Cardiff manager Russell Slade said: "He is devastated, especially as he worked so hard to get over the double ankle injury he had in the summer."
The Bluebirds could rush Bruno Ecuele Manga back into action for Saturday's Championship game against Derby County.
Ecuele Manga only returned on Thursday from African Cup of Nations duty with Gabon.
Turner's absence could also have implications for Cardiff before the transfer window closes on Monday night.
Slade hopes to make one or two more additions, adding: " I have been looking for a leader type in the window anyway.
"But probably with Ben going it makes it more vital we try to search for somebody who can provide that role for us a little bit."
Slade, who is not looking to lose more players before the window closes, is awaiting a decision from a transfer target and said other potential acquisitions could "go to the wire".
And the Cardiff manager made it clear there is no desire to sell Scottish international goalkeeper David Marshall, who is currently sidelined following groin surgery.
"Nobody at the football wants to sell David Marshall, not even the owner," Slade said.
"But I suspect at some stage at virtually every club in the country everybody has a value, so it would probably have to be something that would blow us away.
"I actually don't see that happening at all. David is very happy and to date there have been no inquiries on my desk."
