Twitter says it is investigating a bug that has caused some messages to become unavailable on its service.

Accounts affected include those belonging to the singers Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and One Direction's Louis Tomlinson.
Oscars presenter Ellen DeGeneres's selfie from the Academy Awards - the most retweeted picture of all time - was also affected.
Several, but not all, of the messages have now been restored.
Attempts to click on links to the missing tweets bring up a message saying: "Sorry, that page doesn't exist!".
"We are currently researching a bug that has caused some Tweets to not be displayed," the service tweeted on its status page on Tuesday evening.
The account indicated this was the third time the US company had experienced a significant fault this month.
Previous problems involved a 45-minute period when many users were unable to log in to the service after a botched upgrade that was later "rolled back", and a 25-minute period when some users were unable to send or receive tweets from mobile apps.
The current fault appears to have lasted for more than 12 hours.
Among the tweets that became inaccessible were:
It was reported that several of Styles's own tweets had also disappeared.
Several Twitter users also complained he last message posted by the actor Cory Monteith had also become inaccessible. The Canadian star of Glee died in July from a heroin overdose.
His message is among the posts that have since been restored.
