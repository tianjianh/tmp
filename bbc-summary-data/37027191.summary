Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho says rival managers spoke out about the cost of Paul Pogba because their clubs are not big enough to do such a deal.

Midfielder Pogba, 23, rejoined United on Tuesday for a world-record Â£89m.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp were outspoken about his valuation.
"Sometimes in football, things happen and the club breaks the record, but this is only possible at clubs like Manchester United," Mourinho told MUTV.
"When I heard some of the comments and heard some of the managers criticising that, I don't think they ever have this problem because, to have this problem, you need to be at one of the top clubs in the world."
Speaking before the deal was confirmed, Wenger said Pogba's valuation was "completely crazy", while Klopp said he would not spend that much on a single player even if his funds were unlimited.
Mourinho said their comments were "not ethical".
