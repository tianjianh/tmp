A two-day auction of art, jewellery, furniture and clothing owned by the late actress Lauren Bacall has fetched $3.64m (£2.45m) in New York.

A hand-coloured etching of an American white pelican by John James Audubon sold for $173,000 (£116,000) - three times more than was expected, according to auction house Bonhams.
A granite games table from the home she shared in Los Angeles with Humphrey Bogart sold for $26,250 (£17,665).
Bacall died in August at the age of 89.
The New York home in which she died, in the Dakota building where John Lennon was shot, is on the market for $26m (£17.5m).
Bacall's Tiffany necklace, a brass Japanese tea set and sculptures by Henry Moore were among other lots to be sold on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Bonhams' vice president Jon King said the "extremely personal" collection "truly reflected Bacall's formidable collecting sense and uniquely intuitive style".
Proceeds from the auction will go to the star's three children: Stephen and Leslie, the son and daughter she had with Bogart, and Sam, the son she had with second husband Jason Robards.
