Two-time Olympic gold medallist Helen Glover says she is considering whether to continue in the sport.

The 30-year-old's partner for pairs gold in 2012 and 2016, Heather Stanning, retired on Wednesday.
Glover, who married television presenter Steve Backshall in September, is taking time out from the sport.
"I haven't decided. I was always going to take these few months without thinking about it too much and without trying to make a decision," she said.
"Heather's decision doesn't affect mine at all, I already knew she was going to retire.
"In 2013, when she left to have a year out, I took my decision regardless of whether she was going to come back or not, so it feels kind of similar to that," she told BBC Radio Cornwall.

Glover hinted in June that she could quit the sport after the Rio Olympics and has not been given a deadline by which to make her decision.
"Its open-ended in terms of GB Rowing's support and they'll support me and will be happy to welcome me back, but also happy to support me if I move away from rowing," said Glover.
"But for me there is a deadline because I don't want to get to the stage where I've left it too late to come back and be competitive.
"People have taken a year out, like Heather did in 2013, and come back very strong, any more than that you'd be looking at making it very difficult for yourself to continue."
