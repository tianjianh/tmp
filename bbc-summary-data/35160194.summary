The spinner claimed 6-77 as the home side were bowled out for 187.
Captain Alastair Cook and Joe Root both scored centuries during the three-day encounter to help England to a first-innings total of 414-6 declared.
The game was England's last before the four-Test series against South Africa begins on 26 December in Durban.
South Africa A's Quinton De Kock scored 53, but he was the only standout performer for his team who lost eight wickets for 152 runs.
Steven Finn took two more wickets in the second innings to finish with match figures of 6-64.
He claimed Omphile Ramela leg before to one that kept low before Khaya Zondo slashed to fourth slip off the shoulder of the bat.
Moeen sealed victory when he bowled Keshav Maharaj before he had Dane Paterson caught in the deep by Alex Hales.
It was the England all rounder's sixth first-class five-for.
Having impressed with the ball, the 28-year-old Worcestershire player admitted he is happy to return to batting at number eight, having made a top score of 35 in six innings when he was promoted to open in the 2-0 Test series defeat against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.
"I can't wait, I'm actually looking forward to going back to eight and playing a few shots, hopefully freeing up," he said.
"Obviously opening didn't work. I enjoyed it and it was a really good experience but I didn't score the runs I'd have liked.
"I probably got caught in two minds at times whether to attack or not but things like that happen. I'm happy and I don't mind where I bat, I'll just look to do my job wherever I bat."
