Landmark Hawick clock tower faces demolition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A landmark building in Hawick could be demolished amid claims it would cost too much to restore.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wilton Mill clock tower is situated on the town's Commercial Road.
It has been claimed it could cost in the region of Â£2m to make the building safe and useable which, a local developer believes, means saving it is out of the question.
An application to demolish the listed building has been lodged with Scottish Borders Council.
Agents for the developers said the building was now "derelict and unsafe" and said it was "stifling advancement of redevelopment" of the site.
A structural assessment earlier this year also recommended removal of the building "as soon as possible".
However, the plans have provoked objections to the loss of an "iconic feature of Hawick's industrial landscape".
Opponents believe that in a "better economic climate" a new use could be found for the building.
The local authority and Historic Scotland will have the final say on whether the clock tower stays or goes.
