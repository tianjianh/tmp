Bedford couple unwittingly grow cannabis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elderly couple have unwittingly grown the "biggest cannabis plant" police officers had seen after buying what they thought was an innocuous shrub from a car boot sale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The couple, who live in Bedford, had planted the drug in their garden.
Police officers were astounded when they spotted the plant. They have collected it and a spokesperson said it would be disposed of.
The couple will face no action from the police.
The officers took to their @bedfordlpt Twitter account to express their surprise at the find, saying: "Seized today. Elderly couple bought shrub at car boot sale, tended carefully - biggest cannabis plant we had seen!!"
