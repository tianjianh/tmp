[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lords begin devolution inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The House of Lords has begun an inquiry into the Union and devolution.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Scottish Secretary Lord Lang of Monkton, who is chairing the inquiry, said devolution had significantly changed the way the UK was governed.
But the Conservative peer said the process had not been undertaken in a coherent or considered way.
The inquiry will seek to identify what binds the constituent parts of the UK and the ways in which it might be strengthened and reinforced.
Lord Lang, who was the Tory MP in south west Scotland in the 1980 and 90s and a cabinet minister in John Major's government, is chairman of the House of Lords Constitution Committee.
He said: "Since 1998, devolution has significantly changed the way the United Kingdom is governed, and there are proposals for the further devolution of power both to nations within the UK and to English cities and regions in the very near future.
"We are concerned, however, that this process has not been undertaken in a coherent or considered way; the devolution of powers to each nation has been considered separately with little or no reflection on the impact on the Union as a whole."
He added: "Our inquiry will span a broad range of constitutional issues and will give witnesses the opportunity to put their views on record on an issue that will profoundly affect the whole of the UK. I would encourage interested parties to send us their evidence by 2 October."
