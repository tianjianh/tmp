Why is Hillary Clinton leaving out 'Rodham'?
Chelsea Clinton has frequently supported her mother at political events, most recently appearing alongside her in Brooklyn, New York, on 7 June, when she secured the Democratic nomination.
Mrs Clinton's opponent, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, also welcomed a new grandson recently. His daughter Ivanka had a third child, Theodore, in March.
