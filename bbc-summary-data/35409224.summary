The incident happened as the teenager and a 15-year-old boy were walking on Fernhill Road, near Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, at about 14:15 on Sunday.
A light-green Vauxhall Corsa mounted the pavement and hit the boy then made off towards the Castlemilk area.
The boy is in a stable condition at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. The 15-year-old boy was not injured.
The car was recovered in Scarrel Gardens, Castlemilk, a short time after the incident and police said inquiries were continuing to trace the occupants.
Det Con Martin McKendrick said: "Thankfully the victim was not badly injured, but this was a deliberate and very dangerous act which could have had far more serious consequences and we need to trace those responsible immediately.
"I would appeal to anyone who was on Fernhill Road around the time of the incident and witnessed what happened to get in touch.
"I would also ask anyone living in the Castlemilk area, near to where the vehicle was recovered, who saw anything suspicious to contact police."
Police said the hit-and-run was reported after both teenagers made their way home after the incident.
