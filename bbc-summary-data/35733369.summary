[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen responded to Celtic's lunchtime victory by securing the three points against Kilmarnock which keep them hanging on to the coat-tails of the Premiership leaders.

Ash Taylor headed them ahead only for Josh Magennis to turn in Rory McKenzie's knock-back.
A diving header by Shay Logan secured a win which was more workmanlike than full of flair.
They stay one point behind the champions with one more game played.
The result means at the other end of the table Killie remain in the sights of bottom club Dundee United, although still eight points clear of the automatic relegation place.
Aberdeen made two changes, leaving out Mark Reynolds and Craig Storrie from their starting line-up, to accommodate fit again Niall McGinn and Barry Robson who came on as a substitute against Partick Thistle in midweek only to limp off injured before the end.
Kilmarnock, with one change in their side - the return of skipper Steven Smith for James McHattie - were under the cosh from the start surviving a number of chances, the closest of which was an effort from Kenny McLean which rattled the post.
Killie were insistent on route one football which seldom threatened and it was no surprise when the Dons took the lead just before half time.
Robson delivered a corner which should never have been awarded - it looked as if goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald didn't touch a nevertheless threatening cross - and Taylor headed home.
But two minutes into the second half Kilmarnock equalised with a goal created by a Greg Kiltie cross from the byline. It was headed back across from the far post by McKenzie and Magennis - a former Aberdeen player - headed home.
That led to a nervous Pittodrie, but Shay Logan had the place bouncing again with a spectacular diving header after Jonny Hayes had drilled a ball in from the left hand side.
Aberdeen were worthy of all three points and if nothing else they are awash with spirit.
However, it spelled out more misery for the visitors whose best hope of avoiding automatic relegation might be continued problems for Dundee United.
