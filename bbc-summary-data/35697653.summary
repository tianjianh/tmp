But lock George Earle (shoulder), number eights Morgan Allen (foot) and Rory Pitman (chest) and scrum-half Rhodri Williams (concussion) are out.
Scotland flanker John Barclay will be at number eight for Scarlets, who have lost one Pro12 home game this season.
"We're lucky to have Jake Ball coming back," said Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac.
Wales coach Warren Gatland released lock Ball and scrum-half Davies to the region as the Welsh squad prepare for their Six Nations showdown with England at Twickenham on 12 March.
"Aled Davies is important with Rhods out, so that's a boost," added Pivac.
WingDTH van der Merwe is back while flanker Aaron Shingler and fly-half brother Steve have failed concussion checks.
Flankers Lewis Rawlins (shoulder) and Jack Condy (shoulder), hooker Emyr Phillips (knee), centre Scott Williams (knee) and wing Tom Williams (shoulder) are also Scarlets absentees.
Scarlets' defeat in Edinburgh last weekend was their third one-point margin in successive weeks after wins over Edinburgh and Ulster.
"It's an opportunity back at home to get back to winning ways," added Pivac.
"If we get a result on Friday night then this group can say they've been in the top four all season."
Scarlets are third in the Pro12 table - five points behind leaders Connacht - while Treviso are bottom despite back-to-back wins over Cardiff Blues and Newport Gwent Dragons.
Treviso boss Marius Goosen makes one starting change as Tommaso Iannone takes the place of Ludovico Nitoglia on the wing.
