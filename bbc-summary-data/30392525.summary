Officers say they found the couple dead on Monday morning after a neighbour in LA phoned emergency services saying she'd heard screams and gun shots.
Earl Hayes, who was once signed to boxer Floyd Mayweather's record label, was found dead along with his partner.
Actress Moseley, 30, had appeared in cheerleading comedy Hellcats and VH1 dance drama Hit the Floor.
That has just been renewed for a third series.
Stephanie Moseley had also worked as a choreographer on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 and danced with the likes of Chris Brown, Usher, Mariah Carey, Beyonce and Janet Jackson.

Alicia Keys' husband Swizz Beatz wrote on Instagram: ''(rest in peace) to one of my best friends in the world (@earl Hayes) I am sick and hurt about this news. I am sending my deepest condolences To your family. Wow this can't be real."

When officers arrived at the couple's apartment complex, they heard more shots being fired.
LAPD's Special Weapons and Tactics (Swat) team was called out and found two people inside the flat, Earl Hayes and Stephanie Moseley, with gunshot wounds.

"VH1 and the entire Hit The Floor family send our thoughts and condolences to her family and friends at this difficult time."
