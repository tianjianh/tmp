[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 1-2 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley's nightmare start to the season as the National League's winless bottom side went down at home to Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Holroyd gave the Silkmen the lead as he latched onto a ball over the top and lobbed Jonathan Maxted successfully.
Injury forced Macc into an early change as David Fitzpatrick went off, but replacement Mitch Hancox soon crossed for Ollie Norburn to volley in Macc's second at the back post.
Jordan Preston and Nicky Clee combined well to allow Preston to pull one back with a smart finish, but Macclesfield controlled proceedings in the second half, leaving the hosts without a win in their opening 12 games of the season.
