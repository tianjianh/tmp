World Snooker: Ronnie O'Sullivan warned for media no-show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ronnie O'Sullivan has received a formal warning from World Snooker after failing to fulfil media obligations at the World Championship in Sheffield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He refused to speak to reporters after his first-round win over David Gilbert.
World Snooker says any further breaches by the five-time champion will result in a fine and possible further action by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.
He faces fellow Englishman Barry Hawkins or China's Zhang Anda next.
