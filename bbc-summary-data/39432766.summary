Jiang Zhipeng's misplaced header set up the home team for the game's only goal.
Jiang's wife revealed on social media that he had filed for divorce.
"For three and a half years out of our four-year marriage, he was sleeping with other women," said Zhang Zhiyue. "Now he is trying to drive me to an early grave."
AFP news agency also report that she posted photos on social network Weibo of Jiang snuggling with his alleged mistress, and called for the Chinese football association and the sports bureau of Guangdong province to "expel" him from professional football.
Chinese soccer authorities have not commented on the situation.
Guangzhou R&F defender Jiang, 28, made his debut for the national team in 2013.
