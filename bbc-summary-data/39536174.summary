The man was found in northern suburb of the city, after police released a grainy CCTV image of a person of interest.
The driver fled the scene after Friday's attack on a busy shopping street in the city centre.
Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has called it a terrorist attack.
More than a dozen people were injured.
The country's borders have been tightened at the prime minister's request.

Eyewitness: 'I heard the screams'
The lorry crashed into the front of Ahlens department store in the middle of the afternoon on Drottninggatan (Queen Street), one of the city's major pedestrian thoroughfares.
The beer company that owns the vehicle said it was hijacked outside a nearby restaurant, where it was making a delivery.
Police shared the image of the man, dressed in a hooded jacket, early on Friday evening.
They confirmed a man resembling him was arrested in the Marsta area.
"We have investigated several people this evening, who we found interesting in one way or another, and recently we arrested someone we are very interested in," said police investigator Jan Evensson, referring to the Marsta arrest.
Central Stockholm was in lockdown after the incident.
In the immediate aftermath, shoppers took refuge in nearby buildings for hours, waiting for the area to be secured.
The central station, which is near the Ahlens store, was evacuated.
The metro, central roads and various bus lines were also shut.
City authorities made several spaces, including a number of schools, available as temporary accommodation for those who could not get home because of transport disruptions.
Eyewitnesses described horrifying scenes outside the store, as bodies and injured people lay on the ground.
In a speech on Friday night, Prime Minister Lofven said Swedish values of democracy and freedom would not be "undermined by hatred".
