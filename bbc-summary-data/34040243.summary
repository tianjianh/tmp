Howard Cox, 67, from Bideford, Devon, was on his way to an air show in the Republic of Ireland last month when his aircraft crashed on farmland.
He had been flying to an air show.
The final two minutes of the flight were recorded by air traffic control at Shannon Airport in County Clare after Mr Cox made a mayday call.
Mr Cox had spent 30 years working on his single-seat plane, a Bede BD5 plane, a type of mini-jet similar to one that featured in the James Bond film Octopussy.
He was eight minutes into his flight from Waterford to Shannon when it suffered engine trouble before coming down near Dungarvan in County Waterford.
In his mayday, he said: "I have engine failure. I have an engine on fire".
"Roger, are you going back to Waterford?" air traffic controller in Shannon asked.
Mr Cox replied: "Negative - I'm just going to have to find a field."
The preliminary report by Ireland's Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) said Mr Cox's voice was composed and professional during the mayday calls and his final communications.
The last words he is heard saying were "ending up in a field".
Mr Cox had been in the Republic of Ireland for several days before his death preparing to display his plane at for the Foynes Air Show at the Shannon estuary.
Gerry Humphreys, the show's director, was travelling behind Mr Cox in another aircraft when the engine fire occurred.
He flew over the crash site.
The left wing of Mr Cox's jet clipped a tree on the boundary of a field.
The entire wing then broke off and the plane hit a hedgerow and the ground, bursting into flames on impact.
Wreckage examination is continuing at the AAIU hangar, the report said.
