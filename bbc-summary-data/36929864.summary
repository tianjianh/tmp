Nottingham Forest 4-3 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Philippe Montanier's Nottingham Forest reign began with a 4-3 opening weekend win that spoilt Burton Albion's first Championship fixture.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Britt Assombalonga started and finished the Reds' scoring on his first start in 18 months to help seal three points for the new French boss.
Burton had led 2-1 through Lucas Akins and Lloyd Dyer goals before Thomas Lam and Oliver Burke turned it round.
Tom Naylor's late header had Forest nerves jangling, but the hosts held on.
The only sour note for Montanier's side was the injury to goalkeeper Dorus de Vries, who was withdrawn on a stretcher in the first 20 minutes with an ankle problem.
Victory for the home side came at the expense of Forest legend Nigel Clough, who steered Albion to promotion to the second tier for the first time in their history last season.
In searing sunshine, a sell-out crowd at a reduced capacity was given a glimpse of the future with five academy talents named in the hosts' starting line-up.
Despite the loss, Burton showed character to fight back from a goal down to silence the City Ground crowd, but also to keep pressing when Forest were 4-2 up and seemingly comfortable at the end.
Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"Even at the end it was difficult for us because they're a very good team and we didn't manage that very well.
"But other than the end we played a good game with a young team, five academy players, it was a great victory for Nottingham Forest.
"We tried to play offensive football but it's not always easy, because the opponents are at the good level and now we need to work hard to not concede three goals because we won't score four goals every game."
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:
"We have to learn that when we get opportunity to take a point or three form the game we have to take them and they were certainly there all the way through the game.
"The players are hugely disappointed because they know we should have got something out of the game, but there was also a bit of misfortune.
"We're resilient, we keep going and the chance we had in the 94th minute was probably the best chance of the game and we thought it was in. That sums up the day. A lot of positives, but we've got to learn and learn fast."
