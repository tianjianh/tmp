The 26-year-old made 71 appearances for the Scottish Premiership side over two seasons, but was released at the end of the 2016-17 campaign.
Former Liverpool youngster Amoo moved to Scotland after playing 70 league matches for Carlisle United.
"I'm looking forward to moving back to England and showing my stuff here," said Amoo.
"I know how competitive this level is with a lot of games to be played, so I want to chip in with as much as I can to help the team.
"They finished just outside the play-offs last season and it's clear there is a strong group of talented players, who I am keen to get to work with."
