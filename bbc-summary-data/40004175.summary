Tipuric, 27, beat fellow 2017 British and Irish Lions squad member, Scarlets hooker Ken Owens, to the accolade.
Scarlets wing Steffan Evans, 22, has taken the Most Promising Player award.
Evans saw off the challenge of Ospreys wing Keelan Giles after both were picked for Wales' summer tour squad for Tests against Tonga and Samoa.
Aberavon's Stefan Andrews was named Welsh Premiership Player, finishing ahead of Merthyr fly-half Matthew Jarvis in the ballot.
Tipuric took over on Wales' open-side from national team and Lions captain Sam Warburton.
Both players are heading for New Zealand to take on the All Blacks in a three-Test series on their second Lions tours.
