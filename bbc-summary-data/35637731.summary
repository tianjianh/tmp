[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 1-2 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Bishop scored a late winner for Southport as they secured victory at play-off-chasing Dover Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie Allen gave the Sandgrounders a first-half lead when he turned home Steven Hewitt's pass, but Ricky Miller levelled after goalkeeper Max Crocombe failed to gather a free-kick.
Poor defending then allowed Allen to cross for Bishop to hit the winner and end Southport's eight-game winless run.
Max Cartwright was sent off for the visitors late on for two yellow cards.
