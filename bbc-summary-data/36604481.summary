Euro 2016: Republic of Ireland join home nations in last 16

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be joined by the Republic of Ireland in the Euro 2016 knockout stages.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robbie Brady scored a late header to give his country a 1-0 victory over Italy.
That meant they qualified for the last 16 as one of the best third-placed sides.
The Republic of Ireland will play the hosts France next - on Sunday afternoon.
Wales and Northern Ireland will play each other on Saturday for a place in the quarter-finals.
England will play Iceland on Monday, after Iceland qualified thanks to a dramatic late winner over Austria.
Iceland are the smallest nation ever to qualify for a major tournament.
