The 24-year-old number eight played for the first time since November on Sunday, as his club Saracens won 35-27 at Newcastle.
He was then named in England coach Eddie Jones' 30-man training squad.
"I talked to Eddie this week and said that if I come through the game then we can talk," Vunipola told BBC Newcastle.
"I'd love to be back in the mix but I don't want to disrespect anybody and say I'll walk straight back in."
Vunipola managed 72 minutes of Sunday's Premiership game at Kingston Park.
"It was good," he said. "I'm not sure why they took me off but that is the coach's decision.
"I am just looking forward to my fish and chips after this as I've waited a long time."
Harlequins wing Marland Yarde was the other player recalled to the squad.
