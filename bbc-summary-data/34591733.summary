Joaquin Gomez Hernandez, 24, attacked 33-year-old escort worker Vanessa Santillan, then tried to blame one of her clients, the Old Bailey was told.
The court heard Gomez Hernandez, who denied murder, launched the attack after earlier finding Ms Santillan with a client at her London flat in March.
He was told he must serve a minimum of 14 and a half years in prison.
The court heard unemployed Gomez Hernandez was jealous and resented having to rely on Ms Santillan for money since their arrival in London from Mexico, two months before her death.
He became angry when Ms Santillan entertained a client after the pair had been out with friends, later attacking her, inflicting massive head and neck injuries, the jury was told.
The court heard he then pretended to find her body and suggested to police that one of her clients had killed her.
Sentencing him to a mandatory life term, Judge Richard Marks QC told Gomez Hernandez: "Vanessa had extensive head injuries and suffered manual strangulation.
"You left her on the floor, naked from the waist down. You then engaged in a pretence and lied to the police.
"Your subsequent conduct - taking Vanessa's property including money and telephones and visiting prostitutes after the attack - was callous in the extreme."
An impact statement from Ms Santillan's family said: "This loss cannot be remedied or changed. It is something that has greatly affected us and hurts a lot.
"Our family will never be the same again without Vanessa. We cannot stop thinking how unjust her death was."
