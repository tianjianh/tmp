The advisory said the quake occurred near Yonaguni island, near Taiwan.
The alert advised residents of nearby islands to "get out of the water and leave the coast immediately", but added that no damage was expected.
There were no initial reports of damage in Japan nor in Taiwan, where residents reported feeling tremors.
The Japan Meterological Agency said the earthquake's depth was "very shallow". The alert was lifted after about an hour.
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau said it detected two earthquakes, one measuring 6.3 and another of magnitude 5.0 east of Hualien county.
The US-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had said a "destructive Pacific-wide tsunami" was not expected".
Japan sits in a region with high tectonic plate activity, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, and registers more than 20% of the planet's most powerful earthquakes every year.
