Man on a Bench by Giles Penny was unveiled in Bruton in June and now attracts a number of visitors who sit on it to have their photograph taken.
Town mayor Steve Hall, said he was certain it "won't heat up to griddle levels" this summer but it could be a "shock" to those wearing shorts.
The sign warning that the "surface will be hot" in the sunshine, is to erected.
The sculpture by the renowned artist - who also has works at Canary Wharf in London - was installed next to the town's Packhorse Bridge two months ago.
Since then, according to Mr Hall, it has become a "star attraction".
"It's not a bench, it's a piece of art but because you can sit on the bench next to the sculpture a lot of people are going up and having their photograph taken," he said.
"You can sit on it comfortably, 99% of the time but I decided if we did get a real 1976 summer again it would probably be very, very uncomfortable and may even result in burns."
As a precaution the sculptor had been asked to make a sign, warning people to "test it" before sitting on it.
