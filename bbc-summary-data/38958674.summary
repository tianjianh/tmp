The magical sport, created by writer JK Rowling in the Harry Potter books, has now been turned into a sport even muggles can enjoy.
The game is now played in 25 countries around the world, and those taking part say it's great because there are so many different player positions to choose from.
The sport has many of the same elements of the game played by Harry and his friends, including quaffles and even a golden snitch which is released at the end of a game.
