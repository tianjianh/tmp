A disused Victorian sewage pipe has become the centrepiece of the North Sea’s "first snorkel trail”.
The trail – backed by North Norfolk District Council – will stretch 50m (150ft) out into the waters off Sheringham and feature ropes, life buoys and information signs
The idea was proposed earlier this year by divers Dawn Watson and Rob Spray.
Mr Spray said: “I think people just wouldn’t believe just how colourful it is. As you swim along the pipe it is deep reds and verdant greens and crabs and lobsters and fish. And it is just on the edge of the beach."
