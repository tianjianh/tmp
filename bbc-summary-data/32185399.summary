Worthing seafront's pink house prompts a rethink on rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A house that has been painted bright pink in a Sussex conservation area has prompted councillors to take action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The house on Marine Parade is not listed, so Worthing Borough Council said it had no direct control over how it is painted.
However, it said it would request that the colour was "toned down". The owner has made no comment to the BBC.
The council also said it would now introduce measures to prevent "inappropriate painting".
A spokesman said it would not be retrospective, but would protect properties within the town's conservation area in future.
The measures will protect the buildings along the seafront, from Splash Point to Heene Terrace, "from inappropriate development by the withdrawal of permitted development rights for any painting or works of external redecoration to the front elevations and any visible side elevations".
The proposed Article 4(2) Direction would not necessarily mean permission to repaint would be refused, but it would enable the council "to retain some control over the colour scheme".
Worthing Council said it had resulted in the property "becoming overly dominant in the street scene and an erosion of the character that defines the historic seafront" due to the existing permitted development rights.
