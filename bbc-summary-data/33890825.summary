Rob Walton, 36, from Hinckley, Leicestershire, was hit by a "freak wave" while swimming off the coast of Labenne, south west France, on Monday.
In a statement, Mr Walton's family described the father of four as a "larger than life" character.
Mr Walton played at Championship level in Birmingham, Rotherham and Coventry.
In recent years, he was player-coach at Rugby Lions and had guided them to two successive promotions.
The statement said: "Rob's wife Gemma, his parents, sister and all the family are absolutely devastated by their loss.
"He was a larger than life character and touched everyone around him, whether that was on the rugby pitch, coaching, spending time with his beautiful children or having fun with his vast circle of family and friends."
The statement added the family were "overwhelmed" by the love and support they had received "at this difficult time".
"We would ask everyone to give us some time to try to come to terms with the huge hole he will leave in our lives and fully respect our privacy," it added.
It is believed Mr Walton was body boarding when tragedy struck, according to reports in France.
His death is currently being investigated by police in Labenne.
Local reports said his spine may have been fatally damaged after being hit by a freak wave.
The accident happened at about 14:00 BST on Monday.
Mr Walton grew up in Stoke Golding, Leicestershire, and played junior and senior rugby for Hinckley before moving to Birmingham and Solihull, Rotherham and Coventry.
The lock forward, who was known affectionately as "Yoghurt", was part of the Birmingham side - then known as the Pertemps Bees - that famously beat London Wasps in the 2004 Powergen Cup quarter-final.
After a second stint in Hinckley, he moved into coaching.
Paying tribute to him, friends described him as a "gentle giant".
