Operation Griffin, involving Scotland Yard, City of London Police and British Transport Police will brief and remind the public to stay vigilant.
The operation will include automatic number plate recognition and high-visibility patrols across all 32 boroughs until 15 June.
Cdr Simon Bray said: "The threat to London from terrorism remains real."
As part of the operation, briefings will also be held for officers in each borough to ensure continuity between national and neighbourhood policing.
Assistant Chief Constable Steve Thomas of British Transport Police added: "It is vitally important that we do not get complacent, and the vigilance of passengers and staff remains a crucial element."
