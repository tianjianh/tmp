The robbery happened four days ago, but the details only emerged on Thursday.
The interior ministry said the main suspects were a plumber, facing financial difficulty, and a department employee, who helped him break in.
Thirty-one gold and four silver bars, worth around $2m (Â£1.2m), were taken during the raid.
A number of commemorative coins were also taken.
The men were arrested with the stolen items and a large amount of cash in their possession, the interior ministry added.
Much of the gold has reportedly already been sold to jewellers in Cairo.
The finance department employee was spotted on CCTV footage at a jewellery shop, where he tried to sell some of the stolen metal on Thursday, the Middle Eastern News Agency reports.
He is accused of sharing information with the plumber, which helped him bypass security and access the safe where the bars were being held.
