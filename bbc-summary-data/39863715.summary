[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds Rhinos reached the Challenge Cup quarter-finals with a thumping victory over League One side Barrow Raiders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joel Moon scored a first-half hat-trick as Leeds dominated from the start, with Matt Parcell, Ash Handley and Ryan Hall also crossing for 32-4 at half-time.
Handley, Parcell and Rob Burrow completed braces after the break, while Stevie Ward, Liam Sutcliffe and Keith Galloway added further scores.
Luke Creswell and Jarrad Stack ran in consolation tries for Barrow.
The Raiders top the third tier having won all seven of their matches in the league this season, and they had managed 13 victories from 13 games in all competitions prior to Sunday's hammering by Leeds.
But they were always well short against the 13-time winners, who also landed 20 points courtesy of Sutcliffe's boot.
Rhinos are currently fourth in Super League with nine wins from 13 games.
