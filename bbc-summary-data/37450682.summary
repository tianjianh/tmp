Donald Trump's 'other wall' divides opinion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The waves crashing on a wintry, rain-swept Doonbeg beach make it seem a million miles from the sun-drenched southern border of the United States.

But they have more in common than you might think: Donald Trump wants to build a wall at both.
Whereas the Mexican border barrier would stop people getting into the US, the County Clare sea fortification would protect Mr Trump's award-winning golf resort from the sea.
While the presidential hopeful doesn't believe in man-made climate change, the sea is swallowing up an estimated metre of the dunes every year.
The golf resort employs some 250 people in the high season and has 75 properties on the complex, as well as three bars and three restaurants.
The Trump organisation has applied to Clare County Council to place tonnes of limestone boulders - some almost four metres tall - along the three-kilometre strand.
Joe Russell, the resort's general manager, said the proposal was a carefully-considered engineering solution that fits in with the natural landscape.
"Back in the 1940s, people in the local authority from west Clare actually took rock off the beach to build roads," Mr Russell told the BBC.
"What we're seeking to do is to put rock back onto the beach and, hopefully, over the next number of months and years, to protect the vital asset of this business which is the golf course."
Storms two years ago took their toll.
The Trump organisation says the previous owners of the resort also wanted some form of fortifications in line with what is happening all along the wild Atlantic coast.
"Donald Trump has the means to do it," said Mr Russell.
"My concern is that we're going to have another storm.
"It hits the dune face, it takes from the golf course and we end up with a tourist season in a future year that is compromised.
"The jobs, the local economy and people's livelihoods will be affected by a golf course that has essentially been destroyed by the ocean."
But some ecologists oppose the proposal.
Theresa O'Donohoe from the Clare Environmental Network says experience shows sea fortifications are futile against storms and crashing waves.
"I find it very hypocritical for a man who claims that man is not making climate change to want to build what they say is not a wall but is effectively a wall against nature," she told the BBC.
"And it's not going to work against nature. Mother Nature will beat the wall down."
In the village of Doonbeg, most people seem to support the Trump proposal.
"Coastal protection is vitally needed in the area," said Rita McInerney, who runs The Wild Atlantic Break coffee shop.
"It's already been done in various other locations up and down the western sea board.
"It is a sign of the times that it's required."
Gareth Fitzpatrick, a school teacher and surfer, said he could see both sides of the argument.
"Donald Trump wants to protect his investment after losing 38 acres in the last storm, but on the other hand, you can see the environmental impact of it and for surfers," he said.
Tommy Tubridy, a publican and restaurateur, said more than 90% of local people wanted planning permission to be granted for the sea fortification.
"If this wall isn't built, in time from Doonbeg right out to Loop Head will become an island," he said.
"The sea will come in and take over from the golf course right towards Kilrush miles away."
Clare County Council has said it may be several months before a decision is reached on the Doonbeg barrier.
And who knows? By then it could be one of President Trump's two walls.
