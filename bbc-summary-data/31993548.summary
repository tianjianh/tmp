Rape suspect: My confidence was knocked to hell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
At the minute if you go to the police and say you've been raped, or are the victim of another sex offence, you're automatically entitled to anonymity.

But the same isn't true for anyone suspected of those crimes.
A cross-party group of MPs say people who are accused of rape and sex crimes in England and Wales should stay anonymous until they are charged.
Critics say it'll stop victims coming forward, so Newsbeat's looked at both sides of the argument.
The chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, Labour MP Keith Vaz, argues naming sex crime suspects can be "destructive" to a person's livelihood, as well as damage their reputation.
But Jill Saward, a victim of rape who has waived her anonymity to campaign for other victims, says sex crime suspects have to be named:
"People who are rapists are multiple rapists."
She added: "When one victim comes forward often their isn't enough evidence there, you need the evidence of other people."
27-year-old Kyle was cleared of rape in court last year, but that was 14 months after being accused, and having his name in local papers after he was first arrested.
"My life got literally twisted upside down, my confidence was knocked to hell," he said.
"I was threatened, they assumed that I'd done something so bad because it was all over the papers.
"Its so demeaning, so embarrassing, it hurts, it really does hurt."
Newsbeat also heard from another man who was arrested on suspicion of rape, who wanted to be anonymous.
"I was put on bail for about 3 months," he said.
"I lost my job, I was verbally abused, physically abused and threatened.
"I was not even charged, it never went to court."
He explained he was eventually diagnosed with severe depression, which he's only just recovering from.
"They shouldn't name either (alleged victim or suspect), because it causes too much damage.
"They shouldn't name anybody at all until the verdict."

Sometimes when a suspected sex offender is named after being arrested, it can encourage other victims to come forward, like in the case of the former celebrity publicist Max Clifford.
He was jailed for eight years last year for a string of indecent assaults against girls and young women.
Newsbeat spoke to a rape victim as well, who also wanted to retain her right to be kept anonymous.
"I was raped at 15," she explains.
"I kept it to myself and it ate away at me, and throughout that age as well I started going through depression."
A year later she told the police after she was encouraged by a friend.
"They didn't believe me whatsoever, and the police were like "why are you wasting your time, why are you wasting the police's time?""
She added: "They threatened that they could arrest me.
"I felt like I was going to have a breakdown, I felt I couldn't be on this world any more.
"I think (the names of) people who have been accused and arrested should definitely be made public, because you don't know what that person may be capable of."
