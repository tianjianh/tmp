Yorkshire's Pidcock beat compatriot Dan Tulett by 38 seconds, with Ben Turner completing the podium places.
They had to overcome difficult conditions as snow, ice and mud added to an already tricky course.
Evie Richards, another Briton and the defending champion, took bronze in the women's under-23 race.
Richards said she was delighted to get another medal.
"I know it's not a gold medal but it means a lot," she said. "Any medal - and being on that podium - is amazing."
Pidcock, meanwhile, told BBC Sport: "It's the best day of my life.
"It's historic. To share it with these two as well is amazing.
"Support for cyclo-cross in Britain is low.  Hopefully this will change that and get more people out on cross bikes."
Britain's highest finisher in the women's elite race was Nikki Brammeier, who was ninth.
This event is the 68th Cyclo-Cross World Championships, and 30,000 spectators are expected to attend the event in Bieles, Luxembourg.
