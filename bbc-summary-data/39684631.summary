The last tickets to the three-day June event in Somerset sold out in 20 minutes earlier as people flooded the website.
Some fans complained on social media, describing @seetickets site as "the worst website in history".
The BBC has approached the ticketing company for comment.
To buy a Glastonbury tickets, pre-registration is first needed.
The general admission tickets sold out in October, but buyers need to pay the full balance by April.
If they do not, their tickets are re-sold again to those who have pre-registered.
For those who missed out on the initial sale, Sunday's resale was the last chance to secure a ticket, but many were left disappointed.
One vented their feelings on Twitter saying: "Through to the registration screen 5 times and couldn't click proceed."
Others also said they had problems, with one frustrated fan writing they filled in their details three times but kept returning to the queue.
Another stated: "So the sold out screen works fine for the server but not the actual ticket sales. such a shocking system #glastonbury #glastonbury2017"
Another said: "How can the Glastonbury resale tickets be sold out when nobody ever gets past the first page."
But some people were successful.
One festivalgoer wrote: "First time applying for Glastonbury tickets and I got them within 6 minutes. I was frantic putting my details in. #Glastonburyresale".
Another successful fan said: "4th time trying for Glastonbury tickets and I got them!!!!
"The festival confirmed the event is now sold out, with a message on the official Twitter page saying : "This morning's resale tickets have now all been sold.
"Thanks to everyone who bought one and sorry to those of you who missed out."
The ticket company also warned fans via Twitter not to buy tickets illegally.
