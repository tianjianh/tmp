The mobile phone company, which employs about 4,500 people at the site, is undertaking a restructuring programme to change staffing across the country.
The job losses will be in the firm's corporate division.
However, a spokesman said hundreds of jobs would be created in its customer services department.
He said: "We continually review our costs to ensure we can compete more effectively and that our investment is focused on products and services, including our network, which truly benefit customers.
"As a result, while we will be creating hundreds of new roles within our UK-based customer services team this year we will also be simplifying the structures of some of our corporate functions.
"We will be working with all those affected to support them through this period."
