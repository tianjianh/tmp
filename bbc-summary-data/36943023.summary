Tyrone manager Mickey Harte says All Star Mattie Donnelly will be available for Saturday's All-Ireland SFC quarter-final against Mayo in Croke Park.

Donnelly suffered concussion playing for his club last weekend but has been given the all clear to resume training.
"He has got clearance now, it will be nine days since his hit before he goes into any contact again," Harte said.
Tyrone cannot appeal the black cards Donnelly and Cathal McShane received in the Ulster final win over Donegal.

Both players were dismissed by referee David Coldrick within five minutes of each other in the first half.
Donnelly was deemed to have taken out Eoin McHugh with a body check while McShane was sent off for tripping Neil McGee while he was on the ground.
Harte said: "I don't have to tell you that I was never an advocate of the black card anyway".
"I really did not see the value in it and it adds another degree of difficulty to the job of referees."
A rule change introduced by the GAA this year means black cards cannot be appealed until a player accumulates three, resulting in a one-game suspension.
Tyrone have no new injury worries heading into their first championship meeting with Mayo on Saturday (16:00 BST) since the 2013 All-Ireland SFC semi-final.
Donegal play All-Ireland champions Dublin in the second part of Saturday's quarter-final double bill (18:00 BST).
