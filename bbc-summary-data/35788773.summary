Carl Frampton: Belfast boxer set to fight Santa Cruz

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carl Frampton is set to move up a division to fight Mexican Leo Santa Cruz for the WBA world featherweight title this summer.

The Belfast man is the current IBF and WBA world super-bantamweight champion.
Showtime announced on Friday that Frampton and Santa Cruz have "agreed to a championship match-up to be scheduled for late summer".
If the fight goes ahead Frampton would have to relinquish his WBA super-bantamweight belt.
Frampton has been ordered to defend his WBA title against Guillermo Rigondeaux by 27 July.
However, Frampton's manager Barry McGuigan has consistently ruled out the Cuban as a possible opponent while saying that a showdown with WBA featherweight champion Santa Cruz was an "obvious fight".
Frampton, 28, outpointed Scott Quigg on last month to add the WBA world title to his IBF belt.
