Maxine Benson guilty of murdering Alfie Stone after pasta row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who stabbed a teenager to death in a row over a pasta meal outside a supermarket has been found guilty of murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maxine Benson, 33, attacked 18-year-old Alfie Stone after claiming either he or his older brother had eaten her food.
Mr Stone was stabbed in the heart outside the Tesco Express in High Road, Ickenham, west London, on 9 November last year.
Benson was found guilty of murder after a trial at the Old Bailey.
The court heard Benson was filmed on CCTV wielding the knife. Passers-by rushed to give the victim first aid but he died hours later.
A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as blood loss and a stab wound to the heart.
Steven Hawgood, 29, and his girlfriend, Corinne Cripps, 28, were cleared of murder.
However, the jury is continuing their deliberations regarding an alternative charge of manslaughter.
Benson, of no fixed address, was remanded in custody ahead of a sentencing hearing.
