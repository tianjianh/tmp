BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra to recreate Beethoven 'marathon'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In December 1808, one of the most famous concerts in music history was given in Vienna's Theater an der Wien.

It was a four-hour marathon of Ludwig van Beethoven's music, including the world premieres of his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies.
One of the attendees wrote that he "experienced the truth that one can easily have too much of a good thing."
Now music fans will get to judge for themselves, when the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra recreates the show.
The three-hour concert will form part of the orchestra's 2016/17 season, its first under Thomas Dausgaard.
The Danish conductor takes over from Donald Runnicles in September, and his first programme underlines his commitment to new music.
Five new pieces have been commissioned under the banner Scottish Inspirations, which will "showcase the work and ideas of composers energised by Scotland and Scottish identity".
They include FÃ¨in-Aithnem, a new work by Glasgow's Jay Capperauld, whose title is Gaelic for the phrase "self-identity". Helen Grimes has taken inspiration from two pictures by Scottish artist Joan Eardley for her piece.
As well these new works, Dausgaard will launch the season with Anton Bruckner's Ninth Symphony, delivering the Scottish premiere of a recently-completed version of the famously unfinished work.
The season will conclude next year with a celebration of Haydn and Mahler.
"I am extremely excited at the prospect of beginning my first season as Chief Conductor with such a wonderful orchestra and a wonderful range of programmes, paying tribute to some of the greatest classical music ever written and also taking fresh inspiration from Scotland," said Dausgaard.
Full details can be found on the SSO website.
Why was it important to reflect Scotland's heritage in your first season?
I had wonderful experiences travelling around in Scotland a few years ago. The wide open spaces, the interplay between land, sky and water, the deep-rooted culture being part of many people's lives - and I was reminded how many artists, writers and composers have taken strong inspiration in this very special corner of the world. How can we keep this inspiration alive today? I had the idea that we could ask national, as well as international, composers to write for us, taking inspiration from something Scottish. I am very happy that this is turning out to become a series of compositions by very significant voices of today - a series which I hope will broaden our perspective on what Scotland is.
How daunting is it to take on Beethoven's 1808 Academy concert? Will it require stamina training?
Yes, it is a kind of marathon! In a way, we musicians have been stamina training from a young age, getting to know many of these works early on. In this concert, it is a combination of demanding stamina and also riding on the energy from the works already performed. The proportions of the works also change as they become parts of something bigger - so Symphony Number Six, which is one of Beethoven's longest, now basically takes the role of an extended overture!
What other piece are you most looking forward to?
We will be performing some amazing programmes, including several premieres, world premieres, UK premieres and Glasgow premieres - like our opening Bruckner Symphony Number 9 in the wonderful complete version. I am really keen to experience how these will be received. But most importantly, I am thrilled about the collaboration with the orchestra and our relationship with the audience.
