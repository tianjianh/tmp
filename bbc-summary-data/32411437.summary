The town of Tonbridge is celebrating the end of World War II in Europe with four days of events next month.
Pam Mills, of the Royal British Legion, is trying to locate as many people as possible from photos of an original street party held in the town on 8 May.
They show children "in fancy dress with smiles on their faces", she said.
"You look at it and you instantly smile and you think, 'that's great, let's do it again'."
The black-and-white photos show residents from the Ives Road, Audley Avenue, Clare Avenue and Pembroke Road areas.
Ms Mills has been using social media and local contacts to get in touch with people connected to the original street party, which will be recreated with an afternoon tea party on 7 May at The Humphrey Bean pub in Tonbridge.
One of the residents at the VE Day party was Billy Gowin, 82, who was 11-years-old.
He said he remembered the day well because his older brother Ted, who was in the Royal Engineers regiment and had been missing, returned home from a German prisoner of war camp just hours before the start of the party.
"My brother was guest of honour at the party... he judged the tug-of-war and lit the bonfire in the evening," he recalled, adding that it was a "very exciting day" as his mother knew that her other sons would also be coming home.
