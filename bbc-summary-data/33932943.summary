The competition, known as the Worlds, has drawn 230 bands from 16 nations, including Canada, the US, Oman, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.
Heats got under way at Glasgow Green on Friday. The winners of the 2015 event will be announced on Sunday.
The competition is the culmination of the week-long Piping Live festival which attracts about 50,000 spectators.
Councillor Archie Graham, chair of Glasgow Life and depute leader of Glasgow City Council, is chieftain for the championships.
He said: "The Worlds have been associated with Glasgow for over 60 years and in that time have become one of the most anticipated events the city hosts each year.
"To have so many bands competing here reinforces Glasgow's global reputation as a warm and welcoming host city.
"There is nothing to compare with the sights and sounds of Glasgow Green during The Worlds."
The 2014 championship was won by Northern Ireland's Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band - its fourth consecutive title and 10th win overall.
