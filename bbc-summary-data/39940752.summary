Leeds police hunt 'giant penis' costume man after assault

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are hunting for a man who was wearing a "giant penis" costume at the time of a serious street assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 26-year-old was left with a shattered shin bone, torn ligaments and a dislocated knee after he was set upon by a group of 10 men in Leeds City Centre, police said.
He required surgery for his injuries.
West Yorkshire Police said one member of the group - thought to have been a stag party - was wearing the "distinctive fancy dress outfit".

The force issued a stock photo of a costume like the one being worn in a bid to get witnesses to contact them.
Appealing for information, Det Con Gaynor Burt said the assault happened at the junction of Albion Street and Boar Lane at 03:00 BST on 2 April.
"The victim was very badly injured in this attack and will still require further surgery," she said.
"While the nature of costume worn by one of the group might be amusing to some, we are hoping that mentioning it will jog someone's memory and assist in tracing those responsible for what was a serious assault that has left the victim with long-term consequences."
The man's attacker was described as white, about 6ft (183cm) tall, with a shaved head, police said. He was wearing a beige or white top.
Another member of the group was described as shorter and of stocky build with black hair. He was wearing red and white T-shirt.ã€€
