CS Sfaxien of Tunisia became the first team to reach the newly expanded group phase of the African Confederation Cup with a 2-0 win over Rail Kadiogo of Burkina Faso on Friday.
The result in Sfax gave Sfaxien, three-times former winners of the Confederation Cup, a 4-1 aggregate win in the second leg of their play-off.
Goals from Maher Hannachi and Karim Aouadhi sealed the victory for the Tunisian side.
On Sunday, JS Kabylie of Algeria are aiming to overturn a 2-0 deficit when they host Confederation Cup holders TP Mazembe of the DR Congo.
The Algerians will be looking to striker Mohamed Boulaouidet who has rescued his club in two earlier qualifying victories.
He scored twice in a 4-0 preliminary-round rout of Liberians Monrovia Club Breweries that overturned a shock three-goal first-leg loss in west  Africa.
Then in the last-32 against Etoile of Congo Brazzaville, he snatched the only goal of the tie in the final minute of the match.
For the second successive season, Mazembe failed to qualify for the Champions League group stage and were demoted to Africa's second tier competition.
The Congolese boast a multi-national squad and Zambia midfielder Nathan Sinkala and Mali centre-back Salif Coulibaly scored against Kabylie in Lubumbashi.
