US must improve TV diversity says Directors Guild of America

US TV series Boardwalk Empire, The Exes and Workaholics are among the worst when it comes to employing female or minority ethnic directors, according to the Directors Guild of America (DGA).

The shows were among the series to be criticised for a lack of diversity behind the camera.
The guild said TV companies must make "a concerted effort" to improve.
The DGA's latest diversity report said 69% of US prime time TV episodes were directed by white men in the last year.
That is unchanged on the previous year. Women directed 16% of all episodes in 2014/15, up from 14% in 2013/14.
Directors from ethnic minorities made 18% of all episodes, up from 17%.
Homeland, The Game and The Following were among the best shows for diversity among directors, the guild said.
DGA president Paris Barclay said: "The uptick in the number of episodes directed by women - modest but hopeful - is just a drop in the bucket of what needs to be done by studios, networks and showrunners before we can begin to realise equal opportunities in television for our members.
"Without employers making a concerted effort to bring a more diverse mix of new entrants to the hiring pool, we won't see meaningful and lasting change."
The DGA analysed 3,900 episodes of 277 series made for TV and cable networks and "high budget original content series" made for on-demand services like Netflix and Amazon.
Twenty-seven series used no female or minority ethnic directors in the last year, it said. Five of those have been listed as having used none in both of the past two annual reports.
The DGA also published a "best of" list, showing that 11 series used female or minority ethnic directors for at least 50% of their episodes in both 2013/14 and 2014/15.
