[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster have received a further boost with the news that forwards Ricky Lutton and Sean Reidy have agreed contract extensions with the province.

Flanker Reidy has signed a two-year deal, while tight-head prop Lutton has extended his stay for another year.
Jared Payne, Stuart Olding and Franco van der Merwe have also committed their futures to Ulster in recent weeks.
The Irish province also announced that back-row forward Marcell Coetzee will begin a three-year deal in the summer.
Reidy joined the province on a short-term contract ahead of the 2014-15 season, but the 26-year-old was restricted to just eight appearances because of injury.
The Irish-qualified back-rower has featured much more heavily this season, lining out 15 times for Les Kiss's side.
Reidy, whose grandfather hails from County Kerry, has been particularly prominent since the turn of the year and has scored three tries in his last four appearances.
Lutton, 29, has amassed 44 Ulster caps to date, including 19 so far this season, and has started the last five games in the absence of Wiehahn Herbst.
"I've really enjoyed being part of this environment over the past few years. We are building something special here and I want to be involved in that and contribute in a positive manner," commented Lutton.

Ulster Director of Rugby Les Kiss said both players had played key roles in the Pro12 and in Europe this season.
"Sean has shown his class this season, particularly over the past couple of months when Chris Henry was unavailable. He has backed himself since he arrived at Ulster and he has developed into a really good player for us in the back row.
"Ricky will provide us with a very viable option at tight-head prop, along with Wiehahn (Herbst) and Rodney Ah You. He has gone from strength to strength for us and he has really stepped up this season and put in some very good performances."
