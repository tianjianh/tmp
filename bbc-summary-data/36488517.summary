A wooden pavilion designed by V&A Dundee architect Kengo Kuma will showcase the city's resurgence at the Pop-Up Cities Expo in Edinburgh.

The showcase of progressive cities is part of the Festival of Architecture 2016.
The 5m by 5m pavilion is made from logs taken from Templeton Woods, north-west of Dundee.
It will come back to the city's Slessor Gardens before being returned to the forest as a bicycle hub.
The trees used in its construction were all wind-blown, not felled, in keeping with the project's design brief of sustainability.
Mike Galloway, Dundee City Council's director of city development, said: "When we were choosing the design for the V&A, I'd done a fair amount of research on Kengo Kuma and I read a number of his books.
"I was very taken with a whole series of pavilions that he had designed over his career, quite fantastic little pieces of design and architecture.
"We were delighted that he agreed and responded so well with the concept of the pavilion that we're erecting."
The pavilion's clear polycarbonate roof exposes its interior to natural light.
The Â£80.1m V&A Dundee museum, designed by the Tokyo-based architect, is expected to open in 2018.
Kengo Kuma said: "The trunks are stacked up randomly to create a structure inspired by firewood logs.
"Our aim was to create an environment that communicates the roughness and warmth of timber to sit in harmony with its environment and peripheral scenery."
The Pop-Up Cities Expo takes place in Edinburgh from 21 June to 17 July.
