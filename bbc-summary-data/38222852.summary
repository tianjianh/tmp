Reilly, of Maunders Place, trained to be a football coach as part of a community programme run by Exeter City Football Club.
The court heard character references from the club's Head of Community Jamie Vittles as well as Exmouth Town manager Richard Pears.
Reilly had been driving his car around Exmouth town centre for 10 minutes which Judge Graham Cottle of Exeter Crown Court said made clear he'd "obviously been following her".
The judge said: "Eventually you tried to grab her. You grabbed her between the legs, pulling her into your car. I am not sure exactly how long she remained kidnapped but it was a few minutes before she was able to affect her release."
Reilly had spent the afternoon looking at sex and prostitution websites before he went out in his car in the early hours of the morning.
Prosecutor Peter Coombe said the evidence of Mr Reilly's internet use in the hours before the incident suggested he may have been planning an attack or abduction.
Reilly was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years.
