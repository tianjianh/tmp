A Senegalese man has died after setting himself on fire on Monday outside the official residence of President Macky Sall in the capital, Dakar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheikh Mbaye, 32, apparently said that life was better under ex-President Abdoulaye Wade, local media report.
He died in hospital where he was treated for burn wounds.
It is the first case of self-immolation in Senegal, a stable democracy hit by high unemployment, since Mr Sall beat Mr Wade in elections last year.
Mr Mbaye arrived at the presidential gates on Monday doused in flammable liquid and then burnt himself.
Local media quoted him as telling witnesses that life was better under Mr Wade, who failed to secure a controversial third-term in fiercely-contested elections last year.
There were at least two acts of self-immolation during Mr Wade's presidency.
In February 2011, former soldier Bocar Bocoum died after setting himself on fire outside the presidential residence.
He apparently carried out the act as part of demands for compensation for military injuries.
A man also set himself on fire in front of the presidential residence in 2008.
There have been similar acts of self-immolation in several African countries, including Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria and Senegal's neighbour, Mauritania.
