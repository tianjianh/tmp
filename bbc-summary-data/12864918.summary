Officers have an extension until Monday to question a man being held over Miss O'Callaghan's murder.
Miss O'Callaghan's body was found in Oxfordshire after Thursday's arrest.
Thousands of people gathered in Swindon on Saturday night for a vigil for the 22-year-old, at which Chinese lanterns and balloons were released.
Miss O'Callaghan had not been seen since leaving a nightclub in Swindon early on the morning of Saturday 19 March.
The suspect, named locally as taxi driver Christopher Halliwell, was arrested at a supermarket on suspicion of kidnap and two murders on Thursday morning.
Miss O'Callaghan's body was found at White Horse Hill, Uffington, Oxfordshire, after her suspected killer guided detectives to the spot.
He also directed them to Eastleach, Gloucestershire, where a search for the second body was started.
The remains were found on Saturday morning.
Det Supt Steve Fulcher, of Wiltshire Police, said officers had been told the remains were those of a woman abducted in Swindon between 2003 and 2005.
They have yet to be formally identified.
Det Supt Fulcher told a news conference on Saturday an examination of Miss O'Callaghan's body revealed that she had not been sexually assaulted.
Further tests, which could take some time, were still required on her body to determine the cause of death, he said.
Det Supt Fulcher said the suspect had indicated that he had killed another young woman at some point between 2003 and 2005.
"He couldn't be specific about the dates or the year but he was able to give me the exact location of the body," he said.
"He told me that a young woman had been taken by him from the Swindon area."
He appealed for anyone who had been "lamping" or poaching in the Ramsbury area of Wiltshire or nearby from 0300 BST on Saturday 19 March to contact the force if they had seen anything suspicious, or a green Toyota Avensis.
He stressed officers were not interested in prosecuting anyone for poaching.
Hundreds of Chinese lanterns and balloons were launched into the sky on Saturday evening during an event in Swindon in memory of Miss O'Callaghan. Thousands of people gathered at the town's Polo Ground for a two-minute silence.
Team mates also stood in silence on Saturday afternoon at the club where she played bowls.
A Wiltshire Police spokeswoman said floral tributes placed outside the Suju nightclub by Miss O'Callaghan's friends and well-wishers were being moved from the doorway because the club planned to re-open.
Miss O'Callaghan's family had agreed that the tributes could be moved, she added.
