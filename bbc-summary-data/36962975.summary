The 26-year-old joined from Lokomotiv Moscow for Â£13.5m but has failed to score in his 152 minutes on the pitch.
The Senegalese has not appeared in any of Everton's pre-season fixtures.
Winger Aiden McGeady, forwards Conor McAleny and Leandro Rodriguez and defender Luke Garbutt are also among those not assigned a number.
Republic of Ireland international McGeady featured briefly in Everton's first two pre-season games, but did not travel to Germany for the club's two fixtures in Dresden.
He spent the final four months of last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.
