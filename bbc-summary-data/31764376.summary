What the Newsbeat election survey says about you

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No-one has ever asked this number of 18 to 24-year-olds about British politics in the run-up to a general election before.

ComRes interviewed 6,345 people for Newsbeat during February.
They answered questions ranging from the big issues they think politicians should focus on to which leader you would go to the pub with on a night out.
The results give us a good idea of what you're bothered about in 2015.
Huddled around tables in a bar in Manchester's Northern Quarter eight young adults spoke to Newsbeat about the survey.
It's the sort of a pub conversation that politicians and their advisers would love to listen in on.
Whether you will vote
The views of our panel often echoed the survey, especially when it comes to actually voting on 7 May.
They put the regular claim that 18 to 24-year-olds being are "apathetic" to rest.
Most of the panel said they would definitely be voting because "it's vital that you take part and have a say".
Jess Taberner, 20, said: "Everyone should vote. Even if it's just 'I don't know who to vote for but I'll just put a tick in any box' because then at least they'd have a right to moan."
The survey suggests 47% of 18 to 24-year-olds will definitely vote or are "very likely to" while 15% said they definitely won't or are "very unlikely to vote".
Also in Manchester, Tom Bishop talked about his "desire for change" but he also challenged others in the room about the value of voting.
He thinks the parties standing don't reflect his views and that voting simply hands more power to the politicians he wants to see out of a job.
Compared to older voters, you seem to care more about keeping the cost of your shopping down, improving education and being able to afford to buy your own house.
But one of the biggest worries for people around the table: housing.
This reflects the 24% of 18 to 24-year-olds who raised it as a top priority for government in our survey.
Emily Yates, 23, told us why she had moved from the south east to Leeds. "[It was] pretty much all because of rent prices," she said.
We know that in England the number of people under 35 owning their own home has been falling in recent years, while the number renting privately has been rising.
Heads also nodded when it came to the price of everyday items such as food, travel and energy bills. One-in-three people see it as a priority.
According to the survey, 18 to 24-year-olds also care a great deal more about education compared to others who will be voting in May.
You're nearly three times more likely than your parents to say what happens in schools, colleges and universities should be a top priority for whoever wins power.
Emily, a wheelchair user, explained how she regularly uses the NHS and is worried about parts of it becoming privatised.
In fact, worries about the future of the NHS featured prominently.
Jess said: "I got diagnosed with bipolar three months ago but I've not received anywhere near the right level of care."
Meanwhile, only around a 10th of people picked out online piracy, youth services and drugs policy as the main priorities.
A chunky 64% said that politics is an effective way to make a difference to the country. But then half of the people surveyed said they haven't yet registered to vote. Why?
Well, there seems a clear disconnect between how important you think politics is and the people who are currently in politics.
Of those who said they were unlikely to vote, 30% said it was because they didn't know enough about the candidates and the issues.
Thirty-eight per cent of you didn't know which party leader to trust.
But you did seem to know who you would go to the pub with... it's the man who is often seen with a pint on polling day, UKIP leader Nigel Farage. 21% of the people surveyed said they thought he'd be the most fun on a night out.
The online survey took place between 5 and 23 February, 2015
