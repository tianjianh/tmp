[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The trouble between a "small number" of inmates on one wing of the facility, near Doncaster, was quelled overnight, the Prison Service said.
One prisoner was injured but did not require hospital treatment. No staff were hurt.
HM Inspectorate of Prisons found "high" levels of violence in its latest inspection of the jail in February.
About 1,000 inmates are held at the Category C prison, one of whom is reportedly former England footballer Adam Johnson.
Johnson was jailed for six years for grooming and engaging in sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.
