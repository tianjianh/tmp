Hay, a former world champion himself, has worked with Muirhead, Anna Sloan, Vicki Adams and Sarah Reid for the past four years.
His departure is part of a major overhaul which will also see the replacement of Reid, who came into the team in place of Claire Hamilton.
Muirhead's rink were world champions  in 2013 and won a 2014 Olympic bronze.
In all they won seven medals at World and European Championships during Hay's time as coach and four prestigious Grand Slam events in Canada.
But they failed to make the semi-finals of the recent World Championships in Saskatchewan, with seven wins from their 11 round-robin games.
The decision comes less than two years before the next Winter Olympics in Korea, with Hay urging Muirhead's rink to go on and win gold.
"It has been an enjoyable and, most of the time, a successful journey for both the girls and myself over the past four years," said Hay.
"Eve, Anna, Vicki, Sarah and Claire (not forgetting our outstanding fifths Lauren Gray and Rachel Hannan) are totally professional, very committed and talented athletes who have been a pleasure to work with both on and off the ice.
"I wish all the girls the very best for the future and hope they have continued success and go on to obtain the ultimate goal of gold at the 2018 Olympics."
Muirhead said no decisions have been made yet about replacements for Hay and Reid and they "will consider our options over the next month".
"We must say a heartfelt thank you to both Sarah and Dave who have given so much of themselves to the team and we take that contribution with us," she said.
"It's been a total pleasure working with Sarah for the last two seasons and she has brought a lot to the team. We consider her a great friend and a great curler and wish her the very best for whatever she decides to do next.
"No longer working with Dave is going to be a real shake-up for us as a team as he has been our coach for the last four years. He is a fantastic coach and has been an inspiring and committed member of our team for the last four years."
