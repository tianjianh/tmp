Macedonia profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Television is Macedonia's most popular news medium. Public networks face stiff competition from commercial stations, which dominate the ratings.

An EU-sponsored report says the broadcasting market is overcrowded. There are scores of TV and radio networks. Many local broadcasters are struggling to survive financially, says the report.
The newspaper market is small. A regional media watchdog says many titles get by with financial help from the government or business groups.
Most private media are tied to political or business interests and state media tend to support the government, says US-based Freedom House.
The issue of media freedom burst dramatically into the public arena in May 2015, when the country's opposition leader accused the government of illegally wire-tapping around 100 journalists to cement control over the media. It was the latest revelation in a long-running scandal that Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski blamed on foreign spies.
In 2009, Macedonia was ranked 34th on the Press Freedom Index published by watchdog Reporters Without Borders. Six years later, it had dropped to number 117.
There were 1.3 million internet users by December 2013 (Internetworldstats.com). Facebook is the leading social media platform.
