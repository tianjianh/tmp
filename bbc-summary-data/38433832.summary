[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 0-1 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Green's 11th goal of the season helped Mansfield keep their play-off ambitions alive with a 1-0 victory away at Blackpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Green took advantage of a loose pass by Clark Robertson on the half-hour mark to earn a first win in six attempts for the Stags.
Mansfield then defended their lead resolutely and limited the Seasiders to chances few and far between.
Blackpool had started brightest, with Kelvin Mellor seeing a header cleared off the line on 20 minutes, before Green put the visitors ahead against the run of play with the aid of a deflection.
Krystian Pearce and Mal Benning both tested Sam Slocombe with long-range efforts as Mansfield grew in confidence, but Armand Gnanduillet should have levelled for Blackpool on 39 minutes when he headed Brad Potts' cross wide.
Pearce was close to doubling Mansfield's lead when he headed Joel Byrom's free-kick just over on 48 minutes.
The lacklustre home side had two penalty appeals waved away in the closing stages after claiming for a foul and a handball involving Kyle Howkins.
