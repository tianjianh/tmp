The 33-year-old pulled up while fielding on the final day and left the ground to undergo scans in hospital.
Clarke also needed treatment on Tuesday on his long-term back injury after retiring hurt while batting.
"There is a chance I will never play again." he told a news conference.
"I hope that is not the case, but you have to be realistic as well."
Clarke suffered the injury in his right hamstring in the 44th over of India's second innings at the Adelaide Oval on Saturday as he attempted to bend down to pick up the ball while fielding.
"I have had my scans and the results are not great," he said.
"They have shown a tear and I can pretty confidently say I won't take part in this Test series.
"I will wait for the experts' advice and opinions on what I need to do to get back out onto the park."
He had injections to relieve spasms in his back while batting on the first day, but returned to the crease the following day to complete a century.
Clarke was a doubt for the first Test, which was due to start at the Gabba on 4 December, with the left hamstring injury he sustained playing against South Africa in November.
However, the Brisbane Test was rescheduled following the death of Australia cricketer Phillip Hughes on 27 November, and Clarke says he was determined to play in the Adelaide Test, the first match after Hughes's death.
"I have no regrets about playing this Test and I have no regrets about going back onto the field after I retired hurt. This was the most important Test match of my career," he said.
Clarke, who has suffered with back injuries since he was a teenager, admits that every match he plays is taking its toll on his body.
"My body in general is always at risk. This is a different hamstring. I have done my left hamstring, the right side of my back, this is my right hammy," he added.
"I have injury concerns at the moment. I have to be honest with myself and have a good hard think about things."
