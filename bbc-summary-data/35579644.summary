Leigh Centurions have turned down two bids for half-back Ryan Brierley from Super League side Huddersfield Giants, reports BBC Radio Manchester.

The 23-year-old was not included in Leigh's squad for the Championship win over Oldham on Sunday.
Brierley, a former Castleford youngster, has scored 81 tries in 66 appearances in the past three seasons.
The Giants are looking to strengthen their squad after Luke Robinson was forced to retire aged 31.
