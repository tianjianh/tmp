Clearwater Seafoods will pay £98.4m for the wild shellfish processor, which is owned by the Beaton family and private equity fund Change Capital Partners.
Macduff, which is based near Peterhead, specialises in scallops, langoustine, whelk and crab.
It operates factories in Mintlaw, Stornoway and Exeter.
It also owns and operates 14 scallop harvesting vessels from its Dumfries facility and employs about 400 people at seasonal peaks.
Under the deal, Macduff will retain its name and operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clearwater.
Macduff was founded in 1987 by the fifth generation of the Beaton family, who have been involved in the seafood industry for more than 120 years.
Nova Scotia-based Clearwater is one of North America's largest seafood companies, employing about 1,400 people.
Macduff said the deal would bring the company access to new markets, investment and opportunities for growth.
Macduff chairman Euan Beaton said: "Having reached our goal of building a £52m business, we had one suitor in mind which shares our vision and values to enable us to accelerate our growth on a global scale.
"This deal is great news for our operations in the UK, bringing investment and access to new markets within an extremely successful and respected business.
"It provides learning and development opportunities for our staff as we share best practice with Clearwater and it gives fishermen access to more markets."
