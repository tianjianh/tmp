Her body was found in Orrell Water Park in Wigan at 02:30 BST, Greater Manchester Police said.
She had been reported missing by her family on Friday night after she failed to return home from Winstanley College, where she studied.
Police said her disappearance was "extremely out of character" and have launched a murder investigation.
Formal identification is yet to take place.
Det Supt Howard Millington said: "This was a brutal attack on a young woman, the type rarely seen in Greater Manchester."
He said officers were trying to find out "what exactly happened", adding that she was found "on the edge of a field".
Police said there was a report that two young women were followed by two men in the area on Thursday.
"We are keeping an open mind about this. However, we would like to hear from anyone who may have any information about any recent incidents of this nature," he said.
"I understand that there will be many people in the community extremely worried, things like this don't happen in Orrell... There will be a large police presence in the area for some time."
