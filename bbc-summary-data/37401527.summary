Two Met Police officers have been placed on restricted duties after social media footage appeared to show a member of the force attacking a car.

The force confirmed a formal complaint was received in relation to the incident in Camden, north London, on Friday.
One officer was filmed striking a car windscreen when the driver refused to get out of the vehicle.
The driver, stopped in a case of mistaken identity, was not arrested.
A Met Police statement released earlier said: "The footage continues to be subject to an investigation by officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) and the driver of the car has been spoken to by these officers.
"The officers involved in the incident have been identified and have been placed on restricted duties."
The incident took place at 17:00 BST on Friday and was circulated on social media on Saturday.
Leon Fontana, 25, told the Press Association he was the driver and the person who filmed the footage.
The police statement added: "Although the investigation is in its early stages, it has been established that the officers stopped the vehicle based on information relating to a man who is of interest to police.
"On conclusion of the incident, the officers identified that the driver was not the man in question and he was not arrested."
The footage showed a man in police uniform pulling at a partially-opened driver's side window, repeatedly telling the driver "get out of the car".
He ordered the driver to get out of the car one more time before saying "you're not allowed to drive it".
When the driver continued to refuse to leave the vehicle the officer hit the driver's side window with what appeared to be a baton.
Meanwhile, a voice from inside the car said: "I've got a licence. I've got a licence. I've got insurance. You're smashing this for no reason."
The officer could then be seen striking the windscreen, shattering the glass before he sliced around the damaged area with what looked like a cutting tool.
