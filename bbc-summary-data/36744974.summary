The 34-year-old was released by AFC Wimbledon shortly after scoring a penalty in their fourth-tier play-off final victory over Plymouth in May.
He asked managers to "hit me up on WhatsApp" in his post-match interview.
Gareth Ainsworth is the boss to have heeded the call for the 16-stone man, who has 143 career league goals.
The cult hero, who counts Gillingham, Northampton and Barry Town among his various former clubs, admits himself that he is not the "typical footballer size-wise".
But his physique has made one of the most recognisable English players outside the Premier League.
It has also led him to being known worldwide as the strongest man on the video game 'Fifa', as well as prompting him to release his own 'Beast Mode' clothing line.
Ainsworth told the club website: "Bayo has had a phenomenal career and still has plenty to offer, not just on the pitch but also in the changing room because of his character and real leadership qualities.
"He's kept himself fit over the summer and joins the squad at a perfect time just as we're heading out to France for a pre-season training camp which will help everyone get to know each other better and enable us to put more plans in place for the year ahead."
