[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There will be a family fun day as part of the opening celebrations at the Nova Centre in Prestatyn, including children's activities and a chance to visit the new fitness suite.
The centre has been shut for nearly two years after the trust running it on behalf of the council folded.
Television presenter Gethin Jones will open the centre at 17:00 GMT, with activities taking place from 12:00.
The centre had been expected to open in autumn 2015.
