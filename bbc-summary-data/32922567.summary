A woman has spoken of her grief at seeing her daughter's body exhumed after post-mortem examination errors.

New tests were ordered more than a year after Gemma Wilks died because a report said she had a "normal" gallbladder, an organ she had actually had removed.
The 23-year-old's mother Carrie Wilks, from Lincoln, spoke after an inquest into her death on Thursday.
New tests showed Gemma's death, in July 2013, related to a therapeutic drugs overdose, the Lincoln inquest heard.
Coroner Stuart Fisher had ordered the exhumation, in September last year, after errors with initial post-mortem tests indicated Gemma's cause of death was heart disease.
Speaking about the exhumation, Ms Wilks said: "It was horrible - her coffin had collapsed so they had to move her into a body bag.
"It was just really eerie - even though the staff were lovely - it wasn't something any mum should have to go through."
Gemma's body was only exhumed after her mother questioned some of the details of the initial post-mortem report.
Ms Wilks said the family's grief had been made worse because they believed Gemma had "had a massive heart attack".
She said they were told "Gemma's heart was like that of a 60 year old," adding it was "really distressing to think she died on her own in agony".
Gemma had previously been diagnosed with chronic pain syndrome and a personality disorder, her mother said.
Agreeing with the findings of the second post-mortem examination, Mr Fisher said that in 20 years as a coroner, it was the only exhumation he had ever ordered.
He said it had been necessary in order to establish the facts.
