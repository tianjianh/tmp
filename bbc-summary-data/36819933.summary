Lincoln Red Imps will not be fazed as they defend a 1-0 lead at Celtic Park in Champions League qualifying on Wednesday, says captain Roy Chipolina.

The semi-professional side from Gibraltar stunned the Scottish champions last week thanks to a second-half goal from striker Lee Casciaro.
"We're living the dream," the defender told BBC Scotland.
"There was no pressure on us before the first leg, so there is probably even less pressure this time."
Brendan Rodgers' side remain strong favourites to progress but Chipolina and many of his team-mates have experience of playing in front of big crowds and they are revelling in the attention after making the headlines.
Enfield-born Chipolina, 33, is also the Gibraltar captain and played against Scotland, Germany, Poland and Republic of Ireland in the qualifying group for Euro 2016.
"It's a big ask because you can't begin to compare the teams," added Chipolina.
"But at the end of the day it's 11 v 11 and we'll go out there and give it our best shot.
"All the media attention has been unbelievable. It's all new to us but the lads are enjoying it.
"There was no expectation to look beyond the preliminary round but we've made it to the second round for the second year running."
Despite only having five full-time players, the Red Imps will have a full squad to choose from in Glasgow.
"If we do go through, we might struggle," added Chipolina, who works as a customs officer.
"I've used up all my special leave and now I'm into my annual leave."
The winners of the tie play Zalgiris Vilnius or Astana in the next round, with a play-off round to follow to reach the group stage of the Champions League.
Lithuanian side Zalgiris and Astana are tied at 0-0 ahead of the deciding leg in Kazakhstan.
Astana made it to the group stage last season, drawing at home with Benfica, Galatasaray and eventual runners-up Atletico Madrid.
