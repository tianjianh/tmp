England fast bowler Mark Wood has been rested for the third Test against Pakistan in Sharjah to protect a chronic ankle problem.

The 25-year-old Durham seamer, who took six wickets in the opening two matches of the series, could be replaced in the side by fellow paceman Liam Plunkett or all-rounder Samit Patel.
England are 1-0 down in the three-match series after losing the second Test by 178 runs.
The final Test begins on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Pakistan fast bowler Imran Khan has also been ruled out after he suffered a hand injury in fielding practice.
Team manager Intikhab Alam said: "Khan hurt his bowling hand and a finger so he was sent to hospital, where he got four stitches and he will take 10 days to recover."
England all-rounder Ben Stokes said it was a good decision to rest Durham team-mate Wood.
"He's obviously frustrated, it's something that has hampered him for a bit of time now, but it's all about managing him because England want to get the best out of him," said Stokes.
"If they feel giving him a rest now and again will help that until his ankle's not a problem any more, it should be a good call."
England came close to holding out for a remarkable draw in the last Test, and were bowled out with only 6.3 overs remaining.
Asked about coming so close, Stokes responded: "We're a team who's used to being written off by the public and certain media, so we were proud of how close we nearly got to doing that.
"I think Trevor Bayliss [England coach] said that's the longest Pakistan have ever had to bowl in the fourth innings in the UAE. We tried really hard and unfortunately we couldn't get over the line. But we're concentrating on this one now."
