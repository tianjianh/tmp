Contingency plans for Edinburgh pupils exams in place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Contingency plans have been put in place for all Edinburgh pupils affected by the recent schools closures who are due to take exams in May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All pupils will sit their exams in the schools they are currently attending.
Royal High, Drummond and Firrhill pupils will use their own schools.
Gracemount and Craigmount students will be sitting their exams at their host schools of Liberton and Tynecastle respectively.
Individual schools will update pupils and parents regarding their specific arrangements.
Seventeen schools built or modernised under the controversial Public Private Partnership arrangement scheme were shut earlier this month over safety concerns.
The council entered into a deal with a specially-formed private company, the Edinburgh Schools Partnership, and construction work was carried out by Miller Construction.
Under the deal, the profit-making company built the schools, runs the buildings and maintains them. The council is, in effect, a tenant.
Children at all 17 schools are now back in the classroom.
Finding alternative accommodation has been a major logistical operation and some youngsters face lengthy journeys to temporary sites.
Some form of investigation or inquiry into the debacle is expected to be launched after the Scottish election.
