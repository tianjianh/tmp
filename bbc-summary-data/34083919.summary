Police have started an inquiry after a formal complaint was made over alleged remarks aimed at winger Nick Blackman.
Portsmouth FC chief executive Mark Catlin said supporters had backed the investigation "wholeheartedly".
He said anyone found guilty would face a "severe ban" but stressed at this stage nothing had been proven.
Mr Catlin said: "It's important to point out our fans are disgusted at even the thought that anyone may have said something.
"We've taken a lot of statements from stewards and are looking through CCTV but it's really difficult as the information is patchy."
He said the alleged chant came from the family section in the lower section of the south stand.
Reading winger Nick Blackman appeared to be unhappy about something that happened while he was taking a throw-in during the first half of their 2-1 victory.
He spoke to officials following the incident at Fratton Park.
Reading assistant manager Kevin Keen said after the game that there had been a "couple of incidents with Blackman and the crowd".
He added: "There was something that was said to him in the crowd and the referee has acted very quickly and it was put to bed."
The Football Association is also investigating.
