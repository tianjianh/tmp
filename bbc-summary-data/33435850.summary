Darwen drugs gang: Ex-football boss among jailed dealers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gang of drug dealers, including a former football club manager, have been jailed after they "flooded" a Lancashire town with cannabis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven men were sentenced at Preston Crown Court after what Lancashire Police said was one of their biggest drugs investigations in recent times.
Police said the men circulated a "huge amount" of cannabis in the Darwen area.
Among them was Kenneth Langford, who stepped down as manager of AFC Darwen shortly after his arrest last year.
Two other members of his family were also jailed.
Det Insp Mark Vaughton said: "Between them, the Langfords and their associates have blighted Darwen and the surrounding areas for too long, flaunting their criminal wealth.
"I hope these sentences reassure people that we will act on any information that is passed to us in order to make local communities safer."
