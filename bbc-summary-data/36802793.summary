A man accused of murdering a 13-month-old boy has told a court he returned home from a takeaway to find the boy lying on the floor.

Hardeep Hunjan and partner Ronnie Tayler-Morrison deny killing Noah Serra-Morrison.
Mr Hunjan, 27, told a Luton Crown Court jury he did not harm Noah, and had gone out after putting him to bed on the night of the toddler's death.
The couple, from Luton, previously said Noah fell out of his cot.
Jurors previously heard Noah suffered a catalogue of injuries in the weeks before he died from a "massive" fatal head injury last November.
The court heard his injuries were likely to have been caused by being swung against a wall or floor by his limbs.
Giving evidence, Mr Hunjan told the jury that after putting Noah to bed in their Crawley Road flat, he and Miss Tayler-Morrison, 21, drank vodka and smoked cannabis, checking on the baby from time to time.
Later on he went to get a takeaway and on his return, checked on Noah and saw him out of his cot, lying in the floor.
He said the child's right eye was "half closed", there were "black dots" on his forehead and a red mark under his nose.
Mr Hunjan said he told Miss Tayler-Morrison they should call an ambulance but she refused because she thought if social services found out she had been drinking they would take the baby away.
"Ronnie was screaming and shouting at me saying, 'fix him, fix him'," he said.
Eventually he said she called her sister who told her to call an ambulance.
Noah was taken to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital, where he was pronounced dead in the early hours.
Defence barrister Miss Sally Howes QC asked Mr Hunjan: "Did you injure that child in any way?" to which he replied that he did not.
The pair have also pleaded not guilty to causing or allowing the death of a child and not guilty to cruelty by wilful neglect.
The trial continues.
