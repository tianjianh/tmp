The prince was cheering and smiling as he rolled the plane during a flight along the Isle of Wight coastline in August last year.
The stunt was to promote his Spitfire scholarship which offers training for wounded servicemen and women.
He also met two trainees who are hoping to pilot the aircraft in a Battle of Britain flypast.
Footage of the flight shows the prince open-mouthed and howling in appreciation after his pilot instructor Phil O'Dell takes control and manoeuvres the aircraft.
After landing, Harry - who is an Apache helicopter commander - is heard saying "my first landing in a Spitfire feels quite good" and "all good things must come to an end".
The prince launched the scholarship in February 2014 and it mirrors the training World War Two Spitfire pilots received.
Former Private Nathan Forster, 27 - who was injured in Afghanistan - and Corporal Alan Robinson, 36, an RAF aircraft technician - who lost a leg in a motorbike accident - have been chosen for the course.
The pair are aiming to join an historic aircraft flypast later this year to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Britain.
