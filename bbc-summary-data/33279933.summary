US television network Univision says it is cutting ties with businessman Donald Trump and ending coverage of the Miss USA beauty pageant, which he co-owns.

The network, one of the largest US Spanish-language broadcasters, said it follows the hotel tycoon's disparaging remarks made about Mexicans.
Mr Trump said Mexicans brought drugs and crime to the US, during his announcement last week to seek the Republican presidential nomination.
He is now threatening a lawsuit.
In his speech last week, Mr Trump said of Mexico: "They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people, but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting."
In announcing the breakup, Univision said that his words were "insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants" and said it would not air the Miss USA pageant on 12 July. The company also said it would be severing all business ties with the celebrity businessman.
Mr Trump has said his remarks were a criticism of US lawmakers, not the Mexican people or their government. He has also said that if Univision follows through with its decision it would be in breach of a contract that "has no termination rights".
"We intend to pursue all legal rights and remedies available to Mr Trump pursuant to the terms of the licence agreement as well as a defamation case against Univision," lawyer Michael Cohen said.
Mr Trump also accused the Mexican government of pressuring the network into "laying down".
"They want to silence Donald Trump. And Donald Trump can't be silenced," Mr Trump said in reference to himself.
"Of course I have a signed contract: five years, they have to pay me almost $15m [Â£9.5m]," he said in an interview with the Fox News television network.
Univision has not commented on these remarks.
Cristian de la Fuente, one of the two co-hosts who pulled out of the programme, said: "It's a shame that such an important institution as Miss USA is now in the hands of a clown."
While English-language television network NBC has the primary broadcast rights to the spectacle, Univision was - for the first time - going to simultaneously air the event in Spanish.
Colombian singer J Balvin was set to give a performance that would air on both broadcasts, but has withdrawn from the event.
NBC plans to air the programme despite Univision pulling out.
