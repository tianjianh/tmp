Preston have re-signed Callum Robinson on loan from Aston Villa and extended the loan of Middlesbrough's Adam Reach, both until the end of the season.

Forward Robinson, 20, scored seven goals in 28 games during two spells on loan with Preston last season.
Winger Reach, 22, joined the Lilywhites on a three-month loan in September and has scored twice in 17 appearances.
Meanwhile, manager Simon Grayson said he will look to make further additions to his squad in the transfer window.
Grayson has already signed Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone after Jordan Pickford's loan deal expired.
"We'll try and improve the squad," the 46-year-old told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"We had good news that Adam Reach will sign for the rest of the season now, which is fantastic for Middlesbrough to allow him to come and the lad has done fantastic for us.
"I'm sure he won't be the first of the signings we make over the next few weeks."
