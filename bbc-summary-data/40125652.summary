[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leigh Centurions prop Dayne Weston has announced he will retire from rugby league at the end of the 2017 season to move back to Australia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old Australian was contracted with Leigh until 2019 but will move back for "family reasons".
He joined Leigh last season from Melbourne Storm after spells at Penrith Panthers, North Queensland Cowboys and Cronulla Sharks in the NRL.
"It's time to put the family first," he told the club website.
"My wife was always going to go home with the kids at the end of this year as our youngest is starting school and there's no way I can stay over here for another two years without them.
"I am determined to leave on a high with the club having cemented its place in Super League."
