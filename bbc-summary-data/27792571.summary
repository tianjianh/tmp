Students and staff at the INTO language skills centre in the Haymarket area had to leave the building on Tuesday night.
A bomb disposal team performed a controlled explosion on the Town Moor in the early hours.
An 18-year-old man was arrested in London. The university said the campus was now open as normal.
No-one was reported injured and police said there was no danger to the public.
A spokesman for Newcastle University said: "The INTO building is now open for staff and students following last night's evacuation and we are working closely with Northumbria Police with their on-going inquiries."
Roads in the area reopened before 01:00 BST.
A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: "Residents around Newcastle Town Moor may have heard a slight bang and I would like to reassure them this is in connection with the incident at the University and was planned.
"Inquiries are in the early stages and we are working closely with Newcastle University.
"There is currently no cause for concern for students and the wider community."
Newcastle University caters for more than 22,000 UK and international students and has 1,200 academic staff.
