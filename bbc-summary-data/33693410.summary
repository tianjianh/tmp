A North Sea drilling contractor is set to make more than 100 people redundant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ensco said in a letter to employees that two rigs had been stacked in the shipyard as a result of current market conditions.
The memorandum said: "We are anticipating up to 117 redundancies.
"However, in order to minimise this number, we are implementing a recruitment and promotion freeze and seeking voluntary redundancy."
The rigs involved are the Ensco 70 and Ensco 102.
