The Chinese transfer record was broken on Friday for the third time in 10 days, as Super League side Jiangsu Suning spent Â£38.4m on Alex Teixeira.
Moyes was sacked by United in April 2014 after 10 months in charge, before spending a year at Real Sociedad.
"My heart has always been in the Premier League. I've had an offer to go to China as well," said Moyes, 52.
Moyes - a guest on Saturday morning's Danny Baker show on BBC 5 live - was asked if he could be back in a job next season.

"I think I will," he said. "I have had numerous opportunities, especially since I have come back to England.
"I want to pick the right job, one that really excites me and one I am able to get my teeth into. You want to feel you can manage the way you want to manage."
On the prospect of coaching an international team, Moyes said: "I would have an interest. I have come through all the layers of football.
"If the right international job came I don't think I would say 'no', but at the moment it is club management.
"It is in my blood, I have managed 850 games and I would like to get to 1,000 games."
Asked about reports that former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho's representatives are in talks about the managerial position at Manchester United, Moyes said: "Jose would arguably be up there with the best managers in the world,
"Manchester United is a great football club and I don't think there's any manager in the world who would not want to work for them.
"The big thing is that there is a manager in place. I think it is wrong that we talk about somebody's job. I think we talk too easily in football about men losing their job."
