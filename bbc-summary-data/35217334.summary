Micky Mellon named Tranmere Rovers manager after Shrewsbury Town departure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Micky Mellon has left his position as manager of League One club Shrewsbury Town after two and a half years in charge to become Tranmere Rovers boss.

Struggling Shrewsbury are currently 22nd in League One, having won just twice in 11 games this season.
The ex-Fleetwood manager, 44, has returned to National League Rovers, for whom he featured in more than 200 games during two spells as a player.
Tranmere sacked Gary Brabin on 18 September and are ninth in the table.
Mellon's assistant Mike Jackson has also left Shrewsbury.
Also an ex-Tranmere player, the 42-year-old was Shrewsbury boss for four months prior to Mellon's appointment in the summer of 2014.
Tranmere have had Paul Carden in charge since sacking Brabin and have won just once in seven games.
Mellon guided Shrewsbury to promotion from League Two in 2014-15, his first season in charge, but they finished 20th to narrowly avoid relegation the following year - and he had come under increasing pressure from Town fans in the early weeks of 2016-17.
"Let's be honest, the team hasn't performed to how we would have expected this season," Shrewsbury chief executive Brian Caldwell told BBC Radio Shropshire, following the confirmation of Mellon's departure by "mutual consent".
He added: "We've tried to be as patient as possible with how it's going and I think it's in the best interests of everybody that we make this decision."
Town are now looking for their sixth 'permanent' manager since moving to their Oteley Road home in 2007, and their ninth in Roland Wycherley's 20 years as chairman.
Ex-Bristol Rovers, QPR, Plymouth Argyle, Leicester City, Blackpool, Crystal Palace and Millwall manager Ian Holloway is expected to be a contender, although he is under contract to Sky Sports in his role as their Football League analyst.
Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst, who got the Mariners promoted to League Two last season, is another early name to be linked with the vacancy.
Bookmakers quickly made Steve Cotterill the early favourite for the job, but the much-travelled former Bristol City manager has already contacted BBC Radio Shropshire to rule himself out.
Goalkeeping coach Danny Coyne will take caretaker charge for Saturday's trip to second-placed Bradford City.
