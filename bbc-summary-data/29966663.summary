The two-year-old girl sustained a fractured skull in an attack at her home in Bessbrook on 19 October.
Police in Newry and Mourne said on Friday they had been informed by her family that she had been moved into a normal ward.
A man has been charged in connection with her attempted murder.
Darren Eamon Fagan, 24, from Clonavon Avenue, Portadown, denies the charge.
He has claimed that the child was dropped while being carried up stairs by her mother.
In a post on Twitter, police said the toddler was off most of her medication and was making "fantastic progress".
During a bail application on Wednesday, the High Court heard that the toddler had not regained her sight.
Bail was refused.
Police officers discovered the toddler in a "lifeless" condition at the her family home on 19 October, after they responded to report that a child outside the house was not breathing.
She was then taken to hospital by ambulance.
