Glenn Delaney has left his job as head of rugby operations at London Irish as part of a restructure at the club.

Delaney, an ex-London Irish player, returned in 2012 and had spells as forwards coach and interim head coach before taking the role in 2015.
However, changes have been made to the rugby department following relegation from the Premiership last season.
"The difficulties of relegation have meant that inevitably people have moved on," chief executive Bob Casey said.
He told the club website: "Glenn has been a great servant to London Irish and has been passionate about moving it forward. We will all miss him and wish him and his family well for the future."
Delaney added: "It is unfortunate that my time at London Irish has come to an end. It is a club I hold dear and have many fond memories of.
"The players and staff have been magnificent to work with and I am sure they will serve the club well."
Meanwhile, Samoa back row forward Ofisa Treviranus has extended his contract with the club by two years.
The 32-year-old has made 85 appearances for the Exiles since joining in 2011 and captained his country at the 2015 World Cup in England.
