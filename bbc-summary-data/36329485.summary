A charity has said it is "overwhelmed" after it received more than 20,000 knitted forget-me-nots to mark Dementia Awareness Week.

The 10p-sized flowers have been hand-crafted by volunteers from around the world for the Alzheimer's Society branch in Weston-super-Mare.
The society said its initial appeal for 1,000 forget-me-nots had been "quickly met".
The knitted and crocheted flowers are on display on Weston's Grand Pier.
Hayley Pope, from the society, said: "We started off by asking for 1,000 - which we though was quite achievable - but very soon we were overwhelmed with these little forget-me-nots coming in, so we put the target up to 3,500 to represent the number of people in North Somerset with dementia.
"So many people are affected by dementia, so many people have parents or family members who have dementia - I think everybody really wants to help."
Volunteer Karen Burt said: "It takes seconds to do one.  I've made 300.
"My father suffers from dementia - he's been diagnosed for six years now and it's something that everybody needs to know about it.  It's a horrible disease."
