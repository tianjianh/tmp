Sheeran, who is an ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), donated 21 items for the £10m appeal to build a new hospice in Norfolk.
The highest-valued item was a camouflage hoodie which fetched £990.
Earlier this year, other items of Sheeran's clothing raised thousands of pounds for several charities in Suffolk.
Sheeran, from Framlingham, Suffolk, has just returned to the top of the UK singles chart with Thinking Out Loud, while his latest album X has sold over a million copies in the UK.
EACH began the Nook Appeal earlier this year to build a new centre at Framingham Earl to replace the one at Quidenham in Norfolk.
Sheeran posted a message about the latest auction to his millions of followers on Twitter on 28 November.
He wrote: "I donated all my favourite clothes to @EACH_hospices including all my hoodies."
Also sold on eBay, alongside four hoodies, were a "previously-owned" T-shirt featuring Boba Fett from Star Wars, which fetched £251, and a pair of Adidas trainers, which raised £275.
Simon Hempsall, marketing manager for EACH, said: "We're extremely grateful to Ed for this fairly unique fundraising opportunity for the Nook Appeal and have been blown away by the response to the auction - helped in no small way by him tweeting it to his 11.4 million followers."
