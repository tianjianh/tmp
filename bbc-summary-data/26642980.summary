Colman was recognised for her role in hit ITV series Broadchurch - which won best drama serial - and her portrayal of single mum Carol in Channel 4's Run.
Idris Elba was named best actor for BBC One's Luther.
Channel 4's Educating Yorkshire won best documentary series at the London ceremony.
The hit programme was described by judges as "enormously watchable".
Colman also picked up the RTS best actress award in 2013 for her portrayal of a mum whose son is shot by a gangster in Jimmy McGovern's The Accused.
This year, the judges described her as being at "the very top of her game".
The actress collected her award on stage without her shoes, saying: "I kicked them off under the table and forgot to put them back on."
Run also won the drama writing award for Marlon Smith and Daniel Fajemisin-Duncan.
James Corden and Mathew Baynton, with Tom Basden, won best comedy writing for BBC Two's The Wrong Mans.
Other winners at this year's event included Brendan O'Carroll, who picked up best comedy performance for Mrs Brown's Boys. Coronation Street won best soap/continuing drama.
Stephen Fry was named best presenter for his series Stephen Fry: Out There, broadcast on BBC Two, in which he travelled to a number of countries to examine how they treat their gay communities.
In his acceptance speech, he paraphrased Winston Churchill, saying: "I think you can judge a civilisation by the way it treats its minorities."
BBC Two's Peaky Blinders, about a criminal gang set in 1919 Birmingham, won best drama series.
Best entertainment show went to Channel 4's The Last Leg, which first aired as a nightly alternative review of each day of the London 2012 Paralympic Games.
Alan Carr was recognised in the best entertainment performance category for his chat show on Channel 4, Alan Carr: Chatty Man.
He beat big Ant and Dec - nominated for both Britain's Got Talent and Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway on ITV - and Leigh Francis for Celebrity Juice and Through the Keyhole.
The Challenger - the story of how Richard Feynman helped to discover the cause of the Challenger disaster - was named best single drama, while Game of Thrones was honoured with the best international programme award.
David Suchet, star of the long-running TV series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was honoured with a lifetime achievement award but was unable to attend the event at the Grosvenor House hotel after feeling unwell before the ceremony.
Outgoing BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow was given the judges' award for her achievements with the channel.
She commissioned shows like Miranda and The Great British Bake-Off during her six years in the role.
