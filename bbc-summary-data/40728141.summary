An abandoned Leeds viaduct could be transformed into a "high line", akin to walkways in New York and Paris.

The Holbeck Viaduct Project aims to reopen the mile-long structure, which starts near Granary Wharf in the city centre and ends close to Elland Road.
It is hoped the Victorian walkway, unused since 1988, would be used as a park, a pedestrian route and more.
Initial studies found £2m would need to be raised to allow the project to go ahead by 2023.
The team behind it said the launch of a pre-feasibility report was the culmination of a year's work, with further talks with landowners Network Rail and Leeds City Council now hoped to take place.
Other mooted uses for the walkway include allotments, public art spaces, children's play areas and a market space.
John Paddington, from the Holbeck Viaduct Project, said the report proved the scheme was "very much feasible".
"It's really great to see the huge interest the viaduct project generates and this is shown by the support we get and the people willing to volunteer their time to develop the project," he said.
"We're now looking forward to discussions with Network Rail about working in partnership to deliver a full feasibility report in the next year or so."
The scheme echoes the well-known High Line in New York and Promenade Plantée in Paris, but wants to "reflect Leeds and its local communities" according to the team behind the plans.
