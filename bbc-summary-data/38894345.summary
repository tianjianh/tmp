Martin Caceres: Southampton close to ex-Juventus defender deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southampton are close to agreeing a deal to sign former Barcelona and Juventus centre-back Martin Caceres.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Uruguayan, 29, will complete a move once a work permit has been granted and other formalities are concluded.
Caceres, who has 68 caps for his country, left Juventus in the summer and can join Saints as a free agent.
He will provide cover after Virgil van Dijk was ruled out for up to three months with an ankle problem and Jose Fonte left for West Ham.
It will be a short-term deal until the end of the season.
Caceres made 77 appearances for the Italian champions across three spells, winning the Serie A title four times.
He has also played for Barcelona - winning La Liga in 2009 - and Sevilla in the Spanish top flight.
However, he has not made a competitive appearance since last February after suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon.
