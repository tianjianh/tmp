Joshua Titcombe death: Midwife Lindsey Biggs struck off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A midwife whose failings contributed to the death of a baby boy has been stuck off.

Lindsey Biggs was one of those caring for newborn Joshua Titcombe at Barrow's Furness General Hospital, in Cumbria, in November 2008.
An investigation later found she and a colleague had committed a string of errors causing him to "lose a significant chance of survival."
Ms Biggs has now been banned from working as a midwife.
The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) tribunal heard there was a "high risk" she would repeat the same mistakes again if allowed to practise.
Joshua, from Dalton-in-Furness, was nine days old when he died after suffering pneumococcal septicaemia and a lung haemorrhage.
Ms Biggs was among a number of employees investigated after an inquest heard staff repeatedly missed chances to spot and treat a serious infection which led to his death.
She had failed to tell a paediatrician the baby had a low temperature and to ensure three-hourly observations were made on him.
The tribunal ruled she fell "well below" the standards expected of a registered midwife.
Chairman Stuart Gray said she had caused "actual harm" to Joshua and "emotional harm" to his mother.
She further showed an "attitudinal problem", "a profound and sustained lack of insight" and a "distinct lack of remorse" for her actions, he added.
Joshua's father, James Titcombe, said all the family had wanted was to prevent others going through the "same agony".
"Instead we faced years of dishonesty and deceit. Not only has this made our grief so much harder, it has meant that other mothers and babies have been put at risk."
An NMC spokesman said: "The independent panel clearly recognised that should she remain on the register Ms Biggs would pose a significant risk to the public, therefore it is right that she has been struck off."
In August, fellow midwife Holly Parkinson - who was also involved in Joshua's care - was suspended by the council for nine months for not referring matters to a paediatrician.
A number of other hearings involving midwives who worked for the trust are under way.
