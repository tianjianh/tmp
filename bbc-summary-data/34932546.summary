He was attacked by four men in Stewartfield Grove, East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, and chased into McLean Crescent at 23:00 on Tuesday.
The victim was then forced into a car, driven for more than 30 minutes and dumped in Slamannan, near Falkirk.
He is being treated for injuries to his head, hands and feet and is in a serious but stable condition.
Det Insp Kevin Jamieson, who is leading the investigation, said "This was a particularly violent and terrifying attack in a residential area which was witnessed by members of the local community.
"The victim is still receiving treatment in hospital and as a result has been unable to assist officers with their inquiries so far.
"It is of utmost importance that we trace the men responsible as soon as possible and I am appealing directly for every person who may have witnessed what happened to contact police."
Det Insp Jamieson said police believed the incident was a "targeted attack" and officers were working to establish a motive.
He added: "I would also ask anyone who was in the Slamannan area and saw the car or anything suspicious to get in touch.
"No matter how insignificant you think your information might be, let us be the judge of that, because it could turn out to be vital to our investigation."
He said there would be additional officers in the Stewartfield area of East Kilbride if anyone wanted to speak.
Police said the car used in the attack was dark-coloured and the victim was dumped in the Brownrigg Road area of Slamannan.
