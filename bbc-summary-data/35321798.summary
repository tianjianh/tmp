[SN]TITLE[SN]
Harris Tweed mill in Lewis could go into administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of three Harris Tweed mills in Lewis could go into voluntary administration next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Carloway Mill employs 27 people and provides yarn to 30 weavers.
A Chinese textile company invested in the business in 2013 but hopes of expanding into the Chinese market have not been realised.
The mill's owners said the cost of its raw material had increased by 35% and weavers' wages had risen but the price of tweed had fallen by 10%.
They added that the business had a full order book and would seek voluntary administration to give the site and its jobs some protection.
