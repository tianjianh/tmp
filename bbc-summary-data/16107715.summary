Tests on 3kg of suspected drugs, found on a plane being dismantled at Cotswold Airport, Wiltshire, have shown it to be cocaine.

The haul was found in October, hidden behind a panel of a toilet, by Air Salvage International (ASI) engineers taking apart a scrapped jumbo jet.
The UK Border Agency carried out tests on the packages and has launched an investigation.
A spokesman said it had an estimated street value of up to Â£300,000.
Each parcel measured 20 cm by 13 cm (8 in by 5 in) and each was found wrapped in plastic and black gaffer tape.
Air Salvage International dismantles aeroplanes at Cotswold Airport, whose runway crosses the Wiltshire/Gloucestershire border. It is the largest specialist breaker in Britain.
