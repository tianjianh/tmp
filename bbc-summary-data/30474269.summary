The 33-year-old says his career could be over after his latest injury, which he suffered in a win over India in the first Test of their series.
Australian team doctor Peter Brukner said Clarke had "substantial damage to a key part of the hamstring tendon".
Steve Smith will captain Australia for the rest of the Test series against India, Cricket Australia has announced.
The length of Clarke's absence is unclear ahead of February's World Cup, which will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.
"His recovery and the timing of his return to play will be dependent on the surgeon's advice and how well he recovers in the coming weeks," added Brukner.
Smith will become Australia's 45th and third-youngest Test captain when the second Test starts in Brisbane on Wednesday.
"It's something that I've always dreamt of doing," said the 25-year-old all-rounder. "It's an amazing thrill."
Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, who was expected to get the captaincy, has been named as vice-captain.
Chairman of selectors Rod Marsh said Smith was highly regarded not just for his batting but also his "maturity and clear leadership potential".
Smith, who has played just 23 Tests and has previously captained New South Wales, scored 162 not out and 52 not out in the recent first-Test victory over India in Adelaide.
