The visitors have only one win in their last 10 games - a run that included the departure of Mark Goldberg as manager.
Fowler netted Wrexham's first with the header from Mark Carrington's cross.
Jennings struck from the penalty spot after he had been tripped by Paul Rodgers and sent Bromley to a loss that dropped them down to 15th in the table.
