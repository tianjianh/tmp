[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 69-year-old, who also broke a leg and wrist at St Sunday Crag, was taken to hospital by helicopter after initial treatment at the valley bottom.
He is expected to make a full recovery, following treatment at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary.
Mike Blakey, of Patterdale Mountain Rescue, said it was "remarkable given the distance he has fallen".
He also thanked a passing police officer and emergency medical technician who helped the man on Saturday at about 16:00 BST.
