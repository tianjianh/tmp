As in 2012, leading designer Stella McCartney, in collaboration with Adidas, has been selected to create the outfits to be worn by Britain's squad.
On being announced as creative director last year, McCartney promised her designs would deliver "cutting-edge" innovations, "allowing GB athletes to perform to their very best ability on the world's biggest sporting stage".
UK Sport has predicted Britain could win  as many as 79 medals in Rio, where the Games begin on 5 August.
Mo Farah will be attempting to win another Olympic double after taking 10,000m and 5,000m gold in London, while Jessica Ennis-Hill will defend her heptathlon crown.
The 2016 Games have been beset by organisational problems, with Brazil in a deep recession that is affecting all aspects of the Olympics.
Organisers recently had to scrap plans for a 4,000-seater stand at the rowing and canoeing venue as part of a $500m (Â£353m) cost-cutting measure.
The tough economic situation may also be the reason for slow ticket sales to date.
Figures published by BBC Business last month showed just 12-15% of Paralympic tickets and 47% of Olympic tickets had been sold.
Concerns over Zika also remain, with venues to be inspected daily in the lead-up to and during the Games in an attempt to minimise the impact of the virus.
