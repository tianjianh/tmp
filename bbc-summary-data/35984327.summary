[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hedgehog cafe opens in Japan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They've already got cat cafes and rabbit cafes - so it was only a matter of time before a hedgehog café opened up in Tokyo, Japan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People there have to pay around £6 get to spend up to an hour with a hedgehog and customers have been queuing up to get in.
Hedgehogs aren't originally from Japan, so it's a rare to see them.
The owners are hoping the cafe will show people that hedgehogs are actually gentle, and not as spiky as they look.
