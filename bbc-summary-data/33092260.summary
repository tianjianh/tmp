The cylindrical device, which was between six and eight inches long (15-20cm), was discovered at the Scaur at Kirkcolm on Wednesday.
A police spokesman said the small bomb was rusty and resembled a dog bone.
He urged anyone who finds similar devices not to touch them, but to contact Police Scotland as soon as possible with its location.
The spokesman said: "The device has been dealt with and there is no danger to the public.
"However, please be aware when walking along the coastline should any similar devices be found.
"The devices will not explode, however they will burn at high temperatures and emit toxic fumes."
The bomblet may have come from Beaufort's Dyke, a deep trench in the Irish Sea between Scotland and Northern Ireland, which has been used as a munitions dump.
