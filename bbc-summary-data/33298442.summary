The Picton name traces back to 13th Century west Wales, but became world-renowned after 1815 through Battle of Waterloo officer, Sir Thomas Picton.
Retired Surrey scientist Brian Picton Swann has discovered Pictons in North America, New Zealand and Costa Rica while researching his family tree.
Thirty descendants have now met for a reunion in Bluestone National Park.
Mr Picton Swann, who has been researching his family tree since 1967, has used Y-chromosome DNA testing, alongside documentary methods.
He said it is difficult to go far back in Wales using only papers, adding: "We hope to be able to bridge from 1750 back to 1260 by using the latest advances in DNA testing, called Next Generation Sequencing."
