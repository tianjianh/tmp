Garth Brooks: Dublin gigs controversy prompts licensing changes

The Irish government has announced new licensing rules after last year's cancelled Garth Brooks concerts.
The US country star's five gigs at Dublin's Croke Park were scrapped after opposition from residents.
Promoters must now meet with the relevant local authority before applying for an event licence.
Residents living near Croke Park had threatened legal action last year after an initial two planned concerts by Brooks were increased to five due to demand.
They claimed they were not consulted before the organisers announced the extra shows or put the tickets on sale.
The Gaelic Athletic Association, which owns Croke Park, had an agreement with residents that a maximum of three concerts would be held each year in the stadium.
Dublin City Council only granted a three-day licence, leading Brooks to criticise the handling of the controversy and ultimately cancel all of the gigs.
About 400,000 fans had booked tickets.
Now, licence applications from promoters will not be accepted by a local authority unless a consultation has already taken place.
Event promoters will also not be entitled to advertise or sell tickets for events prior to the holding the meeting.
Where tickets have been advertised and sold prior to the holding of a consultation, an application for a licence will not be accepted.
A review group was set up by the Irish government met the four main promoters of outdoor events in Ireland to discuss changes to licensing legislation.
Dublin Chamber of Commerce said the Brooks gigs controversy highlighted a flaw in the Republic of Ireland's licensing laws.
"The Garth Brooks debacle last summer was hugely embarrassing for Ireland and jeopardised our international reputation as a great place to host and attend an event," the chamber's chief executive Gina Quin said.
