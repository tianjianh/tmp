Weymouth Jurassic Coast cliff crack closes path

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A large crack which has opened up on a cliff near Weymouth has closed a path on the Jurassic Coast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The path on the seaward side of the crack has been shut between Bowleaze Cove and Redcliff Point in Preston.
It follows a warning after an inspection by geologists and Dorset County Council's right of way officers.
The South West Coast Path is unaffected but the council said it would continue to closely monitor the area for further movement.
The drop in the cracked section is currently just over 1m (3ft) deep.
Dorset County Council said the area was well-known for landslips "due to its geology of permeable limestone over impermeable clay", and described the Jurassic Coast as "dynamic and always on the move, especially during or after wet and wild weather".
Although the authority said the movement on the Weymouth cliff had been going on for several years, it added the latest slip had "happened quickly".
Sam Rose, Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site team manager, described it as a "natural process that makes the coast such a beautiful place" but urged members of the public to heed the warning signs.
