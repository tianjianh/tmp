Bristol fly-half Adrian Jarvis has announced he will retire at the end of the Premiership season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jarvis, 33, made his professional debut for Harlequins in January 2004, before moving to Bristol in 2008.
He left to join Leeds in 2011 before re-signing for Bristol, where he has scored 933 points in 157 games across his two spells at the club.
"Adrian has been an excellent servant to Bristol Rugby over the years," head coach Mark Tainton said.
"To make over 150 appearances for any club in the competitive era is an impressive achievement and Adrian is held in high regard by myself, the players and supporters.
"Adrian will remain an integral part of our plans for the remainder of the season."
Bristol are currently bottom of the Premiership table, two points behind 11th-placed Worcester.
