Claudia Lawrence's dad calls for missing person 'guardianship' law

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of Claudia Lawrence is calling for more government action to help families manage the affairs of missing people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Lawrence said he wanted relatives of adults missing for more than three months to have "guardianship" of legal and financial matters on their behalf.
Miss Lawrence disappeared on her way to work in York in March 2009.
The Ministry of Justice said it was "crucial we get the legislation right on such a sensitive issue".
Under current law in England and Wales, the disappearance of a person does not affect the ownership or control of their property and affairs.
In March 2015, following a consultation, the Ministry of Justice said it strongly supported changes, but Mr Lawrence said it was not a "top priority" for the department.
After meeting with MPs in Westminster, he said: "I'm extremely disappointed that the Bill hasn't been brought forward and I don't know what has happened to stop it - we need these laws."
Miss Lawrence lived in the Heworth area of York and was 35 when she disappeared.
Four men, in their 50s and from the York area, were arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and have since been released from bail.
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "We are committed to helping families of missing people deal with the administrative problems associated with the disappearance of a loved one.
"Delegating control of another person's property is a significant step.
"It's crucial we get the legislation right on such a sensitive issue and we want to bring forward plans as soon as we can."
