The Royal also edged Antrim in the first encounter but a scoring error resulted in Saturday's replay.
Ciaran Clark and Conor Johnston goals helped Antrim into a 2-8 to 0-6 lead.
Meath fought back after the break to lead but the see-saw encounter went to extra-time and Steven Clynch scored the winning point in the dying seconds.
The Leinster men had already been presented with the cup on 4 June but the GAA later correctly ruled that the final score had been a 2-17 to 1-20 draw.
The teams returned to headquarters and the Saffrons netted at the start and end of the first half to hold an eight-point advantage.
Meath made a blistering opening to the second half, with Neil Heffernan hitting two goals as the Royals moved in front 15 minutes from time.
Antrim responded and McKenna's second goal restored their lead but Clynch netted a third Meath goal and they were three ahead late in added time.
Up stepped Darren Hamill to score a dramatic Saffrons goal to send the match into extra-time.
Gavin McGowan's goal gave Meath a two-point lead at half-time in extra-time.
A fifth Antrim goal, from James Connolly, helped the Ulster team open up a two-point gap with three minutes remaining.
Clynch halved the deficit and he sent over the decisive point after James Toher's leveller.
