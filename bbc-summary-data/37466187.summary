[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southern Railway Seaford to Brighton services restart

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trains are running on a Sussex line for the first time since operator Southern cut its timetable in July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Buses had replaced most trains on the Seaford to Brighton route after the operator cut 341 trains out of 2,242 from its timetable.
Industrial action and staff shortages have hit Southern's services, which link London with the South East.
Southern has apologised to customers for the "hassle and inconvenience" of the reduced timetable.
