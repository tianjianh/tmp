[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An animal rights group is calling for the search for a companion for an  elephant at a safari park in central Scotland to be called off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mondula, known as Mondy, has been on her own at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling since neighbour Toto died aged 46 last March.
The park is now in contact with zoos across Europe.
However, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has called for Mondy to be moved to a sanctuary.
Mondy and Toto had lived together for almost 20 years.
Blair Drummond said that, despite not being the closest of friends, Mondy was affected by Toto's death.
Peta has written to the safari park, pointing out that elephants in nature travel up to 30 miles a day in close-knit family herds and as a result of being kept in a zoo or safari park can suffer from foot and joint ailments.
Peta's senior campaign co-ordinator Kirsty Henderson said: "At a reputable sanctuary, Mondula would be able to enjoy ample space in a more natural environment among dozens of potential companions. Peta stands ready to help Blair Drummond Safari Park find her a new home at a sanctuary with other elephants, where she'd be able to choose the company she keeps."
