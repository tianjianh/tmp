Watching the US Republican debate with Canadians

Tucked away in an upstairs corner of a pub in downtown Calgary, Alberta, a group of American ex-pats and interested Canadians gathered to watch Wednesday night's Republican US presidential debate.

Although they have their own nation's politics to worry about - this western city is hosting a debate for the party leaders on Thursday, and Canadian's general election just over a month away - they were irresistibly drawn to the spectacle of the US event.
"I call American politics my Jersey Shore," says Mike Guadet, referencing the reality television show best known for its train wreck personalities.
"How can you beat those characters? Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina - they're interesting, and they say ridiculous things sometimes, but sometimes they say poetic things."
The native Canadian who works in digital marketing adds that US politics are a lot more consequential on the world stage, "given their size and their military prowess", so a lot of Canadians are tuning in.
As the beer flowed and the debate drew to a conclusion, the consensus among the group of nearly a dozen spectators who came to the event hosted by Democrats Abroad matched fairly closely to the analyses from most US commentators. The crowd was left-leaning, but as Gaudet noted, Conservatives in Canada would probably be Democrats in the US anyway.
Former computer executive Fiorina and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were among the winners, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was underwhelming and Donald Trump was, well, Trump.
"Donald Trump is a sideshow as far as I'm concerned," says Laurel White Johnston, a retired American who has lived in Calgary for the past 13 years. "I don't know why he's in there."
Her pick was Florida Senator Marco Rubio.
"He's a thoughtful person and he's moderate," she says. "I get very tired of people invoking God and whatnot in these debates."
Omar Masood, a Canadian citizen who immigrated from Dubai 10 years ago to attend university, also wasn't a big Trump fan: "I feel like when he says something that might make a little bit of sense, people take notice of it not because it makes a little bit of sense but because, in the ocean of stupidity, it's some light at the end of the tunnel."
He says while he wasn't surprised by what he saw as Islam-bashing and xenophobic themes during the debate, he was struck by how little the candidates spoke about the economy - currently a huge issue in Canada.
"They spent a lot of time talking about borders and social issues," he says. "They did not distinguish themselves on economic policy."
He says that Canadian politicians "make a lot more sense", but one Republican candidate who did catch his fancy was Ohio Governor John Kasich.
"I liked the fact that he didn't want to focus on demagoguery," he says. "He was focused on more positive themes, and he tried to in his own limited way to talk about the economy."
Mr Kasich, he notes with a laugh, "aspires to talk like a Canadian politician".
Although the turnout for the Calgary debate-watch party was small, there was plenty of evidence that Canadians across the nation are keeping an eye on what was happening to their south. The debate was Canada's top Twitter trend through much of its three-hour duration.
But was it serious viewing or just outsiders hoping to witness a Trump-inspired conflagration?
Dana Strasser, another American expat, says that whenever she tries to have a serious discussion about US politics with most Canadians, "they just roll their eyes".
Next month's federal elections are a chance for Canadians to cast their verdict on the state of the country - and the government that's been running it.
