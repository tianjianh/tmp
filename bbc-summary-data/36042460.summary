An ill-disguised armed robber has been jailed after his Minnie Mouse gloves, severe limp and tattoo blew his cover.

Shane Hadlington, 27, wore a motorbike helmet when he threatened staff at a Black Country shop with a metal bar, West Midlands Police said.
But distinctive details including the two-tone duvet he used as a swag bag led to officers tracking him down.
Hadlington, of Bridge Road, Tipton, was jailed for six years after a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Sergeant Sean Corrigan, from Dudley Police, said: "We soon racked up a whole package of overwhelming evidence against Hadlington...with Minnie Mouse being his ultimate downfall."
Hadlington, along and another man who has never been identified, stole spirits and cigarettes worth £3,700 from One Stop Shop on Bourne Street, Roseville in Dudley on 15 August 2015.
A police officer who watched CCTV of the raid recognised Hadlington after he saw him in a wheelchair four days previously - when he said he had fallen off his motorbike and hurt his leg.
"In the CCTV he's literally hopping on the good leg," said Sgt Corrigan.
"You can see him hobbling down the ramp and hopping onto a motorbike to get away."
Sgt Corrigan said a look through Hadlington's facebook page showed him with a DAD tattoo on his wrist identical to that of the man caught on camera.
A search of his former home in Lower Gornal, Dudley uncovered the incriminating Minnie Mouse gloves, a two-tone duvet and tracksuit bottoms identical to those worn by one of the offenders, police said.
He was added to the wanted list and his photograph was circulated on social media.
In October 2015 he was arrested at a café in Kingswinford after being spotted by a PCSO.
Hadlington was jailed on Friday.
