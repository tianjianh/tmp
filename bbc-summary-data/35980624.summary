Sighthill standing stones to be temporarily removed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The standing stones of Sighthill Park in Glasgow are being temporarily removed as part of the Â£250m regeneration of the area.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stones will be stored before eventually being re-erected at a different location.
They will be relocated within the new park, south east of the current site.
The Stone Circle was established in 1979 by the Glasgow Parks Department Astronomy Project, guided by the Scottish author Duncan Lunan.
Mr Lunan organised the construction to accurately mirror the rise and fall of the sun and moon over the city.
It was claimed to be the first authentically aligned stone circle built in Britain in about 3,000 years.
The regeneration work in Sighthill Park is part of a five year programme due to finish in 2019.
It plans to deliver about 800 new homes for sale and rent and a new community school campus.
The development also includes a  new footbridge across the M8 to connect Sighthill with the city centre and a new road bridge across the railway to link Sighthill and Port Dundas.
