Work finishes on £15m Wrexham emergency centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has finished on a new £15m emergency centre in Wrexham, combining fire and ambulance station services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The building on Croesnewydd Road will replace the town's existing fire station and ambulance stations in Wrexham and Chirk. Staff are expected to move in next month.
The plans were mooted in 2012 and construction began in September 2014.
New staff have been recruited to clean ambulances after use so paramedics can spend more time with patients.
