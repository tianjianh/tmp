Adrian Bayford, who netted £148m with his then-wife in 2012, has volunteered to hold this year's Cambridge Rock Festival on his estate in Horseheath.
Festival director Dave Roberts said he had been "unsure" whether to go ahead with the event, which is usually held at a farm near Barton, this year.
The festival attracts about 3,000 music fans on each of its four days.

Since 2009, it has been held at Haggis Farm Polo Club in Barton.
However, before Mr Bayford approached organisers two weeks ago, its director said he was "a little unsure about whether to go ahead" with this year's event.
Mr Bayford, who owns Black Barn Records in Cambridge, approached him and offered the venue for free, in return for publicity for his company, Mr Roberts said.
"I know Adrian would like to do lots of things with his estate and [that's] great, he's a lovely fellow, and absolutely into his music," he said.
"He has come to us with his love of music so the two knitted together."
The acts for this year's festival - from 3 to 6 August - have not yet been announced, but Mr Roberts said "Eddie and the Hot Rods will be back".
Headliners in the past have included The Stranglers, Hazel O'Connor, Australian Pink Floyd and Dr Feelgood.
When Mr Bayford and his wife won their millions, The Sunday Times Rich List said their fortune rivalled that of Jamie and Jools Oliver (£150m), Sir Tom Jones (£140m) and Eric Clapton (£130m).
Their win placed them 516th in Britain's Rich List.
