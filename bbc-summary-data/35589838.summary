[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A plumber discovered the corpse on Thursday after being called to a property in Scartho Road, Grimsby.
A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, but police said the baby "must have been placed there".
Det Insp Christine Calvert, of Humberside Police, said the coin which was found with the body was dated 2013.
The towel was from Marks & Spencer.
Ms Calvert said: "The baby's body must have been placed in the location where he was discovered, as the pipes either side are too narrow for him to have settled there."
Police are working to establish the significance of the towel, coin and hair bands.
Humberside Police is working with health and social services to identify the boy's parents.
Ms Calvert said: "Very little is known of the circumstances which led to the baby's death, but we are concerned that the baby's parents, in particular his mother, may need help and support following the loss of her child and as such she may be very vulnerable.
"We are urging anyone who can help identify the parents of this baby, or the parents themselves, to come forward in order for us to make sure they get any support or medical treatment that may be required."
The body is thought to have been there "post 2013" and appeared to have gone to full-term.
