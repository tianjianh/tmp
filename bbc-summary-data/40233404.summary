The 19-year-old won 0-6 7-6 (11-9) 6-2 against Argentina's Gustavo Fernandez to claim his first Grand Slam title.
Later on Saturday, Hewett lost in the men's doubles final alongside fellow Briton Gordon Reid.
They were beaten 6-4 6-3 by French pair Stephane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer, who also beat them in the Rio 2016 final.
Hewett, seventh in the rankings, said: "I had a good feeling about this week. This time last year I was outside the top 10, hadn't really won anything.
"A year on, I've got two [Paralympic] silver medals, [I am] Wimbledon doubles champion and now singles Grand Slam [champion] at Roland Garros - I can't believe it."
Fernandez had two match points during the second-set tie-break, but Hewett said he remained confident of victory.
"I played him a week and a half ago in another final and I was 6-0 3-0 down, and when it went 6-0 2-0 this time I was thinking, 'Oh no, here we go again'," Hewett added.

"But I remembered coming back that time so I knew I could come back, and when it got to that tie-break, it was very up and down, he had match points, I had set points.
"Mentally that was a big positive for me to keep in there and hold out. I felt good after I won that second set and knew I needed to get off to a good start in the third and when that happened I grew in confidence."
