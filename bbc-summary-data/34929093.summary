Andy Murray Q&A - Davis Cup, captaincy & winning at snooker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
We arrived in Ghent on Monday before the Davis Cup final and so far everything has been great, if a bit cold! The court is good, the town is nice and, most importantly, I won at snooker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thanks for all the good wishes you've been sending. I thought I'd use this column to answer a few of your questions.
Q) When you are all not talking about tennis (or football) what does team GB discuss at the dinner table? (@AndiMillman)
We're discussing my snooker victory over Ken Skupski on Tuesday night - we talked about that quite a lot. It wasn't comprehensive at all - I had to pot the brown, blue, pink and black in a row to get the win. It was a decent break. I've probably done better than that, my best is around mid-20s, but Tuesday's would have been up there. I think it was the highest break of the night to win. It was a bit lucky, to be fair.
Q) Who's the biggest prankster in the changing room and what's the best prank you've seen? (@MoWilson18)
We don't really play pranks, it's really just everyone constantly dishing out stick to each other. Shane Annun, our physio, takes a lot of it actually.
Q) Would winning the Davis Cup with Team GB mean more to you than winning a Grand Slam? (Linda Farnhill)
I think it would be different. The enjoyment you get out of winning as part of a team I would say is greater than on your own. When we win Davis Cup matches it's nicer celebrating with everyone and having a big team around. It would be comparable but completely different to a Slam.

A Slam also happens in the space of a couple of weeks, whereas the Davis Cup - this year has been over the course of nine or 10 months but it has actually been a much longer road, like five or six years.
Q) Given the tour is so worldwide, is there a difficult aspect to playing away from home? (Aidan Williams)
It makes a difference but playing in front of a home crowd can help or also hinder in an individual sport. Some players don't enjoy it - they can lift you when you're down but you can also put a lot of pressure on yourself to perform. When you play away from home, the crowd is against you but it does feel like there's a little bit less pressure. The expectation tends to be with the home team.
Q) Do you like having a coach/captain on the court during games and would you like to see that introduced on tour? (Greg Edwards)
I guess it's nice - it's different. I don't see it as being a negative in any way. The thing with the on-court coaching on the rest of the tour is I don't think it really works.
Some players are at a huge disadvantage depending on the language they speak, because if you speak a language that the commentators and others don't understand then the whole tour and locker room don't know what the coach is telling you at the side. If you speak English or Spanish then everyone does, and I don't think that's so fair.
Q) Would you ever consider being Great Britain's Davis Cup captain in the future? (William Smith)
I've never really thought about it, to be honest. I don't think it would happen immediately after I stop playing because I would want to do other stuff first, but maybe when I'm quite a bit older.
It's obviously completely different to what I do now. Obviously I would have  the experience of playing in the matches, so would have a good understanding of how the players are feeling and what they're going through. But you have to be able to communicate well with different people; you have to be able to manage a team, which I think is what Leon Smith has done extremely well. He doesn't have the experience of having played in the matches but his management of the team has been excellent I think.
So there are different ways of doing the job, and whether I'd be good at it, I don't know.
Q) Will you play the Davis Cup again next year? Please do! (Nicola Jade)
The plan is to play the first tie against Japan in March, and then it will be difficult. If we win, the tie after Wimbledon but before the Olympics is not easy timing. Both the Davis Cup and the Olympics events are important, both are for your country, but it's better to prepare properly for one rather than a little bit for both.
I would rather prepare as best I can for one and give it my best shot. I'll definitely be playing the tie against Japan, that's for sure, and then after that we'll have to see what happens with my schedule.
