Comedian Al Murray 'too heavy' for parachute jump

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Comedian Al Murray, who is standing for parliament in his guise as The Pub Landlord, has been forced to cancel a parachute jump because he is too heavy.

He was expected to plunge 12,000ft (3,658m) into Headcorn Aerodrome in Kent before addressing constituents.
"It seems that I am too heavy to jump. Yet another tragic victim of this country's obesity epidemic," he said.
Murray is contesting the South Thanet seat where he is taking on UKIP leader Nigel Farage in the general election.
Mr Murray learned at the aerodrome that he was heavier than the 14st 7lb (92kg) limit.
Dressed in his trademark burgundy blazer, he said he was unaware of his weight.
"I'm a true British man - I neither cry nor weigh myself on scales. Those are my values," he said.
In a statement, Murray, whose character is based around a love for all things British, said: "My life is being held back by health and safety gone mad.
"Gone are the days that a British citizen could throw themselves out of a plane regardless of the risk.
"I hope, however, that this settles once and for all the issue of whether I am a political heavyweight."
He complained about being weighed on metric scales, adding they proved conclusively the "dead hand of Brussels" on the British way of life.
Oxford-educated Murray launched a plan in January to reach Parliament.  He pledged the UK will leave Europe by 2025 "and the edge of the Solar System by 2050".
He promised to tackle crime by locking up all unemployed people and to stop people reaching the shores of "the greatest country in the world" by bricking up the Channel Tunnel.
He also promised to introduce "1p a pint" but to keep crisps at the current price.
