Isle of Man e-gaming work permit exemption call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some e-gaming specialists could be added to a list of professions exempt from Isle of Man work permits.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tynwald will consider easing the entry requirements because Manx-based games companies have been experiencing problems recruiting qualified workers.
Tax breaks have attracted about 30 e-gaming firms, transforming the Isle of Man into a major international player.
The wider e-business industry accounts for about 25% of national income and employs more than 1,700 people.
Work permit exemptions would apply only to contracts of at least 12 months and with a salary of at least Â£25,000.
It is thought the sector will be looking to fill 100 skilled positions every year for the foreseeable future.
A government spokesman said if the work permit exemption is applied it will only affect some positions within Information Communications Technology and e-Business.
