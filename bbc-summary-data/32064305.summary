The 2 Sisters chicken processing factory  in Llangefni is consulting staff on plans to cut a whole shift of workers, affecting 300 jobs.
Dr Alexandra Plows from Bangor University said it would be difficult for workers to find new employment.
The consultation period on the job losses comes to an end on 6 April.
Speaking on Radio Cymru's current affairs programme Manylu Dr Plows, a researcher at the university's school of social sciences, said: "We've faced a serious situation for a long time - like a slow motion car crash.
"There's a gap in the employment market, particularly with big employers. We've seen other major employers like Peboc, the Gaerwen abattoir and Anglesey Aluminium close."
Unite union representative Paddy McNought said: "Even with the agency workers we've estimated that about 50% of them live locally so you're talking about 200 who live locally losing their jobs."
2 Sisters said it would be inappropriate for them to make any comment about the future of the factory - and the possible job losses - during the consultation period.
