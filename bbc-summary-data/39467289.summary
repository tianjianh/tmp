Premier League predictions: Lawro v DJ and Man Utd fan Goldie

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for the midweek Premier League fixtures is DJ, artist and drum and bass pioneer Goldie.
Goldie is a Manchester United fan who follows Jose Mourinho's side from his home in Thailand, and has seen a lot of the rest of the Premier League too.
"I never thought I would say this but, as well as United, I will sit and watch any good games I get on the TV," he told BBC Sport.
"I watch more other teams than I have ever done before because I just miss a bit of footy."
Goldie feels Mourinho is the right manager to bring success back to Old Trafford but is unsure whether they will make the top four this season.
"We have been dropping points in silly games and we are relying on one of the teams above us imploding," he explained.
"Tottenham have been that team in past seasons but, looking at the top four now, I am not sure who will slip up this time.
"It is going to take time for Jose to get it right, but I think he will."

Goldie, who used to go clubbing with Dwight Yorke when the striker was at United, is less impressed with Paul Pogba, who returned to Old Trafford for a world record Â£89m fee last summer, four years after leaving to join Juventus for a nominal amount.
He added: "Seriously, why did Fergie [Sir Alex Ferguson] get rid of Pogba? I think we are seeing why. He did not see anything special.
"I am sorry but for the money we spent on him, we could have reinforced the entire midfield. He has not done anything for us this season and for me he is in the same bracket as Diego and Juan Sebastian Veron - disappointing.
"It is all right saying that he has sold a lot of shirts but come on, you have got to do more than that, mate."
You can make your Premier League predictions now and compare them with those of Lawro and other fans by playing the BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
All kick-offs 19:45 BST unless otherwise stated.
Burnley 1-0 Stoke City
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Goldie's prediction: This will be close, but I think Burnley will nick it. 2-1
Match report
Leicester City 2-0 Sunderland
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Goldie's prediction: I don't think anyone expected the turnaround from Leicester since Claudio Ranieri was sacked. I think Jermain Defoe will score, but the Foxes are just on fire at the minute. 3-1
Match report
Watford 2-0 West Brom
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Goldie's prediction: Watford were on a poor run until they beat Sunderland at the weekend, so I have to back West Brom here. 0-2
Match report
Man Utd 1-1 Everton
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Goldie's prediction: Zlatan is available after his suspension and he will be itching to get involved. I am going to be bold and go for a 3-2 United win but as much as I'd like to think we will win it, it's probably going to end up another draw. 3-2
Match report
Arsenal v West Ham
It took Arsenal a while to work out how to stop Manchester City playing from the back in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Emirates Stadium.
The Gunners never really closed the City players down and there were spells where they looked rudderless.

West Ham have problems of their own, though, and I am sick of hearing about what their owners think about it.
They don't have to apologise on social media every time the Hammers lose, but it is like they cannot stay off it.
Why not just let the manager explain if the team are beaten, and back the manager? Instead, Slaven Bilic's future seems to be a topic of discussion every week.
I am going for an Arsenal win on Wednesday, and if I am right we will probably hear a lot more about whether Bilic is being sacked - or not - this week.
Even if Arsenal do win, though, I am not sure it would be a good enough result for Wenger to announce he is definitely staying for another couple of years.
If that is what is happening, he should maybe save that news for a different day.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Goldie's prediction: There are a lot of rumours about the future of both managers and when West Ham get unsettled from a managerial point of view, anything can happen. This is a tricky one to call, but Arsenal need it more. 2-1
Hull City v Middlesbrough
Middlesbrough's draw with Swansea on Sunday was not a disaster but, the situation they are in, a point was not enough for them.
Boro cannot draw their way to safety, and it is going to be very hard for them to dig themselves out of trouble.
They know they struggle to score goals - there is nothing worse than when you are looking round your dressing room before a game, thinking 'who is going to get our goals to win this one for us?'
It will be interesting to see how Boro boss Steve Agnew sets his team up because this is a tough game for them - Hull had a great result at the weekend, coming back from a goal down to beat West Ham.
The Tigers seem to do that a lot at home - play poorly in the first half but turn it around after the break.
I would give the manager Marco Silva the credit for that, and he has a great record at the KCOM Stadium, with five wins and a draw from six league games.
I know it took me until last week to tip Hull to win this season, but I think they are going to do it again, and at this rate I might be safe to venture over the Humber Bridge soon.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Goldie's prediction: I don't think Middlesbrough have been playing that badly, but they are just not scoring at all. Both teams need the points desperately, but I am going with Boro. 1-2
Southampton v Crystal Palace
Palace rode their luck at times in their win over leaders Chelsea on Saturday but they defended the way you would expect a Sam Allardyce side to defend, which is by putting their bodies on the line.
Allardyce has got plenty of players who pose a threat at the other end too, so I am not surprised their results have picked up - he has got people like Wilfried Zaha going.
I think Palace's unbeaten run will continue when they go to St Mary's but they might have to settle for a point.
I am never quite sure what to expect from Southampton, and if Manolo Gabbiadini is still injured then he is a big miss up front, but they are capable of digging in to get something out of this game if they have to.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Goldie's prediction: Palace have had a big turnaround under Sam Allardyce and got that great win at Chelsea on Saturday. Southampton are very unpredictable, but they might be the ones to surprise people this time. 2-1
Swansea City v Tottenham
I thought Tottenham would struggle against Burnley on Saturday but in the end they won comfortably, despite their injuries.
Fernando Llorente will be a big miss for Swansea if he is still out injured, but I would back Tottenham's defence to cope with him anyway.
Swansea are just starting to stutter a little bit, but Spurs just seem to keep going.
Lawro's prediction: 0-1
Goldie's prediction: I think Spurs will take this one. Like I say, I am hoping their wheels come off but don't see them slipping up here. 1-2
Chelsea v Man City (20:00 BST)
Manchester City let Arsenal off the hook in their 2-2 draw at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
The Gunners were so open, they were there for the taking. There is no way Chelsea will give them the same sort of room at Stamford Bridge.
I actually think this is a game that Chelsea will look at as one they just must not lose, rather than have to win.
That is the reason why I am backing City to get a point - which would be their fourth draw in a row.
We know how good Pep Guardiola's side are going forward but teams do not have to work that hard to score against them and until he gets that, whenever you watch City, your heart is always a bit in your mouth.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Goldie's prediction: I really did not think Chelsea would be doing the damage they are doing this season. They slipped up against Palace but I don't think it will happen again against City. 2-1
Liverpool v Bournemouth (20:00 BST)
Bournemouth might try to sit back a bit but the best thing about their team is the way they play when they come forward.
If they go on the attack then that will help Liverpool, and I also think Jurgen Klopp's side have regained a bit of their belief from earlier in the season anyway.
The Cherries will let them play and I think Liverpool will have too much for them.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Goldie's prediction: Liverpool have been brilliant against the top teams but can struggle to break down sides that slow them down. I was going to go for a draw here but Bournemouth beat them 4-3 in a crazy game earlier in the season so, you know what? I am going go for Bournemouth to do them again. 1-2
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
*Does not include scores from postponed games.
Lawro's best score: 140 points (week 22 v James McAvoy)
Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week 28, but only five games played so far) or 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
Last weekend, Lawro got six correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 matches for a total of 90 points.
He beat comedian and actor Omid Djalili, who got one correct result with no perfect scores, for a tally of 10 points that leaves him bottom of the guest leaderboard.
