The court heard that Becsei had pulled out from a farm on to Ely Road and started driving on the wrong side of the road. The vehicles collided on a bend just south of the junction with Brickmakers Way.
Speaking after the hearing, PC James Thorne said: "This tragic collision was a result of Becsei not paying proper attention to his driving for a relatively long period of time.
"Losing concentration while driving has the potential to prove fatal and maintaining that due care and attention is particularly important when you're driving on a side of the road you're not used to."
