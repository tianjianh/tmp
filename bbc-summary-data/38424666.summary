Southampton 1-2 West Bromwich Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hal Robson-Kanu scored a stunning winner on his first Premier League start since May 2013 as West Brom came from behind to beat Southampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wales international spearheaded a well-drilled West Brom outfit, but they conceded possession all too easily in the first half and fell behind to Shane Long's powerful header.
They levelled within two minutes when Robson-Kanu turned Chris Brunt's first-time pass into the path of Matt Phillips, who finished neatly.
The Baggies were perhaps fortunate not to have Allan Nyom sent off before half-time, and they took full advantage when Robson-Kanu slammed left-footed into the top corner from 20 yards.
Relive Kanu's stunner and West Brom's win
All the reaction from Saturday's Premier League games
Robson-Kanu was the only change to the side beaten at Arsenal, and boss Tony Pulis was rewarded with a show of determination and organisation as Saints had few clear-cut chances.
The hosts, who made six changes following a 4-1 loss to Spurs, were blunt and ultimately exposed by their efficient visitors, their day made worse when Virgil van Dijk was shown a second yellow for pulling back Salomon Rondon on 88 minutes.
Home fans headed for the exit in their droves as Van Dijk was dismissed. Their side are ninth, a place behind West Brom.
Robson-Kanu - introduced 13 times from the bench this season - last started a Premier League match while playing for Reading.
And his performance, having replaced top scorer Rondon in the starting XI, was symptomatic of how right Pulis got things at St Mary's.
The fact goalkeeper Ben Foster's 37 passes were more than any of his team-mates highlights just how bad the Baggies were in possession, but they outmanoeuvred their hosts, limiting them to harmless crosses.
Jonny Evans fielded aerial challenges admirably, while Phillips deserves praise for his calm leveller and a neat reverse pass which sent Robson-Kanu free for the game's standout moment of quality.
The match-winning strike was as powerful as it was accurate, beating Fraser Forster at his near post to give Robson-Kanu his first goal since a sublime effort against Belgium at Euro 2016.
Pulis admitted his side were "shocking" in the opening period, citing a cancelled flight on Friday and enforced bus travel as a potential reason for the slow start.
But he too deserves credit. He refused to make widespread changes in the wake of back-to-back defeats and, at the halfway stage of the season, his side are three points and five places better off than at this stage of 2015-16.
Saints boss Claude Puel said changing more than half his side was a result of fixture congestion and not a knee-jerk move after the defeat by Tottenham.
The French boss has now made four or more changes in each of their last five league games. His latest selection saw Southampton unable to pick a final pass of meaning in 94 minutes.
There were glimmers of flair from Sofiane Boufal but, the goals aside, West Brom could claim the game's best chance when James Morrison's header was saved with the Baggies 2-1 up.
Southampton may feel Nyom should have been dismissed for clattering Long nine minutes after being booked.
But the fact they have only won two league games in a row once this season shows their inconsistency.
At the halfway stage of the season they are three places better off than at the same stage in 2015-16 but have scored seven goals fewer. It is not hard to see why.
Southampton manager Claude Puel: "We started well, with possession and quality, and then the first chance for the opponent they score. It's a difficult moment for the squad. We have to concentrate more in defence."
West Brom manager Tony Pulis: "In the first half we were shocking really, way off the pace of the game. But in the second half we got going and we played with a lot more purpose.
"Robson-Kanu has been very good. We felt it was the right time to give Salomon Rondon a rest, he was a little bit down in training this week. Now I have a problem Monday... who do I pick?"
West Brom host second-bottom Hull City on Monday in a 15:00 GMT kick-off, while Southampton will face former manager Ronald Koeman when they travel to Everton at the same time.
