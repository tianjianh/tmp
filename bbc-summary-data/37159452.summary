David Ellam was attacked near his home in the town last Monday and died later in hospital.
The 52-year-old was thought to have been protecting his terrier when a larger dog, previously seized by police over fears it was dangerous, turned on him.
Mr Ellam also worked as a lollipop man.
It was "a job he really loved doing", his family said.

"In his spare time, David had been volunteering with both the Royal Voluntary Service and Carers Count. He loved doing this," his family added.
"He was also an integral part of Walking Football at Huddersfield Town football club.
"He had a quirky sense of humour and family called him The Gadget Man because he loved his electronic toys."
Mr Ellam's family also thanked police and staff at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary "who did everything in their power to save David".
Mr Ellam and his terrier, Rolo, were bitten outside their home on Riddings Road on 15 August.
West Yorkshire Police said the dog involved had been returned to its owner several days previously after being seized in June as a suspected banned pit bull breed.
A 29-year-old man, thought to be the dog's owner, has been arrested and bailed.
West Yorkshire Police have referred the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
