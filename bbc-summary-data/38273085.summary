[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 40-minute delay to the start due to a power failure did not dampen the crowd's spirits, although the first half took a while to liven up.
When it did, Aswad Thomas spectacularly cleared Shamir Mullings' header off the line.
At the other end, Ricky Miller hit a superb shot from 30 yards, but Sam Russell matched it with a fine save.
The Whites found the breakthrough after the break when Moses Emmanuel headed in a pinpoint cross by Ricky Modeste.
Kieffer Moore, however, struck in a loose ball in injury time to draw the sides level.
