Skeletal remains found in a Luton garden are those of a woman who went missing 12 years ago, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalia Doherty, 50, a mother-of-three who was last seen alive in Eastbourne, East Sussex, on 15 April 2003, was identified by dental records.
Her remains were discovered during a search of a garden of a house in Icknield Way, earlier this week.
Two men, aged 66 and 39, from Luton who were arrested on suspicion of murder have been bailed until next year.
The older man had previously been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and preventing a lawful burial.
A 71-year-old man from Port Glasgow is on bail on suspicion of the same crimes.
Police said the victim's family was being kept updated with developments, while being supported by family liaison officers.
Detectives believe that shortly before her death, Ms Doherty travelled to Luton to stay with her late ex-husband, Gerald, at the now-demolished Regents Arms in Hastings Street.
Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit launched a fresh investigation in January 2014, which led them to believe Ms Doherty was murdered.
Investigations are continuing at the house in Icknield Way, police have said.
