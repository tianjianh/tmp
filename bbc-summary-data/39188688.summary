Morecambe 0-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County increased their hopes of avoiding League Two relegation by winning a second straight match under new boss Michael Flynn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Exiles were 11 points adrift when they sacked boss Graham Westley but followed up a win over Crewe thanks to Ryan Bird's second half penalty.
County are now seven points from League Two safety and off the bottom of the table after Bird converted after Alex Whitmore fouled Alex Samuel.
Morecambe remain 15th.
Newport County boss Michael Flynn told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It is not easy, but the boys were outstanding.
"We had enough chances to wrap up the game earlier, but the boys showed great character.
"We kept a clean sheet. I was very nervous, but tried not to show it.
"It's a brilliant win. We will keep fighting and we will keep scraping."
