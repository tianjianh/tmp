The visitors led 21-9 at the end of the first quarter and were 45-18 at the break.
The Silver Ferns continued to dominate with the scores at 67-25 going into the final quarter.
Wales scored only twice more in the last period as New Zealand added 25 more goals.
Trish Wilcox's Wales team went into the game ranked eighth in the world against second-placed New Zealand, who had finished the recent Quad Series second winners Australia, and above hosts England.
Te Paea Selby-Rickit scored 40 times for New Zealand, a personal record at international level.
The two teams meet again at the same venue, Ice Arena Wales, on Wednesday.
Wales captain Suzy Drane told BBC Wales: "We're not going to be looking at our scoreline. We're going to be looking very much on our performances.
"We always knew it was going to be difficult.
"This is the start of our journey to Commonwealth Games 14 months away and we're going to take the positives; what we did well and make sure we do those more consistently.
"Our consistency is what let us down."
Wales squad: Sara Bell, Fern Davies, Suzy Drane (capt), Bethan Dyke, Chloe James, Kyra Jones, Nia Jones, Lateisha Kidner, Chelsea Lewis, Kelly Morgan (vice-capt), Georgia Rowe, Amanda Varey.
