The Ashton Gate club will also add former New Zealand utility back Bruce Reihana to new head coach Pat Lam's backroom staff as skills coach in June.
Perkins, 21, has been dual-registered with Bedford for two terms, while Ehizode, 19, has played Anglo-Welsh Cup rugby for Wasps this season.
Reihana, 40, spent nine years of his playing career at Northampton Saints.
He will join Bristol from French Top 14 side Bordeaux to work alongside Connacht's Lam, who was named in December as the Premiership strugglers' next permanent boss.
"When the opportunity arose to join Pat Lam's coaching team and to work with the players at Bristol Rugby, it excited me straight away," he told Bristol's website.
