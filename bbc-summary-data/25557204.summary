About 150,000 people are expected to attend the annual fireworks display on the banks of the River Thames.
Clouds of apple and cherry mist and peach snow will be released into the air and people will also get scratch 'n' sniff programmes and fruit sweets.
The mayor said it was among the world's "most dazzling firework displays".
Boris Johnson said: "There is no better way to celebrate the highs of 2013 and the start of an exciting new year."
BBC London weather forecaster Sara Thornton said there would be scattered showers at midnight .
A spokesperson for the mayor's office said contingency plans were in place to cope with changes to the weather, including reducing the number and type of fireworks which would go off.
Up to 100,000 people in key viewing areas by the Thames will be given the scratch 'n' sniff programmes, LED wristbands and seven kinds of fruit-flavoured sweets that link to the tastes and smells of the multi-sensory display.
The fireworks display on the Southbank, which begin as Big Ben strikes midnight, will be shown live on BBC One and will take place alongside a specially created musical soundtrack.
In his New Year's message Mr Johnson said: "We are saying goodbye to 2013, which was another exciting and memorable year for our city and the whole of the country.
"Let's continue to strive and to work together to ensure the future success of our great city."
Buses, the Tube, DLR, tram and some National Rail services in Greater London will run all night and will be mostly free from 23:45 GMT until 04:30.
