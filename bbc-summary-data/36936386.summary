Leading by 41 seconds overnight, the Tyrone man took no chances in Sunday's four stages, finishing 29.1 seconds ahead of Finn Jari-Matti Latvala.
Meeke, 37, led for almost every kilometre of the event in his Citroen.
Ireland's Craig Breen earned his first World Rally podium as he took third, one minute 41.3 seconds off the lead.
Belgium's Thierry Neuville was a further 4.6 seconds adrift in fourth with New Zealander Hayden Paddon in fifth spot.
Meeke earned his second World Rally series win in Portugal in May.
The Northern Irishman is racing a reduced schedule for Citroen this year as the team concentrates on developing a new car for next season.
Dungannon native Meeke's first World Rally series win came in Argentina last year.
World championship leader Sebastien Ogier lost hope of victory after going off the road early in the event.
Frenchman Ogier still has a comfortable 45-point lead over Andres Mikkelsen in this year's series, while Meeke is now ninth in the championship.
