[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A children's nurse will stand trial accused of 22 counts of making indecent images of children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aaron Ravel, 46, of Cavehill Road, Belfast, appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court for a preliminary enquiry hearing.
The alleged offences are said to be connected to files found on a computer.
The prosecution stressed at an earlier hearing there was no suggestion that any of the images relate to patients.
The alleged offences cover a period between October 2013 to April 2014.
The accused confirmed that he understood the charges on Friday.
He declined to give evidence or call witnesses at this stage of the case.
He will appear at Belfast Crown Court on a date to be fixed and has been released on bail until trial.
The judge said the accused was not to have unsupervised contact with anyone under the age of 16 unless approved by social services.
