Sukvinder Mannan, 33, ploughed his car in to a bus shelter near Bearwood in Birmingham in May 2014.
The crash killed 21-year-old Rebecca McManus, who was waiting to go to a hen party, and badly injured her friend.
Inderjit Singh, 31, who was racing Mannan, has been sentenced to 12 months for dangerous driving.
Mannan, of Roundhills Road, Halesowen, reached speeds of more than of 100mph in a 40mph zone, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard.
He lost control of his Mitsubishi Evolution on a bend, causing it to crash into the bus stop where Miss McManus and her friend were standing.
During an earlier hearing, he admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving, plus failing to provide a blood sample.
Singh, of Cranbourne Avenue, Wolverhampton, had been racing Mannan on Hagley Road West on the evening of 31 May. He was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving.
Miss McManus, who had just finished a three-year English Literature and Creative Writing degree at the University of East Anglia, died at the scene.
Her friend, who was also standing at the bus stop, is still recovering in hospital.
