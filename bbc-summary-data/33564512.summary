"Lucasfilm & Disney didn't approve, participate in or condone the inappropriate use of our characters in this manner," said a post on the official Star Wars Twitter feed.
Star Wars fans had called the photoshoot "distasteful" and "lame".
The front cover of American GQ features Schumer sucking C-3PO's finger.
Inside the magazine Schumer also appears in the back of a cab with Chewbacca, C-3PO and Yoda, dancing with stormtroopers and is pictured in bed with R2-D2 and C-3PO.
She is dressed as the character Princess Leia, who was originally played by Carrie Fisher.
The Trainwreck and Inside Amy Schumer actress was chosen as American GQ's cover star for its August comedy issue, saluting her as "the funniest woman in the galaxy".
On Thursday the comedian was nominated for eight Emmy Awards for her Comedy Central series Inside Amy Schumer, including lead actress in a comedy series and the writing and directing comedy categories.
The comment from Lucas Film and Disney came in response to tweets from disgruntled Star Wars fans.
One wrote, "I can't believe @Disney and @starwars are allowing @GQMagazine to do this DISTASTEFUL #starwars spread shame on all of you".
Another agreed, "This is the lamest thing I've seen in a while."
The new Star Wars film The Force Awakens - one of the highlights of the recent Comic-Con festival in San Diego - is set for release on 18 December.
It is the first in a new series of films in the sci-fi franchise.
Schumer is currently promoting a film of her own - Trainwreck, directed by Judd Apatow and co-starring Saturday Night Live star Bill Hader. The comedy is released in US cinemas this weekend.
