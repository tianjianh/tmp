A fighter from Burkina Faso flexes his muscles on Sunday to celebrate his victory in a match during the second stage of the West African wrestling tournamentâ€¦
Spectators pack into the sports palace in Ivory Coast's main city of Abidjan to enjoy the day of action.
The games are organised by Ecowas, the regional grouping that includes 15 countries in West Africa. Here a fighter from Senegal (L) faces an opponent from Niger.
At the Youth Olympic Games in the Chinese city of Nanjing on Thursday, Swaziland's female taekwondo fighter (in blue) takes on a rival from Senegal.
Cape Verdean singer Ceuzany performs on Saturday in the Portuguese city Almada, where more than 50,000 people attended events at the four-day Sol da Caparica Festivalâ€¦
Festival-goers were also entertained by Anselmo Ralph, an R&B singer from Angola.
The French air force aerobatics display team - Patrouille de France - fly over an aircraft carrier off Toulon to mark the 70th anniversary of the southern invasion during World War II of occupied France, which included thousands of African soldiers and opened up a second western front against the Nazis.
Moroccan war veterans, many in their 90s, were on board the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The invasion, called Operation Dragoon with a total force of 450,000 men, is less well known than the D-Day landings in Normandy launched 10 weeks earlier. Historian Jean-Marie Guillon told the AFP news agency: "We underestimate the importance of these landings." French President Francois Hollande said the actions of troops from France's former colonies were "decisive"...
Fifteen African leaders, including Cameroon's President Paul Biya (L) and his wife Chantal (R), attended the commemorations. Addressing those on board, Mr Hollande said: "By their sacrifice, these men bound our country to Africa with a bond of blood that no-one can undo. To the youth of Africa, I want to say that we have not forgotten, even if France took too long to learn the lessons in terms of emancipation and recognition," AFP reports.
On the same in a medical centre for Ebola patients in eastern Sierra Leone - an epicentre of the Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 1,300 people in the region this year - a health worker checks their protective clothing in a mirror.
In Liberia's capital, Monrovia, Alfred Sirleaf edits a chalkboard newspaper called Daily Talk, writing up different headlines on the board each day for discussion. In the last few weeks he has been scoring the government's response to the Ebola outbreak. But on Tuesday, he weighs up the contributions he estimates US and China have made to help deal with the crisis.
The next day in Ivory Coast, a sign warns motorists in Abidjan about Ebola, saying that the threat is real. Ivory Coast has not had any cases of the virus, but borders both Liberia and Guinea - two of the worst-affected countries.
Also on Wednesday, Spanish motorbike stunt rider Maikel Melero surprises a giraffe as he practises in South Africa ahead of the Red Bull X-Fighters World Tour event in Pretoria. He will be competing with 11 other top motocross freestylers on Saturday in front of the city's grand Union Buildings, headquarters of the South African government.
Footballers in France fly through the air on Saturday during a match between Toulouse and Lyon in Montpellier. Burkinabe defender Bakary Kone (R) and Cameroonian forward Clinton N'Jie, both of Lyon, vie for the ball with Colombian midfielder Abel Aguilar.
And in Nigeria, there is a scramble on Wednesday at an electoral commission centre near the capital, Abuja, as people arrive to collect their voting cards, which are being gradually handed out around the country ahead of elections due next year.
