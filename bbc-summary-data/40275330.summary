[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish school governance shake-up to be announced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a major shake-up in the way schools are governed will be set out by the Scottish government later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government has been reviewing what powers schools and councils should have.
It has also been looking at what planned new regional boards should do.
Education Secretary John Swinney will set out the proposals to the Scottish Parliament. Councils are fiercely protective of their role in the education system.
Virtually every state-funded school in Scotland is run by the local council.
Watch live coverage of the ministerial statement on education governance here from 2.45pm.
The government has already set out in broad terms what may and may not be on its agenda and carried out a major consultation with stakeholders.
It says it wants to empower parents and give as much power as possible to head teachers. But it has also made it clear that schools will not be able to opt out of local authority control and that there will be no selective schools or grammar schools.
The questions are more about exactly what formal powers heads should have, how parents will be involved, what responsibilities councils should retain and what the role of the proposed new regional boards which will operate across council areas should be.
In a newspaper article this week, Mr Swinney wrote: "We firstly must ask: who is best placed to understand and meet the educational needs of individual children? Who knows them? Who is at the heart of their schooling?
"That is why I have pledged to make teachers and parents the key decision makers in the life of a school. Decisions about a child's learning should be made as close to that child as possible."
The Scottish government has said it wants to be judged on education. It has highlighted how it wants to close the gap between how well children from relatively rich and poor backgrounds perform and raise attainment across the board.
But doing this is easier said than done.
Last year, Scotland recorded its worst performance in the international Pisa rankings, classed as average in all three areas for the first time ever.
The Scottish government's own surveys on literacy and numeracy suggest performance has been declining.
The government accepts that these issues need to be addressed, but also points to exam results and the high proportion of youngsters in work, education or training as positives and insists that Scotland has a fundamentally good education system.
It is likely to stress today that any structural reform is not an end in itself - rather it is a means of helping head teachers to raise attainment.
The government's critics point out that after 10 years in charge, it can be held to account for problems and what they see as a lack of progress.
The plans to be announced follow on from other government steps. They include:
However, critics note the decline in the number of teachers in recent years, the significant recruitment problems in some areas and the pressure on council budgets.
The education secretary is likely to face a tough balancing act - his plans could be condemned by some as too radical and by others as too tame.
The largest teachers' union, the EIS, said in its response to the government's review that the main challenges facing schools were related to funding, resources and staffing.
General secretary Larry Flanagan said: "Improving learning in our classrooms can be achieved by providing greater support to teachers through improved resourcing, effective pedagogical leadership and advice, and creating time to teach.
"None of these require organisational change,  but all of them require a change in culture from government, both local and national, with greater trust being placed in the profession."
Scotland's 32 councils play a pivotal role in education - they run schools, employ teachers and set budgets - although they work within a number of national agreements.
Local government organisation Cosla argues that closing the attainment gap requires a holistic approach involving different public services and agencies - not a simple focus on classroom-based education.
It believes there is no evidence that governance structures are a barrier to dealing with the attainment gap or improving the delivery of education.
Indeed a number of education experts would make the point that changing governance arrangements would not, in itself, raise performance.
Although the SNP enjoys a strong position in local government after May's council elections, other parties are likely to look for any signs of the reforms undermining the role of councils.
Those who might want more fundamental change are likely to be disappointed too.
State-funded schools operating outside the traditional system - like Jordanhill in Glasgow - are likely to remain the exception.
There will be no provision for schools to opt out of council control although one source close to government suggested to BBC Scotland that a question would be "what actual council control they would be opting out of" once the powers being given to heads are clear.
The announcement will be awaited keenly by parents, teachers, unions and councils.
But ultimately the question will be whether these reforms play a part in raising attainment.
