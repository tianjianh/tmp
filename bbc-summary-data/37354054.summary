[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC kept alive their hopes of winning the League Leaders' Shield by coming from behind to win 18-12 at Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.

Liam Finn's penalty gave the hosts an 8-6 lead at the break after Joe Arundel and Danny Washbrook exchanged tries.
Jordan Thompson put the Black and Whites in front but Tom Johnstone dived over in the corner to level the score.
Hull hit back and won it through Mahe Fonua's try to move a point behind Super League leaders Warrington.
The Black and Whites, who had lost to St Helens and Wigan in their two games since beating Warrington in the Challenge Cup final last month, knew only a victory would give them a chance of overhauling Wolves.
Even so, the win at Belle Vue might not be enough as Warrington can clinch the League Leaders' Shield themselves with victory over third-placed Wigan on Friday.
And defeat would leave all three sides in with a chance going into next week's final round of Super 8s fixtures, when Hull and the Wolves meet at the KCOM Stadium.
Wakefield, who have now lost all six games in the Super 8s, enjoyed the better of the first half and, after Hull's Fetuli Talanoa had been sent to the sin-bin for preventing Johnstone from playing the ball, deservedly led 8-0 through Arundel's converted try from Craig Hall's high kick and Finn's penalty.
Washbrook crashed over just before the break to cut Wakefield's lead to two points before Thompson burst through to go in under the posts.
Johnstone's stunning finish tied the game at 12-12 with 13 minutes left but Fonua replied immediately when he snuck over in the corner from the play-the-ball after giving Hull field position with a powerful run from inside his own half.
Wakefield coach Chris Chester:
"I'm very proud. I thought for long parts of that game we were the better team. It was a massive step up from where we've been in the last few weeks.
"We had lots of opportunities to put the game to bed with the amount of possession we had but for two weeks running couldn't get the ball over the line.
"Defensively we were very good, probably the best we've defended all season.
Hull coach Lee Radford:
"I told them beforehand I'd take any kind of win and they held me to that. I'm over the moon with the two points, although obviously it was a bit of an eyesore for 80 minutes.
"We played really well last week against a good Wigan side and got nothing for it. At this time of the year all it's about is picking two points up.
"Hopefully if Wigan knock Warrington off, we'll have a chance to collect the League Leaders' Shield at home, which would be great for our players and fans.
"If not, we want to finish second and get a home semi."
