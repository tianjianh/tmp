A Victorian park in Dorset has received £260,000 of Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) money towards a multi-million pound redevelopment.

The first round of funding for Poole Park follows a fundraising campaign by the Friends of Poole Park.
The cash will be spent over the next two years while a detailed research and monitoring project on the boating lake is carried out.
Borough councillor Xena Dion said it was a "huge step" in the revamp plans.
The development phase of the project is expected to be completed in late 2016, with the second phase of the bid submitted shortly after.
The park was opened in 1890 by Edward Prince of Wales.
