[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leicester City v Bournemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester are again without defender Robert Huth, who is nursing a foot injury, but Andy King could return from a hamstring problem.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wes Morgan, Danny Drinkwater, Molla Wague and Nampalys Mendy remain out.
Bournemouth could welcome back midfielders Dan Gosling and Andrew Surman after their respective calf and knee problems.
They are definitely without the injured Benik Afobe, while Lewis Cook is away with England's under-20 side.
Simon Brotherton: "Either team could finish in the top half of the table, but Bournemouth might finish as high as eighth if everything falls into place, which would be a remarkable achievement in only their second season in the Premier League.
"Last year's champions Leicester need to win for a top-10 finish, after salvaging their season under Craig Shakespeare.
"Nonetheless, after winning the first five games following the managerial change in February, they've tailed off somewhat, culminating in Thursday's thrashing at home to Spurs.
"It was the joint-heaviest defeat ever suffered by a reigning Premier League champion.
"Bad timing for Shakespeare if he's hoping to impress the owners and stay in the role next season."

Leicester City manager Craig Shakespeare: "There's not enough strength in our squad. We've come into injuries and we've managed to get through the games before that.
"Recruitment is a massive area in any football club. We have to get that right. But we've been unfortunate with injuries and when you miss all the players that we did [against Tottenham on Thursday], I think it took its toll."
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "For a club of our size, keeping players who are performing so well in the Premier League will be our biggest challenge this summer, probably more so than any other.
"But we have ambitious plans. We don't want to lose our best players, we want to bring in more so, hopefully, that will be achieved. I believe we can keep all our players and we are under no pressure to sell.
"We want to continue to keep growing and we believe we can achieve special things."
Bournemouth are already in the top 10 and, if they can become a little bit meaner defensively, then they can continue their progress next season.
Leicester will go above them - and into the top half - with a win, however, and that is what I think will happen.
