The Celtic captain has yet to hold talks with Scotland coach Gordon Strachan, but hopes to be selected for the crucial encounter at Hampden.
Brown announced his retirement from international football in August, citing concerns over injury problems.
However, he reversed the decision and faced England at Wembley in November.
He earned his 52nd cap in last month's World Cup qualifying victory over Slovenia at Hampden, a result which kept the Scots' feint hopes of qualifying for Russia 2018 alive.
West Brom midfielder Darren Fletcher assumed the captaincy after Brown elected to withdraw from Scotland duty last year, though the Celtic man reclaimed the armband against Slovenia in Fletcher's absence.
Scotland sit fourth in World Cup qualifying Group F, having collected seven points from their first five fixtures.
England top the group on 13 points, with Slovakia second on nine points and Slovenia one point ahead of Strachan's side.
You can watch the interview with Scott Brown on Football Focus on BBC One, Saturday 8 April at midday.
