The ram-raid occurred at 02:30 BST on Thursday at the Post Office in Shepshed, Leicestershire.
The truck was abandoned at the scene while the suspects made off in a silver pick-up truck and a dark coloured saloon, Leicestershire Police said.
The cash machine was later found on farmland in Hickling with "a quantity of cash" missing.
It comes off the back of several cash machine raids in the county since October 2014.
Mick Cottingham, who co-owns the badly damaged building with the Post Office, said a man who lives in the flat above the building "felt the floor move".
"They've made a right mess of it - they've made more damage inside than you can see from the outside," he said.
Mr Cottingham added work was being done to ensure the building was structurally safe.
A Leicestershire Police spokesman said: "The premises has been cordoned off while inquiries are being conducted.
"It's believed the suspects left the scene in a silver pick-up truck and a dark coloured saloon towards Hathern."
A Post Office spokeswoman said the company was trying to "restore services" to the area as soon as possible and pledged support to staff and police in their efforts to "apprehend those responsible".
Anyone with any information on the ram-raid is asked to contact the force.
