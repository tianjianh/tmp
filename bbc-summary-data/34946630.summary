[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Wight freedom honour granted to troop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A parade has taken place to mark the Isle of Wight Troop being awarded the freedom of the island.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council granted honorary freedom to the troop, which was previously known as the Isle of Wight Rifles, for its "distinguished record".
It is part of the 266 Port Squadron, of 165 Port and Maritime Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps (RLC).
A ceremony was held in St Thomas Square, Newport, followed by a parade around the town.
The honour was approved by Isle of Wight Council on Wednesday and acknowledged the "bond of friendship" between the soldiers and the people of the Island.
With the freedom, the troop is awarded the right to march "through the streets of the island on all ceremonial occasions with swords drawn, bayonets fixed, drums beating, bands playing and colours flying".
Members of the Rifles took part in the Gallipoli campaign, which took place 100 years ago last April.
