A football-loving five-year-old with terminal cancer has begun new treatment in a bid to try to prolong his life.

Sunderland fan Bradley Lowery was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in 2013, his mother Gemma said.
In December 250,000 well-wishers, inspired by the youngster's courage, sent Christmas cards to his home in Blackhall Colliery, near Hartlepool.
Fundraising manager Lynn Murphy, who has helped raise £700,000 for Bradley said he was doing "great".
She said he started new treatment in a bid to "shrink" his tumours and give him more time.
"He is on the second round of the new treatment, the first round was quite gruelling but after the first two days he was doing great", Ms Murphy said.
Last year more than £700,000 was raised to pay for treatment.
On his Facebook page, Ms Lowery said: "Once we give this treatment a chance Bradley will get rescanned to see if it is working in around three weeks time.
"I am hoping and praying it is and that we can continue on it, my baby deserves a break, he deserves a chance to live."
Ms Lowery said that eventually her son "will lose his fight"..
Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with neuroblastoma and most sufferers are under five years old.
Bradley took part in the warm-up against Chelsea on 14 December, scoring a goal.
The youngster was named joint-winner of Match of the Day's Goal of the Month alongside Manchester United's Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
Everton pledged £200,000 to the cause in September, when Bradley was mascot for Sunderland's home fixture with the Toffees at the Stadium of Light.
His appearance at Goodison Park was much anticipated, with travelling City fans holding a banner saying: "Cancer has no colours, one Bradley Lowery".
Prior to kick-off, Bradley jogged around on the pitch after arriving with the teams from the tunnel.
