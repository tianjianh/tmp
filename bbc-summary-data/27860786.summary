British number two Laura Robson will miss the US Open in August as she continues to recover from a wrist injury.

The 20-year-old, who has already pulled out of Wimbledon, has completed just one match in 2014.
Robson has slipped from 46th in the world rankings to 80th.
"I went through a very, very depressed stage," said Robson, "I didn't go on any tennis websites because I was so jealous of everyone able to play."
Robson told BBC Sport that she is now "past that stage" and will be able to start playing mini tennis with sponge balls in August.
"At the moment it's kind of a day-to-day thing in terms of pain and how the inflammation is going, but rehab seems to be coming along nicely," she said.
27 - Highest WTA ranking - now 80
115 - Career singles matches won
91 - Career singles matches lost
Â£700,000 - Total career prize money
0 - Career titles
1 - Olympic medal (silver) in mixed doubles with Andy Murray, London 2012
Robson's left wrist first flared up in December 2013 when she was forced to withdraw from the ASB Classic in New Zealand. A week later she retired from the Hobart International with the same injury. She has since undergone minor wrist surgery.
In March, Robson added Colombian Mauricio Hadad, who helped Maria Sharapova win Wimbledon in 2004, to her coaching team.
The US Open - the final Grand Slam of the year - gets under way on 25 August in New York.
Robson's only full match to date this year was a swift defeat by Kirsten Flipkens at the Australian Open in January, and she is already targeting Melbourne next year on her route back up the rankings.
"I'd still like to be able to play some matches at the end of this year and get some competitive tennis in before Australia," she said.
"I'm basically going to be playing some very small tournaments to try and get my ranking up again."
The former Wimbledon junior champion admitted that such an extended absence from tennis has been hard to cope with.
"I didn't look at the live scores, and I didn't watch any tennis on TV.
"But now I'm kind of past that and I'm looking forward to being able to watch Wimbledon as a spectator for once."
Robson will be working as part of the BBC commentary team at Wimbledon, which begins on 23 June.
