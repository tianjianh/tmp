The 36-year-old Australian was taken into custody in Queensland on Wednesday before being released without charge.
A Queensland Police spokesman said it followed reports of a disturbance, but would not give further details. Local media said it was at the home of Mr Hackett's parents.
His family later told reporters they had concerns for Mr Hackett's welfare.
Local media reported Mr Hackett's father, Neville, called police on Wednesday.
Television footage showed Mr Hackett displaying his handcuffs to waiting cameras as he was driven into a police station.
Neville Hackett told the Gold Coast Bulletin his son had not made any threats, and he had been receiving medical treatment.
The former Olympian's brother, Craig, told media "this is not Grant Hackett".
"This is a completely different person. I don't know this person, my mum and dad don't know this person," Craig Hackett said in footage broadcast by Nine News.
"He's there in body but he's not there in mind, soul or spirit."
Mr Hackett won Olympic gold in the 1,500m freestyle in both 2000 and 2004 and had a long-standing rivalry with compatriot Ian Thorpe.
The 10-times world champion returned to the pool last year to make an unsuccessful bid to qualify for the Rio Olympics.
He was questioned by airport police in Melbourne last April after allegedly groping a passenger on a flight. He said he had been drinking in the wake of his Olympic disappointment and publicly apologised.
Mr Hackett has previously struggled with prescription drug problems and admitted he became dependent on a sleep medication.
The swimmer flew to the United States in 2014 to spend time in a rehab centre after he was spotted topless and disoriented in the lobby of a Melbourne casino.
