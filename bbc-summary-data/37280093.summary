Luton Town striker Danny Hylton says there is no reason why the Hatters cannot win League Two this season.

Hylton scored a hat-trick in Saturday's 4-1 win over Wycombe as the club moved to the top of the table.
"I believe that we've got everything in place to go on and do well. For me, I want to go and win the league," the 27-year-old told BBC Sport.
"I'm sure there's a lot of people that have the same view as me. I don't see anything why we shouldn't do that."
Hylton has scored five goals in six League Two appearances after moving to Kenilworth Road in the summer, having turned down a new contract with Oxford United, despite helping them to promotion to League One last term.
He continued: "We've got a team that work really, really hard, and we've got players who have great ability. If you've got both you're going to do well. But the hard work is the main thing, the desire to do well.
"The manager keeps us grounded, we work hard every day, he's learning and he's a top, top coach and players are improving all the time."
Boss Nathan Jones is embarking on his first full campaign as a manager, and Hylton said he has been impressed by the Welshman's attitude to the game.
"From the minute I met him it was like 'wow', he just blew me away. Some managers can just say the usual stuff and you've heard it all before, but when I spoke to the gaffer he sold it to me," he added.
"We work on our shape and how we want to play throughout the week. He said 'if you talk Japanese on a Monday to Friday, you'll talk Japanese on a Saturday'.
"When it comes off and we're doing well, you see how enthusiastic he is, clapping, shouting in Spanish and getting excited, but that's because he loves the game."
