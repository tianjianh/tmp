Mrs Allan left her home in Ponteland, Northumberland, early on Boxing Day wearing pyjamas and a waterproof jacket. She was later seen on CCTV on Newcastle's Quayside.
The body of the 59-year-old was recovered from the River Tyne at Tyne Dock West, Jarrow, on Wednesday.
Northumbria Police said a report has been prepared for the coroner.
The disappearance of the mother-of three sparked a major search operation involving many local people in her home town.
When the CCTV images emerged, police divers searched a section of the River Tyne but drew a blank.
Flowers were laid at the spot where she was last seen by family and friends.
