Two notices at St Mary's on the Isle of Wight warn drivers not to use an "ambluance parking only" area.
Julie Packer informed the BBC via Facebook after seeing a photograph of the error.
The Isle of Wight NHS Trust said private firm Car Parking Partnership (CPP), whose logo appears on the signs, had made the mistake.
A spokesperson from ParkingEye, speaking on behalf of the firm, said: "The production of this sign was subcontracted to a third party by CPP.
"The misspelling will be corrected as soon as possible."
