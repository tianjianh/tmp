Defender Poole joined from Newport County in September 2015, debuting in a Europa League tie in February 2016.
The 18-year-old did not make a first team appearance during the 2016-17 season but says senior players have told him to be patient for his chance.
"I made the breakthrough last year so I did want it again this year," he said.
"That's all you want as a footballer, more and more of it."
Poole says Pogba, the world's most expensive player, has been one of those to offer advice.
"People like Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba came through the youth team and they are the ones that help us as they know exactly what we're going through," he explained.
"They're all nice people and really genuine guys.
"They know it takes time. I get a bit ahead of myself sometimes and they tell me 'take your time' and 'slow down.'
"I'm 18 but some of them are 21 in the reserves now and had a little bit of a taste at the end of the season against Crystal Palace and did really well."
Poole's senior Manchester United debut was a late substitute in a Europa League game against FC Midtjylland, a game in which Rashford made his Red Devils bow.
Rashford, 19 scored twice in the 5-1 win and is now part of the first team squad as well as an England international.
Cardiff-born Poole has represented Wales at various youth levels including Under-21 and is included in the squad for the Toulon Under-20 tournament in France.
"We're really excited by it and I think we'll do well over there," Poole added.
"It's a tough start as they will have home advantage."
