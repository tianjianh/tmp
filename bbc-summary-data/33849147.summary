After a record crowd of more than 4,000 watched Hereford FC win their first ever league game at Edgar Street on Saturday, midfielder Aaron Birch says the fans are the key to any success.

A total of 4,062 people - the most in the history of the Midland League - saw the newly-formed club beat Dunkirk 4-1.
"The crowd are going to help us win this league," said 20-year-old Birch.
"I've never played in front of so many. It was surreal. The hype for this game was massive."
Formed in the aftermath of Hereford United's winding-up in December 2014, Hereford FC beat FC United of Manchester in their first game back at Edgar Street during pre-season in July, again in front of a large crowd of almost 4,250.
A hat-trick from striker John Mills and another from forward Pablo Heysham got the Bulls off to the perfect start to life in the ninth tier of English football.
Birch says they have now set the standard they have to try and match consistently.
"We're going to have to keep playing well to keep the crowd coming, it works hand-in-hand," he added to BBC Hereford and Worcester.
"I think the players will be loyal - I can't see why anyone would want to leave with the potential that's here and the crowds."
