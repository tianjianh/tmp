Kyle Bartley believes assistant boss Pep Clotet deserves credit for Leeds United's improved defending.

Leeds, 15th in the Championship table, looked vulnerable at the start of the season, particularly at set-pieces.
But central defender Bartley has formed an impressive partnership with Pontus Jansson in recent weeks.
Bartley, on loan from Swansea, told BBC Radio Leeds: "You'd have to give the credit to Pep. He had a look and then changed our set-up slightly."
The Yorkshire side were beaten in their opening two league matches of the season, losing 3-0 at QPR and then 2-1 at home to Birmingham.
But on-loan Torino defender Jansson, 25, has played a key role in their improvement.
Leeds have kept clean sheets in their last two games and conceded just two goals in their last four matches - and just one in their last four away games.
Bartley, also 25, explained: "We have Pontus as a spare man who isn't picking up anyone and whose job it is to go and attack the ball, which he has done very well.
"It's made us look a lot more solid. We're going out there now thinking we're going to win, not just hoping."
