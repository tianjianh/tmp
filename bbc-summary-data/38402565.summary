The woman was driving a Ford Focus which was involved in a collision at about 12:50 on the A82 at Lochend, near Inverness.
Three people in a Land Rover Discovery were not injured.

Police said the casualties were not thought to have life-threatening injuries. They were taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness for treatment.
The collision involved a Peugeot van and a Renault Scenic and the A9 was closed for several hours after the crash at about 09:30, before it was later fully reopened.
The A82 remains closed around the scene of the crash.
The incidents came amid snow falls and heavy rain showers.
