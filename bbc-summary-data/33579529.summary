It follows the discovery of a suspicious object in Victoria Street.
Ch Supt Pauline Shields said: "The alert began after a call was received suggesting a device may have been left in the area.
"Officers are conducting a thorough search to ensure the safety of the public and investigations into an item located earlier are ongoing."
She added: "As this alert continues, we are thankful for the cooperation and support of local people, a number of whom have had to leave their homes."
Officers have warned residents not to touch anything suspicious.
The road has been closed to traffic and a police helicopter has been used in the security operation.
Translink said the 15:20 BST train service between Dublin and Belfast train will terminate at Portadown as a result of the alert.
Affected passengers will be taken to Belfast by bus.
Upper Bann MLA John O'Dowd, from Sinn FÃ©in, condemned those responsible, saying they had  "brought nothing but disruption to the local community".
"Those behind this alert are not representative of the people of Lurgan and should stop these pointless actions immediately," he added.
