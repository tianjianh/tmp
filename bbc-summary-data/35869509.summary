A man was shot on Monday close to St Brendan's Primary School in Craigavon at closing time as pupils left the grounds.
The injured man is in a "stable" condition in hospital.
Education Minister John O'Dowd said the attack caused distress to both children and adults.
"The emotional well being of pupils is paramount," he said.
"I have asked for a critical incident team to be dispatched to the school to offer support and assistance."
He said the attack demonstrated a "blatant disregard" for the safety of pupils, parents and staff.
"I also want to commend school staff who reacted courageously during and after the attack, to ensure the safety of their pupils. The actions of St Brendan's staff are in stark contrast to those who carried this attack," he said.
