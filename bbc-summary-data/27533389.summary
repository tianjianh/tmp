[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No party has managed to gain control of Worcester City Council following the local elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Of the 12 seats that were up for election, the Conservatives gained one with Matt Lacey taking the ward of Claines from the Liberal Democrats.
It means the Conservatives have 17 seats, Labour has 16 with the Lib Dems and the Greens holding one each.
Wyre Forest District Council also remains under no overall control and Labour retained control in Redditch.
It has 17 of the 29 seats in Redditch, after gaining two.
Conservatives remain the largest single party in Wyre Forest, with 15 seats, while UKIP were the big winners on the day, gaining five seats.
In Worcester, the council was controlled by the Conservatives until May 2013, with the support of two Lib Dem councillors.
Then the Lib Dems switched their allegiance, along with one Green councillor, to hand control to Labour.
Adrian Gregson, Labour councillor and current council leader, said: "There will obviously have to be some discussions on what happens next, with all the parties.
"We've held all our seats and have increased our votes in some of those, but the people of Worcester have said it's a really tight vote here and in most places have rejected the main national parties."
Conservative Simon Geraghty said: "I think it is time to have a discussion and see if we can do things slightly differently in Worcester."
