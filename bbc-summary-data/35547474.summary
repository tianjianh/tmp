Separated people face more violence, figures suggest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People separated from their partners are more than four times more likely to be victims of violent crime than those who are married or in civil partnerships, figures suggest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Crime Survey for England and Wales found 4.2% of separated adults had been victims in the year ending March 2015.
The figure for those married or in civil partnerships was 1%.
New detailed data also showed students were more likely than other groups to be victims of violent crime.
Responding to the survey, 3.4% of full-time students said they had been victims at least once in the last year, compared to 1.9% of people in "routine and manual" jobs, 1.8% of the long-term unemployed and 1.5% of people in "managerial and professional" work.
Among those surveyed were 1,067 separated people, 15,014 who were married or in civil partnerships and 1,027 full-time students.
Based on reporting their own experiences of violent crime in the year up to the end of March 2015, higher-risk groups included men, people aged 16-24, those of a "mixed or multiple ethnic background" and "adults in low-income households".
