[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Braintree kept Guiseley firmly entrenched in the survival struggle with a 2-0 win at Cressing Road, considerably enhancing their own prospects of staying in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There was little for the supporters to get excited about in the first period. Will Hatfield found space but shot wide for the visitors, and Craig Braham-Barrett fired just over for Braintree.
Jerome Okimo helped to break the deadlock early in the second half, coming up from the back to head in a set-piece, getting the Braintree faithful dreaming of salvation in two weeks' time.
Michael Cheek added a second from close range on 71 minutes to put matters beyond Adam Lockwood's men.
