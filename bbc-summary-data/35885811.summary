Louise James lost her partner Sean, her two sons Mark and Evan, her mother Ruth Daniels and her 14-year-old sister Jodie Lee Daniels in Sunday's accident.
The five victims were killed when their car slid off the pier and into the sea.
Ahead of his visit, Catholic Primate of All-Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, described it as an "enormous tragedy".
The Derry native travelled back to his home city on Wednesday to pay his respects to Ms James, on the eve of a joint funeral for her loved-ones.
The only survivor of the accident was her four-month-old baby girl, Rionaghac-Ann, who was rescued by passer-by Davitt Walsh, who swam out to help the family.
"At a time like this I realise that any words of mine are totally inadequate," Archbishop Martin said.
"The enormous tragedy that has struck this family has stunned us all into silence.  What can we say?  All we can offer is our spiritual presence with them and the promise of our prayers.
"People from all over Ireland and beyond want to be close to all the bereaved in this time of grief and desolation.
"Even in the midst of such awful tragedy this family has made us all think of how precious and important our loved ones are to us."
Archbishop Martin also visited the Holy Family Parish Church in Derry to sign the book of condolence and meet clergymen who will officiate at the funeral service.
