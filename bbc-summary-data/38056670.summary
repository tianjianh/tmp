World number two Rory McIlroy will focus on ensuring he produces his best golf in the majors next season.

The 27-year-old admits his 2016 major efforts were a disappointment in what he feels was otherwise a good season.
McIlroy has also targeted Colin Montgomerie's money list record after watching Henrik Stenson succeed him as European number one on Sunday in Dubai.
"Next season I just need to make sure the majors match up to what I am doing outside of them," said McIlroy.
McIlroy, who has four majors to his name, failed to genuinely threaten to add to that tally in the year's four biggest events.
He recorded two top-10 finishes and two missed cuts in this year's majors and described his putting as "pathetic" after making an early exit from the US PGA for the first time in his career.
"My major championship performances haven't been what I wanted, but if you take the majors away I feel like I have played pretty well and had a good season," added the Tour Championship and overall FedEx Cup title winner.
He relinquished his European number one status to Open champion Stenson at the season-ending DP World Tour event at Jumeirah Estates over the weekend.
And the three-time European money list winner revealed he has the record eight titles of Scotsman Montgomerie in his sights.
"When you see someone do something you have done before and have not quite achieved this year, of course you want to do it again," said the Northern Irishman.
"I want to win the Race again, I have got a few more years and it would be nice to pass Monty.
"That will be a nice little target to aim for and hopefully I can get my fourth next year.
"I know if I win tournaments and play well in the big events that these things sort of happen in the process."
