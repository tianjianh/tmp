[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Lee Chung-yong lashed home a sensational late winner for Crystal Palace at Stoke to put the Eagles level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham.

Connor Wickham's powerful penalty gave Palace a first-half lead.
Stoke levelled from the spot when Damien Delaney was punished for handball and Bojan stepped up to dispatch his fourth goal of the season.
With both sides looking for the winner, Lee found it with a 30-yard shot which sailed past Jack Butland on 88 minutes.

Stoke will feel aggrieved not have taken at least a point, but Mark Hughes' side lacked the spark of two weeks earlier when they beat Manchester City at home.
Palace never dominated but were always a threat on the break and they will wake up on Christmas Day level on points with Manchester United and Spurs, who occupy a Champions League spot.
Palace have now won 11 of their last 16 away games in the Premier League, and they were once again rewarded for a composed performance against one of the better sides in the league.
Alan Pardew's side knew when to sit back and soak up the Stoke pressure, knowing they had willing outlets in wingers Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie.

Zaha was a particular threat on the right and provided Palace's opening goal after being clipped by Glenn Whelan in the box.
And it was Bolasie's intervention which eventually led to the spectacular winner for the visitors.
The Congo international raced through but was denied by the impressive Jack Butland in the Stoke goal.
The resulting corner was eventually cleared by Stoke but only as far as Lee, who struck his shot perfectly across Butland and into the top left-hand corner.
Stoke missed an opportunity to reaffirm their top-10 credentials and will be disappointed to have only five shots on target from 26 efforts at goal.
There was plenty of patient build-up from the clever Bojan and industrious Xherdan Shaqiri but a lack of finesse when it mattered.
Bojan, in particular, should have done better from eight yards when he shot straight at keeper Wayne Hennessey just after Stoke had equalised and with Palace wobbling.
Marco van Ginkel deflected a cross from the left on to the post, while Glen Johnson and Marko Arnautovic also went close on a frustrating afternoon for the Potters.
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "We were the totally dominant side - there is no way we should have lost that game. Crystal Palace were resolute and had the benefit of a penalty and then they were happy to sit back and hit us on the break.
"It's two years running they have come here and nicked the points. If they were honest they would say they didn't deserve to win today.
"We tried to get back into the game, could have converted any number of chances and then the lad scores a wonder goal. He hasn't scored many like that in his career.
"We are playing well enough. On another day we would have won."
Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: "Stoke bossed us in the second half but we showed the qualities which are why we are where we are. We have been terrific away from home ever since I have been here.
"We are dangerous when he have the first goal as we have pace on the break. Stoke were due a goal for sure, they put some real quality in and a draw would have been a fair result.
"The goal which won it was brilliant. It will wake all of Asia up tonight. We want to fight for that sixth place."
Stoke face Manchester United at home on Boxing Day, knowing victory would take them to within three points of their manager's former club. Crystal Palace visit 14th-placed Bournemouth on the same day.
