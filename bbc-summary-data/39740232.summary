Former world champion Scott Quigg has a better work ethic than Manny Pacquiao, according to trainer Freddie Roach.

Quigg, 28, moved to work under hall of fame inductee Roach at California's prestigious Wildcard Gym in February.
Quigg, who meets Romanian Viorel Simion in an eliminator for the IBF featherweight title held by Lee Selby, said he is now "a different fighter".
"He's the only guy who works harder than Pacquiao," said Roach, who also trains the eight-weight world champion.
"That's a big call," added the seven-time winner of the Boxing Writers' of American Trainer of the Year award.
"His work ethic is great and we've seen a lot of really good changes already in the gym."
Quigg, who lost the WBA super-bantamweight world title to Carl Frampton in 2016, won on his only outing at featherweight in December.
The meeting with Simion, who has one defeat in 22 fights, forms part of the undercard to Anthony Joshua's heavyweight title fight with Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium.
It will be Quigg's first bout since parting ways with Manchester-based trainer Joe Gallagher.
"I've always wanted to keep improving," said Bury-born Quigg. "I'm walking into the gym with Freddie and I feel like I'm back in school, keeping on learning. The sparring, the quality, just being around that environment I feel a different fighter.
"I think it's the best place to be. You're sparring all different kinds, you can't get better preparation. The subtle changes that have been made I'm putting into practice against world level opposition. I'm confident on Saturday night you will see the best ever Scott Quigg."
