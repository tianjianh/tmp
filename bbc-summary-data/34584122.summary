West Brom striker Rickie Lambert is "desperate" to end his goal drought in a bid to keep the Baggies away from the bottom of the Premier League table.

The 33-year-old has yet to score since his Â£3m summer move from Liverpool, and has not netted a first-team goal for nine months.
"I'm more desperate than anyone else. It's what I get paid for," the England forward told BBC WM.
"I'm just going to keep working hard and hope it comes this Saturday."
Lambert spent a frustrating season at Anfield, where he made only seven Premier League starts, following the arrival of Mario Balotelli.
And he has again been confined largely to the bench at The Hawthorns, having started just three top-flight games so far.
He hopes that if he keeps working hard under Albion boss Tony Pulis, then the chances will come - starting this Saturday at Carrow Road against promoted Norwich City.
"I know there's more to this role under Pulis than just scoring goals," he said. "You get asked a lot more defensively than I've had in the past, but it's something you have to get used to and I'm trying to get as fit as I can.
"He's decided to go with Salomon Rondon at the minute, but I'm on the bench waiting for my chance."
Having managed seven goals from nine games, three by Saido Berahino, 13th-placed Albion are the Premier League's second-lowest scorers.
"We want to improve our attacking," he added. " We want to be more adventurous and score more goals. But we want to keep our strength as a team, which is that we do not concede goals."
Rickie Lambert was talking at the 25th anniversary of the WBA Foundation, a registered charity which works alongside the Baggies.
