David Haye should "focus on the fighter" rather than "trash talk" before his bout with Tony Bellew, says former world champion Floyd Mayweather.

The British Boxing Board of Control warned Haye and Bellew about comments at a pre-fight news conference.
Former WBA heavyweight champion Haye meets WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew at London's O2 Arena on Saturday.
"Trash talking is OK but being disrespectful is something totally different," Mayweather told BBC Sport.
"I heard he was talking about the fans. He should focus on the fighter."
Retired five-weight world champion Mayweather, 40, also told a BBC Sport Facebook Live he had "done his part" regarding a much-anticipated fight with Irish UFC star Conor McGregor.
"I'm just waiting - if they really want the fight to happen, let's see," said the American.
WBO world welterweight champion Manny Pacquiao will fight Great Britain's Amir Khan on 23 April and Mayweather, who outpointed Pacquiao when the two met in 2015, wished them both luck.
"May the best man win," he said. "We saw what both boxers did in their last fights."
