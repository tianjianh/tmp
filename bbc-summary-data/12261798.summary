Gabor's release from the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles has come more than a week earlier than expected and doctors are pleased with her progress, added John Blanchette.
The 93-year-old star of 1950s films Moulin Rouge and Lili had her leg amputated   because gangrene developed after a hip replacement operation in July.
Mr Blanchette said Gabor's husband, Frederic Prinz von Anhalt, had said his wife was now "feisty, yelling at nurses and at him. Everything is back to normal".
Gabor was admitted to hospital on 2 January after attempts to save her leg with antibiotics were unsuccessful.
The star had been admitted to hospital a number of times since breaking her hip in July.
After the hip replacement surgery, she went on to develop swelling in her legs and blood clots throughout her body.
She was in a critical condition and had asked for a priest during a trip to the hospital in August, but she recovered and was sent home.
She was readmitted to hospital in the new year because a wound in her right leg had grown and "wasn't healing any more", Mr Blanchette had said. Gabor had reportedly been bedridden for months.
The veteran actress was partially paralysed in a car accident in 2002 and suffered a stroke in 2005, after which she used a wheelchair.
Gabor starred in the films Moulin Rouge, Touch of Evil and Queen of Outer Space, among others.
