Nicky Smith wants to make up for a disappointing Six Nations campaign when Wales play Tonga and Samoa in June.

Smith, 23, started one game in the Six Nations as Rob Evans established himself at loose-head.
But, with Evans and Gethin Jenkins injured, Ospreys' Smith is keen to take his chance.
"Going from starting the first game in Italy to being on the bench for the rest of the Six Nations was disappointing," said Smith.
"But, looking back on it, it wasn't the worst thing in the world to happen to me.
"I was disappointed at the time, but it was my first full Six Nations campaign and I was still involved in every game, and it has made me more hungry."
Wales play Tonga in Auckland's Eden Park on Friday, 16 June followed by a Test against Samoa in Apia on Friday, 23 June.
Smith is part of a relatively inexperienced Wales squad, with 12 players on duty with the British and Irish Lions and a number - like Evans and Jenkins - injured.
Smith has made 12 appearances for Wales, but 14 of the touring party have never played in a Test.
"I'm really excited to extend my season," added Smith.
"At my age, you want to play as much rugby as you can because you've got that desire to impress and keep working hard.
"Tonga and Samoa are big boys and one thing that has really improved in Pacific Island rugby in the last few years has been the set-piece.
"They've always had strong forwards, but now their technique is very good too and it means we're going to be facing sides with a very strong scrum.
"As front-row forwards we want to give our team a strong platform and I've been working hard on that in training."
