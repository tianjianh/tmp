The Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) has banned for life 15 players and officials involved in match-fixing.

Those banned include former Zifa chief executive Henrietta Rushwaya and coach Sunday Chidzambwa, who took the Warriors to the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time, in 2004.
Football's world governing body, Fifa, has indicated that it will uphold any bans applied by Zifa.
The bans follows the conclusion of an independent inquiry set up by Zifa.
An official report of its findings was released on 16 October in which it recommended life bans for 13 players, 10-year bans for seven other players, 37 five-year bans and 25 two-year bans.
Justice Ahmed Ebrahim, a former Supreme Court judge who was chairman of the the independent committee, said at the time: "Today will go down as a sad, depressing day in the annals of history of the game in Zimbabwe.
Justice Ebrahim added that what the investigation has revealed "may well only be the proverbial tip of the iceberg".
Zifa president Cuthbert Dube also believes that there is more work to be done.
"We will not step down until we clean up football," he said.
"There is match-fixing in the premier league and in division one, and we are not pleased with the standard of our referees."
An initial Zifa investigation into national team tours of Asia between 2007 and 2009 found that players were paid to lose matches.
A total of 16 players have been cleared, including Al Hilal striker Edward Sadomba.
Zifa has yet to confirm the punishments for the other 70 players and officials involved in the investigation.

Henrietta Rushwaya - former Zifa CEO
