Estudiantes v Gimnasia La Plata brawl: 15 players given bans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Argentine FA has sanctioned 15 players with bans ranging from one to eight games after a mass brawl in a pre-season friendly match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game between Estudiantes and arch-rivals Gimnasia La Plata was called off in stoppage time after players punched and kicked each other.
Estudiantes duo Alvaro Pereira and Mariano Andujar and Gimnasia's Nicolas Mazzola were all given eight-game bans.
Three Gimnasia players were each banned for five games.
Another nine players from both sides were suspended for between one and four matches, while the Argentine government has banned 12 players from entering stadiums for two league matches.
Uruguay defender Pereira has since joined La Liga side Getafe on loan, but he will not be able to make his debut until April.
