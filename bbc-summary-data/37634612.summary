[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The master of a Shetland boat that sank has been jailed for six months after he admitted failing to preserve a crewman's life.

Leonard Scollay, 40, died after the Diamond hit rocks and sank near Burrafirth harbour on 25 March 2014.
At Lerwick Sheriff Court, Christopher Smith, 39, also admitted neglecting to keep a proper lookout.
Sheriff Philip Mann acknowledged that Smith was "truly remorseful" over the death of a friend.
It was Mr Scollay's first voyage to sea and he had not had any sea survival training. He was not wearing a life jacket.
A previous Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) report said both the skipper and Mr Scollay had taken drugs.
It said their ability to function had been significantly impaired as a result.
The MAIB report, released last year, said: "The skipper employed Leonard without ensuring that he was appropriately trained.
"It is likely that Leonard Scollay would have survived had he been wearing a lifejacket.
"However, he had taken heroin before the accident and this would have impaired his ability to survive or to appreciate his predicament."
Defence agent Martin Morrow said it was "unquestionably difficult" for the court.
Sheriff Mann said that Smith had pleaded guilty to a "very serious charge" of failing to keep a proper lookout.
"Unfortunately Mr Scollay lost his life; you fortunately survived," the sheriff said.
He said no sentence he could impose would "bring Mr Scollay back or lessen the grief" felt by his family, but by passing sentence he was "not engaged in trying to place a value on Mr Scollay's life" as that would be impossible.
Smith's six-month jail term was reduced from nine months to reflect his guilty plea.
