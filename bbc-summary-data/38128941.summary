A group of 13 "woefully" equipped student walkers were rescued from Snowdonia at the weekend.

They called for help at 16:15 GMT on Saturday when one member suffered a panic attack in fading light on Carnedd Llewelyn.
An RAF mountain rescue team was nearby and was able to escort the group to safety.
Chris Lloyd from Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue said they were poorly equipped in everyday street clothing.
The students were part of a walking club and were near the summit of the mountain when the alarm was raised.
Mr Lloyd said: "They had gone up the mountain on a glorious day. The mountain was white with snow and the skies were blue."
But he said some of the group were "inadequately dressed for going to the top" where temperatures are much cooler than they are at sea level.
The group had one ice axe between them and none of them had crampons - spikes fitted to boots for grip on snow and ice.
"They were determined to carry on with their route rather than turn back." said Mr Lloyd.
"Luckily for them there was an RAF team in the valley who walked them back to our base."
