A woman who died after eating a sorbet on holiday in Greece had warned her travel agent and hotel about her food allergies, an inquest has heard.

Amanda Thompson, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, collapsed after eating the strawberry dessert, the court heard.
Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Manchester coroner Simon Nelson concluded that something in the sorbet had triggered a fatal reaction.
Holiday company Thomson offered its "deepest sympathies" to her family.
Rochdale Coroner's Court heard Mrs Thompson, a 50-year-old mother of two, knew eating eggs, milk or apples would make her seriously ill.
When she went on holiday to Rhodes in 2012 with her family, she told the hotel's management about her concerns.
Her husband Ian told the hearing that shortly after eating the dessert his wife complained of a tingling sensation in her mouth and feared she was having a severe allergic reaction.
He said she went to the hotel room and collapsed. She never regained consciousness.
The inquest heard a Greek pathologist later concluded she died of natural causes, probably due to heart failure.
Mr Thompson said he always believed his wife died as a result of anaphylactic shock.
A British pathologist later confirmed that was indeed the cause of her death, the hearing was told.
Mr Nelson said he found it "astonishing" that neither the hotel management nor holiday company had launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mrs Thompson's death.
Thomson said in a statement: "We note the verdict of the inquest today and we'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the family at this extremely difficult time."
