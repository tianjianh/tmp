Jofra Archer (4-31) and Steve Magoffin (5-50), who had Paul Horton caught behind with the first ball of the match, did most of the damage.
Neil Dexter (52) was one of only four home batsmen to reach double figures.
Sussex openers Chris Nash (65) and Ed Joyce put on 82 for the first wicket but Dexter's 5-41 limited the home side's deficit to 47 at the close.
Sussex head coach Mark Davis told BBC Sussex:
"There was a load in the pitch all day, but we bowled much better after lunch than before, Jofra Archer and Steve Magoffin were really good and created pressure from both ends.
"The moment we did that we knocked them over quite quickly and then Chris Nash and Ed Joyce played like they have all year to put on 82 for the first wicket.
"We lost a few at the back end, but we're in a good place in the game, with a decent lead and we'll try and extend that tomorrow.
"It's good to bounce back after the defeat by Kent, albeit with a depleted team, but it shows the character there is in the group."
Leicestershire all-rounder Neil Dexter told BBC Radio Leicester:
"We let ourselves down a little in the afternoon session, which is disappointing, though we managed to claw back a little in the evening.
"There's something in the wicket, it's not doing massive amounts, just enough. Sometimes as a batting unit you can get yourself out before the ball is actually bowled.
"We're on the back foot, but hopefully we can come back tomorrow, restrict their lead and then build a couple of partnerships that will put the pressure back on them batting last.
"It's good to get five wickets, though personally speaking, a hundred always means a lot more!"
