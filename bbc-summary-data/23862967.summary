The Sea Trust, which took the picture, said the "very large" shark was estimated to be four metres (about 13ft) long.
It was spotted with a large pod of common dolphins during a survey in the Bristol Channel on Monday.
The Trust says the species is a rare sight in UK waters, with just six spotted in 2012 and two in 2011.
Thresher sharks have distinctive long tails and are known for breaching - or leaping - clear of the sea surface.
During the same trip, from Milford Haven, Sea Trust volunteers saw "pod after pod" of dolphins, many of which were pregnant or with newborn calves.
