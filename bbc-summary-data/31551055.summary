Tottenham Hotspur stadium: Family firm loses legal challenge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A business standing in the way of Tottenham Hotspur's Â£400m stadium redevelopment has lost its High Court challenge against a compulsory purchase order being used to force it out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Archway Sheet Metal Works, in Paxton Road, Tottenham, north London, asked a judge to quash the order.
The firm argued the order was "unlawful and invalid".
But Mr Justice Dove ruled there was "no legal flaw" in the decision-making process.
If Archway - the last objector to the purchase order - had won it could have thrown plans for the new 56,000 capacity stadium into disarray.
Instead, unless there is a successful appeal against the ruling, it is believed the way is now clear for Tottenham Hotspur to go ahead and build a "world-class" football venue.
Josif Josif, 46, who runs the family business producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry, was in court with other family members to hear the judge's ruling.
In November a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, located yards from the White Hart Lane ground.
