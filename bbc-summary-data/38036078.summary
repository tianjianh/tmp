[SN]TITLE[SN]
Liverpool 2-0 Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to 11 games with a win against Sunderland but could face a spell without Philippe Coutinho who was taken off on a stretcher at Anfield.

The Brazillian clutched his ankle after a challenge from Didier Ndong late in a first half where Liverpool failed to turn 80% possession into clear chances.
Sunderland threatened briefly in each period, with Steven Pienaar and Duncan Watmore taking heavy touches when presented with openings.
But as Jurgen Klopp's side continued to press, it was Coutinho's replacement, Divock Origi, who found the net with what appeared to be a right-foot cross from the left side of the area.
Relive Liverpool's win over Sunderland
Coutinho suffers injury
It sparked relief at Anfield and when Ndong felled Sadio Mane in the box, James Milner converted a spot-kick to make it 14 games unbeaten in all competitions for the Reds.
They now sit second in the table, a point behind Chelsea, while Sunderland drop to bottom spot.
Coutinho's injury, coupled with admirable Sunderland resistance, kept home fans quiet for long spells.
Klopp clearly banks on Anfield being an intimidating place to visit and a return of 16 points from 18 available at home this season points to him getting his wish.
But he was visibly frustrated early in the second half when he waved to the Kop and demanded more from supporters.
Sunderland created their best opening moments later when Liverpool keeper Loris Karius dived at Watmore's feet to block and Victor Anichebe's shot in the following melee was cleared.
But Liverpool's positivity was undeniable, with full-backs Milner and Nathaniel Clyne playing high up the pitch, Emre Can repeatedly joining attacks and even centre-back Joel Matip spending long spells in midfield.
They missed chances through a Dejan Lovren header and a Georginio Wijnaldum volley. But with a touch of fortune, Origi's in-swinging cross nestled in the corner and Milner's penalty was emphatic.
With no European football to distract them and no league defeat since August, Liverpool have clear momentum. Their former skipper Steven Gerrard watched their latest win from the stands just days after his retirement. Are Klopp's men capable of landing the one honour which eluded him?
How Liverpool deal with a potential lay-off for Coutinho will be critical in whether their momentum can lead to a push for that elusive Premier League title.
His contribution of five goals and six assists in the league sums up the key role he has under Klopp and his all-round displays have seen reports of interest from Barcelona.
Against David Moyes' side Coutinho seemed to be man-marked early on. When he escaped the attentions of Jason Denayer after half an hour he took a heavy touch in the area and felt the full force of Ndong's clearance.
There was no suggestion of a foul but Coutinho's foot took the impact of both the ball and Ndong's follow-through, and he instantly waved to the bench before grimacing during treatment.
Origi's impact points to Liverpool having the resources to deal with any spell out for Coutinho. But with Mane primed to attend the African Cup of Nations with Senegal in January, Klopp will desperately hope he has not lost arguably his most creative force for long.
Moyes had spoken of "parking the double decker bus at Anfield" and for long spells that tactic was deployed.
But Sunderland clearly had confidence as a result of back-to-back wins and they threatened early on, notably when Pienaar's heavy touch gave Karius the chance to save.
Frustratingly for their travelling contingent, the Black Cats dropped deep after half an hour and never really established a footing again. Denayer played the full match in midfield yet made just seven passes. He perhaps summed up Sunderland's retreat.
"This was the most defensive team I ever saw in my life," said Klopp afterwards.

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: "It was an intense game for us and a deserved win at the end. Sunderland always play a defensive style and that is OK. We forced them to be that. It is the most difficult thing in world football to come through but we stayed concentrated, worked for the moment and found a way."
Sunderland manager David Moyes: "I thought we had done enough to keep them out. But overall we worked very hard to stay in the game. We were never going to come here and have lots of chances so it was always going to be tough. But we weren't going to be rolled over and we weren't."
