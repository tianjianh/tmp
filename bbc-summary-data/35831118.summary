Motu Matu'u: Samoa hooker joins Gloucester Rugby from Hurricanes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premiership side Gloucester have signed Samoa international hooker Motu Matu'u from Super Rugby club Hurricanes on a deal to start next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matu'u has scored three tries in 42 appearances for Hurricanes since joining from Wellington in 2012.
The 28-year-old has won seven international caps for Samoa.
"His powerful, abrasive style of play is well suited to the Premiership," director of rugby David Humphreys told the club website.
"He will add further strength in depth to the Gloucester front five."
Gloucester are currently seventh in the Premiership table, eight points outside the top four.
