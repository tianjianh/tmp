The 22-year-old, who has not played this season due to a serious hamstring injury, joined the Exiles in 2012 from Super Rugby side Natal Sharks.
"We're delighted to keep hold of a player we've been developing for the last couple of years," assistant coach Clark Laidlaw told BBC Sport.
Palframan made his Premiership debut for Irish last season against Sale.
