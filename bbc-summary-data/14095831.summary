Tanzania profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tanzania's media scene, once small and largely state-controlled, developed rapidly following the advent of the multi-party era in the mid 1990s.

Television was a latecomer: state TV launched in 2001, several years after the first private station. TV viewing is eroding radio's traditional dominance.
Although the growth of the broadcast media has been hindered by a lack of capital investment, dozens of private FM radio stations are on the air, most of them in cities.
News from international radios - including the BBC, Voice of America and Germany's Deutsche Welle - is carried by many stations.
Government-owned media are "largely biased" toward the ruling party, says US-based Freedom House.
The mainland and Zanzibar have separate media policies. Many islanders can pick up broadcasts from the mainland and read the mainland Tanzanian press.
By June 2012, 5.6 million Tanzanians were online (Internetworldstats.com).
