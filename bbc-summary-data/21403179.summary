Dry Doddington church rivals Leaning Tower of Pisa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Villagers who believe their church tower tilts more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa are trying to get official confirmation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tower of the Church of St James, in Dry Doddington, is believed to lean between 4.9 and 5.1 degrees.
This would mean it leans more than Italy's famous tower, which tilts at 3.99 degrees.
The friends group for the Lincolnshire church is now raising money to protect its tower for future generations.
Church warden and treasurer Alex Maniurka said: "There's definite indications that we are up there with the Leaning Tower of Pisa and if we could beat it I think it would be something very special.
"Day on day we get people driving past who have to stop and have a look and take a double take at the lean of the angle.
"They can't believe that it leans so much."
A local history society is being set up to uncover the church's past and find out why the tower tilts.
Thomas Braithwaite, a member of the church's friends group, said: "They said there was a plague years ago and they buried some of the dead at the end of the tower which caused it to lean, but it hasn't moved for some years.
"I think it's the movement of the clay soil and things like that."
The tower needs Â£80,000 of repairs but the work will not alter its angle as it is thought to be stable, Mr Braithwaite said.
