Michelle Coleman did the Locked in for Autism challenge at Tesco in Long Eaton where she has worked for 11 years.
It was in support of Caudwell Children, a charity that supports disabled youngsters.
Ms Coleman said people with autism can often feel trapped, isolated and vulnerable.
The 48-year-old, who agreed to the challenge after an appeal to the store, said the response by people visiting the store had been overwhelming.
She said: "I've enjoyed it but I'm ready for my bed."
Ms Coleman said the idea of living in the glass box was to make people more aware of what autistic people can experience in their daily lives.
"Things like feeling you are being watched and finding it hard to communicate," she added.
While in the box, Ms Coleman changed costumes every two hours to keep herself occupied and entertain visitors.
Andy Bailey, from Caudwell Children, said: "Autism is the most prevalent disability in the country and 133,500 children have been diagnosed with the condition."
He said the challenge had allowed them to engage with visitors about the work of the charity.
The supermarket challenge raised about Â£2,500 for Caudwell Children.
