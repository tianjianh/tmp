A gravestone used as an ornament by a couple from Glyn Ceiriog, Wrexham, is thought to be a rare effigy of a medieval monk.

Meryl and Jerry Butler bought the stone at an auction in Ruabon in the 1990s.
Academics say the inscribed carving could be an image of a 13th Century Cistercian abbot from the Valle Crucis Abbey in Llangollen, Denbighshire.
Archaeology Prof Howard Williams, from the University of Chester, said it was a "unique monument".
Mr and Mrs Butler were restoring a medieval and Tudor house when they spotted the stone fragment for sale.
"We just loved the smile on his face, so we bought it for the garden," said Mr Butler.
"It was on its side and we think it had been face down before that - had it been left face up you wouldn't have the detail now."
The monument spent 20 years alongside the fireplace of the couple's home until they decided to share it with the public.
They approached Llangollen Museum, whose manager Gill Smith quickly realised its significance.
Ms Smith in turn contacted Prof Williams, who spoke of his "awe and surprise" on seeing the stone.
"I realised we were looking at a unique monument," he said. "We couldn't think of anything like it from north Wales.
"Inscribed effigies are rare indeed. There is only one other comparable example, from Rhuddlan, and while there are a large collection of medieval grave slabs from Valle Crucis Abbey, none have an inscribed effigy.
"What is amazing is that he is smiling. In this monument, we have an individual depicted fully aware and awake, awaiting salvation."
Prof Williams believes the original Lombardic inscription - of which only the final fragment remains - is likely to refer to Hwyel, who was recorded as Abbot of Valle Crucis around 1295.
"It's wonderful that he has survived and we are thrilled to see him appreciated at last," added Mr Butler.
"I'm sure one day he will go back home to Valle Crucis and perhaps more will be discovered about his life and times."
