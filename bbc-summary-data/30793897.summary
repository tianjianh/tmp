Andrew Birch, 46, from Skelmersdale, died when his Peugeot collided with a Toyota on Southport Road, Scarisbrick, Lancashire, on 6 January.
Police believe a grey BMW was involved in an overtaking manoeuvre, causing the other two vehicles to collide.
Detectives also want to trace a woman who was seen walking a husky-type dog.
Mr Birch's 80-year-old mother and a woman, aged 41, who was driving the Toyota were seriously injured in the crash.
Det Ch Insp Andy Hulme from Lancashire Police said: "If anybody uses the road on a regular basis and has seen a grey-coloured BMW being driven in an erratic manner, we would urge them to come forward.
"For one hour this evening, we will also be stopping vehicles travelling along the stretch of road near to where the collision took place to ask occupants if they saw anything at around the same time last week.
A 29-year-old man from Southport has been bailed until 4 March.
Two other men also arrested, aged 22 and 24, both from Liverpool, have been released with no further action.
