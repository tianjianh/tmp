[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hull City 1-1 West Brom

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A much-improved second-half display saw Hull City come from behind to secure a deserved point against West Brom at the KCOM Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors led at half-time through Gareth McAuley's header, as Hull's players conspired to play a full 45 minutes without a single shot on goal - much to the disgust of the home fans.
The introduction of Adama Diomande for the ill Ryan Mason at half-time brought a change of shape and attitude from Hull, who finally began to threaten the visitors' goal.
They were rewarded with a 72nd-minute equaliser from captain Michael Dawson, who steered home off the post after Robert Snodgrass' free-kick was nodded down by Dieumerci Mbokani.
Hull remain inside the relegation zone on goal difference having pulled level with West Ham and Crystal Palace on 11 points.
West Brom, who missed the chance to claim a third straight Premier League win for the first time in four years, stay in ninth.
Hull's first-half performance was probably as poor a 45 minutes as any Premier League team has managed this season.
With 15 minutes of the contest gone they had allowed West Brom an astonishing 82% of possession and looked woefully short of confidence and ideas.
There was a feeling of inevitability about West Brom's goal when it came just after the half-hour, McAuley getting up ahead of Curtis Davies to nod Matt Phillips' corner into the net and sap away what little atmosphere there was inside the ground.
Half-time was met with boos from the home fans, who were rightly concerned at seeing West Brom carve out six shots to Hull's none.
Better was needed and better was exactly what they got.
Diomande's entrance for Mason saw Hull switch to a three-man front line also comprising Mbokani and Snodgrass, and the results were immediate.
A first corner of the match arrived on 46 minutes, their first shot of the match after 50, and then - as is the way of these things - another followed seconds later.
Snodgrass was instrumental in the improved display - as he was in Hull's win against Southampton in their last home game - and it was his free-kick that helped them back onto level terms, Mbokani attacking a high delivery to create the opening for Dawson to apply a smart finish.

West Brom boss Tony Pulis will be frustrated at seeing his side fail to continue their winning run, particularly given the confidence coursing through the squad after Monday's thumping 4-0 win over Burnley.
Presented with an abject Hull performance in the first half, West Brom could and should have had the game sewn up long before Dawson equalised.
Rather than go for the jugular, the visitors allowed Hull back into the match after going in front and by the break the possession percentage stats had gone from 82-18 in West Brom's favour to 50-50.
It was not as though West Brom were without the motivation to win by a bigger margin. Victory by at least two clear goals would have taken them into sixth place, ahead of Manchester United and Everton on goal difference.
But even though they were second-best for most of the second half, they did have two good chances to claim the win in the dying moments.
Nacer Chadli's curling 25-yard free-kick needed a smart save from David Marshall to keep the scores level, and right at the death Salomon Rondon nodded wastefully wide from James McClean's inviting cross when hitting the target was the minimum requirement.

Hull City boss Mike Phelan speaking to BBC Sport: "In the second half we upped our tempo - I made a change and it seemed to do the trick but overall our just rewards was the draw.
"We set up to try and contain West Brom at times but we went in 1-0 down from a set-piece, which if we do our jobs properly shouldn't happen. But I think the belief was there for the players.
"It's easy to say let's go gung-ho and throw loads of forwards on the pitch, but I think they were value for money first half and we were value for money second half."
West Brom boss Tony Pulis, speaking to BBC Sport: "We played really well in the first half and we restricted them a lot but you have to give them credit in the second.
"Having said that, we came again and had the best chances but we weren't thinking about our position in the table.
"We are playing with more swagger recently. We should have created more chances but we played on Monday so we are 48 hours behind Hull in terms of prep."
Hull are back in action at the KCOM Stadium on Tuesday night with an EFL Cup quarter-final tie against Newcastle (19:45 BST). Mike Phelan's men resume Premier League duty at Middlesbrough on Monday, 5 December (20:00), while the Baggies return to action next Saturday with a home league match against Watford (15:00).
