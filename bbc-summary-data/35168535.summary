Star Wars: The Force Awakens has been added to the nominations for the Critics' Choice best picture award.

The Broadcast Film Critics Association (BFCA) chose to add the film to the 10 nominees it announced last week.
The decision was made, its president said, because "many members felt [it] deserves to be in our consideration".
The best picture prize is the only award the new Star Wars film will be in contention for at the Critics' Choice awards ceremony on 17 January.
The move is unusual but not unprecedented, as Cast Away was belatedly added to the nominations list in 2000.
The Force Awakens, which opened in cinemas last week, was not shown early enough for BFCA members to vote for it in the initial awards ballot.
Members were polled this week to see if they would have voted it as one of their top five films of the year had they seen it before the voting deadline.
"The results were such that it was obvious this was a movie that would have been in the top 10 if it had had the chance," BFCA president Joey Berlin told Screen Daily.
He said adding the film to the best picture nominees was considered to be "the best compromise in the best interests of the movie, members and our audience".
"It would be foolish to suggest that the incredible popularity of the film isn't a factor," Berlin admitted in another interview with Variety. "And I can't deny that this is also a good thing for the Critics' Choice Awards show.
"But it's really the popularity of the film amongst the critics, that it's getting such good reviews."
According to Box Office Mojo, the new Star Wars film has now made more than $610m (Â£409 million) at the global box office.
Cast member Peter Mayhew - aka Chewbacca - was among those to alert his Twitter followers to the Critics' Choice organisers' change of heart.
Mad Max: Fury Road has received the most nominations from the critical body, which included George Miller's action film in 13 different categories.
