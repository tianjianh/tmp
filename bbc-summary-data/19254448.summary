Salmon fishery board condemns Usan's fishing extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fishery board has condemned the Scottish government's decision to extend the season for the country's biggest wild salmon netting company.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Esk District Salmon Fishery Board said giving Usan Salmon Fisheries an additional 14 days to catch fish was "recklessly irresponsible".
It has described the move as making "no sense at all" in terms of conservation.
A government spokeswoman said there was no evidence the extension would have a detrimental impact on stocks.
Usan Salmon Fisheries will be allowed to net and kill salmon between 1 September and 14 September, after the end of the statutory netting season on 31 August, for three years from 2012.
The reason for the extension had been stated as "to compensate the fishery for disruption" caused by Marine Scotland Science having "access to fish and genetic samples during the commercial fishery season" for tagging research purposes.
Hugh Campbell Adamson, chairman of the fishery board, said: "We are perturbed by the government's unilateral intention to allow netting in September.
"It makes no sense at all from a conservation perspective to permit any additional pressure on salmon stocks."
Mr Campbell Adamson said the government had paid Usan Â£30,000 for its assistance in procuring 95 salmon for radio-tagging between February and April, but an offer by the board to continue to make cash payments to the company as compensation for the tagging programme in May and June was rejected by Scottish government.
The chairman said that instead the government is allowing Usan to kill up to 1,000 more salmon with a potential gross value of some Â£50,000.
Mr Adamson said the move was in stark contrast to the government's promotion of catch and release to fishery boards and anglers, he added: "Usan's nets in the South Esk district killed 6,500 salmon last year.
"It beggars belief that the netting season is now being lengthened."
A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said it was fully committed to salmon conservation and that no license would have been granted had there been evidence it would have a detrimental impact on stocks.
She added: "The licensed fishery has been granted in support of the National Fisheries Management Demonstration Project being carried out on the South Esk.
"This is an innovative three year research project, being carried out by Marine Scotland Science, applying science-based management techniques to better understand the status of salmon stocks on the Esk."
