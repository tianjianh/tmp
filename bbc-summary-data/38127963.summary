Barcelona's Real Sociedad draw was 'worst game' under Luis Enrique

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique says the performance in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad was their "worst game" during his time in charge.

Barca were lucky, with La Real having a goal wrongly ruled out for offside, as well as hitting the woodwork twice.
"This is the first time I've seen a team walk all over us since I became coach," said Enrique, boss since 2014.
"If we look at the result, it is the best of the season. The opponents were far superior."
Barcelona's next La Liga game is against leaders Real Madrid next Saturday, and the champions are six points off their rivals going into El Clasico.
"I'm sure we'll see a different Barca in the Clasico," said Enrique.
Barcelona trailed deservedly to Willian Jose's header, but Lionel Messi equalised six minutes later.
Barca, who have not won in their past eight away games against Real Sociedad, were dominated on possession for the first time this season, with only 47.7% of the ball.
Fifth-placed La Real should have retaken the lead when Juanmi tapped home, but it was harshly disallowed, while Carlos Vela hit the crossbar and post.
"Most teams try to get the better of us by defending but they played a good game, trying to play with the ball, and they deserved the three points," added Enrique.
"We are in week 13, you can't discount the champions from the past two seasons. There is still a long way to go."
Meanwhile, left-back Jordi Alba is a doubt for El Clasico with ankle and knee problems. The club said "how he evolves will determine his availability for the next few games".
