PSNI murder bid accused Christine Connor agrees to wear tag

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who has been on remand for two years on charges including attempting to murder police has been released on bail after agreeing to wear a tag.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christine Connor, whose address in north Belfast cannot be published due to a reporting restriction, is charged over two attacks on police in May 2013.
She previously applied for bail on two other occasions.
However, both times she was told it was conditional on her wearing an electronic tag, which she refused.
The most recent application was at Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
However, returning to court on Tuesday, her barrister said Ms Connor was now willing to be tagged as part of her bail conditions.
A judge said he was willing to grant bail as a result.
As well as being tagged, Ms Connors has to adhere to several other conditions which include obeying an 8pm to 7am curfew, reporting to police on a daily basis and surrendering her passport.
Ms Connors and her co-accused Stuart Downes, 30, from Ryton Close in Shrewsbury are expected to stand trial on charges arising from the incidents in May 2013, which include a pipe bomb attack on police in the Ballysillan area of the city.
