[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council report has outlined details of the financial commitment given in order to "maximise the economic benefits" of the Borders Railway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A blueprint to "stimulate business growth, generate employment and boost visitor numbers" was launched in November 2014.
The current cost of projects associated with it is more than £17m.
Scottish Borders Council has committed more than £7m of capital and revenue funding to the schemes.
The multi-million pound line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in the Borders opened to passengers last year.
The blueprint was developed by Scottish Enterprise along with the Scottish government, Transport Scotland, Abellio ScotRail and the City of Edinburgh, Midlothian and Scottish Borders councils.
£3.5m
Permanent home for Great Tapestry of Scotland
£3m
Central Borders Business Park upgrade
£100,000 Marketing programme
£62,300 Integrated transport at station "hubs"
£39,600 Steam train experience
Since its launch, work has concentrated on an action plan to deliver "key investments and commitments".
The Scottish government has committed £10m in principle to meet any "funding gap" in realising these projects.
Scottish Borders Council has already given its support to a number of the schemes associated with the railway.
A report to the local authority said that without this financial commitment there was a risk the blueprint's "economic and community benefits" would not be realised.
Councillors are being asked to note the "significant progress" achieved while agreeing to get further regular reports on the action plan.
