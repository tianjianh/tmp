[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr McKay, who was 36, was shot dead at his home on Longlands Road on 25 October.
Requiem mass was held at St Gerard's church on the Antrim Road for Mr McKay on Friday.
Fr Gerry Cassidy said Mr McKay had died "in the early summer of his life".
He said sympathy and prayers were also with the family of David Black who was murdered on the M1 motorway in Northern Ireland on Thursday.
Mr McKay, the father of a 10-year-old child, was shot several times as he sat alone on a sofa in his living room. He died at the scene.
At least two armed men were involved in the attack.
Police have asked anyone who saw a silver Volkswagen Bora, which had been stolen by five masked men in the New Lodge area shortly before the shooting to contact them.
The car was later found burnt out in Ardmoulin Place, west Belfast.
