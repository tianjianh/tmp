The 27-year-old recorded a time of five minutes 41.8 seconds at the Lee Valley Park Velodrome in London.
Sbihi won world championship gold with the GB men's eight boat in September.
"It's a big record and it's stood for quite a long time so I'm delighted to have broken it, especially in the Olympic season," he said.
Sam Townsend, world silver medallist in 2014, was second, with Paul Bennett third.
Richard Chambers won the lightweight men's 2k category in 6mins 8.8secs.
