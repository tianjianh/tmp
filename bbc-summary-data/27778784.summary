Stanning, 29, will be competing at an international meet for the first time since she won gold with Glover, 28, at London 2012.
"We're in the top British boat so we want to win," Stanning told BBC Sport. "I want to do the boat justice."
Britain's team, featuring 30 European medallists, will compete in 18 classes.
Stanning returned to rowing last November after a six-month stint in the army, winning the British trials in April before missing the European Championships as a precaution.
She replaces Polly Swann, who moves to the eight after winning European gold with Glover in the pair earlier this month.
Despite adding the European title to her Olympic and world crowns, Glover knows the three-day World Cup regatta, which starts on Friday, offers tough competition.
"We didn't have America, Australia or New Zealand at the European Championships, so we know we will have to raise our level," said Glover.
"But this race and the following one in Lucerne is just a stepping stone to the World Championships in August in Amsterdam."
Alex Gregory, Moe Sbihi, George Nash and Andy Triggs Hodge remain in the men's four after their victory at the European Championships.
"We gelled from the first day together as a crew," said Gregory. "There will be a bigger, more competitive field this weekend, so it'll be good for our development as well as giving us the opportunity to put down a marker for Amsterdam."
Gregory added the regatta also gives teams the chance to test the water and venue that will host next year's World Championships, which double as the qualifying regatta for the Rio 2016 Olympics.
Great Britain topped the medal table at the European Championships earlier this month, winning two gold, four silver and two bronze medals. Fifteen of the 17 boats reached finals.
"Every lake is different and has a slightly different feel," he said. "Depending on your location, the water will feel different on the blade or under the boat, so rowing on the lake is important."
Alan Sinclair and Nathaniel Reilly O'Donnell have been moved from the pair into the eight, which will be coxed by former world under-23 medallist Henry Fieldman, rather than world champion Phelan Hill.
Olympic single scull bronze medallist Alan Campbell will miss the regatta for family reasons.
In the lightweight events, Charlotte Taylor, who reached the European final in the single on her senior debut, moves into the double with world under-23 champion Eleanor Piggott.
They form a second double boat behind Imogen Walsh and Olympic champion Kat Copeland, who took bronze in Belgrade.
