Northern Ireland children learn of concussion dangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New lessons on the dangers of concussion have been made available to all schoolchildren in Northern Ireland.

The lessons are part of the "Recognise and Remove" campaign for schools on the risks associated with head injuries.
They can be accessed online at the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) website.
The campaign was launched following the death of Benjamin Robinson from Carrickfergus in a rugby match in 2011.
The 14-year-old was allowed to carry on playing despite suffering from concussion.
His parents had argued he should have been taken off the pitch, after being momentarily knocked out during the game.
While most attention has been focused on rugby, Benjamin's father, Peter, said there were risks beyond the rugby pitch.
"We teach swimming, we teach road safety, and concussion can happen anywhere," he said.
"Rugby is probably leading the way when it comes to dealing with concussion, but it can happen in any sport.
"It doesn't even have to be in the sports environment, so it's vital that everyone knows the signs and symptoms."
Mr Robinson was at the launch of the lessons at Lagan College in Belfast, as were representatives from the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Ulster Rugby, the Irish Football Association (IFA) and Ulster Hockey.
The lessons are not compulsory, but Education Minister John O'Dowd said that it was important they were widely used.
"In extreme cases, lives could depend on this, and we want young people to know that they are not letting the team down if they feel they cannot continue," he said.
"The coach should also not be under pressure to make sure a young person stays on the pitch.
"The best thing to do if someone has a head injury is that they sit the rest of the game out."
The Principal of Lagan College, Amanda McNamee, said it was vital to be prepared.
"It's something we've seen not only on the sports pitch, but when children are playing and moving around at the school," she said.
"We become the parents of the children during the school day when they're in our care, so it's important that we don't put children unduly at risk and we are making sound decisions based on information we have been given."
