One of Sark's two banks to close, NatWest announces

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Sark's two banks will close next year, NatWest has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rob Girard, island director of NatWest Guernsey, said it was a "difficult decision", but the branch would close on 27 February 2015.
The company is working with Guernsey Post to run counter services at the Sark Post Office to allow cash and cheque deposits and cash withdrawals.
HSBC, which runs the other bank, said there were currently no plans to close its branch.
Mr Girard said the closure meant there was "one role at risk of redundancy".
He said the move followed "significant" changes in banking in the past few years.
"The number of customers using the branch has dropped by nearly 30% over the last four years whilst online and mobile transactions have grown by more than 200%," Mr Girard said.
"We have advised staff and we are notifying our customers to make them aware of the closure and the different ways they can still bank with us."
