A garage in Bristol which is barely big enough to fit a Mini car in has sold for nearly £50,000.

The lock-up, in in the Clifton area of the city, had been put up for auction with a guide price of £35,000.
But the unnamed buyer, who lives locally, approached the auction house just hours before the sale and made the offer which was accepted by the seller.
Auctioneer Andrew Morgan said that the 2.7m (9ft) wide and 5.7m (19ft) long space could also be used for storage.
He said interest in garages was always high.
"We recently sold another slightly bigger garage for £67,000 and the buyer flew back from the United States to look at it and then instructed a friend to buy it.
"The prices achieved do vary and fall as you head out of the central areas, but when several are offered in the same location people snap them as potential building sites."
