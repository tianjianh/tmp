[SN]TITLE[SN]
Faulty coal fire flue at house where Kimberley Jones died

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The flue of a coal fire at the home of a woman suspected to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning was blocked, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Kimberley Jones, 25, was found by a paramedic at the house in Cwmbach, Aberdare, on 9 August, 2013.
Mother-of-one Ms Jones was due to move into the house the following day, but was allowed to stay the night before.
Tests on the fire showed the flue was ineffective allowing smoke to leak into the room, the Aberdare inquest heard.
During those tests carbon monoxide gas was at 16 times the acceptable level.
Ms Jones' father, Andrew Jones, told the inquest he knew the owner of the house, Ms Linda Parfitt, as a family friend for 25 years and he arranged to buy the house from her to use as a home for his daughter.
Ms Parfitt left the property at the start of the week and Mr Jones was decorating it that week.
He said he stayed there for two nights to keep the house secure.
His daughter, who worked as a care worker, was due to stay there on Thursday 8 August, but Mr Jones said he had woken up cold the previous morning so decided to light the fire.
He told the inquest that he told his daughter to keep a window open as he did not want her to die from carbon monoxide poisoning.
He said: "That will haunt me for the rest of my days."
Mr Jones said his wife called him the following morning as she could not contact their daughter.
He said he went to the house but the emergency services were already there.
He told the coroner he identified his daughter's body later that day.
Plumbing inspector Howard Reed told the coroner the fire was dirty with a lot of soot and debris.
Tests showed its window and door leaked smoke and carbon monoxide tests found that after two hours there were 829 parts per million (ppm) of the gas in the room.
A domestic carbon monoxide alarm would sound at about 50 ppm and levels of between 600 and 750ppm are likely to cause fatalities, the hearing was told.
Debris on the fire's throat plate, which is used to restrict airflow, was blocking the flue and Mr Reed estimated it had not been removed for "many years".
The owner of the house at the time, Ms Parfitt, told the inquest that she and her ex-partner arranged for the fire to be installed.
Ms Parfitt told the inquest that a vent in the living room had been there prior to moving into the house.
She said that she did not inspect it and could not explain how a magazine cover found its way into the grill opening.
When shown a picture of smoke coming from the fire during the inspection after Ms Jones died, Miss Parfitt told the coroner: "I've never seen smoke coming out of it like that - I'm sure about that."
The inquest has now been adjourned until later in the year.
