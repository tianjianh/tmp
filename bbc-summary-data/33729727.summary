Jose Mourinho's Blues finished eight points ahead of second-placed Manchester City last season, with Arsenal third and Manchester United fourth.
But Shearer says the Gunners need to sign a striker, United still have "work to do", and believes City's new Â£49m signing Raheem Sterling is not worth the amount of money he cost.
Gary Lineker and Match of the Day return to BBC One on Saturday 8 August, marking the start of the new Premier League season.
