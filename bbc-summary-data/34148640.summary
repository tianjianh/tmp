Jo Konta played down her winning streak after reaching the US Open third round, saying she is "no Serena Williams".

The 24-year-old Briton beat ninth seed and Wimbledon finalist Garbine Muguruza to reach the last 32 of a Grand Slam for the first time.
It was her 15th win in a row and set up a third-round meeting with Germany's Andrea Petkovic.
"I am going to lose sooner or later - I'm not invincible. I'm no Serena Williams," said Konta.
"I'm just honestly happy to be still in this tournament and get another opportunity to compete."
The British number two, ranked 97th in the world, saw off Muguruza over the course of three hours and 23 minutes - a modern record for a women's match at the US Open - but expects to recover for her next match.
"I believe I will be absolutely fine by tomorrow," she said.
"I need a good night's sleep. This is what we train for. This is why we put the hours in that we do. This is not my first rodeo with a three-and-a-half hour match."
Konta's last defeat came against Russian world number three Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon, since when she has won two challenger titles in Canada and come through three rounds of qualifying and two in the main draw at the US Open.
Born in Sydney, Konta's family came to the UK in 2005 and she is based in Eastbourne, but moved her training base to Gijon in northern Spain at the end of last year.
She has also been working with "mental coach" Juan Coto, a London-based Spaniard who also works with hedge fund managers and city workers.
"We have been doing some great work together," said Konta. "He's a big part of my team and with my coaches.
"He's just helped me a lot with dealing with things and with enjoyment and just keeping things in perspective.
"You know, this tennis world, this tennis community, is very much a bubble and it's very easy to get lost in here. You know, there is a real world out there still."
