Wilberforce's campaigning led to the passing of the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which ended Britain's involvement in the Transatlantic slave trade.
To mark the 210th anniversary of the law, a 3D figure of the Hull-born abolitionist will appear in four films.
The videos will be shown around Hull as part of the city's year of culture.
They are to be projected onto the side of the Wilberforce Institute, opposite Wilberforce House where he was born, from 18:00 GMT.
The films will then to be shown at Paragon Station and the Wilberforce House Museum.
John Oldfield, of the University of Hull's Wilberforce Institute, said: "We are telling his story again for a new audience.
"There is a lot of interest around the issue of slavery, both historical and contemporary.
"His success was hard-fought. It is a fight that still goes on."
The University of Hull and the Glasgow School of Art have created a digital 3D version of Wilberforce showing him at different stages of his life.
The Wilberforce figure is voiced by a drama student with his movements captured for the new video.
The Home Office estimated in 2014 there are up to 13,000 people in the UK still working in slavery,
"Enslaved persons are hidden in plain sight and it's about poverty and deprivation," said Mr Oldfield.
