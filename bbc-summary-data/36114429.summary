[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northamptonshire PCC Adam Simmonds 'should come clean over IPCC inquiry'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police and crime commissioner should "come clean" over the outcome of an investigation into allegations of misconduct, a former MP has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) passed the findings of its inquiry into Northamptonshire PCC Adam Simmonds to prosecutors.
The Crown Prosecution Service said it was awaiting Mr Simmonds's response before making its decision public.
Ex Labour MP Tony Clarke said the outcome should be revealed.
A spokesman for the Conservative PCC, who is not standing for re-election on 5 May, refused to comment.
The IPCC investigated claims Mr Simmonds breached the Data Protection Act by disclosing "sensitive" information relating to a criminal investigation to third parties in 2013 and committed an offence of misconduct in public office.
The matter was referred to the IPCC by the Northamptonshire Police and Crime Panel.
Northamptonshire Green Party spokesman Mr Clarke, the Northampton South MP from 1997 to 2005, said: "Taxpayers have a right to know the outcome of this complaint and if he has nothing to hide he would have no problem informing us.
"I would ask him to come clean. Everyone is aware a complaint was lodged. It is not acceptable for Adam Simmonds not to comment."
A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman revealed to the BBC it had written to Mr Simmonds and was awaiting his response.
An IPCC spokesman said: "The investigation is complete and a file was provided to the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS has now given its decision which has been communicated to Mr Simmonds."
