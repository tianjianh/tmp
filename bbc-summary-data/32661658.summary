Along with his fans, many celebrities have backed him publicly on social media.
One of the most controversial comments was from singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya who said Khan was "not at fault at all" because roads were meant for "cars and dogs", not for people to sleep on.
He has since apologised for the remark.
The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi asked people on the street for their view on the volley of support for Khan.
