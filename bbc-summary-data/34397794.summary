[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doctors have been granted approval to carry out the UK's first 10 womb transplants, following the success of the procedure in Sweden.

Ethical approval has been granted for the transplants - as part of a clinical trial - and will launch in spring.
Around one in 5,000 women are born without a womb, while others lose their womb to cancer.
If the trial is successful, the first UK baby born from a womb transplant could arrive in late 2017 or 2018.
More than 100 women have already been identified as potential recipients of donor wombs.
Dr Richard Smith, a consultant gynaecologist at the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in London who has been working on the project for 19 years, will lead the transplant team.
He said childlessness could be a "disaster" for couples, but the technique would offer hope to those whose only other option is surrogacy or adoption.
How would the procedure work?
The 55-year-old said: "I've met many of the women who want this and it's really important for them and their partners.
"There is no doubting that, for many couples, childlessness is a disaster.
"Infertility is a difficult thing to treat for these women. Surrogacy is an option but it does not answer the deep desire that women have to carry their own baby."
The women who will be selected for the trial must all meet criteria, which include being 38 or under, having a long-term partner and being a healthy weight.
More than 300 women have approached the Womb Transplant UK team, of whom 104 meet the criteria.
In October last year a woman in Sweden became the first in the world to give birth to a baby after having a womb transplant.
The 36-year-old, who was born without a uterus, gave birth by Caesarean section to a boy named Vincent after receiving a womb donated by a family friend.
