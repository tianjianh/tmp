Rachel Slater, 24, and Tim Newton, 27, from Bradford, failed to return from an outing on the mountain last weekend.
Lochaber Mountain Rescue stood down its search over the weekend and will now review its position on Monday.
Meanwhile, rescue teams found two male climbers who got into difficulty on Ben Nevis on Saturday.
Brothers Rory and Leon Probert from Wales were located in the summit shelter, cold and wet,  but otherwise unharmed.
LMRT had resumed a search for Ms Slater and Mr Newton on Saturday morning, saying a rescue team of 26 people and a search dog were involved in the operation.
However, Police Scotland said "very poor" weather, including high winds, falling snow and limited visibility, had halted teams.
"Sadly, there were no positive sightings today and searches have been suspended for [Sunday] due to increasingly hazardous weather and further risk of avalanches," the force said in a statement.
"Reviews continue to be ongoing and it is hoped that there will be an improvement to the conditions on Monday or Tuesday.
"Both Rachel and Tim's family continue to be apprised of these circumstances."
Treacherous conditions have also hindered air and ground searches on Britain's highest peak - in the Scottish Highlands - in recent days.
Ms Slater and Mr Newton were thought to have been camping near the Charles Inglis Clark memorial hut on the north side of Ben Nevis over last weekend.
The alarm was raised on Monday when they failed to return.
Searches on Saturday focused on the lower slopes from the north face of Castle Ridge, Castle Coire, below Waterfall Gully and the area around the CIC hut.
Temperatures were recorded at -6C (21F) on the summit - or -19C (-2F) with the windchill factor.
A post earlier on Saturday on the Lochaber Mountain Rescue team Facebook page said: "Our thoughts continue to be with Rachel and Tim's family and friends.
"We have assured them we will use our best efforts to find them.
"Conditions still remain extremely challenging with considerable avalanche risk, high winds and heavy fresh snow above 500m."
The rescue team said the interest in efforts to find the couple had been "absolutely overwhelming" with 1.1 million visits to their Facebook page this week.
