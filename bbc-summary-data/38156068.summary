Union concern on oil firm bargaining agreement change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unions claim workers at an Aberdeen-based oil services firm are without proper representation after it withdrew from a collective bargaining agreement over pay and conditions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Unite, GMB and RMT unions have raised concerns about the Bilfinger Salamis decision.
The fears are about future plans for pay, jobs and working conditions.
Bilfinger Salamis said leaving the Offshore Contractors Association allowed it closer dialogue with staff.
The OCA collectively agrees pay and conditions with workers on behalf of its member companies.
The Unite, GMB and RMT unions said Bilfinger Salamis's decision to leave had left its members effectively without trade union representation.
They have written to the company asking for voluntary recognition of their rights to represent workers, and that they would seek statutory recognition if necessary.
A joint union spokesman said: "Bilfinger's actions are causing massive concern among workers, who now have justified concerns about their future with the company.
"Trade unions are the way that workers come together to support each other, and it is completely unacceptable for Bilfinger Salamis offshore workers to be left without trade union recognition for collective bargaining."
A spokesman from Bilfinger Salamis said: "Since announcing our withdrawal from the OCA in December 2015, we have been in continual dialogue with the unions and will remain so through our employee representative committee.
"Both Unite and GMB have seats on this committee alongside the offshore workers that have volunteered to take part, with more joining since it was founded in May.
"We are proud of this initiative which enables closer engagement with both our workforce and the unions than was possible within the OCA."
