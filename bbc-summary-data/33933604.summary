Gordon Strachan: Regan relaxed over Scotland coach's contract

Scottish Football Association chief executive Stewart Regan says there is no rush for contract talks with Gordon Strachan.

The Scotland coach's current deal runs out after the conclusion of the Euro 2016 qualification campaign in October.
"Gordon and I have had a chat about it and we will sit down after the Euro qualification phase and we'll discuss his future," Regan told BBC Scotland.
"Gordon has made it very clear that he loves this job."
Former Southampton and Celtic boss Strachan, 58, succeeded Craig Levein in early 2013, midway through a disappointing World Cup qualifying campaign.
And he has a record of 11 wins and four draws from the 21 matches he has overseen.
"Gordon's got a contract in place, that contract is all about taking Scotland to a major final," added Regan.
"We're part way through a campaign, we're in a very good place going into our double-header against Georgia and Germany next month.
"The point I would make is that whilst Gordon is winning matches for Scotland and developing the country like he has done it becomes very difficult to do anything other than to support him."
Asked about whether or not there might be concerns Strachan might be lured away by another management job, Regan emphasised the commitment the Scotland manager had shown to the cause.
"It suits him, it suits his lifestyle," he continued. "He likes working with the players, he likes working with the Scottish national team.
"And we've got a commitment that we'll sit down and have a chat about this once we know where we are with qualification."
Scotland sit third in Group D behind Poland and Germany, with the top two places securing qualification for the Euro 2016 finals in France.
The best third place side also enters the newly-expanded tournament automatically, with the remaining third place teams playing off to determine the final four qualifiers.
With four games to play over the next two months, Regan admits the anticipation is building.
"I think the Georgia game is going to be huge, a really great opportunity to put daylight between ourselves and the Republic of Ireland," he said.
"If we can get a result in Georgia it means we come back to two huge games at home against Germany and Poland. The Germany game is a sell-out. The Poland game is well on the way, and we're all very excited."
"Gordon has got everybody absolutely up for it. The players are wanting to be part of the squad, everyone wants to be picked.
"The fans are excited, the phone calls are coming in about tickets so it's something to look forward to. We haven't had that for such a long time, we're in such a good place. It's now up to the squad to try and do the business."
