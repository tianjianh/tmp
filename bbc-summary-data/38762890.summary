[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A family who left the UK to live their dream life in a remote Italian village feared they would die when it was hit by deep snow and an earthquake.

Peter Fletcher and Clair Diamond, originally from Derby, said they were "petrified" when the impact left their home falling down around them.
The couple and their 13-year-old son were rescued by neighbours after four days with no heating or electricity.
They said the ordeal had left them too frightened to return to Italy.
The quake, earlier this month, followed four days of heavy snow that knocked out power and phone lines and left 6ft (1.8m) accumulations at their rural home near the eastern Italian town of Arsita.
Mr Fletcher said: "We took photos as the snow was falling and it was a fun thing, but when you can't look out of your front window and see daylight because of the snow, it's frightening."
The quake's impact brought down a barn, killing their pet dog, and left a hole in their roof.
The family knew they had to get away but were faced with a wall of snow when they tried to leave.
Miss Diamond said: "It was sheer panic. If we get stuck in our [mile-and-half-long] drive, nobody's going to know we were there.
"But if we stay in the house, we've got no way to stay warm, with no power or wood [to burn]."
The terrified family huddled in a corner of the house overnight and were rescued the next day by a neighbour.
Having returned to the UK, the family are staying with Mrs Fletcher's parents in Lincolnshire and have no plans to return to Italy.
Mr Fletcher said: "We thought we'd bought a piece of paradise but when the earthquake was shaking and we knew we couldn't get out, that was our worst nightmare.
"We can't possibly go back. We're frightened to death to go back."
