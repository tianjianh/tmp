The incident happened some time between 15:50 and 16:25 on Tuesday at the property near Outerford Farm.
The jewellery included a sapphire and diamond ring, an aquamarine gemstone ring and a gold necklace.
Police are keen to speak to anyone who may have been on the B7020 Lochmaben Road, B723 Lockerbie Road or the road linking them which runs past the farm.
PC Garry Duguid said: "This break-in happened over a very short time frame of around 45 minutes while the occupier was out of the house.
"We are keen to hear about any suspicious sightings around these times."
