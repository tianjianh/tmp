Lewis Grassic Gibbon's classic tale stars Peter Mullan and former model Agyness Deyn as Chris Guthrie.
It was shot on locations in Aberdeenshire last year, as well as New Zealand.
Director Terence Davies shot interior scenes in Luxembourg, the location of one of the film's major backers.
Sunset Song, published in 1932, follows a farming family struggling to eke out a living in north east Scotland in the years leading up to World War One.
It was the first in the author's "A Scots Quair" trilogy.
The BBC turned the book into a TV series in 1971.
In 2005 Sunset Song was named the "Best Scottish Book of All Time" at the Edinburgh International Book Festival.
The Toronto Film Festival runs from the 10 to 20 September.
