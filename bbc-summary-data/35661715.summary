Midfielder Craig Storie has signed a contract extension with Aberdeen until the summer of 2018 after becoming a first-team regular in recent weeks.

The 20-year-old has started four of the Dons' last five games.
Manager Derek McInnes told the club website: "We've always been aware of Craig's ability and he's really taken his chance in recent weeks when asked.
"He loves it here at Pittodrie and it wasn't a hard decision for him to agree to stay on for a further two years."
McInnes handed Storie his debut three years ago, but injury hampered the progress of the midfielder, who had loan spells with Forfar Athletic and Brechin City in League One.
The Scotland youth international, who had signed his previous contract in May, came on as a substitute against Ross County at Pittodrie in November and has since made five more appearances.
"I'm sure he'll have a big part to play for Aberdeen in the coming years," McInnes added.
