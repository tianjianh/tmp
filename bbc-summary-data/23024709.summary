The club agreed a deal in principle last week and were just waiting for documentation before confirming the "long-term contract".
The uncapped Spaniard, 25, scored 12 goals in 35 league games for Celta this season as they avoided relegation from La Liga on the final day.
Aspas was a target for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers's old club Swansea.
He becomes Liverpool's second Spanish signing of the weekend, 20, who has joined for a fee believed to be £6.8m.
They are set to be joined at Anfield by Simon Mignolet, with Liverpool expected to complete a £9m move for the Sunderland goalkeeper next week.
Earlier in the summer, Manchester City defender Kolo Toure, 32, agreed to join Liverpool on a free transfer.
