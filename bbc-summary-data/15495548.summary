[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Ormeau Baths gallery in Belfast has closed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Its board said it had no option after it failed to raise the extra sponsorship needed to cover its costs.
The gallery was known for its contemporary art exhibitions and showed work by artists such as Gilbert and George and Yoko Ono.
In a statement it said it had been pushed into "an unsustainable lossmaking position through a combination of factors".
These included "the high operating costs of the gallery, a general rise in exhibition expenses and more recently, a reduction in income from sponsorship, and corporate events held in the gallery".
"It is with great regret that, having reviewed our options, we have concluded that the gallery must close," a spokesperson for the gallery said.
"We would like to put on record our gratitude to the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Belfast City Council for their financial support over the years."
