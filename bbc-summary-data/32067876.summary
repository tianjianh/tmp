[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anne Jackson, who wrote under the name Anne Cluysenaar, was found stabbed in the chest and neck on 1 November last year at her home in Little Wentwood Farm, near Usk.
The 79-year-old's stepson Timothy Jackson, 49, from Sheffield, was ordered to serve a minimum of 19 years.
Cardiff Crown Court heard how Jackson killed his stepmother with a kitchen knife in a family row.
Prosecutor Roger Thomas QC said Jackson picked up the kitchen knife from a sideboard "five feet away" during an argument with his stepmother.
The court heard that in the days before the murder Jackson had been shouting and yelling at his stepmother and was "choking with anger".
His father described his son as a strange character and a bully who "drank like a fish and became a wild animal".
Det Chf Insp Roger Fortey of Gwent Police said: "Although today's sentencing concludes formal legal process it will not ease their sense of loss, however I hope it will provide a little comfort to them as they move on with their lives."
