RNLI rescuers said an adult and two teenagers fell into the water at Seaton Carew along with a fourth person, who swam out to try and help them.
The four were pulled from the water by a crew from the Hartlepool RNLI inshore lifeboat at about 17.30 BST on Sunday and were "shocked and cold".
The three who fell from the craft continue to be treated in hospital.
Hartlepool RNLI Lifeboat operations manager Mike Craddy said his team got to the scene very quickly before the situation "deteriorated."
