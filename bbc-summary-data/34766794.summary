Rangers fans 'sang offensive songs' on train to Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British Transport Police (BTP) are attempting to trace Rangers fans who sang "religiously offensive songs" on a train from England to Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 20 men boarded the Manchester Airport to Glasgow Central service at Lancaster at about 10:15 on Saturday.
They sang offensive songs until the train arrived in Glasgow at 12:30. BTP have appealed for witnesses.
Rangers later beat Alloa 4-0 at Ibrox. A minute's silence was held beforehand to commemorate Remembrance Day.
