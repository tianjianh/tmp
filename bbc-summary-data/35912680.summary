Despite the home side missing a host of chances, James Tavernier's goal sealed victory at Ibrox.
The result put Mark Warburton's side 17 points clear at the top of the table with four games left.
Promotion brings to an end a four-year journey from the bottom division to the Scottish Premiership.
Manager Mark Warburton, who has led the club to promotion in his first season in charge, said: "I am delighted for the fans for what they have been through. It's great for the players and the club to get back in the top tier.
"Promotion was a clear directive for the players this season but they have dealt with the weight of expectation and delivered. All credit to them."

With the club mired in debt, 54-times champions Rangers entered administration and were then liquidated in 2012 under the ownership of Craig Whyte, who has since faced criminal charges owing to his stewardship at Ibrox.
Forced to re-enter the Scottish professional football pyramid in the bottom tier, Rangers - under manager Ally McCoist and controlled by a consortium led by Charles Green - won League Two by 24 points.
League One was clinched in even more emphatic style the following season. They won 33 and drew three of their 36 matches to cruise to the title with a cushion of 39 points over second-placed Dunfermline.
Rangers' route to the top flight was complicated by the relegation from the Premiership of Edinburgh rivals Hearts and Hibernian.
Hearts surged to the Championship title last season ahead of Hibs as Rangers - amid more financial concerns and with Stuart McCall in charge in place of the departed McCoist - finished third before losing the play-off final against Premiership side Motherwell.
A change of ownership, with the club now in the hands of South Africa-based businessman Dave King, led to the arrival of former Brentford manager Mark Warburton in the summer of 2015 and heralded an upturn in Rangers' fortunes.
A run of 11 straight wins to start the Championship campaign laid the foundation for promotion.
Although a dip in form leading up to Christmas left the door ajar for Falkirk and Hibs to mount a challenge, only one defeat in 19 matches helped Rangers seal a place in the Premiership with almost a month to spare.
