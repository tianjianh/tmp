Up to 20,000 fans are expected to see Lyon defend their title against Paris St-Germain (19:45 BST kick-off).
Ludlow sees the match as a chance for Wales' rising players to see "world-class talent" in the flesh.
"That is the main reason why all our young international players are being asked to attend," she said.
"We have a few events happening on the day to make sure they're at such an event, so they can hopefully aspire to be one of those players in the future."
Recently crowned BBC Women's Footballer of 2017 Ada Hegerberg is among the big names who will be playing in Cardiff.
Ludlow said: "We can talk as coaches and in the environment we have and we can give examples of the top-level players we have - the likes of Jess Fishlock, who's out in America now - and different girls who are playing in the Women's Super League.
"But they never, for many of them, experience the live game and actually see their idols in front of them.
"So it's going to be a one-off experience for many, but hopefully it will end up bringing through top-level players for us in the future."
Former Wales Women striker Gwennan Harries has tipped Lyon to retain the title, saying: "They've got a little bit too much experience. They've been there before.
"They've won it twice - they're going for the third one. They've got that big-game know-how so I can see them running out as winners."
Harries also hopes female fans will be inspired to become involved in the sport in Wales.
"I've heard that there's going to be quite a good attendance and hopefully they'll see a brilliant game in front of them; a game that they feel they can take part in and that they'll be inspired by the girls out there playing and want to try to get involved in the game, whether it's playing or coaching or volunteering," said Harries.
