The short video shows Miss Yeates, 25, from Bristol, buying a pizza at a Tesco Express store near her home in Clifton on the night she was last seen.
It is believed she returned home, but no trace has been found of the pizza or its wrapping and police say its whereabouts could provide a vital clue.
Miss Yeates has not been seen since 17 December.
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: "The video has been released by detectives hoping people in the area at the time will remember seeing Joanna and contact the police."
CCTV of Miss Yeates at the Waitrose store in The Triangle on the night she disappeared has already been released.
Miss Yeates' parents, who live in Hampshire, have said they fear she has been abducted and could be dead.
However, Ch Supt Jon Stratford said there was "nothing to suggest she has come to any harm".
Specialist teams continue to search areas around the Clifton Downs and Avon Gorge for the missing woman.
Miss Yeates' family are taking part in a vigil for her at a church in Bristol later.
Worshippers at Christ Church in Clifton will be saying prayers for Joanna and her family are due to attend midnight mass.
Miss Yeates is thought to have returned to the flat she shares with her 27-year-old boyfriend Greg Reardon, but it is not known what happened next.
Her keys, mobile phone, purse and coat had been left behind.
Mr Reardon reported her missing to police on Sunday when he returned from a weekend visiting family in Sheffield.
Reverend Paul Langham, from Christ Church, said: "At all our services over the next couple of days we will be remembering the family in prayer and particularly at the midnight service we will be having a vigil as part of that service.
"Beyond that, obviously there may be people who have ongoing need for somebody to talk with and we are one of the places that people might feel able to come."
He said the doors would be open for anyone who wanted to light a candle or say prayers for Ms Yeates.
Her brother Chris has been handing out leaflets and putting up posters around Bristol in the hope of someone coming forward with new information.
He said: "We are just in complete despair about where she is and how everything happened. We just don't know."
Ch Supt Stratford, of Avon and Somerset Police, said there were 70 police officers and staff working on the case.
"We are not going to let Christmas get in the way of this (investigation)," he said.
Her father David Yeates said on Thursday that he thought she had been abducted after getting home to her flat.
Police officers and mountain rescue teams spent much of Wednesday scouring cliffs and woodland around the Avon Gorge.
In a message to his daughter, Mr Yeates said: "Please come home Jo. Our hearts are breaking up with not having our little girl with us. Greg is going through hell.
"Please contact us, we don't know what to do without you.
"If she's dead, please tell somebody where she is. We want her back whatever."
