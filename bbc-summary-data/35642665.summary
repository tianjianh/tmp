Tries for Ben Currie and Kevin Penny gave the hosts an early lead.
Craig Hall and Anthony Tupou touched down for Wakefield either side of a Kurt Gidley try for Wire.
But two tries from Chris Sandow and one from Currie secured a home win, despite Jonny Molloy's late try for Wildcats.
A difficult night for Wakefield began before kick-off, with full-back Ben Jones-Bishop suffering an injury in the warm-up.
Both sides struggled to create chances with ball in hand, but a string of Wakefield errors allowed the hosts to control field position throughout the first half.
Warrington dominated the game in all areas after the interval as they earned their third successive win, but their celebrations were dampened when highly impressive half-back Gidley was taken off after taking a blow to the head.
Warrington head coach Tony Smith:
"The results are okay but we know there is a lot more to come.
"A few players were off their game and we haven't quite hit the straps yet.
"We lacked some tempo but Wakefield played very well. They are a huge improvement on last year and I'm not saying that because my elder brother is their coach."
Wakefield head coach Brian Smith:
"We self inflicted at times and there was some very loose passing at the start and end of the game.
"But we competed very hard and if anyone looks at the scoreline they will think it lopsided but it wasn't.
"I have to give a big rap to my younger brother with Warrington having the makings of a very good team.
"If they are not up there or thereabouts at the end of the season I will be very surprised."
