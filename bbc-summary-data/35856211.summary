MCC v Yorkshire: Gary Ballance hits century in Abu Dhabi

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Ballance scored a century for Yorkshire on the opening day of the Champion County game against the MCC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yorkshire lost openers Alex Lees and Adam Lyth early on and spinner James Tredwell took three wickets to reduce the champions to 88-5 in Abu Dhabi.
However, Ballance (105) and Will Rhodes (95) put on 125 for the sixth wicket before Ballance was trapped lbw.
Rhodes missed out on his century as Yorkshire posted 275 before James Harris saw out an over in reply.
Yorkshire won the toss and decided to bat but, aside from England batsman Ballance and Rhodes, Lyth (13) and Andrew Gale (23) were the only men to make it into double figures.
The MCC rallied with the new ball following Ballance's departure, as Jake Ball picked up the wicket of Andrew Hodd, while Graham Onions removed Steven Patterson and Jack Brooks in consecutive balls.
Rhodes came close to hitting his maiden first-class ton during his final-wicket partnership with Karl Carver but was caught behind off the bowling of Rikki Clarke.
Middlesex seamer Harris saw out the one over the MCC had to face in reply from Brooks before stumps.
