World number one Van Gerwen clinched the Â£200,000 first prize with an 11-3 victory in the final.
The Dutchman, 27, had eased past Adrian Lewis 10-4 to reach the final, while Taylor defeated defending champion Gary Anderson 10-7 in his last-four tie.
Van Gerwen's previous Premier League title came in 2013, when he also beat Englishman Taylor, 55, in the final.
A second success rarely looked in doubt once Van Gerwen had raced into a 6-2 lead in the best-of-21-legs contest.
Taylor, a six-times Premier League champion, struggled to find his best form in the final and, having taken a 2-1 lead, lost 10 of the next 11 legs.
Van Gerwen told Sky Sports: "This feels fantastic for me, I'm over the moon to win this title. It's unbelievable.
"I'm playing stronger in this tournament every year, I've been top of the table four years in a row and I'm really glad I can hold this trophy now for the second time."
Taylor, a 16-times world champion, added: "I'm very proud to get through to the final. He beat me up, he put me under pressure, he's doing phenomenal things.
"I honestly don't know how he does it. His scoring is good, but his finishing is phenomenal and that's where it hurts you."
