Matthew Morgan has been tipped to be a success at the Cardiff Blues because of the artificial Cardiff Arms Park pitch.

Wales captain Sam Warburton and coach Danny Wilson believe Morgan will be ideally suited to playing there.
Morgan, 24, has joined from English Premiership side Bristol hoping to boost his Wales career.
"I think that it [the artificial pitch] was quite a big factor in signing Matthew," Warburton told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"The fact that he has got some of the best feet in international rugby to be honest - I don't think there are many guys better than that - and I think he will bring that on the surface we play on.
"We scored quite a few tries last year, there weren't many teams who scored more tries than us, but he will add to that again and will definitely improve our attack."
The diminutive fly-half left Welsh rugby in 2014 when he departed Ospreys, but is keen to add to his five Wales caps.
Legendary wing Shane Williams has repeatedly called for Matthews to earn a recall to Warren Gatland's side, having last played for Wales in their 2015 World Cup victory over Fiji.
Blues head coach Wilson said: "He's got an X-factor and I think that X-factor suits the surface we play on.
"It's a hard track and a fast track we have here at the Arms Park and it will be very suited to Matthew and his skill-set.

"Hopefully he's going to be the danger that we are all hoping."
Warburton, back with the region after Wales' summer tour to New Zealand is also excited to play alongside Kiwi centre Willis Halaholo.
The 25-year old has signed from Super Rugby side Hurricanes on a three-year deal.
"It is great for us Willis has chosen to play in Cardiff," Warburton added.
"He has been playing extremely well in the Super 15, he has quite a few tries and has been very effective for his club."
