Bilal Asif: Under-review bowler gets Pakistan Test call-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Off-spinner Bilal Asif has been added to Pakistan's squad for the second Test against England - despite his suspect bowling action being under review.

The 30-year-old will act as cover for leg-spinner Yasir Shah, who missed the first Test because of a back spasm.
Asif was reported for a suspect action following Pakistan's third one-day match against Zimbabwe this month.
He will join up with the squad in the United Arab Emirates after completing tests on his action in Chennai.
The outcome of the tests to determine the degree of straightening in Bilal's bowling arm will not be known until after the second Test has begun, and ICC rules stipulate no player is banned until investigations are complete.
Meanwhile batsman Azhar Ali is a doubt for the Test on Thursday after flying home following the death of his mother-in-law.
Ali missed the Abu Dhabi game because of injury. He was Pakistan's leading run scorer the last time the teams met in the UAE three years ago.
