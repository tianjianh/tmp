Actor Michael Sheen says the core values of the NHS are being undermined.

He made his comments on The Andrew Marr Show, saying: "This is beyond party politics. I think that's partly the point.
"There has been a systematic undermining of the core values of the NHS no matter who has been in power."
Last week Sheen delivered a passionate political speech to a pro-NHS march on St David's Day.
He said: "I think watching party politics snipe against each other, trying to make points against each other all the time, misses the slightly bigger picture that we are starting to become a society that we cannot be proud of.
"I think we really have to take stock of that and make a stand about it."
