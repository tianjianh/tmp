William Joyner was born without fingers on his left hand.
The Reading FC fan's blue and white prosthetic has been made by a senior lecturer and a PhD student at the University of Bedfordshire.
"My friends are really excited for me, I can't wait to take it home and show everyone," he said.
William from Towcester, Northamptonshire, aspires to play football in the British Paralympic team one day.
His mum Jo said: "That will really help him, especially with his football.
"It will help build his confidence and strengthen his left side because as the moment he doesn't use it much.
"Instead of people feeling sorry for him because of his hand, now they will be really impressed by his new one."
The hand was developed by senior lecturer David Jazani and technician Mark Hooper.
Mr Jazani said: "As engineers we are always looking for solutions to help people. This is only the beginning, we are looking to develop the hand as Will grows."
Mr Hooper added: "It's been brilliant watching him take to the hand so quickly and seeing the smile on his face.
"As the technology progresses, we hope to be able to help more people in the future."
William had a fitting on Tuesday for his permanent hand and will be able to take it home once some adjustments are made.
