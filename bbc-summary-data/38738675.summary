Canaries academy graduate Murphy has made 44 first-team appearances since his debut against Watford in the League Cup in September 2013.
The 21-year-old was set to be out of contract at the end of the season.
"He's got blistering pace, he's got real athleticism and he's a goal threat in pretty much every minute of the game," manager Alex Neil said.
"Those types of players are rare and hopefully he can become a first-team regular."
