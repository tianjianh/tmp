Farnsfield digester plans meets public concern

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concerns over bad smells have prompted opposition to plans for a organic power plant in Nottinghamshire.

A consortium of farmers wants to use carrots, maize and manure to produce gas for the National Grid.
But the owners of nearby Wheelgate Park and White Post Farm and residents of Farnsfield believe the odour could affect their lives and income.
At a meeting the consortium assured villagers they would work to keep the smells to a minimum.
Anaerobic digesters use organic waste pumped into a sealed container to produce power from methane gas.
Fresh Growers, the farmers' consortium, predicts it would produce enough electricity for 1,200 homes and enough gas for 2,400 homes, roughly the size of nearby Farnsfield village.
Meeting locals at a Farnsfield pub, developers admitted they would have to work to convince many.
Chair of the consortium, Bill Eastwood, said: "You cannot smell what is going on in the digester and the only thing which smells naturally is the mature and that will be delivered in sealed lorries.
"The material which comes out will smell like silage, which is a country smell and not invasive."
The plant is about 500 metres from family attractions Wheelgate Park, an outdoor fun fair, and White Post Farm, an animal petting centre.
White Post co-owner Simon Rouse said: "I am worried because it is an unknown. If there is a smell, the visitors will smell it. If they smell it, they won't come and that is 70 jobs gone."
The plans will be considered by the county council later in the year.
