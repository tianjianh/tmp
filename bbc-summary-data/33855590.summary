[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Premier League has announced a new deal with American broadcaster NBC Universal to show live games for the next six years.

US rights are already with NBC Universal at $83m (£53.2m) a season.
The Premier League has been negotiating its latest round of overseas television rights, having secured a record £5.1bn three-season domestic deal with BT Sport and Sky, which starts in 2016-17.
That dwarfs the existing £1bn-a-season agreement currently in place.
The new US agreement is in addition to the domestic rights deal and covers all Premier League matches in seasons 2016-17 to 2021-22.
The Premier League and NBC have not revealed how much the new deal is worth.
Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore said NBC Universal's coverage of the previous two seasons had driven interest in clubs, and the competition as a whole, to unprecedented levels.
The total overseas rights, which include lucrative regions such as the Middle East and North Africa (Mena), will be worth about an additional £2bn in the current deal cycle.
