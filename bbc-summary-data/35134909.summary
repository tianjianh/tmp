Hundreds of police community support officers (PCSOs) who faced being axed by the West Midlands force have won a reprieve.

Last month, Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said that the number could fall from 535 to 119 by 2020.
But he has confirmed that no compulsory redundancies will now take place, with cuts being made elsewhere.
Mr Jamieson said the force was "in a better place than before".

Last month, Chancellor George Osborne confirmed in his Spending Review that police budgets in England and Wales would be protected in real terms.
It followed fears they would face significant cuts.
Mr Jamieson said: "To protect PCSOs we are having to continue with efficiencies elsewhere, like the number of buildings we own and rent.
"West Midlands Police's funding is still going down, that is why we are having to continue to cut elsewhere to protect our PCSOs.
"The truth is that the pressures on the police are growing, we are dealing with issues like radicalisation, cyber-crime and child sexual exploitation in greater numbers than before, and our funding is still falling.
"There are still difficult choices to be made in the future."
