His decision follows a 1-1 draw at home to Cameroon on Sunday in Group B of 2018 World Cup qualifying.
The 62-year-old Serb met with the Algeria Football Federation president Mohamed Raouraoua on Tuesday to discuss the result, and his departure was announced shortly afterwards.
Rajevac replaced Frenchman Christian Gourcuff, who left the job in April.
Algeria's next 2018 World Cup qualifier is away to Nigeria on 12 November.
Only the group winners will qualify for the tournament in Russia.
The federation also announced on Tuesday that they have sent a request to Fifa for Bordeaux's Adam Ounas to switch national allegiances after playing for France at under-20 level.
"It was a decision of the heart, so it was not difficult to follow my heart," the 19-year-old told BBC Sport early this year.
The Bordeaux midfielder was born in France but is eligible to play for Algeria through his parents and was in the crowd for Sunday's 1-1 draw with Cameroon.
