[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mother of Weasenham St Peter dead baby faces no charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother arrested on suspicion of infanticide almost 27 years after her baby was found dead inside a carrier bag will not face charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The newborn was discovered at Windmill Pit, in Weasenham St Peter, near Fakenham, Norfolk, on 5 June 1988.
The baby, known as Baby Peter, was buried at the local church but exhumed last April for tests to be carried out.
The Crown Prosecution Service has advised police it is not in the public interest to prosecute the mother.
Norfolk Police tracked her down earlier this year using DNA.
In interview, the mother told officers she had delivered the stillborn baby alone after concealing her pregnancy from family and friends.
Frank Ferguson, deputy chief crown prosecutor in the East of England, said: "The original post-mortem on the baby could not show whether the baby was born alive and could not determine a cause of death.
"There was also no evidence of any injury. A more recent post mortem reached the same conclusions.
"In light of those findings, we concluded that there was no evidence that the baby was unlawfully killed by the mother."
The woman disposed of the body by throwing it into a pond in the village several days after the baby was born, Mr Ferguson said.
"The mother has clearly suffered beyond any punishment a court could impose."
