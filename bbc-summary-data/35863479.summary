The Australia international was a late replacement for the injured Phil Dollman and played 80 minutes in his first game for four months.
"I don't know how his lungs were," Hepher joked to BBC Radio Devon.
"He had a real solid game and that's all you can ask for from a full-back - a solid game is a good game."
The Devon side are top of the Premiership with fives game to play, with the meanest defence in the league.
Turner arrived at Sandy Park last month, having played for Toulon as cover during the World Cup.
"It's taken a little bit of time getting him up to speed because he's been out for a while, but he's bought into what we're doing," added Hepher.
"He's starting to understand what we're trying to get from situations and there's little bits coming from it.
"We like guys that can play in different positions.
"You can see that with Phil (Dollman) and Whitts (Ian Whitten) - Lachie's another guy that can play in numerous positions."
