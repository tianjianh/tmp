The Royal Society of Biology has announced the shortlist for its Photographer of the Year awards.

In the main category there are seven photos by amateur photographers, as well as three shots shortlisted for Young Photographer of the Year.
These were taken by Darpan Pasak, Timofev Zubarev and Oliver Tidswell - aged 12, 13 and 17 respectively.
The society invited submissions from around the world, on the theme of "conflict and survival".
The shortlisted photos include squabbles for food and mates between seabirds and muskox, as well as insects, plants and snails struggling against the environment and other species.
The winners will be announced at a ceremony in London on October 15, during Biology Week.
