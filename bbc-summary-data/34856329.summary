Brett Ferres: Huddersfield Giants suspend England forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Giants have suspended England international Brett Ferres "pending an internal investigation into conduct away from the club".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old forward, who helped England to a series win over New Zealand on Saturday, joined the Giants from Castleford in July 2012.
Injury limited him to just 13 Super League appearances last season.
The Giants confirmed in a statement that they would not be making any further comment at this stage.
