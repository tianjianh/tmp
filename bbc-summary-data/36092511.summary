[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cove Rangers 0-3 Edinburgh City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross Allum scored twice as Edinburgh City opened up a three-goal first-leg advantage in the pyramid play-off tie with Cove Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Allum put the Lowland League champions ahead and Gordon Donaldson netted their second.
And Allum scored again before half-time.
Highland League winners Cove were unable to claw back their deficit in the second half and the winner of the tie will face East Stirlingshire.
That second tie will decide which team starts next season in Scottish League Two.
