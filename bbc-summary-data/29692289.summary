London Ambulance Service (LAS) was called to reports of a woman feeling unwell at Farm Avenue, Wembley, last Wednesday.
It took the patient to Northwick Park Hospital, in Harrow, but she died in the ambulance.
"We are aware that there was an issue with the tail lift," LAS said.
"We are looking into the circumstances of what happened," a spokeswoman for the service added.
"Our ambulance crew, along with staff from Northwick Park Hospital, made every effort to resuscitate the patient but sadly she died."
The patient was diabetic and had been taken to hospital with symptoms of hypoglycemia, the Evening Standard reported.
