GB made the perfect start when Colin Shields netted his 34th international goal after four minutes and 28 seconds.
Nenad Rakovic levelled before a neat Matty Davies finish regained the lead.
Uros Bjelogrlic made it 2-2 but David Phillips put GB back ahead, David Clarke hit a brace and Robert Lachowicz fired the sixth in the final minute.
World ranked 24, GB have not qualified for the Olympics since 1948, when they were fifth.
Their final game is against hosts Italy, who are ranked 18, on Sunday, with only the group winners progressing to the final stage of qualifying in September.
GB head coach, Pete Russell, whose team beat the Netherlands 6-5 in their opening match, said: "One of the best things is we scored six goals again.
"We have got a lot of guys scoring at the moment and that is really good for us. We came here to be in this position and I am very much looking forward to Italy."
