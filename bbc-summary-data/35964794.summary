Canadian conservatives score big victory in Saskatchewan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The conservative Saskatchewan Party has swept to a third consecutive victory as the Canadian province held elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall has risen to national prominence as one the country's leading conservatives.
Mr Wall has become a frequent foil of Prime Minster Justin Trudeau and his recently elected Liberal government.
The largely rural province is seen as one of last conservative strongholds in Canada.
The Saskatchewan Party won a clear election, with victories in 48 out of 61 constituencies confirmed, according to the CBC.   The party is on track win three more.
The Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (NDP) led by Cam Broten has won 10 seats, a slight improvement after the party suffered major losses in the 2011 elections.
During the campaign, Mr Broten criticised Mr Wall's government for running a deficit.
Mr Wall campaigned on his record and promised bring more jobs to the province.
In a surprising upset, neighbouring province Alberta elected the left-leaning NDP last year, ousting the conservatives after years in power.
Failing oil prices and a strong US dollar have hurt the Canadian economy. Alberta - a hub of the Canadian oil industry - has been hard hit.
However, with strong agriculture and mining sectors, Saskatchewan weathered the downturn better than Alberta.
Mr Wall remains popular and the province's unemployment rate is low, compared to the rest of the country.
