Barn-to-homes row hits Brecon Beacons developers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anyone who wants to turn a barn into a home in the Brecon Beacons National Park could be hit with a five-figure bill.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The park authority is considering charging property developers 58% of the cost of a new affordable home.
The decision was voted through - by 10 votes to five.
But the Country and Landowners Association (CLA) and local councillors said the move would make many new developments "unviable".
They also accused officers of manipulating a report into the effect of the policy on the area.
Karen Anthony from the CLA, which represents local businesses and landowners in rural Wales, blasted the move.
She accused officers of "social engineering" and "manipulating an independent report", saying viability should be considered before setting a rate for affordable housing.
Mrs Anthony said Snowdonia National Park officials request a Â£30,000 sum which goes towards affordable housing in barn conversions, but they will negotiate on that figure.
Chief executive of the Brecon Beacons authority, John Cook said he was "saddened" by the suggestion there had been any dishonesty among officers.
He said he looked forward to responding to the accusations with "the facts".
There were calls at the meeting for external scrutiny on the issue and a proposal to delay adoption of the policy.
But members voted against delaying the motion by 10 votes to five.
