Taxi driver Marcin Klis, 42, and his wife Angelika, 39, from York, had been at the venue to collect their daughters from the Ariana Grande concert.
The couple were among 22 people who died when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device in the arena's foyer.
The funeral service was a private one at the request of the family.
