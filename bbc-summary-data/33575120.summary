[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The youth was one of two boys - one on foot and one on a bike - chased along Exeter Road, Feltham, by two special constables at 22:35 BST on Thursday.
A firearm, believed to be an air weapon, was found at the scene.
A 22-year-old officer sustained minor injuries which were not caused by the firearm.
Police are still trying to trace the second suspect, involved in what Acting Ch Insp Hannah Wheeler described as a "traumatic incident".
She said: "The bravery and courage shown by our specials last night was extraordinary."
She added that the police "will ensure they receive the recognition they deserve".
