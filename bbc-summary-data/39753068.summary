Second seed Ouseph, who won bronze last year, beat Germany's Fabian Roth, seeded eighth, to set up a tie with the host nation's Hans-Kristian Solberg Vittinghus, seeded fourth.
Scotland's Kirsty Gilmour is also guaranteed a medal after beating Line Kjaersfeldt to reach the women's singles semi-finals.
Gilmour's victory means the Scot will secure at least a bronze to add to the silver she won last year.
But England's Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge were knocked in the men's doubles quarter-finals by Mads Conrad-Petersen and Mads Pieler Kolding.
