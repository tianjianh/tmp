Pop star Adele has announced two dates at Wembley Stadium next summer to round off her multi-million pound world tour.

The singer announced the concerts in an Instagram video, where she sang football anthem Three Lions as well as the Match of the Day theme song.
Dubbed "The Finale", the performances will see her play to more than 150,000 fans on 29 June and 1 July 2017.
Tickets go on sale to members of her fan club on 30 November, followed by a general sale on 2 December.
Wembley Stadium has not announced any other events planned for that week, raising the prospect that Adele may add further concerts if demand is high enough.
Launching in Belfast on Leap Day, Adele's first world tour has incorporated 107 dates across Europe and North America, with more dates to come in Australia next year.
Alongside flawless renditions of hits like Hello, Skyfall and Someone Like You, the star's unfiltered, uncensored on-stage chatter has often made headlines.
In Belfast, she confessed to having "severe bowel movements" as opening night nerves kicked in. She announced her Glastonbury headline slot from the stage of London's O2, and allowed a couple in Toronto to get engaged during her show.
"You got a Tiffany ring! Nice work, nice work," she told the bride-to-be.
After Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced the end of their marriage in September, the star jokingly dedicated her show to them, calling it "the end of an era".
And just last week, she had an encounter with a bat during a show in Mexico.
"There's a bat there and it landed by your head!" she said, pointing at an audience member. "It landed right by your head! Welcome to Mexico! I'm happy to be here, but a bat? Jesus Christ!"
