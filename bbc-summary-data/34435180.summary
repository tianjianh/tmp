The out-of-court settlement has not been disclosed in detail, but brings to an end a legal battle that has raged since Williams' suicide last year.
A lawyer for Susan Williams said she would stay in the San Francisco home she had shared with the actor.
A lawyer for the three children said they were pleased that the legal battle had now been ended.
Susan Williams' lawyer, James Wagstaffe, told Associated Press news agency that she would stay in the home, be provided with living expenses and keep possession of various items.
"Susan gets to enforce Robin's wishes. She gets to stay in the house as Robin wanted, with the trust being created to pay the expenses," Mr Wagstaffe said.
The couple had been married for three years before the 63-year-old actor took his own life in August 2014.
Meredith Bushnell, lawyer for the adult children from previous marriages - Zachary, Zelda and Cody - said: "I think they're just very happy to have this behind them."
The legal battle had included items such as watches, memorabilia, clothing and photographs, and led to several court hearings.
The settlement requires judicial approval.
Williams was famous for such films as Good Morning Vietnam and Dead Poets Society and won an Oscar for his role in Good Will Hunting.
His publicist said he had been "battling severe depression".
Williams had talked, and even joked, about his struggles with alcohol and drugs.
