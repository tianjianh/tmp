Police were called on Tuesday to reports of a banging noise coming from the lorry, parked in Goldsmith Way, Hatfield, Hertfordshire.
All the occupants were checked by paramedics and found to be unharmed.
The Home Office said the baby was in the care of social services.
The remaining group of 19, which includes four families who are believed to be from Iraq, Iran and Palestine, have been handed to Immigration Enforcement for their cases to be investigated, said the Home Office.
