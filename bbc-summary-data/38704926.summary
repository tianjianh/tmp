Just five days after winning their third BBL Cup in a row, the Eagles were beaten 112-103 by the unfancied Wolves.
Newcastle were outscored 30-16 in the third quarter by a Worcester side beaten 81-73 at Bristol last weekend.
"The guys have been challenging each other all week in training." James told BBC Sport. "They have been beasted."
He added: "Our game plan was to stand up to Newcastle and to do to them what they usually do to others.
"None of our players was going to back down. Our efforts have been rewarded today - I'm super proud of the players."

While top scorer on the night was Newcastle's Rahmon Fletcher with 34 points, Worcester produced more of a team effort, spearheaded by Maurice Walker (23), Ashton Khan (22) and Danny Huffor (21).
"We had six players with double-figure points, not just one player out on his own," added James.
Worcester, who are up to seventh in the BBL, now face a trip to London Lions on Sunday before returning to the University of Worcester Arena next Friday (27 January) to host Surrey Scorchers.
