Scrolls bearing the name of each victim were presented to their families along with a medal to denote the city's "highest honour".
Dalglish's wife Marina was also honoured, as were the former Bishop of Liverpool, and Prof Phil Scraton.
Their medals were presented during a ceremony at St George's Hall.
In April, an inquest jury found the fans who died as a result of a crush at the 1989 FA Cup game in Sheffield were unlawfully killed.
Mr Dalglish, who was manager at the time of the tragedy, ensured the club was represented at the fans' funerals and, along with his wife, helped support the bereaved families.
He said: "We only did for the families what they did for us - support us."
Former bishop, the Rt Rev James Jones led the Hillsborough Independent Panel, which uncovered evidence in 2012 about the disaster.
Prof Scraton led the panel's research team and his book, Hillsborough: The Truth, first published in 1999, is widely accepted as the definitive account of the disaster.
The victims' families were awarded freedom of the city of Liverpool in 2009.
