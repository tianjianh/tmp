Edinburgh resident Paul Brett has won Trail Magazine's 2015 UK Mountain Photo of the Year.
After pausing to take the photograph, he rejoined a friend to finish an ascent of Britain's highest mountain.
On the way up he slipped and had to use his ice axe to arrest a potentially dangerous slide down the peak.
Mr Brett was among more than 500 people who entered the annual competition.
He told Trail: "It was a perfect spring day with no wind.
"After cresting the summit of Carn Dearg Meadhonach we were rewarded with this amazing view. My friend was already heading up Carn Mor Dearg, which really helped give an amazing sense of scale to the scene."
He added: "I had to use the pick of my ice axe to stop myself sliding down the mountain on the push to the summit of Ben Nevis, which was very scary at the time - but it was good to know I had the knowledge to do what was needed."
