The 25-year-old scored 21 goals in 34 league appearances last season, and is under contract at Lyon until 2019.
In a statement on Twitter, the French club said "Lacazette is irreplaceable and one of the main leaders" in coach Bruno Genesio's team.
Lyon denied a newspaper report saying they turned down an offer of 48m euros (£42.2m) from the Premier League side.
