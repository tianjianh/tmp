Guernsey retailer Alliance Group will create 30 jobs in Jersey and bring Tesco products to the island, says the managing director.

Andrew Bagot said he would be "very disappointed" if a Tesco-branded shop was not trading this year.
The first outlet will be an existing shop while a second would likely be a bigger new-build, said Mr Bagot.
Alliance Group began selling Tesco products in Guernsey this year.
Jersey is currently served by Waitrose and Co-op supermarkets.
"There is no doubt that there is always room for choice and always room for competition," he said.
"I'd be disappointed if we weren't up and running in six months."
Mr Bagot said some products would be sold more cheaply in Jersey than in Tesco stores in the UK because of lower tax rates.
But Julia Quennault, who co-owns the Classic Farm Shop in St Peter, is disappointed at the news.
She said: "It's not that it's Tesco per se, it's that there's only so much consumer demand. You can only cut the cake so thin."
