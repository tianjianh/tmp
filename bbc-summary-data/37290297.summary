Widnes Vikings centre Stefan Marsh will miss the rest of the season due to a knee injury picked up in last week's victory over Wigan Warriors.

The 26-year-old, who joined Widnes from Wigan in 2012, will await a decision on whether he now requires an operation.
Marsh signed a new two-year-deal in April to remain at the club until 2018.
Head coach Denis Betts told the club website: "We're assessing him this week but the early signs mean he will definitely miss the rest of this year."
