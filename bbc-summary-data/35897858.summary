The 34-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday after the bank noticed multiple suspect transactions and contacted the police.
The bank has not been named.
Police uncovered 80 transactions totalling $492,000 ($376,000; Â£266,000) being paid into two separate accounts.
Det Supt Arthur Katsogiannis, commander of the Fraud and Cybercrime Squad, said arrest was part of a broader crackdown on financial wrongdoing.
"The good work of these investigators should reassure businesses in New South Wales that police are doing all they can to ensure they can operate in a corruption-free environment," he said.
The bank employee has been granted bail and is due to appear in court in May.
