[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A founder of a group improving race relations with police was Tasered in the face by officers who mistook him for a wanted man for the second time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Footage filmed by a neighbour shows Judah Adunbi, 63, outside his Bristol home when he is stopped by police.
Mr Adunbi refused to give his name and after a dispute was Tasered in the face by officers who tried to arrest him.
The incident, which Mr Adunbi said left him "scared for his life", has been referred to the police watchdog.
Mr Adunbi, the founding member of an independent group between the police and prominent members of the Afro-Caribbean community, said he was "terrified" by what happened.
"When the Taser hit me I thought it had killed me," he said.
"I thought I was dying and I was thinking 'my children and my grandchildren need me'."
It is the second time Mr Adunbi has been mistaken for the same man.
In 2009 he won a wrongful arrest case against Avon and Somerset Police and was awarded compensation.
He said: "[The police] claim they are looking for an individual...they know who the individual is so why go as far as accuse any black man in the street with dreadlocks."
Police confirmed that a Taser was not used in that incident.
A neighbour of Mr Adunbi filmed the second incident, which took place outside his home in the Easton area of Bristol on 14 January.
The video shows the two officers approaching Mr Adunbi while returning from a walk with his dog. They give the name of the wanted man and ask if that is him.
When he says he is not that man, they ask for his name, which he declines to give.
Mr Adunbi says he refused because he is "not a criminal" and was "just going about my business".
Officers tried to arrest him as he walked into his back garden and then Tasered him.
"I collapsed... I was paralysed and she [the police officer] had the audacity to tell me to get up," he said.
Mr Adunbi was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary and then to Patchway police station, where he was interviewed and charged with a public order offence and assaulting a police officer.
Those charges have since been dropped.
According to Avon and Somerset Police guidelines "you do not have to give your name, address or date of birth to the police if you're stopped and searched unless you are being reported for an offence.'
The National Police Chiefs' Council - which represents senior police - say that "officers who are trained and equipped with Taser must decide on the most reasonable and necessary use of force in the circumstances."
Mr Adunbi, who was the former chairman of the race relations group, said what happened to him was "disgraceful".
He added race relations in the city were "getting worse" and called for the police and community groups to "sit down around the table and sort this out".
Ch Supt Jon Reilly said: "After reviewing what happened, we voluntarily referred a complaint about this incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
He added he had met Mr Adunbi and had a "constructive conversation".
He said: "We're aware of concerns within the local community and we take these concerns very seriously."
An IPCC spokesperson said: "We are independently investigating a complaint about an incident in Easton on 14 January where a man was Tasered.
"The IPCC investigation follows a referral from Avon and Somerset Police and is in its early stages."
It said it was going to review the "body worn video of the officers involved, checking for any CCTV evidence and conducting house to house enquiries as part of the investigation".
An appeal has also been made for any footage filmed by members of the public.
