[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Butterworth, from Countesthorpe, was found guilty of 10 counts of indecent assault against two boys after a trial at Leicester Crown Court.
The boys were aged between 14 and 15 when the assaults took place, Leicestershire Police said.
Officers believe there may be more victims of the 70-year-old.
Investigatory support officer, Grace Clay, said Butterworth "befriended" the boys in the community before abusing them.
"I believe there could be more victims of Butterworth, and I would urge anyone who thinks they may have been abused by him to come forward," she said.
