At 18:45 on Saturday about 10 or 15 supporters boarded the Inverness to Edinburgh Waverley service.
The incident is believed to have involved Heart of Midlothian Football Club supporters.
Throughout the journey they sang songs of a Sectarian nature.
They also continued singing after getting off the train at Haymarket Station.
PC Chris Sutherland, of the British Transport Police, said: "This behaviour was by a small pocket of supporters on a busy train, packed with other fans and young families.
"We have a no tolerance attitude towards such behaviour, which has no place whatsoever in the game.
"I am appealing for anyone who saw this taking place to come forward and let us know so we can stop this behaviour from happening again."
