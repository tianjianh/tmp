Hansen, 46, who initially retired from the European Tour at this event last year, is on course for his first Tour win since the Joburg Open in 2009.
Ireland's Padraig Harrington (67) is a shot back on 17-under.
Defending champion Andy Sullivan (69) of England had six birdies and four bogies to be in a tie for fourth.
Sullivan is on 16-under alongside compatriot Chris Paisley and Scotland's Paul Lawrie, who both shot 65.
The forecast for overnight storms had resulted in a delayed two-tee start but the weather stayed fine and Hansen prospered.
Hansen had announced his retirement at the Victoria Clube de Golfe in 2015, but will be glad he chose to use his exemption to play five events in 2016, including here.
There were birdies on the first, second, fifth, 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th, 17th and 18th to give him only his second 62 in 1,499 European Tour rounds.
He said: "I didn't really have a strategy. Just go out and play and just try to enjoy it and hit good shots and it turned out all right."
On his semi-retirement from the European Tour, he added: "It probably helps a little bit because it doesn't really matter to me either way - it is what it is.
"I'm not going to come back and play full-time; that decision has been made so I'm just enjoying playing being here."
