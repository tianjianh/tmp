Wales' Moore and England's McNeill only began competing together this winter but have already won four medals, including two silvers and a bronze on the North American Cup circuit.
The British duo won in Winterberg in a time of one minute 53.96 seconds.
Germany's Anna Koehler and Franziska Fritz were second, with compatriots Kim Kalicki and Lisa-Sophie Gericke third.

Prior to taking up bobsleigh, Moore competed for Wales as a sprinter at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and had a 100m personal best of 11.65 seconds.
Victory was Great Britain's first world junior win since Paula Walker and Rebeka Wilson triumphed in February 2011.
"It's a massive result for Great Britain Bobsleigh and the women's programme and it's one that these athletes should be very proud of," said Lee Johnston, lead coach for GB Bobsleigh.
"Both Micas performed when it really mattered and to beat the Germans in their own backyard is a real boost."
