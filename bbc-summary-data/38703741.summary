American Dustin Johnson is a shot behind after carding an impressive eight-under-par round of 64.

Kaymer was the overnight leader but the German hit three bogeys to card a level-par 72 on Saturday.
In a closely grouped field, English pair Ross Fisher and Lee Westwood are three shots off the lead, along with Henrik Stenson of Sweden.
"I'm very happy with that," said world number 23 Hatton, who has one European Tour title to his name - the 2016 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.
"I got off to a bit of a slow start but holed a couple of putts on the back nine."
Johnson equalled the lowest score of the week with his third round, which included an eagle and six birdies.
"The biggest difference was I drove it better," he said.
"I'm still yet to birdie a par five, but I did make an eagle on eight, chipped one in. It was a really solid round."
