Two men who attempted to abduct a serviceman near an RAF base were likely to have been "part of a larger team", police have said.

The serviceman was threatened with a knife near RAF Marham on Wednesday afternoon and attempts were made to grab him.
Det Supt Paul Durham said the victim "only witnessed two attackers" but there could have been more.
Police are also appealing for dash-cam footage from people in the area.
Drivers in the Marham and King's Lynn areas are being urged to come forward with video as it may hold vital clues.
"Many people now use these devices and they may contain something that the driver or rider isn't aware of," Det Supt Durham said.
The serviceman was able to hold off the attackers and return to the base.
Initial inquiries have revealed there were a number of people walking on Squires Hill, near Costcutters, around the times of the incident.
It is hoped CCTV could be used to help trace a dark people carrier that is thought to have been used by the suspects, who are yet to be found.
"While the victim only witnessed two attackers, there may have been more than two people in the vehicle and given the nature of the attack, it is likely they were part of a larger team," Det Supt Durham said.
"So I would urge people to review their footage from the week leading up to the incident and contact us if they feel it could assist the inquiry."
Police have now lifted the cordon at the attempted abduction scene.
