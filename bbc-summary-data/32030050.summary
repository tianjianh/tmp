[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke is considering asking Liverpool's Steven Gerrard to address his Europe side when they play the United States in 2016.

Europe will face the US at Hazeltine in Minnesota when Gerrard is set to be playing in the US with LA Galaxy.
Clarke's predecessor Paul McGinley asked ex-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to speak to his players during their 2014 success.
"If I did something like that, he'd be someone I'd consider," said Clarke.
The 46-year-old Clarke is a Liverpool fan and called Gerrard, 34, who was sent off in a defeat by Manchester United on Sunday, a "real legend".
"LA is not that close to Minnesota so we will see," joked Clarke.
But he added: "Paul [McGinley] obviously got a lot of help and advice from a lot of different people who have been in that position of managing people and looking after people and I will be the same."
