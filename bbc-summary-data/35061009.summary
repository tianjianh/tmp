The west coast's Caledonian Sleeper will travel between London and Oban, instead of Fort William, in February due to planned engineering works.

Serco, which operates the service, said it would use the disruption caused by Network Rail work to trial Oban as a potential new destination.
Fort William is the last stop for the train on the West Highland Line.
Passengers will be bussed there from Oban on the weekends of 12-14, 19-21 and 26-28 February.
Peter Strachan, managing director of the Caledonian Sleeper, said: "We have chosen to stop at Oban rather than provide bus travel from Tulloch because we would like to receive feedback on this route from guests and local businesses to inform our long-term planning.
"Oban is a popular destination for tourists as well as being known as the gateway to the isles, with a ferry service to many islands, including  Mull, Lismore and Kerrera.
"As we continue to progress our plans for the Caledonian Sleeper service over the next 15 years we are keen to explore the possibility of extending our route."
