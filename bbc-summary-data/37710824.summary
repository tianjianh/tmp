Yemen conflict: UN-brokered three-day ceasefire begins

A three-day ceasefire brokered by the UN has officially begun in war-ravaged Yemen.

The truce went into effect a minute before midnight local time, just hours after clashes were reported.
Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's forces - supported by a Saudi-led coalition - have been fighting Houthi rebels, who control Sanaa.
The UN hopes the break in fighting might lead to a resumption of peace talks between the two sides.
The coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, said in a statement it would respect the three-day truce provided its foes in Yemen's Iran-allied Houthi movement also complied.
The parliament in Sanaa, in which pro-Houthi MPs hold a majority, called on Wednesday for a "full commitment" to the truce.
But there is some scepticism about whether or not the ceasefire will hold and pave a way to end the 19-month civil war, which has left thousands dead.
It is the sixth one attempted.
President Mansour Hadi, who is in exile, told state news agency Saba on Wednesday that he expected his foes would violate the truce.
"We don't expect from them today anything more than prevarication and procrastination," Hadi was quoted as saying after meeting the American and British ambassadors.
The announcement of the ceasefire follows international alarm over the deaths of 140 people in a Saudi airstrike which hit a funeral gathering in Sanaa.
Saudi officials say the air strike in the capital earlier this month should have hit Houthi rebel leaders, but erroneous intelligence meant that the wrong site was targeted.
The UN special envoy to Yemen Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed said he hoped the ceasefire "will spare the Yemeni people further bloodshed and will allow for the expanded delivery of humanitarian assistance".
The conflict in Yemen pits forces loyal to the internationally recognised government of President Hadi against the rebels. The coalition led by Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of backing the rebels and supports the president.
The war has killed nearly 7,000 people in addition to wounding more than 35,000 and displacing at least three million since March last year, according to the UN.
