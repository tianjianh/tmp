The Derry triathlete was 32nd following the swim and had drifted out to 36th at the end of the bike stage.
However, Reid moved through the field in the 10k run as she gained 15 places to finish just under five minutes behind winner Gwen Jorgensen.
Illness curtailed Reid's training for the Games and she said there was "no pressure" on her ahead of the event.
Four years ago, her Olympic dream turned into a nightmare as she crashed in the cycling section of the event and finished in 43rd place.
American Jorgensen won the race in 1:56.16 and 40 seconds ahead of defending champion Nicola Sprig of Switzerland.
Vicky Holland outsprinted fellow Briton Non Stanford in a thrilling finish to clinch the bronze medal.
