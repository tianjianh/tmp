Paul Tisdale: Exeter City boss relishing Devon derby contest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale admits Saturday's Devon derby against Plymouth Argyle is "not just another game".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grecians, who will have forward Alex Nicholls back in the squad, are five points outside the League Two play-offs after a six-match unbeaten run in March.
Meanwhile, Argyle are third after back-to-back wins over York and Morecambe.
"There's an element of anxiety and excitement about it," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon.
"I have been involved in probably a dozen Devon derbies. It's a different type of game and it has a life of its own at times.
"We are looking forward to it, we are highly prepared for it."
Tisdale awaits fitness reports on Jordan Moore-Taylor and Matt Oakley before finalising his team.
