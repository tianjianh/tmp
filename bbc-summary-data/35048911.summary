Former singing teacher Ali Cameron Daw aims to show people how to hold a note and to enrol them in a backing group for The Rooterz.
She said: "I know people believe they can't sing, and my mission really is to prove them wrong and get them to come along."
The group will be performing live on stage in January at a weekend music festival in Bradford on Avon, in Wiltshire.
BBC Points West's Ali Vowles reports.
