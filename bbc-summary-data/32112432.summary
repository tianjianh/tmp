[SN]TITLE[SN]
Israel ex-PM Olmert found guilty in corruption retrial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been found guilty of fraud and breach of trust after a retrial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He had been acquitted in 2012 of taking envelopes stuffed with money from a US-based supporter.
However, a retrial was ordered after the emergence of recordings in which he referred to receiving the money.
Olmert, who served as Israeli PM from 2006 to 2009, is currently appealing a conviction for bribery in 2014 for which he was sentenced to six years.
His lawyers say they are considering appealing the latest conviction.
