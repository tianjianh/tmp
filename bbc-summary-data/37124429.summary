Mountain rescue teams across Wales have seen a 28% increase in the number of calls over the past 12 months.

Six teams had a total rise from 459 calls between August 2014-2015, to 585 in the 12 months to August this year.
North East Wales Search and Rescue Team (NEWSAR) saw the biggest jump, but Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team, which covers Snowdonia, received the most calls.
Becky Vaughan, of NEWSAR, said it put a "huge strain" on the team.
North East Wales, Aberglaslyn, Llanberis, Central Beacon, Brecon and Aberdovey search and rescue teams all reported a year-on-year increase to Welsh language news programme Newyddion 9.
Aberdovey 32 to 35
Aberglaslyn 50 to 55
Brecon 96 to 111
Central Beacon 87 to 118
Llanberis 157 to 203
North East Wales 37 to 63
Brecon Mountain Rescue Team recorded its busiest month on record in July, with 23 call-outs for incidents including missing people, injured mountain bikers and unconscious walkers.
The team's deputy leader, Mark Jones, said he believed the spike was linked to more people taking part in outdoor activities.
He said the team, staffed by volunteers, costs Â£40,000 a year to run based on about 100 calls, so an increase in calls would impact on medical equipment and rescue material supplies.
Ms Vaughan said the rise in call-outs put pressure on teams and the need to raise money to continue their work.
"The increase in calls has also put a strain on us. We don't get paid so we have to go out to work. Many of us work full-time," she said.
"We have families and we have to leave the family to help people. Also, if the number of calls increases, we have to raise more money to help other people.
"So we have to go out on Sunday to raise money in a fair at St Asaph so that we can continue."
