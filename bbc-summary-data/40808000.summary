[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wanted man, 70, arrested in Malta over sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man wanted by police over a string of alleged sexual offences against children in Welsh orphanages has been arrested in Malta.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bryan Davies, 70, is accused of 38 sexual offences, which are said to have occurred between 1975 and 1978 and from 2007 to 2013, police said.
He was arrested on the Maltese island of Gozo, where he had retired and had been living in the village of Munxar.
A Maltese court ruled he would be extradited to the UK to face charges.
Mr Davies agreed to the extradition, which should happen within 10 days.
He waived his right to appeal but his defence lawyer said that was not an admission of guilt.
Mr Davies is to face charges of indecent assault, taking indecent photos of children and inciting children to take part in sexual activities.
