Thanet council 'forced into a corner' over cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Kent council claims it is being "forced into a corner" as proposed cuts to government grants could leave a shortfall of more than £500,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thanet District Council said it was considering a 2% rise in the authority's part of the council tax.
Councillor Rick Everitt, cabinet member for finance, said the council had seen a 28% reduction in government funding over the past two years.
"Further cuts to the council purse are really unwelcome," he said.
The council said figures from the Department of Communities and Local Government showed the council was likely to be left short of £580,000 for the next financial year.
Mr Everitt said: "Having already suffered a reduction of 28% in government funding over the past two years, resources are stretched to the absolute limit.
"This additional reduction of over half a million pounds has forced us into a corner."
From Monday, the council will be asking for residents' views on which services should be a priority.
The council said final figures were expected in December and would be debated at a meeting in January.
