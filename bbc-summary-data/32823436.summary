Conal McFeely, the development executive of Rathmore business park, said he was threatened by up to 30 youths carrying iron bars.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the gang damaged gates, left graffiti on walls and stole wooden pallets for a bonfire.
Mr McFeely said local residents in Creggan are being intimidated.
"Over the last two nights the community at the Rathmore centre has been suffering a series of anti-social attacks by a group of youths, aged from 10 to 17 years old, " he said.
"The neighbours are actually quite frightened when they see up to 30 young people gathering, some with masks, some with iron bars.
"They entered the Rathmore centre, bust open gates, pulled down fences, pulled down gates and took away the pallets for a bonfire, even though it's a month early."
Police have confirmed they received reports of wooden pallets being stolen from the area.
Mr McFeely said he was threatened by the gang when he tried to intervene.
"One of the tenants went down to collect pallets in his company van and they threatened him, threatened to burn the van and told him they would be back that night to get the pallets.
"I confronted them and they surrounded me, threatened me, called me all sorts of things. But I wouldn't let them out with the pallets.
"What are the parents of these young people doing,? They must know what they're at.
"It's a big expensive clean-up that could cost us several thousands of pounds."
Mr McFeely said security at the centre has been increased.
BricKKiln waste management company is one of those based at the Rathmore centre.
Thomas McGlinchey from the company said they have built a 20ft wall at the rear of their premises to tackle theft.
"These 'collections' are now starting three months before the bonfire. We also have built 20ft walls at the rear of the premises to keep them out.
"They now bring ladders to scale them.  All the companies out here are under constant threat of the damage.
"The parents must know that their kids are out collecting this material and should be made responsible for their damages."
