[SN]TITLE[SN]
David Black murder: Damien McLaughlin to stand trial in connection with killing of prison officer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The only man currently charged in connection with the murder of prison officer David Black is to stand trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Damien McLaughlin, of Kilmascally Road, Dungannon, County Tyrone is accused of providing the Toyota car used by Mr Black's killers.
A judge told a preliminary inquiry at Craigavon that he was satisfied there was a case to answer.
Mr Black was shot as he was driving to work in Maghaberry Prison in November 2012.
Mr McLaughlin will now stand trial for aiding and abetting that murder as well as possessing items to be used in terrorism, preparing terrorist acts and belonging to an illegal organisation.
After judge gave his ruling, the accused's solicitor asked to address the court.
He said he was withdrawing as the solicitor in the case as part of the law firm's ongoing protest against new legal aid rules and reduced fees introduced last month.
