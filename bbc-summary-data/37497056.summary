Nottingham Forest look weary and need the international break to regain their freshness, according to head coach Philippe Montanier.

Forest ended a run of three losses with a 1-1 home draw with Fulham on Tuesday.
But they are still winless in five Championship games, six if the EFL Cup defeat to Arsenal is included.
"We need a break. We saw a game with a not very high tempo because I think the two teams were a little tired," Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham.
Forest have played six matches in 17 days but, because of the internationals, they have 12 days without a fixture following the trip to face Bristol City on Saturday, 1 October.
Montanier added: "The attitude of the team has been very good; we are not in a good moment but it was important to end this bad period after three defeats.
"I wait for the international break to get good fitness for all the squad."
