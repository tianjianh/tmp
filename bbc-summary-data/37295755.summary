[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Pembrokeshire's first dedicated Welsh school is opening on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ysgol Hafan Y Mor has been built in Tenby in response to the growing demand for Welsh-medium education in the area.
It opens along with the English-medium Tenby Church in Wales VC primary school, and together they cater for children aged three to 11 years.
The two new schools represent an Â£8.37m investment in education in the town from Pembrokeshire council and the Welsh Government.
They replace Tenby infants and junior schools.
The Tenby Church in Wales school is a new build, while Ysgol Hafan Y Mor is located in the renovated former junior school.
Pembrokeshire council's cabinet member for the Welsh language, Huw George said: "This is an historic time for primary education in Tenby and particularly for the Welsh language in Pembrokeshire.
"Both ventures have our best wishes for the future."
