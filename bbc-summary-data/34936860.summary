[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nutmeg grater exhibition opens in Bristol

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 nutmeg graters - billed as "the biggest ever collection" of the ornate implements gathered in a single place - have gone on display.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The unusual items, which have been loaned to a Bristol gallery by private collectors, date from the 1690s.
An urn-shaped grinder, a memorial grater adorned with a photo of a dead child, and one built into a walking stick are among the exhibits.
Curator Stephen Grey-Harris said the majority had never been seen in public.
