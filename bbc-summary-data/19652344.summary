Team captains Steven Gerrard and Nemanja Vidic will release 96 red balloons as a tribute to the victims.
Crowd mosaics will also be displayed on three sides of the ground, reading The Truth, Justice and 96.
It will be the first home game for Liverpool since the Hillsborough Independent Panel report was published.
The report cleared fans of any wrongdoing and found police tried to blame fans for the disaster, on 15 April 1989.
Mosaic creator Andy Knott said The Truth would be shown on the Kop, Justice on the Lower Centenary Stand and 96 on the Anfield Road end.
"Whenever it [creating the mosaics] is to do with Hillsborough it is always special, even more so now that the truth is out and the families can get on and realise that they were right for 20 odd years.
"They can get on and try and find the justice that the victims deserve."
He said the mosaics - which are created by fans in the stands holding up coloured cards - can take up to five hours to prepare.
He said: "You get a sense of pride, especially when you see the pictures after and anybody who helps just feels proud.
"It just makes everybody know that we are supporting the families and the survivors."
Both clubs have stressed the importance of all players respecting the occasion.
