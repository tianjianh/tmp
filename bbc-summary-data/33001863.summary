The minibus ended up on its roof following the accident on the A74(M) motorway four miles north of Moffat at 17:25 on Wednesday.
The baby was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.
She was kept in overnight after suffering suspected head injuries.
The 33-year-old male driver, a 37-year-old male passenger, two girls aged 16 and 13 and three boys aged 12, 10 and eight were all taken to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary where they remained overnight with a variety of minor injuries.
All eight of the injured people were from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire.
The Scottish Ambulance Service sent four ambulances and a special operations rescue team to the scene and firefighters used cutting equipment to free some of the passengers.
HGV drivers and passing motorists managed to halt the traffic and comfort the injured until the emergency services arrived.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said the seven people in the Dumfries hospital are expected to be discharged on Thursday.
The baby is expected to discharged on Friday.
One motorist said: "The unsung heroes were the HGV drivers who were diverting the traffic away from the accident.
"They were risking their own lives because the road was very busy with lorries and cars."
The road was closed in both directions for about 90 minutes and a further 30 minutes on the southbound carriageway as work went on to free the injured and investigate the cause of the accident.
Police have appealed for any witnesses to contact them. The vehicle involved was a white LDV minibus.
