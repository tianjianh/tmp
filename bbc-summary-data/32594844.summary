William McGreevy jailed over east Belfast robbery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An east Belfast man who robbed an off-licence at knifepoint while he had a branch sticking out of his mouth, has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William McGreevy, 39, from Strandburn Park, faced four charges dating back to 14 June last year.
The incidents included the robbery of the off-licence on the Belmont Road and threatening a delivery driver with a bottle of Buckfast.
McGreevy will serve two years in custody and two on supervised licence.
Belfast Crown Court was told that McGreevy was intoxicated and under the influence of prescription drugs at the time of the offences.
A prosecutor said on the evening of 14 June, the defendant was walking along the Belmont Road, drunk, with a branch in his mouth.
McGreevy entered a Tesco store, and as he was standing in the queue brought a knife out of his pocket, then replaced it and repeated this action around six times.
The prosecutor told the court the member of staff working the till was "large", and that it was the Crown's case that despite the presence of the knife, McGreevy "wasn't going to take his chance" and left the store.
As McGreevy was walking along the Belmont Road, he stopped a man he vaguely knew who was a delivery driver for a Chinese restaurant and asked for lift, but was told by the delivery man that he was busy.
McGreevy then walked into an off-licence 100 yards from the Tesco store. Still with the branch in his mouth, the defendant then brought out the large black-handled knife and pointed it at a female member of staff.
After threatening the employee, the defendant went behind the counter and demanded money, before ransacking the display counter.
He then issued more threats to the employee and a male colleague, warning them he would stab them if they did not open the safe.
The male worker took McGreevy into the back of the shop to show him the safe and explained they could not open it.
He left the off licence with around Â£260 in cash and Â£818 worth of cigarettes and alcohol in plastic bags.
The prosecutor said that following the robbery, McGreevy again approached the delivery man, and got into the passenger seat of his car.
He was told to get out by the driver, who was then threatened by McGreevy who was brandished a half bottle of Buckfast.
When McGreevy threatened to hit the driver, he "realised it was not a joke" and feeling under intimidation, he drove McGreevy a short distance home.
Officers viewed the CCTV footage from Tesco and McGreevy was recognised and arrested.
During interview, he said he had been drinking on the afternoon of June 14, consuming around 10 pints.
He said that he could not remember being in Tesco or the off-licence.
He pleaded guilty to four charges - two counts of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place, robbery and hijacking.
A defence barrister said her client had a long issue with alcohol, especially during times of stress, which had brought him before the court in the past.
