Tom Pattison, from Beccles, was killed during a race at Blaxhall in Suffolk. He leaves a wife and daughter.
Woodbridge & District Motor Cycle Club, which organised the meeting, called it a "tragedy".
Ray Jakeman posted on Mr Pattison's Facebook page to say: "Such a loss to his family and close friends, ride the clouds mate x".
Josh Andrews posted to say: "Used to love the days of lining up on the start line with you buddy with our mums worrying... me asking for advice on how to get quicker and all you would say is 'ride flat out'... going to miss you."
The event was the penultimate round of the Eastern Centre Championship and it was the Woodbridge club's final meeting of the year at the circuit.
The rider was pronounced dead at the scene.
Suffolk Police said there were no suspicious circumstances, although they were appealing for witnesses.
Mr Pattison became a father after he married in June last year.
Woodbridge DMCC said he was not a member of the club, but had been a regular competitor at Blaxhall.
Lyn Berwick, club secretary, said the motocross community was "shell shocked".
She said: "It's the first death of a rider in the 20 years that I've been involved at the track.
"It is a tragedy and my heart goes out to the family, some of whom were there."
Trevor Andrew, chairman of Woodbridge DMCC, said: "We do strive to provide riders with a safe environment in a sport which has inherent dangers.
"We will want to look into the matter ourselves and our national governing body, the Auto Cycle Union, will want to investigate further."
