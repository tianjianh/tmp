Williams suffered a foot injury during the 2015 World Cup defeat by Australia.
Scarlets backs coach Stephen Jones says it "would be awesome" if Williams returns in the Pro12 at Connacht on 30 January.
"But we're governed by the medical staff especially since it's an old injury," said Jones.
"He's got to be managed properly but that would be fantastic."
Wales are scheduled to name their Six Nations squad on Tuesday, 19 January and are likely to assess Williams' fitness before the announcement.
Former Wales fly-half Jones is yet to work with Williams as a coach despite having played alongside him.
"I'll be looking forward to getting him back on the paddock. His skills-set we know but [there's] his leadership skills as well," said Jones.
Scarlets remain top of the Pro12 and host third-placed Connacht on Sunday, 10 January, before visiting the Irish province later in the month.
Jones has been frustrated by injuries on his return to the region as a coach, with Liam and Scott Williams being joined in the treatment room by a host of others, particularly in the back row where open-sides John Barclay and James Davies are missing.
"It would be wonderful to get some guys back from injuries, but it's credit to the whole group how they've conducted themselves this year with a lot of youngsters having valuable game-time which puts us in a stronger position for next year- it's exciting," said the former Wasps player and assistant coach.
Wales international wing Harry Robinson is being assessed for a hamstring injury suffered in Llanelli's win over Cardiff at Premiership level.
Meanwhile, Scarlets still hope Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny will join them.
Halfpenny could remain at Toulon while Wasps and former team Cardiff Blues also keen to sign him.
