Post has been suspended in part of West Bromwich for more than two weeks due to fears about a "roaming" dog.

Royal Mail has sent a letter to residents in Cardigan Close saying they made the decision because of health and safety concerns.
Householders are having to collect their post from a sorting office two miles away in Lyng Lane.
The dog's owner, who lives in the street, said she had not been contacted by Royal Mail.
"I just found out no-one has been receiving their letters because of my dog," Ilona Welch said.
She said she understood the concerns but insisted the four-year-old animal was "harmless".
"She's just grabbing post off him from the inside of the door," she said.
The letter sent to residents on 6 September said the "exceptional step" had been taken due to an "unacceptable level of risk".
Sandwell Council said a dog warden had visited the owner of the dog who had agreed to keep it muzzled and on a lead.
In a statement, Royal Mail said: "We apologise to residents at Cardigan Close for the continued suspension of their mail deliveries.
"We are liaising with local police and dog warden to ensure deliveries can be reinstated as soon as possible, however the safety of our delivery staff is paramount."
