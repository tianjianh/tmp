Hairy high heels called 'grossest shoes of all time'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
These hairy high heels have been called "creepy" and "the grossest shoes of all time" by some fashion websites.

The light pink spiky stilettos are covered in real human hair, have a four inch heel and a pointy toe.
The award winning artist, Zhu Tian, who created them, hasn't said exactly which part of the body the black strands came from.
But just keep imagining it's head hair and think of someone nice, clean and good-looking.
However, you won't be dancing in these shoes (made from someone nice, clean and good-looking).
They weren't invented for this year's Christmas party, they're part of an exhibition in London.
The artist wanted to play with the "fetishist sexualisation of high heels", she said.
"I was invited to create a work using a pair of Dior's stilettos."
Even though the designer's stamp was on the project and it was commissioned by ELLE China, the shoes failed to impress some of the fash pack world.
"The stuff of nightmares" said one website, "creepy" and "the grossest shoes of all time." were some of the other comments.
Tian, who won the Broomhill National Sculpture Prize this year said: "I was trying to question and play with the fetishist sexualisation of high heels in contemporary consumerist culture."
She compares today's high heel shoes to foot binding feet in China in ancient times.
The artist said: "Women who had small highly twisted feet were considered sexy but nowadays people would find the same thing vile.
"High heels have been proven to be harmful to a women's body. So we will look back in 100 years in the same way we now think of foot binding?"
So who cares what the fash pack have said on their websites, the shoes weren't intended for them to wear at a 'launch' or a 'red carpet event'.
But still, as fetishes go there is bound to be someone out there who would like to sniff these flesh coloured hairy stilettos.
Zhu Tian's work will feature in the Young Gods 2015 Exhibition in London between 8 January - 6 February 2015. She is also featured in The Catlin Guide 2015 of New Artists.
