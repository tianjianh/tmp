Scarlets' home advantage will play a key role in Saturday's European Champions Cup opener against Sale, according to head coach Wayne Pivac.

Scarlets recovered from a 13-point deficit to beat Newport Gwent Dragons in the Pro12 on Saturday in what Pivac described as a "lucky win".
Scarlets and Sale each lie seventh in their domestic competitions.
"We've probably got the best draw in the group having a home game first up and that's pretty important," he said.
Reigning champions Saracens are at 2013, 2014 and 2015 title holders Toulon in Pool 3's opening encounter earlier in the day.
Scarlets wing Steff Evans scored a memorable opener in the Welsh derby, but his side trailed 20-14 at the break.
"We put ourselves under a lot of pressure in that first half in particular," said New Zealander Pivac.
"I think we started, really, really well, got the quick try and that's what we're after.
"We started to be put under pressure and make mistakes and they took their opportunities and scored some good tries.

"Certainly we had a bit of a chat at half time and refocused the boys and I thought they were a lot better in the second half.
"We talked about not under-estimating the Dragons because they've got a lot of talented young players and we knew they'd come here and it's a derby and they'd throw everything at it.
"In the end we were probably lucky to get away with a win."
Pivac says his side must learn "not to get ahead of ourselves".
He added: "We've had three wins in a row, but against sides that haven't been performing that well so we've just got to be realistic as to where we're at at this stage of the season and keep building."
