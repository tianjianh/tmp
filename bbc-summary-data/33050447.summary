Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane has ordered an investigation into the TV broadcast of a Jennifer Lopez concert.

The singer's performance at the Mawazine festival in Rabat on 29 May was aired on the 2M public TV network.
Mr Benkirane said the airing was "serious delinquency", adding it contained "disgraceful scenes".
He added the "sexually suggestive" broadcast was in violation of the country's audiovisual law.
Last week, Morocco's minister of communication was criticised for allowing the gig to air on public TV, leading to calls for him to resign.
Local media also criticised Lopez for her "suggestive poses" and for being "scantily" dressed.
Writing to the president of Morocco's High Authority of Audiovisual Communication, Mr Benkirane demanded the authority "take legal measures against those responsible".
He said the channel had broadcast scenes "with sexual overtones and which were indecent and provocative to the religious and moral values of Moroccan society".
He said those responsible for the channel and its output "failed to intervene and stop the broadcast of the disgraceful scenes" as the concert was broadcast with a time delay.
Lopez has performed in Morocco before with no trouble, however it is the first time one of her concerts has been broadcast on television.
According to TMZ an educational group is also suing the singer over the performance, claiming she "disturbed public order and tarnished women's honour and respect".
In the event Lopez and her promoter are prosecuted, the sentence could be up to two years in prison.
