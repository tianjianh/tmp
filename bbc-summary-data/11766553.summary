[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wrexham's Crusaders' winding up order dismissed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A winding-up petition against rugby league club Crusaders has been dismissed at London's High Court, after the club went into administration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case was adjourned a week ago amid confusion over whether the Wrexham-based club had paid its tax debts.
That hearing was told the debts which led to the petition order had since been paid.
The club went into administration on 12 November, claiming inherited debt had "made the business untenable".
Registrar Jaques was told by Cathryn Addy, counsel for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs that the club went into administration under a court order.
The registrar formally dismissed the winding up petition, with costs to be paid as part of the administration.
Joint administrators Peter O'Hara and Simon Weir were appointed to handle the club's affairs last week.
Mr O'Hara said: "We are currently pursuing a number of options and are talking to interested parties and the RFL [Rugby Football League] in the hope that a solution can be found to the club's current difficulties which would enable it to go forward and maintain rugby league in Wales."
