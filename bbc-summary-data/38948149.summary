Reid won her sixth Ladies European Tour title after the pair were tied on 16 under after 72 holes.
Reid and Gal made pars on their first three attempts at the 18th, but Reid finally broke the deadlock when she parred after Gal had bogeyed.
Reid had earlier missed two putts for victory on the final green.
The 29-year-old went into the final round at the 13th Beach Golf Links in Barwon Heads with a two-shot lead, but dropped three shots in the first three roles.
Reid played herself back into contention on the back nine with three birdies to card a one-under 72.
She told Golf Victoria's website: "I was getting frustrated, Sandra is a fantastic player, to win in a play-off is very special and I am just happy to get the win.
"The atmosphere all week has been very special."
