[SN]TITLE[SN]
Declan Wade and Paula Gillespie admit drugs charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple have appeared before Londonderry Magistrates' Court charged with possessing ecstasy with intent to supply and other drugs offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Declan Wade, from High Park in the city, and his partner Paula Marie Gillespie, from St Cecelia's Walk, Derry, were given suspended sentences.
The drugs were found during a search of Gillespie's home on 24 May last year.
The judge said the couple intended to supply the drugs to a group of their friends who were attending a concert.
He said both had different roles to play in supplying the ecstasy.
The court hear mobile phones belonging to the couple were seized and analysed and were found to contain numerous incoming and outgoing messages referring to several illegal drugs.
In addition to the ecstasy charge, 29-year-old Wade was also charged with possessing cocaine, cannabis and diazepam tablets.
The pair pleaded guilty to the charges and were both given a nine-month sentence, suspended for three years.
The judge said that he accepted the defendants were drugs-free and that, based on reports from the probation and social services, it would not be in the public interest to send the couple to jail.
He told them if they had been convicted of the charges following a contested trail, they would have been jailed for 12 months.
