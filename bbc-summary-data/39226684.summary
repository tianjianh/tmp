Amazon.com's bestseller list has been topped by a US political manifesto with a twist - all 266 pages are blank.

Reasons To Vote For Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide contains no words other than page headings and a bibliography.
"You can go cover-to-cover in about 15, 20 seconds," author Michael Knowles, a conservative journalist, told Fox News.
A one-word cover review of the literary phenomenon-cum-political joke simply reads: "Thorough".
The viral popularity of Mr Knowles' $8 (Â£6.6) paperback page-turner follows days of publicity in conservative media.
"It took a very long time to research this book," said the writer, a journalist for the Daily Wire website.
"When I observed their record and reasons to vote for them - on reasons of economics or foreign policy or homeland security or civil rights and so on - I realised it was probably best to just leave all the pages blank."
Among the more than 1,200 mostly sarcastic reviews on Amazon, one purchaser noted: "If Democrats copied and pasted the contents of this book into their national platform they could become unstoppable."
Another wrote that "even my 2 year old can now understand the benefits of liberalism", adding that it had now become "her favorite book to scribble in".
The self-published work follows a similar work on the opposite end of the political spectrum.
Why Trump Deserves Trust, Respect and Admiration, with 206 blank pages, debuted in November. That political tome currently also has a 4.5 out of 5 star rating on Amazon.
"Despite years of research, we could not find anything to say on this subject, so please feel free to use this book for notes," the description of the book reads.
