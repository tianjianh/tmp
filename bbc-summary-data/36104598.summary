Pembrokeshire council agrees site for Welsh-medium school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new Welsh-medium school for three to 16-year-olds in Pembrokeshire have moved a step closer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pembrokeshire councillors agreed for the new school to be sited at Withybush Road, Haverfordwest, on Thursday.
As part of the process, councillors voted in favour of closing the town's Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Gymraeg Glan Cleddau.
A statutory notice will be published next week and residents will have an opportunity to object.
Post-16 Welsh education would be provided at Ysgol y Preseli in Crymych under the plans.
