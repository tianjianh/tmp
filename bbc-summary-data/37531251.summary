Three pensioners - all over 70 - have been awarded for their bravery after they tackled and pinned down a burglar.

The trio were returning to a family member's home in Heanor in Derbyshire when they caught the intruder taking some jewellery in June.
The thief has since been jailed for 27 months for burglary.
The three heroes, one from Germany and two from America, tackled the man and pinned him to the ground before police arrived and arrested him.
Peter Mueller, 70, and his friends, aged 78 and 81, were given awards by Derbyshire police on Friday.
Mr Mueller said his friends now call them "the three musketeers".
"I was astonished. It was instinct," he said.
"I have enjoyed that the British Police make a special day for me. They said 'maybe you are a hero'."
Chief Constable Mick Creedon said: "To have them here and give them the award ... is really important."
