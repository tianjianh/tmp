The Irish province returned to the top of the Pro12 with an emphatic bonus point win at the RDS in Dublin.
Despite the defeat, Scarlets remain fourth and in the play-off spots but fifth placed Ulster are a point behind with a game in hand.
"We were well and truly beaten by a better side on the night," New Zealander Pivac said.
He continued: "You've got to take your hat off to the opposition. They were very, very clinical and a very good side and I think across the board they were better than us.
"It was disappointing because we had enough possession but I think the stat was something like 45% of what we turned over in the first half, we gave back to them.
"We didn't take advantage of the conditions."
Scarlets' next Pro12 game will be at home against Edinburgh on Friday, 24 March.
