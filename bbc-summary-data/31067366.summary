Scottish Borders Council rejects Hag Law wind farm bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors have unanimously voted to refuse permission for an eight turbine wind farm in the Scottish Borders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developers wanted to build the 100m high turbines near Romanno Bridge in Peebleshire.
Stevenson Hill Wind Energy, on behalf of West Coast Energy, also applied to construct a new access road from the A701.
The application drew 125 letters of objection and one of support.
They wanted to build the turbines along the ridges of the peaks of Green Knows, Hag Law and Wether Law.
Members of the Scottish Borders Council's planning applications committee raised concerns about its visual impact on the landscape and neighbouring communities.
Archaeologists had also claimed it would cause unacceptable harm to four scheduled monuments of national importance and a historic landscape of "at least regional importance".
Planning officials advised councillors to reject the scheme on landscape impact and potential noise nuisance grounds.
