[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man from south Wales accused of involvement in a car insurance fraud ring "does not agree" with personal injury claims, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven people have denied conspiracy to defraud at Cardiff Crown Court after six insurance claims worth £144,000 were made between 2009 and 2011.
Matthew Davies, 33, of Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he suffered  injuries in a "genuine" crash.
A guitar worth £1,850 was also damaged, he said.
On Monday, the court heard Mr Davies, who runs a valeting business, expressed his disapproval of personal injury claims during an interview about his own.
"It's not something I agree with," he said at the time.
"I understand the reflection that personal injuries and claims have on the price of people's insurance policies."
The prosecution said he was also recorded as having stated everyone else "is doing it, so I'm going to put one (a claim) in".
Mr Davies told the court he and fellow defendant, Adam Fear, 27, also of Pontypridd, played together in a band called Heroes and Outlaws.
They went for a jam session at a home on Shelley Walk in Rhydyfelin, Pontypridd, on 15 October 2010, Mr Davies said.
He told the court the pair were later driving out of the area when Mr Fear's car collided with a BMW at the junction of Dyffryn Road and Cardiff Road.
When asked whether he was telling the truth and the crash was genuine he said: "Yes, it was."
The court heard Mr Davies attended his GP a week later.
"Initially, I was fine but on the Sunday and Monday evening I could not sleep very well. I had numbness in my fingers and ringing in my ears," he said.
He also told medics he was suffering with neck and back pain after the alleged accident.
Mr Davies visited Caerphilly Miners' Hospital on 3 November 2010, having consulted with a firm of injury specialist lawyers.
When quizzed by prosecutor Christopher Clee, Mr Davies said he had "no idea" why details about his injuries and the accident appeared to differ in the various medical notes.
Mr Davies told the court he discovered his Gibson Les Paul Custom electric guitar was damaged only when collecting it from the wrecked vehicle after the crash.
He said it only later occurred to him that he might make an insurance claim on it but, as he had failed to find a receipt, he ended up having to "cut his losses" and accept an offer of £300 for the damaged instrument.
His fellow band mate Mr Fear has already told the court he is innocent of conspiracy to defraud.
The case continues.
