[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers visited restaurants and takeaways in Perth, Blairgowrie, Scone and Bridge of Earn on Wednesday.
Three Malaysians, two Chinese men and others from India and Pakistan were arrested for immigration offences.
Five were detained while steps are taken to remove them from the country, and two were released while their cases are progressed with the Home Office.
Home Office Immigration enforcement officers arrested Malaysian men, aged 26 and 32, at the New Diamond Takeaway on Rannoch Road in Perth, and a 49-year-old of the same nationality at Scone Fish and Chip Shop.
Two Chinese men, aged 28 and 38, were arrested at Canton Cuisine in Blairgowrie, while a 26-year-old from India and a 36-year-old Pakistani man were found at Spice Village Garden in Bridge of Earn.
The 32-year-old Malaysian and the 36-year-old Pakistani man were released, but will have to report to the Home Office while their cases are progressed.
Each establishment faces a potential civil penalty of up to Â£20,000 per illegal worker arrested, unless they can prove appropriate checks were carried out.
Stephen Roarty from Home Office Immigration Enforcement said: "These arrests serve as a warning to businesses in Perthshire using illegal labour.
"Our dedicated specialist teams have the expertise to catch you and if the correct checks have not been carried out you will pay a heavy penalty.
"Illegal working cheats the taxpayer, undercuts honest employers and often exploits some of society's most vulnerable people."
