The Â£6.5m centre, at University of Wales Trinity Saint David's Waterfront campus, will open in 2018 and offer specialist training at all levels of the industry.
The Swansea hub will work alongside colleges across Wales.
Training body CITB said in the past apprentices had had to leave Wales to gain industry-recognised skills.
Mark Bodger, strategic partnerships director for CITB Wales, said: "The Construction Wales Innovation Centre (CWIC) will help ensure Wales has home-grown skills in place to meet the construction industry's current and future needs.
"CWIC will be a major step forward for the construction industry in Wales."
Some of the partner colleges in the "hub and spoke" training framework will include Coleg Sir Gar in Carmarthenshire, Coleg Ceredigion, Coleg Cambria in north east Wales and Coleg y Cymoedd in south east Wales.
