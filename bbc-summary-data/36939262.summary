[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Desmond D'Mello faces a fitness to practice hearing at the General Dental Council (GDC) next week.
In 2014, more than 22,000 patients in Daybrook, Nottingham, were recalled, with 4,500 tested for viruses.
Mr D'Mello faces 56 misconduct charges including hygiene failures and prescribing antibiotics without seeing patients.
Dental nurse Caroline Surgey - who worked with Mr D'Mello at the Daybrook Dental Surgery - faces 28 similar charges.
A spokesman for the GDC said: "The charges in full against Mr D'Mello allege that in June 2014, he failed to maintain adequate infection control by not wearing gloves, failing to change gloves between patients and other related hygiene issues.
"It is also alleged that Mr D'Mello managed patients in an inadequate manner, including the way in which he issued prescriptions."
This included allegedly prescribing antibiotics without seeing the patient or making a diagnosis.
The pair's hearing is due to start on 8 August and last three weeks.
Mr D'Mello was originally suspended in August 2014 over hygiene concerns. He later volunteered to stop working in the UK.
Thousands were tested for blood borne viruses and five tested positive for hepatitis C.
One of his patients, Amy Duffield, died shortly after treatment but a coroner concluded her death was not connected to the treatment.
