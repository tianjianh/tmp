The 31-year-old was charged on Monday after catching West Ham's Winston Reid with his left arm as they waited for a free-kick to be taken during Saturday's 0-0 draw at Old Trafford.
The Germany international will face a three-match ban if found guilty.
He has until 12:00 GMT on Thursday to respond to the charge.
Referee Mark Clattenburg spoke to both players after the incident, but did not mention it in his post-match report.
"The matter was referred to a panel of three former elite referees who each reviewed the video footage independently of one another to determine whether they considered it a sending-off offence," said an FA statement.
"For an FA charge to follow the decision by the panel must be unanimous."
