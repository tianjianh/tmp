Officials confirmed that Linda Vatcher, 62, died in an attack by gunmen in the Jordanian city of Karak.
Jordanian security forces say they have killed four gunmen after flushing them out of a historic hilltop castle in the city.
The shooting on Sunday left at least 10 people dead and 27 injured.
Vatcher's son Chris, who she was visiting for Christmas, was among those injured. The attackers have not been identified.
Jordanian officials said events began earlier in the day with a shoot-out between police and armed men at a house near Karak. The gunmen then fled by car into the city.
The Vatcher family has asked the media for privacy, but Burgeo Mayor Barbara Barter, a former teaching colleague of the slain tourist, told the BBC that she was a "soft-spoken, conscientious, very kind person" who loved teaching and volunteer work.
The retired school teacher grew up in Burgeo, Newfoundland and later moved to Corner Brook, a larger community on the island 210 km (130 miles) away.
The mayor said Vatcher poured hours into her work in local soup kitchens and food banks, and always returned to Burgeo for its annual cancer society fundraising event.
"She spent most of her life in two communities and she contributed greatly to both, so she's certainly left a very impressive imprint wherever she's gone," she said.
Barb Rhymes, Vatcher's cousin, told the Associated Press she was visiting her son in the Middle East, where he works.
"She was very friendly, outgoing." Ms Rhymes said. "It's devastating. It has hit the town hard."
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he is "shocked and saddened" to learn about Vatcher's death and her son's injury in "this heinous act of violence".
"This is a sad reminder of the very real threat of terrorism around the globe and of the need to continue working closely with trusted allies such as Jordan to help prevent horrific attacks of this nature. The people of Canada stand in solidarity with all Jordanians during this difficult time," Mr Trudeau said in a statement.
