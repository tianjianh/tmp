The Conference North side has been without a permanent home since their ground was destroyed by flood water in the summer of 2007.
The Tigers have ground-shared with other local sides ever since.
Plans for a 4,000 capacity stadium, including a 1,000 seat stand, have been submitted to Gloucester City Council.
Gloucester City's interim chairman, Mike Dunstan, said he was "thrilled" with the news.
"It's fantastic to take this significant step towards a return to our city, and I hope fans are as thrilled with the scale and ambition of the plans as we are," he said.
Gloucester City have not played a competitive game at their own home since 28 April 2007, when they beat Clevedon Town 3-1 at Meadow Park.
"This stadium will provide the club and indeed the city with a fabulous facility for sport."
The club's planning consultant, Paul Duncliffe, said: "The current planning application has addressed the fundamental flooding issues that have persisted for several years and we are pleased to report that the Environment Agency have no objections to the new stadium."
City council planners are due to decide whether or not to grant outline planning permission for the stadium later this summer.
Previous plans, which included wider proposals for floods defences in the surrounding area, had to be scaled down.
The club has been based in Cheltenham since 2010, having previously shared with Forest Green and Cirencester.
