The Portuguese forward, 29, has been linked with a return to Manchester United, whom he left to join Real in a then-world record £80m deal in 2009.
He was presented with the European Golden Shoe on Wednesday for scoring 31 La Liga goals in 2013-14.
"I hope to finish my contract with Real Madrid at 33 and after that we'll see if they want me to stay," said Ronaldo.
"I feel young and still a long way off retiring."
Ronaldo shares the Golden Shoe award with Uruguay's Luis Suarez, who scored 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season before joining Barcelona for £75m.
The Portuguese, who has been nominated for the 2014 Ballon d'Or award to decide the world footballer of the year, has already registered 22 goals in all competitions this season.
In total he has scored 194 league goals in 174 appearances for Real, while netting 55 times in 55 Champions League matches for the current holders.
Speaking to the Real Madrid website, Ronaldo says there will be discussions with club president Florentino Perez over renewing his current contract, which he signed in September 2013.
He added: "I'm very happy and in a great moment of form. Personally and in sporting terms, everything is going well. I want to win and get as many trophies as possible with this club."
A three-time winner of the Golden Shoe and two-time winner of the Ballon d'Or, Ronaldo says he wants to become the best footballer in history.
"Being the best in Portugal isn't enough for me, I'm going to work to be the best ever," he said.
"I don't have to prove anything to anyone, just to myself. I want to continue working in the same way because it's harder and harder to improve my figures.
"I want to be the best at the best club in the world."
