Kajsa Tylen, 40, from Nottingham, began the quest to beat Billie Fleming's 1938 achievement on New Year's Day.
Fleming cycled 47,642 km (29,604 miles) to motivate others in to adopting a healthy lifestyle.
Ms Tylen said it was "amazing" to have passed the mileage, but will continue her challenge until 31 December.
"It's been a long slog, but I'm really proud to have done it," she said.
"I'm going to have to do some rehabilitation when I'm done to walk without hobbling."
She added: "For me to get the Guinness record I have to hit 50,000 km for them to verify it."
Ms Tylen has been flanked during her journey by mother Tina Tylen, who travelled as back-up with a caravan.
She passed Fleming's distance on Thursday and expects to reach her 50,000km (31,068 miles) target on 9 December.
Ms Tylen, a business analyst who is originally from Sweden, has battled through illness, bad weather and muscular pain to surpass her hero's record.
Her challenge took in parts of Europe including Sweden, Finland and Germany.
She said in a video: "I've just passed Billie Fleming's mileage, how exciting is that?"
Tina Tylen said she was "super proud" of her daughter.
A site dedicated to Billie Fleming said: "Kasja has shown amazing strength of character to achieve this, we are in awe!"
Rather than raising money for charity the cyclist has been asking for "Sweat Pledges" - promises to start taking more exercise, similar to Billie Fleming's aims in 1938.
Ms Tylen has been sharing her ride data with Guinness World Records and her achievement is expected to be verified at a later date.
US cyclist Amanda Coker also claims to have broken the record, but according to Cycling Weekly she is riding to a different set of rules set by another organisation.
