A burst water pipe in Oxfordshire has caused flooding in a road and left homes without water.

Thames Water said the burst pipe in Broughton Road, Banbury, left those in the OX16 postcode area without water or with low pressure.
Firefighters worked to stop homes from getting flooded. The flow of water was stopped at about 13:00 BST and supplies have since begun to return to normal.
The road has been closed between Bath Road and Beargarden Road.
It is not yet know why the burst occurred.
