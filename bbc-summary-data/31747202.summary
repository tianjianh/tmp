[SN]TITLE[SN]
Council to fund defibrillators in Nithsdale communities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors have agreed to fund 11 life-saving defibrillators for communities across Dumfriesshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There had been concerns they would refuse the funding applications after an expert's report found that the heart-starting devices have little impact in areas of sparse population.
Campaigners claimed that "people power" persuaded members of Nithsdale Area Committee to approve the funding.
Many of the devices will be placed in remote and rural areas.
Community group The Hub applied for Â£3,770 from the Nithsdale community safety fund for 12 defibrillators and training for volunteers.
Among the areas included in the scheme are Penpont, Keir, Tynron and Locharbriggs.
Only an application to place equipment in the Moniave Institute was refused. A separate bid for defibrillator funding for the local community council was agreed.
Karen Lewis, of The Hub, said: "I am delighted our local elected members supported the funding applications and recognised the strength of support that came from local people who live in the communities involved."
