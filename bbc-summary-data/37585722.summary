[SN]TITLE[SN]
David Haye could fight at Principality Stadium in December

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-world heavyweight champion David Haye could bring his next fight to Cardiff's Principality Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Englishman Haye, 35, will fight on 10 December against a yet-to-be-named opponent, who could be American veteran Shannon Briggs.
The home of Welsh rugby has not hosted a boxing event since November 2007.
It is understood officials are keen to bring boxing back to the venue, but they have concerns over protecting the pitch before the 2017 Six Nations.
Haye was out of the sport for three and a half years after having shoulder surgery in 2013, but returned with a first-round knockout of Australian Mark de Mori in January.
He secured another knockout win over Swiss Arnold Gjergjaj in his second comeback fight in May.
