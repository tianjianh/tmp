An employee at ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne has been nominated for an award for her efforts to help seven island weddings go ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Demi Wylie organised a small team to liaise with the couples and guests during industrial action that affected CalMac sailings in June last year.
Some travel plans for the more than 600 people involved were adjusted so they could reach the Western Isles weddings.
Ms Wylie, 23, has been put forward for a Scottish Transport Award.
She will find out if she has won the Frontline Employee of the Year category at a ceremony in Glasgow on 16 June.
Ms Wylie is based in CalMac's contact centre in Gourock which handles calls across the company's services.
Ferries had been key to getting brides, grooms and many of their guests to ceremonies and venues for the weddings across the Hebridean islands chain.
The industrial action came amid a row over tendering process for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferries Network.
