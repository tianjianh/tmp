Robert Pilott, 65, of Woking, Surrey, died following the pile-up between junction nine and 10 on the northbound M40 in Oxfordshire in February.
The Oxfordshire coroner said he would write to Highways England about the issue of fog sensors.
Thames Valley Police has said no drivers will face criminal proceedings.
The inquest heard how drivers on a stretch of the motorway near Weston-on-the-Green hurtled into each other at 70mph at 07:45 GMT on Saturday 14 February.
Collision investigator Terry Anderson said weather conditions on the day were "exceptional".
He said: "The fog was patchy but then came on suddenly and they would have only had about a second to respond.
"There is no fog detection equipment between junctions nine and 10 of the M40, which would be needed for the matrix signs to warn of fog."
Recording a conclusion of accidental death, coroner Darren Salter said he would be writing to Highways England to see if there is a case for a fog detector and if it is being reviewed.
A Highways England spokesperson said: "Safety is a top priority and we keep safety on our network continually under review. We will support any review the coroner requests."
A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: "A thorough and complex investigation has concluded and no criminal proceedings will be taken against any of the drivers involved."
The motorway was closed northbound for more than eight hours after the crash in which six people were seriously injured and 55 had minor injuries.
