The 23-year-old went into the river on 2 February.
Hundreds of people joined Mr Glenn's family, police divers and other agencies in a search of the riverside since then.
Jack's funeral is to take place on Saturday. His grandfather, Jack Glenn snr, said finding his body was a bittersweet moment for the family.
"We're very relieved that the torment of the last seven and a half weeks is over and that we're able to bring Jack home and able to lay him to rest," he said.
Jack's sister, Katie, has described him as "the best brother in the world".
"He was so talented at everything, he didn't know how good he was and how much everybody loved him," she told the BBC shortly after Jack went missing.
