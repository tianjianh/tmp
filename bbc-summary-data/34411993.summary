Cult Human League label comes out of the shadows

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British music history loves to eulogise record labels from the post-punk era. Manchester had Factory, Glasgow is famous for Postcard, while London was home to both Stiff and Rough Trade.

A new documentary aims to highlight the contribution of another, often forgotten participant - Edinburgh's Fast Product, which as well as nurturing local talent, put out the debut singles of The Human League, The Gang of Four and California's The Dead Kennedys.
The Big Gold Dream is being screened as part of London's Doc N Roll Festival. It tells the tale of how, what started in a tiny Edinburgh flat, ended up with a US number one.
Director Grant McPhee planned to make a documentary about the history of Glasgow's independent music scene, but soon switched coasts after discovering a story about which he knew nothing.
"Punk was banned in Glasgow by the local authorities for a good few years, so punk was taken out of Glasgow," he says.

"A lot of young folk from Glasgow went to Edinburgh. There were these bands there, The Scars and The Fire Engines who I hadn't heard of, so I immediately thought this was more interesting.
"It quickly changed to being a documentary about Fast Product, who were releasing records before Postcard."
Fast Product was founded in 1977 by Bob Last and his then girlfriend Hilary Morrison, who inspired him into action by giving him a copy of Spiral Scratch by The Buzzcocks.
They set up the label in their Keir Street flat near Edinburgh's Art School - writing a manifesto which promised to create "difficult fun".
I met Bob Last in the bar of the Edinburgh Novotel and, as he explains, it is a fitting location.
"It's actually been built on the site of the Tap o' Lauriston, which was our local bar and the centre of our world for two years in '78 and '79. There's not even one of those blue plaques up there on the wall."
It was where local punk bands including The Scars, The Flowers and The Fire Engines would meet and plan chart domination. That would follow, but not for them.
Last's first sortie into the music industry was as a roadie for Edinburgh Punk band The Rezillos, whose hit Top of the Pops, actually got them onto Top of the Pops. Their guitarist, Jo Callis, was from Rotherham, so the band often toured in Yorkshire.
When Last set up Fast Product he started to sign the best support acts from those gigs, including The Mekons and The Gang of Four from Leeds.
Then one day he received a package from Sheffield's The Human League.
"They sent me a cassette in the post with Being Boiled on it, a manifesto typed out on that computer paper and on some mylar. I just phoned up and said I'm putting it out."
In two years the label released 11 singles and one compilation album before Last decided to kill it off. It had been a huge critical success, but not one song had made the charts.
"I originally thought all of these songs would be hits. I realised more money needed to be spent to get them in the Top 40.
"It was a conscious decision to stop and go: 'We've made this statement. We've thrown it out there. Let's see how far it resonates'. I encouraged the bands to go onto labels with bigger money."
This included the Human League, whom he now managed, doing a deal with Virgin Records  "to get more resources".
In 1981 he pulled the unexpected move of persuading the guitarist for The Rezillos, Jo Callis, to join the syth group.
"I was pretty damn sure that The Human League needed the equivalent of a barre chord," he says.
The move worked.  Callis immediately co-wrote Don't You Want Me. It sold a million copies in the UK, was the Christmas number one and topped the charts in the US.
Everything Last had dreamed about in that Edinburgh flat had come true.
"That was the pinnacle. It was very difficult after that to really go any further and it's partly why not long after that I got out of the music business."
Last moved into films, acting as music co-ordinator for Johnny Depp's Chocolat, producing the Oscar nominated The Illusionist and he has just come off a 35-day shoot on Tommy's Honour, a father-son story about the origins of golf, directed by Jason Connery and on which father Sean Connery has worked as an advisor.
Despite his success, the story of Fast Product had been pretty much forgotten, even in the Scottish capital.
"Edinburgh never embraced Fast Product. We had a lot of interest internationally. College radio all over the States would be playing these things and getting in touch with us, Japan, Australia.
"But Edinburgh didn't know how to make any sense of it, because it's a pretty bourgeois city, with its working class areas completely segregated on the periphery. It kind of still is that. That's not what we were about. At all."
The Big Gold Dream is being screened at Picturehouse Central, Shaftesbury Avenue, London at 1900 BST on 2 October.  The London Doc N Rock Festival runs until 4 October.
