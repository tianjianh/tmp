[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As Livi drew 2-2 away to Alloa, who started the day in second, the Diamonds overwhelmed Peterhead 4-1.
It means Livi have a 10-point lead over the Lanarkshire outfit.
Brechin City were held 2-2 at home by Stenhousemuir, the same scoreline as Queen's Park hosting East Fife, while Albion Rovers beat Stranraer 3-0.
Stranraer's win means they move to within a point of Stenny at the foot of the table.
Craig Malcolm put Stranraer ahead on 21 minutes and doubled his tally with 11 minutes left before Steven Bell netted a third.
Alloa and Livi went into the game as the top two in the division and Jordan Kirkpatrick gave the hosts the lead with a superb 25-yard strike after 25 minutes.
But Daniel Mullen levelled for Livingston just before the break.
Liam Buchanan netted his 22nd goal of the season shortly after the restart as the leaders inched ahead, but Dylan Mackin earned the Wasps a valuable point four minutes from time.
Airdrieonians fell behind when Rory McAllister scored his 17th goal of the season, but Jack McKay and Ryan Conroy replied after the break to put the Diamonds in front.
Andy Ryan's powerful finish and a stoppage-time solo goal from Scott Stewart rounded off a emphatic comeback.
Andy Jackson put Brechin in front after only three minutes at Glebe Park when he fired in Ally Love's through ball.
However, Willis Furtado responded with a curling effort from the edge of the box.
Oliver Shaw put Stenhousemuir ahead just after the quarter of an hour mark, but Dougie Hill replied shortly after the restart to earn City a share of the spoils.
That was despite the Warriors going down to 10 men after David Marsh earned his marching orders for yellow bookable offences on 74 minutes.
Two goals in seven first-half minutes put Queen's Park in a dominant position against East Fife, with Dario Zanatta scoring the opener with a neat finish before Anton Brady doubled Park's lead with a powerful strike.
Chris Duggan halved the deficit four minutes after the restart before a close-range effort from Scott Robinson secured a point for the Fifers.
