Rochdale 0-1 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Wootton's 94th-minute header earned MK Dons a 1-0 victory at Rochdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game appeared to be heading for a goalless conclusion when Conrad Logan kept out Ben Reeves' 76th-minute spot-kick after the Dons substitute had been brought down by Jim McNulty.
But a free-kick from the left deep into time added on from Ed Upson picked out Wootton at the back post and he headed the ball into the top corner of the net.
Logan had earlier denied Nicky Maynard while Dale defender Niall Canavan made a superb block to deny Reeves.
Those chances aside, it was all Rochdale and for all Logan's heroics, Dave Martin in the Dons goal was equally impressive in keeping the home side out.
Martin denied midfielder Matt Lund in the first half and frustrated Donal McDermott with a one-handed save before his best block of the afternoon in the last 10 minutes of the game, a fine stop to divert Ian Henderson's header from point-blank range.
Logan maintained the excellent display of goalkeeping when he kept out Daniel Powell and Kabongo Tshimanga in quick succession while at the other end Calvin Andrew slid a shot wide from close range after a teasing centre from Steven Davies before Wootton settled it in the dying seconds.
