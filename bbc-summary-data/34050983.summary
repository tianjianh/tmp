[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff surgeon Peter O'Keefe dismissed for gross misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff heart surgeon has been dismissed for "standards of behaviour in the workplace that constituted gross misconduct".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Consultant Peter O'Keefe, 49, was suspended from University Hospital of Wales in 2012.
An independent inquiry panel dismissed Mr O'Keefe from his position as consultant cardiothoracic surgeon with immediate effect and no notice.
The decision is subject to a right of appeal.
A statement from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: "After considering the findings made by an independent inquiry panel and hearing evidence and submissions in mitigation the board of the health board found that Mr O'Keefe's standards of behaviour in the workplace constitutes gross misconduct within the health board's disciplinary rules."
Welsh Secretary of the British Medical Association, Dr Richard Lewis, said Mr O'Keefe was on holiday with his family, so was unable to comment personally.
