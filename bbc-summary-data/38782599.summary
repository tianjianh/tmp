Champion Frampton and Santa Cruz weighed in without a hitch in Las Vegas after Lee Selby's IBF featherweight title defence was called off.
Frampton, 29 says he will repeat his thrilling win over Santa Cruz last July and may even knock out the Mexican.
"I believe I can knock him out but I'm going to predict a win," said Frampton.
The atmosphere during Friday night's weigh-in at the MGM Grand made the occasion almost seem like a home contest for the Northern Irishman as his supporters delivered vocal encouragement to their hero.
Close to 5,000 Frampton supporters are thought to have travelled from all over Ireland to the contest in Nevada and the champion said that he was "amazed by the turnout" at the weigh-in as both fighters were measured at 125 pounds on the scales.
"I was expecting big numbers but I wasn't expecting that.
"It felt like Belfast here today and I think tomorrow is going to be more of the same.
"The support gives me an awesome boost. I always say when I fight at home, it adds five or 10% to my game and it's going to be like home here. I can't wait to get going."
Selby's title defence against Jonathan Victor Barros was called off with the Nevada Athletic Commission saying that the Argentine had not met its requirements.
Welshman Selby has been linked with a possible bout with Frampton at Belfast's Windsor Park next summer.
