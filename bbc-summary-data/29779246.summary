For the last three years Russia has experimented with keeping permanent summer time.
In 2011 the Russians put their clocks forward one hour but did not put them back in winter time.
The move proved to be highly unpopular with many Russians.
Many Russians in the north complained about living in darkness. There are fewer hours of sunlight closer to the Arctic circle.
