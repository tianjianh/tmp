The 21-year-old, who can play centrally or at right-back, joined the Gunners from Southampton for £16m in 2014.
He quickly became a first-team regular for Arsenal, and won three senior caps for England, but he only featured 12 times in last season's Premier League.
Chambers' Arsenal and England team-mate Jack Wilshere could also be going out on loan this week.
Head coach Aitor Karanka said Chambers had rejected an offer from another club to join Boro.
Chambers is Boro's 11th signing this summer, with the Premier League club bringing in goalkeeper Victor Valdes, striker Alvaro Negredo and midfielder Marten de Roon among others.
The Gunners signed Deportivo La Coruna forward Lucas Perez for £17.1m and Valencia's Germany defender Shkodran Mustafi, for a fee in excess of £35m, on Tuesday.
