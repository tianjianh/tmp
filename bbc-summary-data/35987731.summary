Dyfed-Powys is the largest police force by geography in England and Wales.
It covers the counties of Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Powys, with a population of more than 488,000 and policing more than half of Wales' land mass and more than 350 miles of coastline.
The post of chief constable is served by Simon Prince, while deputy chief constable is Carl Langley.
Neighbouring forces are South Wales Police, North Wales Police, Gwent Police and West Mercia Police in England.
The force's total funding for the year 2016/17 is £93.3m.
Average band D properties in the area will pay a precept of £200.07.
That compares to £240.12 in North Wales, £220.06 in Gwent and £207.85 in South Wales Police force areas.
There were 20,021 crimes recorded in Dyfed-Powys in the year to September 2015.
That is an increased of 9% since the previous year.
Incidents of violence against the person rose by 28%, although all police forces but one saw an increase.
Recorded sexual offences rose by 53%, while burglary rose by 6%, vehicle offences fell by 24% and public order offences dropped by 18%.
A recent inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said Dyfed-Powys Police recognised it needed to work with partners in order to prevent crime and reduce anti-social behaviour.
The review found that it uses a range of alternative methods to divert offenders from the criminal justice system, and has invested significant resources into establishing strong partnership arrangements for managing the most prolific offenders.
But it said there needs to be improvements made in the way the force identifies vulnerability and how it allocates crime for investigation.
