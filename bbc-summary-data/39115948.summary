Worcester Warriors have signed winger Tom Howe from fellow Premiership side Wasps for the 2017-18 season.

The Buckinghamshire-born youngster, 21, has been associated with Wasps since their High Wycombe days, when he joined from Beaconsfield.
Howe, who has two tries in 13 first-team appearances, played for England's Under-20s as they won the Junior World Championship title in 2016.
"Tom is a hungry, young player," said Warriors director of rugby Gary Gold.
"He will add further depth to our options in the back three. He has shone for Wasps when presented with the opportunity. Hopefully, he can use the resources around him at Sixways to flourish."
Howe has also had loan spells in the Championship with Jersey Reds, and in National League One this season at Coventry.
Wasps have also allowed a player to join Warriors' Premiership relegation rivals Bristol.
Loosehead prop Tom Bristow has joined Bristol for the rest of the season, making him available for Sunday's Worcester-Bristol match at Sixways.
Worcester will start Sunday's game two points ahead of Bristol, who beat them when the two sides first met this season at Ashton Gate on Boxing Day.
Meanwhile, Wasps back-row forward Alex Rieder has signed a new, undisclosed-length contract with the Premiership leaders.
