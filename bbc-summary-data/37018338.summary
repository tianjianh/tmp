[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kingsley James' strike on his home debut helped Macclesfield to a comfortable 3-1 win over Southport in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nerves were settled for the hosts after five minutes when Danny Whitaker opened the scoring from Danny Rowe's corner, and four minutes later they were celebrating again as Paul Lewis doubled their lead.
James then netted on 25 minutes with a tidy finish from a well-timed pass by skipper Andy Halls before Chris Holroyd shot just wide as the hosts continued to dominate.
With the points all-but secure for Macclesfield, Southport scored a late consolation through Ashley Grimes.
