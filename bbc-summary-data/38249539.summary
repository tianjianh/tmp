The game show was first broadcast on BBC One in 1979 but is being brought back by ITV for a Christmas special on 24 December.
David Walliams will host the revival, which will be the first full episode since 2002.
Anne Robinson and Louis Walsh will also appear as panellists alongside Paul and Barry Chuckle.
X Factor judge Walsh said: "I am really excited to be taking part in Blankety Blank after 14 years off air.
"The worst-case scenario is that contestants leave with just a Blankety Blank chequebook and pen and, let's be honest, who wouldn't want one of those."
Birds of a Feather and Strictly star Lesley Joseph, comedian Joe Lycett and Coronation Street actress Brooke Vincent will also appear.
Previous hosts of the programme include Sir Terry Wogan, Les Dawson and Paul O'Grady's alter-ego Lily Savage.
The series ran for 11 years on BBC One between 1979 and 1990, and was later revived between 1997 and 1999.
The show was then revived by ITV for a year from 2001.
TV presenter Robinson, who has appeared on the programme before, said: "I'm thrilled to be doing the show again and am indebted to the Chuckle Brothers for explaining how it works. I never got the hang of it last time."
The game sees pairs of contestants go head-to-head to fill in blank statements by matching the answers of the celebrity panellists, with the winner going through to the "supermatch" game.
If the Christmas special is well received, it could mean a full series is commissioned by ITV.
