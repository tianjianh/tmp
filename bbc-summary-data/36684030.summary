Coventry City have made their first signing of the summer after agreeing a deal for striker Kwame Thomas following his release by Derby County.

The 20-year-old made his Rams debut in November 2014, one of only four appearances for the Championship club.
He had a short loan spell with Notts County two seasons ago and spent four months in League One with Blackpool last term, playing 22 times.
Thomas has signed a two-year contract with the Sky Blues.
The deal is subject to Football Association and Football League approval and Coventry boss Tony Mowbray is happy to have completed his first bit of business ahead of next season.
"Kwame is an exciting young striker, who will add pace and power to our attacking options," he told the club's website.
"It's good to get the first signing of the summer over the line and I am looking forward to working with Kwame over the course of next season."
After failing to make the play-offs in League One last season, the Sky Blues released nine players, while midfielder Jim O'Brien joined Shrewsbury Town.
Thomas will join teenage winger Jodi Jones, who signed a permanent deal following a successful loan spell from Dagenham & Redbridge, at the Ricoh Arena as Mowbray reshapes his squad.
