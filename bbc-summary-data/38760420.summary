[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woman embezzled £370,000 from Glasgow property firm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has admitted embezzling more than £370,000 from her employer, which caused colleagues to be made redundant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kerryanne Clarke, 38, pled guilty to transferring the money from Elmwood Construction Services Ltd into her own accounts between 2010 and 2014.
As a result, a number of employees were made redundant from the Glasgow firm, most of which were at Christmas 2014.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Clarke was remanded in custody and sentencing was deferred until next month.
The court heard how she made "duplicate" payments as a bookkeeper at the property development company based at Eagle Street.
Instead of paying the intended recipient twice, she transferred cash to her own accounts.
Clarke made more than 360 transactions between September 2010 and July 2014, paying £372,163 into four different personal accounts.
She handed in her resignation letter in June 2014, and after she left discrepancies were found within the company accounts.
Defence lawyer Ryan Sloan said the company had since gone into liquidation, and he was asked to provide further details about this.
He told the court Clarke had two young children and a drug problem.
