VisitScotland has come up with seven traits it believes can be found within the characters of the people and landscapes of the country.
They are warmth, humour, guts, spark, soul, determination and fun.
Using the hashtag #ScotSpirit the organisation hopes to encourage people across the world to share what Scotland means to them.
Launched by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the campaign is one of a series of initiatives that change the way VisitScotland markets and sells the country around the world.
It focuses on key markets across the UK, France, Germany and New York City.
A new TV advert has been created and interactive website developed.
VisitScotland is also working with the UK charity Family Holiday Association and the tourism industry to create opportunities for struggling families in Scotland, many of whom will never have had a family holiday, to see more of their country.
Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, said: "The new advertising visuals are breathtaking and I'm sure they will inspire many to make the journey to Scotland, but this is about so much more than stunning imagery. It's about harnessing a nation behind tourism.
"We want everyone who cares for Scotland to get behind this campaign by using #ScotSpirit and in doing so become ambassadors for the country and create this very special movement."
He added: "Scotland is a unique place inhabited by a unique people - a combination that creates an inimitable spirit.
"The emotional pull of this spirit can't be duplicated by other destinations. You have to come to Scotland to experience it."
Ms Sturgeon said: "Nowhere is the spirit of Scotland more evident than in its people - visitors to our country can be guaranteed that the people they meet and the welcome they receive will leave a lasting impression.
"So who could be better to be involved in a new campaign to bring even more visitors to Scotland than those who live here or visitors who love our country?"
She added: "Using the hashtag #ScotSpirit, people can get involved and demonstrate what they think makes Scotland special."
John McDonald, director of the Family Holiday Association, said: "This campaign is a fantastic opportunity to work with VisitScotland and their partners to help even more Scottish families in 2016.
"We see #ScotSpirit every day in the families we help, families who are struggling with some of the toughest challenges life can bring but are able to create memories that will last a lifetime, strengthening family bonds along the way."
