The 24-year-old leaves the Bairns after six years following their Premiership play-off final defeat by Kilmarnock.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston said: "I understood he wanted to play at a higher level.
"If their ambition is only to play for Falkirk then they're no use to me. They have to want to play at the highest level they possibly can."
Saints approached Falkirk in January, informing the Championship club that they wanted to offer Alston a pre-contract deal.
"Blair and I have been very open since he decided he wanted to leave it," said Houston.
"We have chatted regularly and we had one last night when he told me he would sign for St Johnstone today.
"Perhaps, if we'd gone up last Sunday, he would have stayed, but that's what happens in football."
Kirkcaldy-born Alston has been at Falkirk since he was a youth and has been a first-team regular since the end of the 2010-11 season.
In the campaign just ended, he made 46 appearances, scoring 12 times, as the Bairns finished runners-up in Scotland's second tier.
"When we had our first discussion about it, I said if you're paying well then there's no reason for me to leave you out in a huff because you're wanting to move on," added Houston. "I totally understand it.
"He's gone about his business 100% committed to Falkirk right to the very end.
"That thrills me. He never let things get to him.
"Now that the season is over, he's had an offer from St Johnstone and we wish him nothing but good luck. He can come back here any time."
Falkirk won the first leg of the play-off final, but they lost out 4-1 on aggregate after a heavy defeat at Rugby Park.
