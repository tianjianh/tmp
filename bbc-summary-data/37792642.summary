Liverpool are serious Premier League title contenders this season, according to Sir Alex Ferguson.

The Reds are third in the table, level on points with leaders Manchester City.
Ex-Manchester United boss Ferguson told German magazine Kicker Jurgen Klopp had "revived Liverpool's enthusiasm" since taking over as manager in October 2015.
He said: "For two decades, Liverpool changed managers without building their own identity. You can now sense you truly have to count them in this year."
In Klopp's first season, Liverpool finished eighth in the league, lost the League Cup final to Manchester City on penalties and were beaten by Sevilla in the Europa League final.
In their nine league matches in 2016-17 they have already played four of the current top seven - Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United - as well as defending champions Leicester.
Their next seven league matches are all against sides outside of the top seven - starting with a trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday, a 17:30 BST kick-off.
