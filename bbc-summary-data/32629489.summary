Michael Cole admits sex offences against Seahaven boys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has pleaded guilty to sex offences against boys after he tricked teenagers into sending him "inappropriate" images online.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Cole, 29, of Newhaven, East Sussex, admitted inciting sexual activity with boys and possessing indecent images of children.
He was charged after police appealed to teenagers who may have been threatened online by a man posing as a woman.
Cole was bailed at Lewes Crown Court until sentencing on 19 June.
During its investigation, Sussex Police said teenagers, mainly boys aged 13 to 17 in the Seaford, Newhaven and Peacehaven areas, were approached by a person calling themselves Jenny Lane and threatened if they did not send inappropriate images.
Det Con Steve Shimmons said Cole, aka "Jenny Lane", used social media, including Facebook and Skype, to contact teenagers and sent out more than 100 friend requests.
