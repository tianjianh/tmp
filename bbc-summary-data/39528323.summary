Townsend, who replaces the departing Vern Cotter in May, will lead the side on their three-match tour in June.
After the Italy game, which will be the first tier one international played in Singapore, Scotland face Australia in Sydney and Fiji in Suva.
"This time will be invaluable for our coaching team as we strive to further improve the squad," Townsend said.
Dominic McKay, Scottish Rugby chief operating officer, said: "Our first Test in Singapore sees the continuation of our long-term objective of further-globalising the Scottish Rugby brand in Asia-Pacific, as part of an exciting summer tour to the southern hemisphere for the Scotland team."
The three Tests will be played on consecutive Saturdays, with Italy on 10 June, Australia seven days later and Fiji on 24 June.
The second Test takes Scotland to Australia for the first time since 2012, when captain Greig Laidlaw kicked a match-winning penalty to secure a 9-6 triumph, the team's first win down under since 1982.
