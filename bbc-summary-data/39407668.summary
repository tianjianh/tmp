[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle defender Sonny Bradley says he can reach 10 league goals this season, after scoring his seventh of the campaign in their win at Doncaster.

The 25-year-old centre-back had only scored six career league goals before joining the Pilgrims last July.
Asked if he could reach double figures, Bradley told BBC Radio Devon: "It's possible - I don't see why not.
"There are seven games to go, [so] maybe one more brace and a late one last game of the season - who knows."
Only forwards Graham Carey and Jake Jervis have scored more for League Two Plymouth, who are in second place.
All of Bradley's goals have been headers, with the winner at Doncaster on Sunday his sixth away from home.
"I don't know where the (celebration) knee slide came from. I felt my hamstring straight after it, I thought 'why have you done that'," he joked.
"It's a great feeling, and when you get that feeling you want it again, again and again.
"I think if we keep working on it and the deliveries keep coming in like they are, I see no reason why I can't score more."
