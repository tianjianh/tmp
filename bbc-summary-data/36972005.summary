Trump Taj Mahal casino to shut down after years of losses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trump Taj Mahal, the Atlantic City casino, founded by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump but no longer under his ownership, will shut down after years of losses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The owners said the casino had long been unprofitable.
The closure after Labour Day will come after a lengthy strike over benefits.
Closing the Trump Taj Mahal will cost 3,000 jobs, adding to 8,000 workers who were laid off in 2014 when four of the other casinos in the city were closed.
The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal will leave only seven casinos in Atlantic City.
The casino was opened 26 years ago by current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
It was taken over by billionaire Carl Icahn in 2009 when Trump Entertainment filed for bankruptcy - a move which forced Mr Trump to give up all of his investment in his Atlantic City casinos.
Mr Icahn told the AP news agency that he has lost nearly $100 million on the Taj Mahal.
Atlantic City's main casino workers union has been on strike against the Taj Mahal since 1 July.
On Thursday, the strike will become the longest in the city's 38-year casino era.
The strike is over the restoration of health insurance and pension benefits. Unions have rejected an offer to restore health insurance at a level less than that of employees at the city's other casinos.
Atlantic City used to be the only gambling centre on the US east coast, but is now struggling with competition from casinos in neighbouring states.
