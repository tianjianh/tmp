Pippa Middleton wedding: Bucklebury village keeps silent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the world's media descend on the sleepy village of Bucklebury for Pippa Middleton's wedding, its residents appear resolute in remaining tight-lipped over the whole affair, as the BBC discovered.

Once in a while, a sleepy, green and quintessentially British village becomes the centre of the universe.
The village is Bucklebury, in West Berkshire, and it is the home of the Middleton family.
Thrown into the limelight because of the relationship and eventual marriage of daughter Catherine and the heir to throne, Prince William, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, it turns out the media's attention extends to all members of the clan.
Pippa Middleton, the younger sister of Kate, is marrying financier James Matthews on Saturday.
There are hints though that the tranquillity of this remote village is about to be disturbed.
There are a lot of journalists snooping around country lanes, and there are police hidden behind tall bushes near to where - you would imagine - the reception will be.
The main sense you get, walking around Bucklebury and the surrounding villages, is that people just want things to go back to normal.
The area has been thrust into the limelight not because it wants to be but because, simply, one of its residents married the future king.
The BBC wanted to speak to the residents of the village to get a flavour of what it was like to live in a place that has such a huge amount of media scrutiny, and is bracing itself for media intrusion once again.
The irony of that was not lost on us.
And none of the Buckleberrians wanted to talk. Our reporter walked into various establishments and asked a dozen people on the street.
The rejections given were very polite, but slightly exasperated.
One woman, who did not be want to be interviewed, said the village was "sick" of the whole affair, and the media "wasn't going to get anywhere". She was right.
An eatery in the village put up a sign outside telling the press they "do not allow filming or interviews", and added the media should respect the privacy of residents.
You get the sense they are waiting for this all to blow over.
Maybe though, after the youngest Middleton is married tomorrow, the press hordes may go away for good, and Bucklebury can return to normal.
Picturesque, very English and commendably discreet.
