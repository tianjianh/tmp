[SN]TITLE[SN]
Psychiatrist Adam Osborne 'begged lover's silence'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A psychiatrist begged a vulnerable patient not to report him to a medical watchdog after he ended their affair, a tribunal has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Adam Osborne, who was married at the time, told her exposing the two-year affair would "destroy" his family, a disciplinary panel was told.
He made threats towards the woman, asking her to retract her complaint to the General Medical Council (GMC).
Dr Osborne, brother of Chancellor George Osborne, was not at the hearing.
He treated the woman, referred to as Patient A, for depression, anxiety and chronic fatigue at a private practice in London, between 2011 and 2014.
She also had problems with substance abuse and self-harm.
Dr Osborne ended the relationship in February last year during an email exchange, the tribunal heard.
Two days later, Patient A, who is no longer living in the UK, was admitted to hospital after taking an overdose - hours after sending an email about the affair to psychiatrist Dr Neil Boast, who had temporarily been Dr Osborne's supervisor.
Following complaints to the GMC by Dr Boast and Patient A, Dr Osborne sent a "number of inappropriate emails" to his former lover between 14 February and 24 February, requesting that she withdraw the complaint.
One email said: "Please don't do this to me, it will destroy me and my family in public."
Representing the GMC, Bernadette Baxter said: "Patient A said on a number of occasions she wanted him to stop contacting her."
The emails "became more imploring" and Dr Osborne was "highly manipulative" in preying on the woman's vulnerabilities.
"He sees himself very much as a victim," she said.
"Then there are emails where the mood very much changed and spills into the territory where he makes threats towards Patient A."
Ms Baxter also outlined how Dr Osborne's emails suggested there would be consequences for her family and argued that Patient A had in fact seduced him.
The tribunal, which will judge whether the psychiatrist's fitness to practise is impaired by reason of misconduct, was told that there had also been contact between Patient A and Dr Osborne's wife.
Julian Woodbridge, who is representing the psychiatrist, said his client had been on sick leave.
Reading a letter to the tribunal, he said Dr Osborne apologised for being in a relationship with Patient A and sending "inappropriate emails in a moment of panic".
In 2010, the psychiatrist was suspended from practising medicine for six months after writing fraudulent prescriptions for a girlfriend, a family member and an escort, while he was a trainee at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester.
As a result, the GMC tribunal said the misconduct, which related to incidents between 2006 and 2008, impaired his fitness to practise.
It found he had "behaved dishonestly" after attempting to obtain anti-psychotic medication for a cocaine addict he had been seeing while his partner was away.
The current tribunal will resume on Wednesday.
