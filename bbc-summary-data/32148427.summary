Bell won the County Championship in 2004 and 2012 with the Bears as well as the T20 Blast at Edgbaston last season.
"As a Warwickshire man, I'm absolutely delighted to commit to this fantastic club," Bell, 32, told the club website.
"I have ambitions on a domestic and international level, and look forward to achieving these as a Bear."
Bell first signed for the Bears in 1999 and became the first Warwickshire player to win 100 Test caps for England last summer.
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown said that Bell had been a fantastic servant to the club.
"Whilst he continues to play a leading role for England, he is also an invaluable member of our squad who makes a huge contribution on and of the pitch," said Brown.
"He has been one of the best batsmen in the world for several years and everyone at the club is delighted that he remains a Bear for the foreseeable future."
Bell, who was part of England's ill-fated World Cup squad, will link up with the national team this week as they head for the West Indies for a three-Test tour in preparation for this summer's home series against New Zealand and Australia.
