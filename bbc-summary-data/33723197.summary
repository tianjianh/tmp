Mo Farah: UK Athletics finds 'no evidence of impropriety'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A UK Athletics review into doping claims against Mo Farah's coach Alberto Salazar has found no evidence of wrongdoing by Britain's double Olympic champion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BBC's Panorama programme accused Salazar of practising doping techniques with other athletes, which he denies.
There is no suggestion that Farah, 32, has been involved in doping.
UK Athletics added there was no reason to question Farah's training regime at Salazar's Oregon Project base.
American Salazar has worked as a consultant for British Athletics since 2013.
In a statement, UK Athletics said it was announcing the initial findings of "the first and most vital objective of the review", but that a full report would be made public some time after next month's World Championships in Beijing.
It said none of the "extensive information" supplied to the review panel contained "any evidence of impropriety" by Farah or gave them reason to "question the appropriateness of the input" into his preparation given by Salazar's team.
The governing body also said that, because of a subsequent launch of a formal investigation by US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD), the findings from their review would be shared with UKAD "prior to any wider circulation".
"UK Athletics continues to take the issue of doping violations in sport extremely seriously and will assist UKAD and other relevant authorities in their important work whenever required," UK Athletics added in its statement.
Farah is currently preparing to stage a defence of his 5,000m and 10,000m world titles in Beijing.
Should he succeed, it would make him the first man to complete the long-distance double at two World Championships.
