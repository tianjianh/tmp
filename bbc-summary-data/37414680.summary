Port Vale 3-1 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An early goal from Alex Jones helped Port Vale on their way to a comfortable 3-1 win over Millwall at Vale Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Valiants' top scorer netted his sixth goal of the campaign, before Martin Paterson and Remie Streete condemned the Lions to their third consecutive defeat with Lee Gregory's penalty only scant consolation.
Jones took only four minutes to fire the home side in front, collecting a cross from the right, turning his marker and thumping the ball past Jordan Archer.
Vale, boasting a 100% home record, doubled their lead after 59 minutes when Sam Foley's shot from the edge of the box was clipped over the Lions keeper by Paterson from close range.
Defender Streete put the result beyond doubt 12 minutes later when he rose highest to meet Sam Hart's corner and planted a header into the ground and over Archer.
Millwall finally got off the mark six minutes from time when Gregory slotted home from the spot after Anthony Grant was penalised for handball while trying to block a shot.
