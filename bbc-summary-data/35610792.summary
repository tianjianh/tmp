[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bernice Jaumotte, admitted misconduct in the running of Amber House care home in Abergele, Conwy county.
The 64-year-old also ran an unclean home, ignored residents' needs and did not provide care plans.
The Care Council for Wales (CCW) found "widespread and significant failings".
Mrs Jaumotte appeared before the CCW disciplinary hearing in Cardiff following her suspension from nursing at a Nursing and Midwifery hearing in August 2015.
The disciplinary hearings followed an investigation in December 2013 by Care Social Service inspectors which found serious breaches of care.
Residents were found looking unclean and unkempt, some with torn clothes, beds were stained, while carpets, bed linen and crockery were unclean and of poor quality.
Mrs Jaumotte's lawyer Susan Cavenden told the Cardiff hearing: "She admits misconduct and the facts of the case."
The Care Council conduct committee hearing was told that Mrs Jaumotte had taken over duties as the care home manager in May, 2013, after the previous manager left.
Miss Cavenden said that some of the offences in the home occurred before Mrs Jaumotte became the acting manager.
Mrs Jaumotte told the hearing: "People lied to me that things were being done.  I had no reason to think that anything was wrong.
"You take your eye off the ball and things can go badly wrong very quickly."
Mrs Jaumotte, whose home is now closed, was ordered to be permanently removed from the social care register.
Disciplinary hearing chairwoman Dr Norma Barry told her: "These matters came to light as a result of a series of inspections following concerns raised by members of the public.
"They were widespread and significant failings concerning the safety and well being of residents.
"The problems at the home were wide-ranging and significant and vulnerable residents were put at risk.
"The committee is not convinced that even now you accepted the failings were your responsibility. There is an ongoing failure to take full responsibility."
