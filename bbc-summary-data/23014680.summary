[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Shoreham crossing named the Adur Ferry Bridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new Â£10m swing bridge in a West Sussex town is to be named the Adur Ferry Bridge following a public vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge in Shoreham will allow pedestrians, cyclists and mobility scooter users to reach the town centre from Shoreham Beach.
It replaces the old structure after its foundations had "taken a pounding" over the years and it could not be economically repaired.
The bridge will open to the public in September.
A shortlist of six names, from a list of more than 60 suggestions put forward by the public, was drawn up by a judging panel, made up of representatives from Shoreham-By-Sea organisations.
Three hundred and thirty-eight votes were cast in total, with the Adur Ferry Bridge receiving more than a third of them.
