Calls for BTEC to prevent pupils becoming so called 'Neets'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are calls for a qualification to be rolled out to help pupils at risk of losing interest in school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BTEC qualification covers issues such as managing money and risk, career success and self esteem.
Targeting pupils in Year 9, the programme is aimed at tackling potential 'Neets' - those not in education, employment or training.
Its developer said some young people need a "penny-dropping moment" to realise the importance of education.
Sweet - succeeding with education employment and training - is billed as a guide on "how to be successful".
Almost 1,000 young people in south Wales are already following the scheme.
The latest statistics show 8.9% of 16 to 18-year-olds in Wales are 'Neets'. The Welsh government said the rate fell by almost 12% between 2013 and 2014 - the lowest level since data started being collected.
Gwawr Booth, who developed the programme, said: "We felt there were some young people who needed a bit of a penny-dropping moment where they realise the importance of education and training.
"Some young people just lose their way a bit and we just wanted to put together a resource that was going to try to make them think a little bit more about where they were heading and what the reality was.
"If we can get a qualification whilst doing that then it's a win-win situation for everybody. And yes, I would love to see this rolled out across Wales."

Kelly Rowlands runs ACT school in Cardiff which caters for pupils who have had problems while attending mainstream education.
She said: "It's far more than just the piece of paper they get at the end of it. It's about the life skills that they get throughout.
"As they progress through the qualification, we have a noticeable improvement in their behaviour and also their motivation to learn and their engagement.
"It's definitely one of the more successful qualifications we run."
