A double murder inquiry has begun after a man and a teenager were attacked at a travellers site in Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called at 13:15 GMT to reports a man had been stabbed. Fifteen minutes later another person arrived at hospital with suspected stab wounds.
It is believed the two males, one in his 30s and a boy in his late teens, were hurt at the West Meadows site.
A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder and has been taken into police custody.
The East of England Ambulance Service said crews were called to West Meadows, on the A14  junction near Whitehouse in the town, at the same time as police, and a man was treated for neck and back injuries before being taken to hospital.
A Suffolk police spokeswoman said detectives, dog units and the police helicopter had also been deployed to both sites.
An Ipswich Hospital spokeswoman said the site had not been "locked down", contrary to initial reports, but the area outside the accident and emergency department had been "cleared to assist police in their investigation".
The hospital was "running normally, but there is a strong police presence on site", she added.
A number of police cars could be seen outside the Garrett Anderson Centre, where the accident and emergency department is based.
The westbound slip road onto the A14 from the Whitehouse interchange has been closed while police investigate.
