An Australian police officer's super excited reaction at the first flow of a drought-affected river has gone viral.
Senior Constable Des Hansson lives and works in the remote town of McKinlay in Queensland's north-west.
His daughter uploaded video of his enthusiastic response to the river's first flow just before Christmas.
It went from 500 to 40,000 views overnight after internet users began sharing it on social media.
