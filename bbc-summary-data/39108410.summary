[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cameron Fields, 21, of Gresley Close, Leicester, stabbed Adam Bent in what police described as an unprovoked attack.
Mr Bent, also of Leicester, was attacked in Braunstone Gate on 16 July after Fields followed him out of a bar.
A 16-year-old who pleaded guilty to assisting an offender was given a 24-month detention and training order.
Leicester Crown Court heard that after the attack Mr Bent staggered into a nearby taxi officer while Fields fled the scene.
Mr Bent died later in hospital from a single stab wound to the chest.
Fields, who received a life sentence, plead guilty to murder in October.
Det Ch Insp Martin Smalley said: "A man's life was taken away from him in a moment.
"Fields chose to carry a knife and he chose to use it that night; as a result he will now face a considerable time behind bars."
