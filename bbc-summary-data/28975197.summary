[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bitter feud that rocked the Plymouth University boardroom will be raised with the government, an MP has said.

MP Oliver Colvile said the row - which has seen the chairman of governors William Taylor temporarily stand aside and the vice chancellor Wendy Purcell suspended as they both face separate investigations - could damage the city.
Mr Colvile said he would discuss the impact with a government minister.
The university said those involved were trying to resolve the situation.
Mr Taylor faces allegations of sexual harassment, which he "categorically" denies, while vice chancellor Wendy Purcell has been suspended ahead of an investigation into her conduct.
Mr Colvile, Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton & Devonport, said he would be talking to Matthew Hancock, the Minister of State at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, about "what action he is proposing to take and if there's anything the government can try and do".
"I think it has got potential implications for it [Plymouth] which is why we need to clear this up as quickly as we can," he said.
"The university is a key player in the city but we need to be making sure we send out the right message that Plymouth is the place people should be investing in."
Earlier this month, retired judge Mr Taylor decided to temporarily "stand aside" while he is investigated about claims of sexual harassment.
The accusations were submitted by Prof Purcell, who is currently suspended as she faces an investigation into her conduct.
She was suspended from her Â£288,000-a-year post in June. The university is yet to reveal the reason for her suspension.
Prof David Coslett, the deputy vice chancellor, said: "I have reassured Mr Colvile, as well as the wider business community, that the relevant parties are trying to resolve the current situation as quickly as possible.
"The strong relationships the university has with the city and business sector, as well as with key influencers nationally and internationally, will ensure that we continue to use our expertise for the good of the city and the region.
"We continue to play our part in attracting millions of pounds in inward investment into the region and continue to support the business community."
