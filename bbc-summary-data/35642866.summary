Pro 12: Edinburgh v Scarlets (Sun)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland under-20 international Blair Kinghorn will start for Edinburgh in Sunday's Pro12 match against Scarlets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The full-back, 19, who recently helped the under-20 national side to an historic victory over England, makes his third start for the club.
Scarlets flanker James Davies returns from a foot injury to start
The 25-year-old returns after undergoing surgery on a broken bone in his foot sustained in the 20-12 win over Zebre in November.
Edinburgh's only other change from the side who lost to Ospreys last time out sees Damien Hoyland return to the wing.
Tom Brown completes the back three, with the rest of the back line remaining unchanged.
Hooker Neil Cochrane will captain the side, with Ben Toolis released by the Scotland national squad to partner Anton Bresler in the second row.
Jamie Ritchie and Hamish Watson start in the back-row either side of number eight Cornell Du Preez.
Victory for Edinburgh will see them move above Glasgow Warriors and into fifth place in the Pro12 table, although they will have played two matches more.
Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons said: "With international call-ups and injury this will yet again be a test of the strength in depth of our squad.
"Our players are looking forward to meeting the challenge this presents."
The only other change from Scarlets' win at Ulster last Sunday sees Maselino Paulino come in at blind-side flanker.
"He's [Davies] been training really well and we're excited to have him back," said Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac.
"He's in a really good place, he'll either start or come off the bench but will be involved in the 23."
Prior to his setback, Davies' sparkling early-season form could have made him a contender for Wales' 2016 Six Nations squad.
"He's been top of the league last year in terms of turnovers at the breakdown," Pivac added.
"Prior to the injury he was leading our team stats in terms of metres carrying the ball and defensive tackles and his all-round game was excellent."
Meanwhile scrum-half Aled Davies has been released from Wales' Six Nations training squad and is set to feature at Murrayfield.
Utility back Gareth Owen and back-row Aaron Shingler will undergo return to play protocols and a late decision will be made regarding their availability.
Scarlets sit third in the Pro12 after Sunday's win at Ulster but have not won successive away league games since October.
Edinburgh have lost their last four games and have beaten the Scarlets just once in their last seven meetings - but the Scottish side have lost just once at home this season.
However, Scarlets coach Pivac admits more away wins are needed to secure a top-four place.
"On the road we're forging a good record," Pivac said.
"We're on track for the top four but we have to keep performing in the games we've targeted as must wins."
