[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 0-0 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth were left frustrated by a spirited Crewe Alexandra as Paul Cook's side were held to a goalless League Two draw at Gresty Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pompey substitute Curtis Main went closest with a second-half header but the Alex, who have started the campaign in promising fashion after last season's relegation, deserved their point.
Portsmouth took an early grip on the game when Michael Smith was lose to connecting with Kal Naismith's driven cross.
But Crewe posed problems on the break through strike partners Ryan Lowe and Chris Dagnall, who flicked a George Cooper cross just past the post.
Portsmouth defender Christian Burgess got in the way of a Charlie Kirk effort, while, at the other end Milan Lalkovic's effort dropped onto the roof of the net.
Lowe conjured up an equally ambitious effort when spotting goalkeeper David Forde off his line, but his effort from 40 yards out fell a couple of yards past the post.
Portsmouth moved up a gear after the break but, when Gary Roberts did slip Michael Doyle in on goal, a timely block from Harry Davis prevented the Pompey skipper from getting his shot away.
Main glanced a header past the far post after Carl Baker's corner was flicked into his path before then almost turning the ball in from close range.
However, Crewe, who knocked Sheffield United out of the EFL Cup in midweek, were still a threat and Billy Bingham's blast forced a save out of Forde.
