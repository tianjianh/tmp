Sands Meadows in Worcestershire bought by wildlife trust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three wildflower meadows in Worcestershire have been bought by a local charity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sands Meadows near Inkberrow have been bought for Â£49,100 by the Worcestershire Wildlife Trust, using money from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The meadows were designated as a Local Wildlife Site in 1990, reflecting their importance for local wildlife.
They are part of a chain of about 60 important grassland sites stretching from Pershore to Astwood Bank
James Hitchcock from the trust said: "Due to many years of care by its previous owner the meadows already have around 60 species of grasses and flowering plants."
The trust hopes the hedges around the meadows will provide a new home for the nationally scarce brown hairstreak butterfly.
The butterfly is already found in the nearby Worcestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserve at Grafton Wood.
The trust is now looking for volunteers to help its conservation officers manage the meadows.
