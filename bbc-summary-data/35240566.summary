A report into whether a man under supervision could have been stopped from going on to kill a teenager in a case of mistaken identity has been made public.

Conner Marshall, 18, from Barry, died four days after he was attacked at a Porthcawl caravan park in March 2015.
David Braddon, 26, of Caerphilly, who was being monitored at the time, was jailed for life for his murder.
Mr Marshall's family had appealed for the full report to be made public.
They received a summary of the report by the National Offender Management Service but had collected a petition of more than 2,300 signatures calling for publication of the full version.
A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed on Wednesday it would be released.
In its summary, the report said Braddon was being monitored by probation workers after he was convicted for drugs offences and assaulting a police officer.
It also found he had missed some follow-up appointments and there were times staff could have "monitored his community order more robustly".
But it concluded staff could not have known he would go on to commit such a violent act.
Mr Marshall's mother Nadine Marshall has claimed the attack might never have happened if Braddon had been more tightly monitored.
"David Braddon was a time bomb... He should have had tighter controls, better management," she said.
