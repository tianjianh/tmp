[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belfast man in Dublin court over IRA attack in Germany

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man wanted by German authorities over an attack on a British army base in Germany in 1996 has appeared in court in the Republic of Ireland on an extradition warrant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Corry, 46, originally from Belfast, was arrested in Killorglin in County Kerry on Friday.
The High Court in Dublin heard his extradition is being sought in relation to terrorist offences.
He is alleged to have been involved in an IRA attack on a base in Osnabruck.
The three mortars were fired from a van, but only one of them exploded.
No-one was hurt in the attack.
Det Sgt Sean Fallon, of the Irish police force's extradition unit, told the court he had shown Mr Corry the warrant alleging he was a suspect for terrorist-type offences at Osnabruck.
He added that Mr Corry had nothing to say in response.
The judge said she was satisfied the man in court was the person named on the European extradition warrant.
She told Mr Corry he had the right to consent to surrender and remanded him in custody pending a bail application on Tuesday.
