[SN]TITLE[SN]
Braintree Town 1-0 Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Braintree climbed up to 11th place in the National League and level on points with Wrexham thanks to a free-kick winner from substitute Taylor Miles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were few chances, with Mark Beck going closest for the Welsh side with a long-range shot and Braintree's Kenny Davis blasting an attempt over.
Miles grabbed the only goal, firing home from 25 yards in the 74th minute.
Wrexham's hopes all but ended when Mark Carrington was sent off for a second caution late on.
Carrington felled Simeon Akinola, and Braintree almost doubled their lead when Sean Marks hit the post.
