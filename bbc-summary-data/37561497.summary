In a Sky News interview she urged the broadcaster to "sign me up for next year - I want a bit of that action".
The prime-time weekend show is currently featuring former Labour MP Ed Balls.
Ms Davidson spoke about her dancing ambitions ahead of her keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference.
She will address delegates on the final day of the Birmingham gathering.
Ms Davidson said she was jealous of Mr Balls' participation in the competition which is now in its twelfth year.
She added: "I have to say I have been totally team Balls on Strictly Come Balls... Strictly Come Dancing.
"I think he's doing a tremendous job and I'm just jealous.
"So if anybody from the BBC is watching, sign me up for next year, because he's making it look brilliant. I want a bit of that action."
At the weekend, Mr Balls was praised for his second dance, a Charleston which earned him a standing ovation from the Strictly audience.
