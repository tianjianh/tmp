Glamorgan's Dutch fast bowler Timm van der Gugten could be in doubt for the start of the season.

The Welsh county's 2016 player of the year suffered a shoulder injury while diving in the field during the Netherlands' draw in Hong Kong.
Van der Gugten, 25, did not return to action after the injury on the first day of the game, bowling only seven overs and was unable to bat.
Glamorgan start their Championship campaign at Northampton on 7 April.
It is unclear how long Van der Gugten will be out for but he is expected to be in a fitness race to make the beginning of the campaign after having treatment in Australia.
The paceman, who was born in New South Wales, claimed 82 wickets in all formats in his debut season in the UK.
Meanwhile, Glamorgan are currently trying to finalise the signing of South Africa fast bowler Marchant de Lange for the 2017 season.
They already have Michael Hogan, Graham Wagg, Craig Meschede, Ruaidhri Smith and teenager Lukas Carey among their seam-bowling options.
