The 42-year-old finished in fifth spot in Amsterdam with a season's best 31 minutes 34 seconds.
Turkey's Yasemin Can won the race in 31 minutes 12 seconds, while Britain's Jess Andrews finished in seventh.
Pavey, who needed to finish in 32:15 to qualify for Rio, has competed at every Olympics since 2000.
The 2014 European champion and Commonwealth Games bronze medallist finished sixth in the 10,000m at the British trials in May after struggling with a chest infection.
"I've been really up against it fitness-wise and each week I've been getting a little bit fitter," she told BBC Sport. "It was only three or four weeks ago that I could run half a race at that pace."
Pavey will now wait to see whether she will be selected for Rio.
"I have to wait and see what the selectors say - so many British girls have run well this season," she added.
"I really can't say what will happen. I'm pleased with my progress - I've given it everything that I could."
Amsterdam saw the return of Yuliya Stepanova, the runner who served a two-year doping ban before turning informer in Russia.
The 30-year-old Russian competed under a neutral flag during the 800m heats but struggled, pulling up after 600m with an injury and walking through the line because she wanted to finish, despite being in obvious discomfort.
She was initially credited with a time but was later officially disqualified from the race for a lane infringement.
Stepanova, who represented Russia at the 2012 World Indoor Championships, has been granted the right to compete at the Rio Olympics as a neutral as a reward for the information she has supplied about the extensive doping in Russian athletics.
Now exiled in the United States, she said the pressure had been hard to live with but was "very happy" and "very grateful" to be in Amsterdam.
She also insisted that she had received a warm welcome from fellow athletes.
"When I was sitting in the changing room, all the girls from the direct opposition I had today came up to me and said thank you for what you've done and being brave," she said.
London 2012 gold medallist Greg Rutherford secured his place in the long jump final in his first competition for a month, despite struggling with an ear problem.
Rutherford picked up the ear injury while competing at a Diamond League meeting in Birmingham.
His first-round qualifying jump of 7.39m was enough to take him to Thursday's final despite finishing eighth, as he followed his initial effort with two fouls.
"It was very rusty," said Rutherford. "The last one finally I felt like I was getting something together."
Dina Asher-Smith registered a season's best time of 22.57 seconds in the 200m to reach the final.
The 20-year-old is searching for her first major senior title after breaking the British 100m record at last year's World Championships.
She came through the semi-finals as the joint fastest qualifier after taking 0.15 seconds off her previous best time of the season.
World champion Dafne Schippers was missing from the 200m, the Dutch athlete opting only to race in the 100m in Amsterdam.
Jodie Williams, who won European silver two years ago in Zurich, joined compatriot Asher-Smith in Thursday's final as a fastest loser, clocking 23.14.
