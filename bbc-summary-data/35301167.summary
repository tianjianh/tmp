Plans to build up to 400 new homes in a former industrial area in Edinburgh have been given the green light by councillors, according to developers.

The Grosvenor Group said the City of Edinburgh Council had granted planning consent for its proposed build-to-rent scheme at Springside, Fountainbridge.
The group has already completed the first phase of the development.
It comprises 250 homes, including affordable homes, serviced apartments and student residences.
David Yaldron, from Grosvenor Britain and Ireland, said: "We welcome the City of Edinburgh Council's forward-thinking decision in granting planning consent.
"Our project team has collaborated closely with local neighbourhood organisations and today's decision marks an important and exciting step forward for the area's wider regeneration.
"In addition to new homes, this consent includes plans for a new public square, community spaces and commercial and retail space, which we hope will add to the vibrancy of the neighbourhood and re-position it as one of the best places to live in Edinburgh."
