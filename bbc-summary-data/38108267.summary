Charleston shootings: Dylann Roof 'fit' to stand trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A white man accused of shooting dead nine black people at a church in Charleston is competent to stand trial, a federal judge in the US state of South Carolina has ruled.

A psychiatric review of 22-year-old Dylann Roof was performed after a request from his defence team.
He is accused of killing the nine parishioners during their Bible study class in June 2015.
A jury selection for a federal trial is due to resume on Monday.
US District Judge Richard Gergel made the ruling after a two-day hearing behind closed doors earlier this week.
He sealed his reasons for finding Dylann Roof competent, saying that information could keep him from having a fair trial.
The suspect faces 33 federal charges including hate crime. He has already been found competent in a state court, where he faces nine counts of murder, and prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty.
The church where the killings took place is a nationally known historic black church, and federal prosecutors claim the killings were racially motivated.
After the shootings, photos emerged online of Dylann Roof holding the Confederate battle flag, sparking a backlash against the emblem, which to many is a symbol of slavery.
