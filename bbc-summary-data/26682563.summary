Titanic Quarter: £20m office development gets go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £20m office development in Belfast's Titanic Quarter has been given the go-ahead by the environment minister.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two blocks of six and seven storeys will be built between Belfast Metropolitan College and the Public Records Office for Northern Ireland.
The proposal also includes over 14,000 sq m of space for research and development.
The minister, Mark H Durkan, said the development would provide "much needed" high specification office space.
He added: "It is anticipated that once completed this building will accommodate 2,000 workers at this highly desirable waterfront location.
"Having this in place should help attract investment and encourage further job creation."
The US bank Citigroup occupies a substantial amount of office space in Titanic Quarter but it is not clear if a tenant has been identified for the new development.
High-end office space in Belfast has been dwindling as little development has taken place in the aftermath of the property crash.
However some new development is now beginning to take place.
Belfast Harbour Commission is currently developing office space in a project known as City Quays 1.
