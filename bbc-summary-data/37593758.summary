[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
QPR's winless home run continued as Danny Williams' equaliser earned Reading a deserved point.

Polish winger Pawel Wszolek netted his first goal for the Hoops from close range after Olamide Shodipo's run.
The lead was short-lived as Williams steered home Garath McCleary's cross.
Rangers, who backed manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink on Friday following a Daily Telegraph corruption investigation, have failed to win at Loftus Road since the opening day of the season.
Ariel Borysiuk shot wide and Sebastian Polter's header was just off target as Rangers threatened either side of half-time.
But the Royals, who have lost just once in nine Championship matches, carried the greater threat in the second half.
Home keeper Alex Smithies denied Roy Beerens and McCleary, while Yann Kermorgant headed McCleary's cross wide.
QPR, who have won just once in eight matches, moved up a place to 13th, while Reading are a point outside the play-off places in seventh.
QPR boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink:
"It's better to win three and lose one than win one and draw three. We really tried to get the three points.
"My boys gave everything and we were very positive in our substitutions, and on another day it might have worked.
"It's just unfortunate because we started ever so well and for the first 20 minutes we looked the better side and got a deserved goal.
"But we stopped doing what made us the better side and that is a pity. In the second half we tried to pick it up again and we did in stages. But it was always going to be a game of not many chances."
Reading boss Jaap Stam:
"I think we should have won it. If you look at the game and how we played, we should have scored a second goal.
"They tried to make it difficult for us by pressing us high up the pitch, but there was still a lot of space for us.
"We kept searching for the second goal in the second half but there was always a threat from QPR, who are a strong side and have physical players.
"In the second half, though, with the chances we created, and sometimes should have created, we should have scored and that's the thing we didn't do well."
