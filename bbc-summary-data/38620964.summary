[SN]TITLE[SN]
Walsall 3-1 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers' travel sickness continued as their League One play-off bid was hit by a sixth-straight away defeat at Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from on-loan Celtic defender Eoghan O'Connell, Simeon Jackson and Joe Edwards ensured that Matty Taylor's late response was mere consolation.
Walsall keeper Neil Etheridge made two excellent saves in the first half, foiling Billy Bodin's curler and Chris Lines' fierce 20-yard free-kick.
The Saddlers only had one real first-half chance and they took it, right on the stroke of half-time, O'Connell pouncing on Lines' loose header to lash home a volley from six yards.
Rovers could have levelled on 57 minutes as Ollie Clarke's low cross found the Pirates' top scorer Taylor unmarked 12 yards out but he fired straight at Etheridge.
That miss proved costly as Walsall doubled their lead on 68 minutes, substitute Jackson collecting Florent Cuvelier's ball over the top to sublimely chip debutant keeper Joe Lumley.
Walsall put the game beyond doubt on 73 minutes, Edwards robbing Byron Moore before coolly slotting beyond Lumley.
Taylor pulled one back on 82 minutes, heading home his 16th league goal of the season after Etheridge misjudged a Lee Brown cross, but it was mere consolation for Rovers.
