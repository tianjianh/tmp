[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mike Samwell, 35, was fatally injured as he tried to stop thieves from stealing his car from outside his home in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester.
Ryan Gibbons, 29, of Steven Court, Egerton Road South in Chorlton, has been charged with murder, burglary and aggravated vehicle-taking.
He is due at Salford and Manchester Magistrates Court on Saturday.
A 15-year-old boy from south Manchester who was arrested on suspicion of murder and burglary has been bailed pending further inquiries.
Two men, aged 20 and 21, who were arrested on suspicion of murder and burglary have also been bailed.
The former submarine officer was asleep with his wife Jessica in their Cranbourne Road home when they were awoken by a noise outside on Sunday morning and he went to investigate.
Police believe he was run over by his car, a black Audi S3, which was taken and later found about three miles away on Whitby Avenue, Ladybarn, with extensive damage.
Mr Samwell's family described him as a "special, kind and exceptionally talented man".
