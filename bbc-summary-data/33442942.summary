Cameron Mathieson's family wins Supreme Court case against DWP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A family has won its legal bid to challenge limits on welfare payments to severely disabled children in hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Benefits for Cameron Mathieson, five, stopped after he spent more than 12 weeks in Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool.
Supreme Court judges agreed the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had been "grossly unfair" when it stopped his payments after 84 days.
His family said they had continued the fight over Disability Living Allowance (DLA) "on behalf of other families".
Cameron, from Warrington, Cheshire, died in 2012.
