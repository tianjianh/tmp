[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Comedian Al Murray, who is standing for parliament in his guise as The Pub Landlord against UKIP leader Nigel Farage, has been on the campaign trail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He is contesting the South Thanet seat, in Kent, in the general election after forming the Free United Kingdom Party.
Mr Murray, 46, visited a pub, a brewery and a school in the constituency.
He said: "If I were to win then I would definitely open a pub because I'm going to nationalise pubs if I get the chance."
Mr Murray, whose character is based around a love for all things British, said his party represented "rational common sense".
On why he chose Thanet, he said: "I heard destiny's call like a trumpet in the far distance and it sounded like it was saying Thanet, so Thanet had to be the place."
He said one of his manifesto pledges including making Thanet the capital city and "demilitarising" North and South Thanet.
"Why can't North and South Thanet walk in harmony together," he said.
He has also promised that beer will cost "1p a pint", although "crisps will remain at the current price".
During his visit to the Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Mr Murray said he was meeting "the adults of tomorrow" to tell them about "their chance to change this nation from Great Britain to Amazing Britain".
Asked how seriously he was taking the election campaign, he said: "Well, only a fool wouldn't take the general election seriously. And a vote for me is a vote for common sense."
A website has been set up for his campaign, carrying the slogan: "Other parties offer the moon on a stick. We'll do better than that: a British moon on a British stick."
His party is using an upturned pound sign for a logo, in a clear parody of the UKIP symbol.
Murray is standing in a constituency which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the previous election in 2010.
