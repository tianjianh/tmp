The Burundi-born 22-year-old made his senior debut for Coventry in August 2011 at the age of 17 and joined the Magpies a year later.
But he made just three league starts in four years with Newcastle and returned to the Sky Blues on loan last season.
"I'm sure he can rediscover the form that made him so popular in his first spell," said manager Tony Mowbray.
