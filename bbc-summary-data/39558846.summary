Swansea City midfielder Jack Cork faces a battle to be fit for Saturday's Premier League trip to Watford because of an ankle injury.

The 27-year-old was forced off the field during Saturday's defeat at West Ham after falling heavily on his ankle.
A Swansea statement said Cork suffered only a minor ankle sprain.
However, Swans are hopeful striker Fernando Llorente will be fully recovered from an ankle injury to start at Vicarage Road.
In his absence after beating Bournemouth on 18 March, Swansea lost to Spurs and drew against Middlesbrough.
Llorente came off the bench in Saturday's 1-0 defeat at West Ham.
Assistant manager Nigel Gibbs told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "We are hopeful of Llorente having a real good week's training and being available for selection.
"He's been a big miss for us."
Former Southampton player Cork has featured in every game since Paul Clement was appointed head coach at the beginning of January, 2017.
