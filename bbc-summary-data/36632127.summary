Welsh football's focus has been on Wales' exploits at Euro 2016, with Chris Coleman's team facing Belgium in Friday's quarter-final.

Away from the excitement in France, it has gone almost unnoticed that European football's domestic competitions begin this week,
Welsh champions The New Saints face Tre Penne of San Marino in the Champions League.
Bala, Connah's Quay and Llandudno represent Wales in the Europa League.
The clubs will be hoping to to emulate the success of the national team as they prepare for this week's first leg games.
Bala Town will be appearing in the Europa League for the third time in four seasons when they face Sweden's AIK Solna away in the first qualifying round first leg on Thursday.
Colin Caton's side won both their home legs in the previous two campaigns but narrowly missed out on progressing to the second qualifying round after away defeats to opponents from Estonia and Luxembourg.
They face their toughest test to date this year, having been paired with the Stockholm-based club, who are seasoned European campaigners.
"We haven't failed to score in any of the games we've played in European competition, which is a massive plus," manager Colin Caton told BBC Wales Sport.
"We've got to tighten up at the back and shut up shop when we're away from home and give ourselves a fighting chance.
"The odds are stacked against us but we won't be phased by anything."
Caton's preparations for the game in Sweden have been aided by the Football Association of Wales' analysis team, who are currently with the national side at the Euros in France.
"They've sent all the information over to us," Caton added.
"They've helped us out at a busy time and we'll analyse it once we get over there."

When Andy Morrison took over at Gap Connah's Quay last November, the club were struggling at the wrong end of the Welsh Premier League table.
But the former Manchester City player oversaw a revival which culminated in the Nomads finishing fifth, their highest ever place.
And a 1-0 win over Airbus UK Broughton in the play-off final in May secured their place in Europe for the first time in their history.
"It was a special day and will live long in the memory but that's gone now," said Morrison, in his first managerial role after a stint as Airbus UK assistant.
"We need to give a good account of ourselves in Europe. We're not kidding ourselves as we know it's going to be a huge ask.
"I'm sure our goalkeeper is going to have to be on the top of his game."
Stabaek will be Quay's first ever opponents in European and Morrison says the pressure will be on the Norwegian side.
"Nobody will expect us to take anything from it," Morrison added.
"There will be no glory for them in beating us. It will only be shame on them if they don't get the result against us so that will add massive pressure."

MBi Llandudno qualified for Europe for the first time in their history at the end of their first season in the Welsh Premier League.
Alan Morgan's side finished third and qualified automatically for the Europa League after Airbus UK Broughton failed to beat TNS in the Welsh Cup final.
The Seasiders have been handed a tough draw in the first qualifying round, facing Swedish giants IFK Göteborg over two legs.
But manager Morgan is undaunted by the prospect of playing the two-time Uefa Cup winners, with the first leg away from home.
"I've said to the lads they've got to take it all in but we're there to try and go through to the next round," Morgan said.
"I said in May that if we ever had a big team, IFK Göteborg were the team I would like to have.
"They've got history and are a massive club but we're going to give a good account of ourselves and give it a good go."
Although Llandudno will be making their debut, Morgan gained European experience during a spell as player at Rhyl and assistant at Bangor City.
