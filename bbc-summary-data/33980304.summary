A funfair has been ordered to improve supervision on a ride after a six-year-old boy was run over by a ghost train.

Thomas Russon, from Sheffield, suffered serious burns when he became trapped by a carriage at Botton's Pleasure Beach in Skegness last month.
The Health and Safety Executive issued an improvement notice ordering better supervision on the Ghost Train.
Thomas's dad David said he was pleased with the order but disappointed there was no action over the ride itself.
Thomas had to be airlifted from the Skegness resort to Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, after suffering burns and bruising to his abdomen.
His family said he underwent two operations for skin grafts and still needed surgery.
Nobody from the Pleasure Beach spoke to the BBC but managing director James Botton, told the Lincolnshire Echo it was the only incident in the ride's 30 year history.
Mr Russon, from the Beighton area of Sheffield, said: "I'm glad the company has been told to improve supervision for children on the ride but I'm concerned it's not enough.
"I've seen how this has affected Thomas and it has been terrifying for all of us. I would hate for this to happen to someone else."
The family has since instructed legal firm Irwin Mitchell to carry out its own investigation.
A spokeswoman for the HSE said an improvement notice was served to increase supervision on the ride.
The firm has until 1 September to comply with the notice which will be published in full next week.
