[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shaun Ferguson's Renault Scenic collided with a car in which Eileen Lamb was a passenger at Old Hutton, Cumbria in April 2015.
Miss Lamb, from Endmoor, died 12 days later as a result of her injuries.
Ferguson, 22, of Ridge Square, Lancaster, was bailed and will return to Carlisle Crown Court for sentencing on 16 December.
Adjourning the case for background reports Mr Justice Davis told Ferguson he would be sentenced by a different judge.
He said: "There are options open to him that could see you conceivably go to prison."
