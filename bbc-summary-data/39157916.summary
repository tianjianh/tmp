Head of legal services Samantha Gainard had been suspended while the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigated.
The watchdog found no case to answer for misconduct.
The force said Ms Gainard's resignation was effective from Friday.
Chief Constable Mark Collins said: "Although I am saddened to lose a member of the leadership team, I understand her decision to seek fresh and new challenges and I wish her all the very best as she moves forward."
Ms Gainard had worked at the organisation since 2002.
An IPCC spokesman said: "Our independent investigation into the allegations was completed some months ago and we found no case to answer for misconduct."
