[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-Wrexham vicar admits indecent images of children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Wrexham vicar has been told he could face jail after he admitted distributing, making and possessing indecent images of children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Kennett-Orpwood, 59, admitted 11 charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday.
They related to possessing 66 indecent movies and 1,425 images between April 2011 and May 2015.
He was vicar of Bistre in Buckley until he resigned in 1999 when he was cautioned for downloading indecent images of boys.
Both cases were joined and Kennett-Orpwood was placed on the sex offender register, and bailed on the condition he observes a tagged curfew and has no contact with anyone under the age of 16.
He will be sentenced in November.
