The Oscar winner is urging film lovers to help the campaign to raise the final instalment for the £450,000 project.
The National Library of Scotland's moving image archive will move to Glasgow's Kelvin Hall in the autumn.
Film producer Iain Smith, actors Brian Cox, Alan Cumming and Bill Paterson are also backing the campaign.
Mr Scorsese, who set up the World Cinema Foundation, said: "Moving image archives hold our common memory.
"For that reason, we need to care for them, and treasure them. That is our obligation. We owe it to future generations.
"Films shouldn't be locked away and neglected in a vault somewhere. They need to be protected and preserved, but they also need to be seen, studied, and enjoyed.
"I enthusiastically support the efforts to develop the Scottish Moving Image Archive, and I urge you all to support this vitally important initiative."
Scotland's moving image archive is the national collection of amateur and professional films which reflect Scottish life, society, industry and culture from the 1890s to the present day. It holds over 46,000 items in total.
In the autumn it will move from its current home on an industrial estate at Hillington outside Glasgow to a purpose-built facility at the Kelvin Hall.
The central location in Scotland's largest city will make it easier for the public to visit and take advantage of the new facilities for exploring the archive.
The fundraising campaign will help to create improved viewing and learning areas including videowalls to showcase films, a public drop-in area, a curated content area, research space, viewing booths and manuscript consultation space.
There will also be a small cinema to "provide a high quality screening experience".
Visitors to the Kelvin Hall will also be able to access digital content from across the library's 24 million items and explore a permanent exhibition space.
Dr John Scally, National Library of Scotland librarian said: "The move to the Kelvin Hall will provide the perfect showcase for our moving image archive and for our wider digital collections.
"It is important to have such high profile endorsements for the developments we are planning. We will be working hard to raise the funds needed to make this into a memorable destination for visitors."
