The 34-year-old is his country's most capped player with 121 appearances, having made his debut in 2002.
He was part of the Czech side that reached the semi-final at Euro 2004, losing to eventual champions Greece.
"When I was a kid, my ultimate dream was to play for the national team at least once," he told Arsenal's website.
"Having done it so many times makes me really proud."
