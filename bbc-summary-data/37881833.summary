[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greenock Morton stretched their unbeaten league run to six games with a hard-fought win away at Dumbarton.

Jim Duffy's side have now won five of their last six Scottish Championship matches and are third in the table.
It took over an hour before Mark Russell broke the deadlock with a nice strike from the edge of the area.
Kudus Oyenuga added to that shortly after when he rolled home into the bottom corner against the side sitting third from bottom.
Following a drab first half with few chances, former Ton striker Warren Hawke commented in the stands that the half to come was the type "that decide which way your season is going".
And Morton's campaign is now going even better thanks to their team applying themselves in those second 45 minutes.
The promising Russell had been pushed forward from his usual left-back berth and showed great composure as he beat impressive Dumbarton goalkeeper Alan Martin with a low, left-footed strike into the far corner.
Oyenuga's second of the season came after Martin had denied Gary Oliver at the edge of the box.
By doing so, the goalkeeper left himself stranded. Oliver found Englishman Oyenuga with a follow-up pass and he converted it in off the post from 10 yards.
Dumbarton created little, but their afternoon was blighted by injuries to defenders Mark Docherty and Frazer Wright - both had to be helped off the field.
Greenock Morton manager Jim Duffy: "In any division, it's difficult to get a bit of consistency and, in this particular division, every game is extremely difficult.
"After the first half, we said to our players it wasn't a pretty game but a game where you needed to stay focused and see if we could try to nick it. I think we justified the victory.
"Mark Russell's goal was an outstanding goal from a terrific young player. His goal gave us the belief that we could go on and win it.
"We want to get as many points on board as possible just now because we know that further down the line form can fluctuate."
Dumbarton manager Stevie Aitken: "We weren't at it right from the word go.
"This morning, Darren Barr had to pull out because his wee girl is not well. Hopefully everything goes okay there.
"Our two injuries in the space of five minutes turned the game. My main concern now is the fitness of the squad because we're right down to the low numbers.
"Mark Docherty is in a lot of pain and is away to hospital for an x-ray - it seems to be his calf, achilles and ankle area. The doctor's checked it and thinks it's more of a muscular problem
"Frazer Wright's pulled up with his hamstring and calf."
