In March, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced its ambition to succeed Dubai, which will host the five-yearly trade convention in 2020.
But Chancellor Philip Hammond now says concerns over rising costs mean the UK will no longer be bidding to be hosts.
Ashton Moss in Tameside was a possible location for the six-month showcase of technology, manufacturing and culture.
Representatives of 145 countries attended World Expo 2015 in Italy, which boasted 54 national pavilions at a sprawling site in Milan.
Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) said the event would have been worth billions of pounds to the local economy and created thousands of jobs.
Tameside Council leader Kieran Quinn said GMCA was "very disappointed" and has asked to meet Mr Hammond to discuss salvaging the bid.
Mr Quinn said the bid rejection came as "terrible news" and demonstrated a lack of government ambition.
He said: "They are stopping us entering a race, not only which we believe we could win, but we could also change the way the UK is viewed post-Brexit vote. This is the kind of opportunity the country needs.
"I do think if a city further south had come forward they would have looked at it differently."
The treasury said in a statement: "Ministers carefully considered Greater Manchester's proposals but do not believe hosting the World Expo offers good value for money for taxpayers.
"The government is working closely with local leaders to create a Northern Powerhouse and build an economy that works for everyone, and that is why we backed Greater Manchester with Â£1.2bn of additional funding through its devolution deal.
"We are also providing over half a billion pounds for local projects to help create jobs across the north, Â£13bn to improve transport, and we remain as committed as ever to working with those in the north, who know the north best, to unleash its full potential."
