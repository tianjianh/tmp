The Good Food Guide put Port Isaac's Restaurant Nathan Outlaw, named after its owner, just ahead of Cumbria's L'Enclume, ending its winning run.
Traditional favourites such as The Ritz and Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck still feature in the top 50 list.
Outlaw described the news as "phenomenal" and attributed the success to the "hard work of the team".
The 39-year-old chef founded the two Michelin star restaurant in 2007 and first made it on the list in 2009 at number 11.
Good Food Guide editor Elizabeth Carter said: "Nobody seems to leave Nathan Outlaw's staff - they just go and work in another one of his restaurants.
"They obviously think he's a pretty good boss as well as a fine chef."
Despite losing the top slot, Simon Rogan's L'Enclume in Cartmel retained its perfect 10 score.
Pollen Street Social in London, Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottinghamshire and The Fat Duck in Berkshire came in at third, fourth and fifth, each scoring nine.
Stark, a 12-seater restaurant in Broadstairs, Kent, is so pushed for space that it does not have a toilet. Diners can instead pop up the road to the local pub.
Despite its lack of facilities, its chef, Ben Crittenden, has been named "chef to watch" by the Guide.
Peter Sanchez-Iglesias won the chef of the year title for the seasonal cuisine he serves at Casamia in Bristol, which was tenth on the list.
The Good Food Guide, published by Waitrose, started ranking the UK's restaurants in 1951.
Each year it assembles a long-list from thousands of recommendations sent in by the public.
It then sends out inspectors to each of the chosen restaurants, where they assume the guise of regular customers before reporting back on their experience.
