Michael Carrick: Manchester United midfielder says any move would be 'difficult'

Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick says it would be very difficult for him to play anywhere else when he eventually leaves Old Trafford.

The 35-year-old former England international joined United in 2006 and can sign for European clubs from January as his contract ends in June.
Carrick says he is "relaxed" about any uncertainty over his future.
"There are a lot of things to be decided but it would be very difficult to play somewhere else," he said.
United manager Jose Mourinho indicated last month that he wants Carrick - who did not sign his current deal until June this year - to stay for an additional year, although he has not communicated that directly to the player.
Carrick knows the final decision will be determined by whether both he and his manager feel he is making a worthwhile contribution to United's bid for honours.
Wednesday's EFL Cup quarter-final win over his first club West Ham was his ninth appearance of the season. Carrick has started four of the past five games, missing the weekend league draw against the Hammers with a minor calf injury.
With the exception of Wayne Rooney, he is United's longest-serving player. He is 21st on the club's all-time appearance list with 430, meaning he has played more times for the club than David Beckham, Denis Law and Peter Schmeichel.
In recent seasons several of Carrick's long-time team-mates have retired.
Rio Ferdinand joined QPR for a year after he left United in 2014, while Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs ended their playing careers without signing for anyone else.
"Everyone is different," said Carrick.
"You can't beat that buzz of winning a big game. That is what I am here for."
