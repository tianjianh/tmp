The Steelmen forced the play in the first half but were limited to Scott McDonald's shot over the bar and blocked near-post effort.
Faissal El Bakhtaoui offered Dundee's best chance of making the breakthrough.
He had a shot saved by Craig Samson in the first half and was later denied when the keeper punched clear.
Motherwell will be the more disappointed by the first goalless draw between the teams in 30 years, having been the more dominant outfit.
They started in a lively manner, with their front three of McDonald, Marvin Johnson and Lionel Ainsworth not giving the visitors' defence - which included new signing Kevin Gomis - time to settle.
The prompting of the midfielders behind them ensured they dominated the first 20 minutes. Craig Clay had a couple of strikes blocked, one which almost ruined the good looks of Darren O'Dea as he used his face to prevent the ball hitting the target.
Full-back Joe Chalmers was also keen to push forward for the home side and he hooked an effort wide from six yards with his left foot.
Despite 'Well's dominance it was Dundee who came close to opening the scoring with their first real attack when El Bakhtaoui got in behind the defence.
He let rip with his right foot only to see Samson parry at his near post, and the striker's follow-up effort was charged down by advancing home defenders.
After McDonald hit a 25-yarder over the top, Chris Cadden unselfishly tried to set up the Australian striker when he latched on to a Ben Heneghan pass inside the box when it looked more appropriate to have a strike at goal himself.
Cadden, who is expected to be called up to the Scotland Under-21 squad for their European Championship qualifiers against Macedonia and Ukraine next week after initially being overlooked, was once again impressive with his positive runs from midfield.
Having scored three goals already this term, the 19-year-old was looking to add to his tally. But for the intervention of O'Dea he would have converted an Ainsworth driven cross from the left.
Paul Hartley switched Michael Duffy from left to the right of midfield at the start of the second half and it almost paid off.
Within the first few minutes of the restart the Celtic loanee created two good opportunities for himself at the edge of the box - one was deflected wide, the other failed to threaten Samson.
But on the hour mark, Duffy blasted a long-range effort just wide of a post with the Motherwell keeper looking relieved.
McDonald and Ainsworth both had shots from just outside the penalty area well saved by Scott Bain.
On-field rivals McDonald and O'Dea - friends from their days as Celtic team-mates - were going for dinner with their families after the match. If the winner was paying, then on this occasion they may have to go Dutch.
Motherwell manager Mark McGhee: "I think we could have won, but I can't tell you we should have won.
"In the first half we got into some great positions but didn't create clear-cut chances.
"I'm satisfied we got a point and it was important we didn't lose another home game going into this break.
"I don't want to be going away with the international team and spend the whole week being distracted by what's going on back here."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "I was pleased, especially in the second half.
"We were more on the front foot, we created good chances, good situations but still a bit wasteful picking the right pass but I'm really happy with the clean sheet.
"We had a new centre-half [Gomis] and I thought he was absolutely outstanding.
"We need to to get one or two players in. We are working really hard to try to strengthen the group."
