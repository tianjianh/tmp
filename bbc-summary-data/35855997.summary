Police said a man entered the store in Fagley and kicked open a security door to get behind the counter.
During a scuffle, the shopkeeper tried to defend himself with a baseball bat and was stabbed with a pocket knife.
The suspect, said to be aged between 20 and 25, left the store on Fagley Road empty-handed. Police said the victim was left "badly traumatised".
The 48-year-old shopkeeper received several cuts to the head in the incident which took place at about 20:00 GMT on Wednesday, and was taken to hospital.
Det Insp Paula Bickerdike, of West Yorkshire Police, described it as "particularly nasty and violent attack which left the victim with a number of injuries to his head and face".
"It could very easily have resulted in more serious injuries to the victim and we urgently need to identify the person responsible," she said.
