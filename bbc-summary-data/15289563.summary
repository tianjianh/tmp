South Korea country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Korea has developed into one of Asia's most affluent countries since partition in 1948. The Communist North has slipped into totalitarianism and poverty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The republic was proclaimed in 1948 and received UN-backed support from the US after it was invaded by the North two years later.
The Korean War ended in 1953 without a peace agreement, leaving South Korea technically at war for more than fifty years.
The following four decades were marked by authoritarian rule, during which government-sponsored schemes encouraged the growth of family-owned industrial conglomerates, including the Hyundai and Samsung groups.
They helped transform South Korea into one of the world's major economies and a leading exporter of cars and electronic goods.
The US has tens of thousands of soldiers in the country.

President: Park Geun-hye
South Korea elected its first female president, Park Geun-hye, in a close-run contest in December 2012.
Her father President Park Chung-hee, ruled the country for 18 years after seizing power in a coup.
In 1974, at the age of 22, Ms Park became South Korea's first lady when her mother was shot dead by a North Korean assassin's bullet intended for her husband.
In December 2016, parliament voted to impeach Ms Park, stripping away her executive powers, over a corruption and influence-peddling scandal.
Though powerless, she retains the title of president until South Korea's Constitutional Court rules on whether to uphold the motion.
Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has been appointed as acting president.
Acting president: Hwang Kyo-ahn
Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn was appointed interim president in December 2016 after parliament voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye.
On assuming the post of acting president, Mr Hwang apologised and said he felt a "deep responsibility" over the political scandal that brought down Ms Park.
He urged ruling and opposition parties to cooperate in order to bring back political stability.
A Park loyalist, he served as justice minister in her administration before becoming prime minister in June 2015.
He is expected to focus on maintaining a stable national security posture, particularly amid prolonged tension with North Korea.
South Korea is at the leading edge of the digital revolution. It is a trailblazer for high-speed and wireless internet.
Around 45 million South Koreans - out of a population of almost 49 million - were online by 2014 (InternetWorldStats).
South Korean TV soaps are popular across the region, including in China. They are part of the "Korean Wave" - the export of South Korean popular culture across Asia.
