It's finally happened.

The much-heralded "world's highest and longest" glass-bottomed bridge has opened to visitors in central China.
It connects two mountain cliffs in what are known as the Avatar mountains (the film was shot here) in Zhangjiajie, Hunan province.
Completed in December, the 430m-long bridge cost $3.4m (Â£2.6m) to build and stands 300m above ground, state news agency Xinhua reported.
It has been paved with 99 panes of three-layered transparent glass.
And according to officials, the 6m-wide bridge - designed by Israeli architect Haim Dotan - has already set world records for its architecture and construction.
Glass bridges in China have been a popular craze for the daring photo opportunities they provide. Events like mass yoga displays and even weddings have been staged on several such bridges.
One couple celebrated their special day by dangling in mid-air from a bridge in Pingjiang, also located in Hunan province.
This was the question on everyone's minds as the city geared up for the bridge's official opening.
But officials have staged high-profile events to try and reassure the public of the bridge's safety.
Officials sent in sledgehammers and even drove a car, filled with passengers, across the bridge earlier this year.
The BBC's Dan Simmons was invited to take a bash at the bridge.
Park officials have said a maximum of 8,000 visitors will be allowed on the bridge each day.
So those wanting to add another thrill to their bucket list are strongly encouraged to book their slots in advance.
