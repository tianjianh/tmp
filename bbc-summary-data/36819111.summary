Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, set off to climb Fansipan mountain alone on 3 June.
He died after slipping down a waterfall. His body was found six days later.
Family and friends from across the world attended his funeral in Norfolk on Friday.
Writing on Facebook, his father Trever Webb said the service was "the most beautiful, but the most tragically sad day in our entire life. Nothing will replace our Aiden".
He described him as "the best son and friend we will ever have".
The Anglian Ruskin University graduate was an experienced climber and planned to conquer the 3,100m (10,300ft) high mountain in one day.
At some point, he was forced off the main mountain trail by a landslide.
He injured himself falling down a ravine, but managed to contact his girlfriend Bluebell Baughan by phone, who was in the nearby town of Sapa and raised the alarm.
He then fell down a 18m (60ft) waterfall and was killed on impact.
After extensive searches his body was discovered by rangers on 9 June.
Friends also paid tribute to the climber, with one saying: "One last goodbye, but the legend will never die."
Another said: "The sun was shining, there were drinks drunk and memories shared. What a beautiful send-off for a beautiful person."
Another said: "Today was filled with tears, songs, laughter, unspeakable grief and memories. Above all though it was filled with love. You created so much love among so many people."
Tributes were also paid to his girlfriend Miss Baughan, 24, from White Notley, Essex, who was described as "the most courageous girl".
Mr Webb's parents are planning to return to Vietnam in December, having said the only way they could "proceed" was by returning to the country to thank those who had helped bring their son home.
