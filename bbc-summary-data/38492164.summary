Reading striker Yann Kermorgant admitted "sticking to the plan" was key to their late win at Bristol City.

Kermorgant scored twice in seven minutes as Reading won a third successive Championship match after coming back from 2-0 down.
"It wasn't the best of starts, but we kept on going right to the end," the Frenchman told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"We know how we want to play and we've got the plan that we stick to and we all believe that can get us something."
Kermorgant, 35, has scored seven Championship goals so far this season for third-placed Reading and took his tally to three from two games over the Christmas and New Year period with his brace at Ashton Gate.
"Our approach didn't work out for us in the first half and after falling 2-0 behind," the former Charlton and Bournemouth striker added.
"But, after Bristol City started dropping back and giving us more time on the ball, I think we spent pretty much the rest of the game 35 yards out from their goal.
"Once we got the first goal, it then became a complete scramble in their half. At 2-2, most people would be happy to hold on to a point, but we knew we could push on for the win and so it proved."
