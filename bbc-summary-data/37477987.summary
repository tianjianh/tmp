[SN]TITLE[SN]
Girls as young as 12 'raped and abused' in Bristol

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Girls as young as 12 were repeatedly raped, sexually abused and trafficked for sex, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A number of the alleged offences against the seven victims happened in Bristol in 2011 and 2012.
Seven men have gone on trial at Bristol Crown Court, accused of a total of 45 offences, including rape, sexual assault, rape of child under 13 and false imprisonment.
All the accused deny the charges.
The jury was told some of the victims were allegedly given drugs and alcohol, and that the girls travelled by train to meet the men.
On one occasion in March 2013, a 15-year-old girl was allegedly simultaneously raped by two men at a flat in Bristol.
The jury also heard a 12-year-old girl was raped, leaving her feeling "dirty" and "regretful".
The court heard that one girl kept a diary of her trips to the city, in which she wrote coded messages about sex and sex acts she had carried out.
One teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court she felt "pressurised" into having sex with six of the men and that she believed it was "expected" of her.
The trial, which began earlier this month but can only now be reported after reporting restrictions were lifted by the judge, was adjourned until Thursday.
The defendants are:
