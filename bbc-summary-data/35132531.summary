The woman described how she told a detective about what happened but no action was taken.
Asked by prosecutor Michelle Colborne QC how she found the detective she told the jury: "He used to come to houses where we were.
"He used to have sex with girls and he used to take drugs from people and pass them on to Ash."
The court has heard that two of the seven defendants - Arshid Hussain and Qurban Ali - were known as Mad Ash and Blind Ash respectively.
The witness did not clarify which one she was referring to.
Asked when this happened, the witness said: "It was while I was still in care."
She added: "I told him what was happening. He wrote it down in his book."
The woman, who is now 36, also told the jury no-one helped her when she was living in children's homes.
The witness replied "No" when Ms Colborne asked if there was "any one person in any of the care homes you felt you could trust?"
The woman claimed that staff at the home were only concerned about "sitting at the end of the night and writing reports up - that was it".
