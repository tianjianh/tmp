A bill to tackle online abuse and cyber crime is being introduced by Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts.

It aims to make it an offence to post content that is discriminatory, threatening and causes distress.
Internet service providers and social media firms would be forced to remove offensive material.
The 10-minute rule bill being presented on Wednesday would need UK government support but has already secured cross-party backing.
It would combine measures against digital crime from about 30 different existing laws and aims to update regulations covering online surveillance, monitoring and abusive digital content.
"The existing laws are fragmented and inadequate and must be made fit for purpose without delay," Ms Saville Roberts said.
Business leaders have called cyber crime one of the biggest threats facing firms, after an attack on TalkTalk in 2015.
