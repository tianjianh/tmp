A man from East Dunbartonshire has been jailed for two years after pleading guilty to a £50,000 VAT fraud.

Robert Gray, 60, from Bearsden, submitted a string of false VAT returns to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) between October 2011 and August 2013.

Gray was caught following an investigation by HMRC.
