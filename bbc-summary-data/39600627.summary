Characters, including John the Baptist, will adopt the language for one of the biggest community theatre productions in the city this year.
The traditional Passion play will also be narrated by a woman - Mary, the mother of Jesus - for the first time.
The performance is due to take place in Princes Street Gardens from 14:00 on Saturday.
Director Suzanne Lofthus said the crew was always looking for new ways to tell the Easter story that enabled more people to connect with it.
She said: "Having a woman's take on the story brings a fresh perspective. Because of how things were in the society of the time, women aren't mentioned very much in traditional presentations of the story, but they were there and witnessed everything."
She added: "People might be a bit surprised at first when they hear John the Baptist speaking in the mother tongue, but we want to communicate the fact that the people in the Bible story were ordinary men and women, just like us."
The play, staged this year by a cast of nearly 40 people, is supported by a professional director, stage manager and professional actor Duncan Rennie, who stars as Jesus.
Cast members ranges in age from students to retired people, and come from all walks of life, say organisers.
The performance is free and un-ticketed.
