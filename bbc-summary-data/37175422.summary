The 21-year-old was released by the Hornets in the summer, having never made a first-team appearance for them.
He has had six separate loan spells, including three at Crewe, and scored 12 goals in 79 matches.
"After having loans at a number of northern clubs, it's good to be at Cambridge United which is closer to home," said London-born Ikpeazu.
