The US were beaten 16½-11½ at Gleneagles in September, their sixth defeat in the last seven contests.
Former captains Raymond Floyd, Tom Lehman and Davis Love are also on the 11-man panel, which will explore areas including captain and player selection.
However, Paul Azinger, who captained the US to their last victory in 2008, chose not to be part of the group.
"I'm not ready to jump on a task force," Azinger, 54, told ESPN.
"I have a scheduled meeting with the PGA of America in early November and I just think it's too soon for me to commit to jumping on a task force."
Azinger did not elaborate on the subject of next month's meeting but, speaking in the aftermath of the latest defeat, he did not rule out returning to the captaincy at Hazeltine in 2016.
In a media conference held immediately after the conclusion of the loss at Gleneagles, Mickelson appeared to criticise captain Tom Watson by stating his support for Azinger's winning formula at Valhalla in 2008.
Jim Furyk, the world number four, and world number 10 Rickie Fowler, who both played at Gleneagles, are also included in the group, along with veteran tour player Steve Stricker, PGA vice-president Derek Sprague, PGA chief executive officer Pete Bevacqua and PGA secretary Paul Levy.
Also debated will be the qualifying system, the dates by which the team is determined and the timing of wildcard selections.
Woods, who has not played in a tournament since August because of injury and asked not to be considered for a wildcard place at Gleneagles, said: "I think this is a great step by the PGA to accomplish what we all want - to win the Ryder Cup.
"The Ryder Cup is very important to every player who has the honour to represent his country. I'm excited to be part of this group."
