UK fugitives: Eight wanted men sought in Netherlands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some of the UK's most wanted men thought to be on the run in the Netherlands have been named by the National Crime Agency (NCA).

The fugitives include Robert Gerrard, 50, and Michael Moogan, 28 from Liverpool, wanted for allegedly importing "huge quantities" of drugs.
They are believed to be linked to a Rotterdam cafe raided as part of a European investigation.
Police believe it was a front for drug traffickers arranging transportation.

"Is it because of the pubs?"
The Dutch cameraman I'm working with was curious as to why so many British suspects seek sanctuary in the Netherlands. And it is partly the culture.
Cities like Amsterdam and The Hague have large expat communities. An estimated 41,000 people from the UK live and work in this largely English-speaking society. So it is relatively easy for the British fugitives to blend in.
"But we don't want them," the Dutch National Police Commissioner Marjolein Smit-Arnold Bik tells me.
"They carry firearms, mostly for protection but we don't know how they will use them."
For the British crime-fighters, it is a case of gone but not forgotten.
Hank Cole, head of International Operations at the NCA, said many of these men use the Netherlands as a springboard to access the UK from inside a country with established drug networks.
A third man from Liverpool, Mark Fitzgibbon, 42, is wanted for supplying, processing and transporting drugs.
Officers seized 84kg of cannabis and 58kg of amphetamine at an address in Liverpool in September 2004.
Hank Cole, head of operations for the NCA, said that along with their partners they would "continue to pursue fugitives relentlessly".
Mr Cole said: "Many believe they can use the Netherlands as a base to continue their illegal activities, which still have an impact on the UK, but they are finding out that it is not a safe haven."
He said last year 20 fugitives were captured in the Netherlands and brought back to the UK.
The other wanted men include:
Operation Return involves the NCA, Crimestoppers UK, and Bel M (Dutch Crimestoppers) and Netherlands law enforcement agencies.
It follows the success of Operation Captura in Spain and Operation Zygos in Cyprus, where 65 out of 85 fugitives have been arrested.
