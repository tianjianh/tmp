Moray Council schools moratorium fall-out continues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The fall-out from a moratorium on the closure of schools in Moray has continued with the collapse of a cross-party group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors agreed the five-year moratorium on the closure of schools earlier this week.
Council leader Allan Wright announced his resignation as he said the result of the controversial vote made his position untenable.
Now a group looking at key challenges facing the council has collapsed.
