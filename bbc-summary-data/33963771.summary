[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jedburgh Town Hall lease proposal dropped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Borders Council has dropped plans to lease Jedburgh Town Hall to a local leisure trust.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposal emerged last year with the authority struggling to maintain the building due to spending constraints.
A report to the council said that opinion in the town remained divided over the plan to lease the site to the Jedburgh Leisure Facilities Trust.
It is now being advised to transfer the site to a proposed regional Culture Trust instead.
In February last year the authority delegated power to officers to grant the lease to the JLFT.
However, concerns over the business case, public consultation and differences of opinion of the appropriateness of the project have since emerged.
In light of that, the council has now decided to drop that plan.
Instead, it is being recommended that it considers transferring the building to a new Culture Trust which is due to be discussed later this year.
That could see libraries, museums and community centres moved to a charitable trust.
It is proposed that the town hall could be part of that project.
