The BBC has been told Devon and Cornwall Police and Devon social services are involved in the inquiry, said to be "at an early stage".
The academy said it wanted the concerns to be thoroughly investigated, but the school would continue to operate normally in the meantime.
The nature of the allegations that prompted the inquiry is not clear.
Letters have been sent to parents and those students over the age of 18, informing them of the investigation.
The academy is a charity and has a history dating back almost 200 years, with an international reputation. Its website says it currently has 76 students aged between four and 24.
Jonathan Farnhill, chief executive and principal, said: "We want these concerns to be investigated objectively and fairly and the academy will be working with Devon County Council and other appropriate authorities to review our practice.
"If, as part of this process, areas for improvement are identified then we will move swiftly to take any action needed to ensure the support and care we give our students is of the highest standard."
A spokesman for Devon County Council said: "It's important that any allegations are looked into sensitively and carefully. The council is working closely with the Police and the academy's chief executive about the investigation."
