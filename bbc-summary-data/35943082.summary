The 25-year-old will join the Welsh Pro12 side following the end of the Super Rugby season this autumn.
"Willis is a player we have been aware of for some time who is having a strong Super Rugby season with Hurricanes," said Blues head coach Danny Wilson.
Halaholo will join Steven Shingler, Nick Williams and Wales pair Matthew Morgan and Rhys Gill next season.
Cardiff describe the Auckland-born man - who has also represented Southland in New Zealand - as a powerful and creative centre who will add "even more attacking edge and depth to the squad."
"We are excited about what he will bring to the Cardiff Blues when he joins us later this year," added Wilson.
"Willis is a creative presence at centre and...alongside the likes of Rey Lee-Lo and Matthew Morgan, will add even more attacking threat to our game.
"He is also strong defensively and is only going to get better the more he plays. He has learnt from the likes of Conrad Smith and Ma'a Nono in recent years, so is a player who is developing fast.
"I know Willis is excited about the challenge of playing Northern Hemisphere rugby and we look forward to welcoming him later this year once he has completed his commitments in New Zealand."
Halaholo will compete with Gavin Evans, Samoa international Rey Lee-Lo and Wales squad player Cory Allen at the Blues next year.
"The opportunity to join a club like Cardiff Blues, who play at a venue with such a rich history, was very appealing," said Halaholo.
"The timing was very good for me and my family and the chance to play rugby in another part of the world and experience some true Welsh culture is also exciting."
