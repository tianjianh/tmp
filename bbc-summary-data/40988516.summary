Team Sky were nine seconds off the pace, with Quick-Step Floors and Team Sunweb both six seconds behind BMC.
Britain's Froome is aiming to become only the third man to win the Vuelta in the same year as the Tour de France.
The Vuelta stays in France for Sunday's second stage, a 203.4km route from Nimes to Gruissan.
BMC Racing's Australian rider Rohan Dennis is the current race leader and will wear the red jersey, after crossing the line first ahead of his team-mates.
While Froome himself is down in 18th place, he is only nine seconds behind Dennis overall.
Three-time winner Alberto Contador, of Spain, who is retiring from professional cycling after the race, is 16 seconds adrift for Trek Segafredo.
