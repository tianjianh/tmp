Morale in Leyton Orient's squad is high despite their poor start to the season, says midfielder Michael Collins.

Orient are in the League Two relegation zone having won one of their last nine games and some fans have called for president Francesco Becchetti to quit.
But Collins told BBC Radio London: "It certainly doesn't seem like a place that's down. Training has been positive and the lads have been positive."
Collins, 30, made his debut in Saturday's 2-0 home defeat by Crewe.
He joined the O's on a three-month contract last week, having been a free agent since leaving Indian side Bengaluru earlier this year.
And the former Huddersfield, Scunthorpe and York midfielder believes his new side can climb away from danger.
"There have been some disappointing results but I don't think it would take much to turn it around," he said.
"I've been in sides before where you know there are problems and I don't sense that here. Sometimes in football you just need a bit of luck and over the coming weeks hopefully we'll get that.
"Nobody is shirking and nobody is hiding."
