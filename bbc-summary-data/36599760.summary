[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Miller, 56, died at his house in Patterdale Walk, Boothville, Northampton, on Tuesday 14 June.
Forensic investigations are still taking place at the scene and a guard is in place, police have said.
In a short statement, his family said he would be sadly missed and was "a much-loved brother; he was permanently a very kind and loving person."
Four people charged with his murder appeared at Northampton Crown Court on Friday.
Joseph Catlin, 30, Michael Hallett, 37, Ian Cuthbertson, 49, and Zena Kane, 35, all of no fixed address, will next appear in court in September.
Police said a 39-year-old woman, arrested on suspicion of murder, and a 19-year-old man and 27-year-old woman, arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, remain on bail.
Det Insp Phil Mills, in charge of the inquiry, said he still wanted anyone with information to come forward despite the arrests and charges.
He said: "We are still keen to speak to anyone who was in the area of Patterdale Walk or Oasis House in Campbell Street between Friday evening and Monday."
