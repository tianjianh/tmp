[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors loose-head prop Gordon Reid has been called into the Scotland squad to face Japan in the second Test in Tokyo on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reid, 29, replaces Alasdair Dickinson, who damaged a hamstring in the opening minutes of Scotland's 26-13 victory in Toyota City.
Dickinson, 32, will fly home and Reid is due to arrive in Tokyo on Monday.
Capped 17 times, Reid was initially left out despite featuring in the 2015 World Cup and this year's Six Nations.
He lost his place as Dickinson's understudy to Edinburgh's Rory Sutherland.
Sutherland is expected to make his first international start on Saturday having won his two previous caps as a substitute - against Ireland in the Six Nations and Japan on Saturday.

Scotland have other injury worries, with WP Nel, their first-choice tight-head, nursing a knee injury, as is back-row forward Ryan Wilson.
Centre Duncan Taylor has a hamstring problem and flanker John Barclay has a damaged shoulder.
All four are being assessed by Scottish Rugby, but Nel expects to play in the second Test.
"I should be okay for next week," said the prop, who scored his second Test try on Saturday.
"I don't go into games looking to score a try. But, if it happens, it happens.
"It is good to get over the line."
