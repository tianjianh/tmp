Tees Barrage dams during 'fish belly' gates overhaul

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Temporary dams are being installed on the Tees Barrage as part of a Â£100,000 maintenance programme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Once a 100-tonne crane has lowered them into place the barrage will be drained so engineers can inspect its four massive "fish belly" gates.
Workers from the Canal and River Trust will then carry out necessary repairs.
When construction began 20 years ago, Stockton's Tees Barrage was considered the largest civil engineering project in the UK.
It opened in 1995 and as well as controlling the flow of the river and preventing flooding it is also used for leisure activities including water-skiing, windsurfing and white water rafting.
A public open day for people to find out more about the works will be held on 22 August.
