Kyle McVey's superb 11th-minute volley put Carrick ahead only for Sammy Morrow to level the tie a minute later.
Steven McCullough's deflected free-kick restored Carrick's lead before half-time and two second-half Declan 'Fabio' O'Brien goals sealed their victory.
O'Brien's second came from a penalty after Mark Scoltock's red card.
It was Institute's fourth successive defeat in the end-of-season play-off.
McVey hammered Carrick ahead with a magnificent left-foot volley from the edge of the area but Michael McCrudden set up Morrow to level with a close-range finish within a minute.
Carrick were ahead again on 25 minutes as McCullough's free-kick clipped Institute's defensive wall and looped past keeper Marty Gallagher.
Rangers keeper Brian Neeson kept his side ahead with a superb stop to deny Niall Grace just before the interval.
Grace went close again as he headed just over the crossbar following the resumption but as Carrick began to take control, McCullough clipped the Institute woodwork before O'Brien cut inside from the left touchline and unleashed a delightful curling shot past Gallagher from 25 yards on 72 minutes.
The game was up for Stute six minutes from time when O'Brien cheekily chipped a penalty to the net after Scoltock had been sent off for hauling down the Dubliner.
