[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ministers could intervene in Crofting Commission row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish government ministers have the power to intervene in the affairs of the troubled Crofting Commission, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last month, the board of crofting's regulatory body apologised for its handling of a dispute with crofters and asked its convener to resign.
Colin Kennedy has told BBC Scotland that he has no plans to resign.
Ms Sturgeon said ministers would not ordinarily get involved in the internal operations of the commission.
However, during First Minister's Questions in Holyrood on Thursday, she said legislation does give ministers the power to intervene if required.
The commission has been embroiled in a public dispute about the running of common grazings, including at Mangersta and Upper Coll on Lewis.
Board members made a public apology at a meeting in Brora, Sutherland, on 28 September, and asked that its convener stand down. Mr Kennedy had earlier walked out of the meeting.
Shetland Lib Dem MSP Tavish Scott raised the dispute during FMQs.
Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: "The resources in dealing with these issues by the commission would, in my view, be far better used in being an effective regulator in crofting.
"I note that crofting commissioners have unanimously called for the convener to resign. The Scottish government has requested further information from the convener in relation to last week's events.
"Although the government would not ordinarily intervene in the internal operations of an independent statutory body the legislation does give Scottish ministers power to if required."
Mr Kennedy told BBC Scotland that he had no plans to stand down. He declined to comment further.
