[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Christmas lights switch-on show in Bradford has been cancelled due to poor weather conditions.

The event, in City Park, was due to feature street theatre, an aerobatic display, live music and fireworks and begin at 16:45 GMT on Saturday.
The council said the show's producer felt the event could not be delivered "safely" in such difficult conditions.
A band of heavy rain is forecast for much of northern England on Saturday evening.
The city's Christmas lights will still be lit from tonight, the council added.
