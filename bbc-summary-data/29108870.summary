A 50-year-old British man has been killed in a shark attack off a beach in Byron Bay, the most easterly point on the Australian mainland, officials say.

Paul Wilcox, originally from Warwickshire, sustained severe injuries on his right leg at the popular tourist destination in New South Wales.
A swimmer brought him in to the beach but he was pronounced dead.
Beaches in the area have been closed for 24 hours and people have been warned to stay out of the water.
Mr Wilcox, a British information technology specialist, had been living in Australia for more than 10 years.
"At 10:45 police and paramedics were called to Main Beach after reports of a shark attack," New South Wales police said in their initial statement.
"He was in the water when he was bitten.  He was seen floating in shallow water, close to the shore line, and dragged onto the beach. An ambulance was called and he was pronounced dead a short time later," the statement said.
Police said Mr Wilcox's wife was watching from the shore, ABC reported.
Witness Mark Hickey said he tried to help.
"I saw what looked like seaweed but it was blood in the water," he said. "I didn't know it was a person but when I realised, I ran out and waded to the bank and grabbed him and did CPR but it was too late."
He told local media he saw a "six or seven foot" shark in the water.
Rescue organisation Surf Lifesaving Australia said the beach was not supervised at the time of the attack as it had occurred a week before seasonal duties.
"At the council's request, lifeguards will be on duty for at least the next 24 hours ensuring the water remains clear," it said in a statement.

There have been several shark attacks off Australia's beaches in recent years.
In April, a woman was killed as she swam off Tathra beach, also in New South Wales.
The Western Australia government, meanwhile, has ordered a cull of sharks, following at least six fatal attacks off the state's beaches in three years.
Baited hooks have been installed off Perth's popular beaches. Any shark more than three metres long - which could include Great White, Tiger and Bull sharks - will be shot.
The controversial move prompted thousands of people to take part in protests against the culls.
