Australia has detained a US anti-abortion campaigner for attempting to enter the country without a valid visa.

Troy Newman's visa was revoked on Tuesday, with ministers saying his presence could incite violence against abortion doctors and women using them.
Mr Newman had been stopped in Denver in the US after his visa was cancelled. However, he subsequently managed to board another flight to Melbourne.
He had been due to speak at events run by the group Right to Life Australia.
"Since Mr Newman does not hold a visa, he is unable to enter Australia and remains in the presence of Australian Border Force officials at the Melbourne Airport pending his removal," said a spokeswoman for the Australian minister for immigration, Peter Dutton.
Mr Newman has previously called for the execution of abortion doctors and has said women who have abortions are murderers.
He has said he will take legal action to stop the government from deporting him.
In a posting on Facebook ahead of his arrival in Melbourne, he said the decision to revoke his visa "was based on a pile of lies, including the idea that I promote violence."
"My 25-year history of peaceful, prayerful action speaks for itself," he said. "Please pray that we can get past immigration so the truth can be told throughout Australia."
Australian officials say that the airline which carried him into the country, reported by local media to be United Airlines, now faces a fine for transporting a traveller without a valid visa.
Earlier this week, Australian Labor MP Terri Butler wrote to Australia's Mr Dutton to ask that Mr Newman's visa be denied, calling him an "anti-choice extremist".
Mr Dutton then confirmed to local media that he cancelled the visa amid concerns Mr Newman's presence could incite violence against abortion doctors and the women using them.
But the website for Mr Newman's organisation, Operation Rescue, insisted that "Newman has never advocated violence and in fact, urges pro-life activists to work within the governmental and legal system to accomplish change".
The visa decision came days after the government said it was unlikely American singer Chris Brown would be given a visa because of his record of domestic violence.
