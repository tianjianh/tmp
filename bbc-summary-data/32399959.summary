The Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation (SSPO) said more than 160,000 tonnes were produced for more than 65 countries in 2014.
The USA remained the top export destination, with sales growing to almost £215m.
It was followed by France, which saw sales grow by 55% in volume to reach £110m.
Exports to China reached almost £65m, with an extra 40% in volume last year.
SSPO chief executive Scott Landsburgh said: "We are delighted with the reception Scottish salmon receives at home and abroad, and these latest figures prove how demand continues to go from strength to strength.
"We use the strictest production standards to produce the highest quality salmon which is why Scottish salmon was awarded 'best farmed salmon in the world' by an independent poll of international seafood buyers for the second consecutive time last year.
"This accolade is a testament to our dedicated salmon farmers and is obviously great news for rural communities where we farm and the wider Scottish economy, which continues to benefit from jobs, significant capital investment and ongoing community support provided by our industry."
The figures were released as Scotland's salmon farmers headed out to the Seafood Global Expo, the world's largest seafood exhibition, in Brussels.
Scottish Sea Farms, The Scottish Salmon Company, Marine Harvest Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture Scotland, Wester Ross Salmon, Loch Duart Salmon and Scottish Quality Salmon are all attending the seafood show, which runs until Thursday.
