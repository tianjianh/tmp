The M8 westbound was closed for five hours at Newhouse in North Lanarkshire because of a jackknifed lorry, which also caused a diesel spillage.
The M77/A77 has reopened northbound at junction 8 Kilmaurs in East Ayrshire following an accident at 06:00.
There was snow in the Inverness area and roads around Fort William and Glencoe were very icy.
Head of network operations at Transport Scotland, Hugh Gillies, told BBC Radio Scotland some incidents had lasted for longer than they would have liked, and he urged drivers to remain cautious as the icy conditions continued.
He added: "There can be no complacency. It has been a difficult couple of days with the weather.
"Speaking to Met Office colleagues the forecast for the next three to four days remains challenging, so vigilance remains the case."
The Met Office has issued amber "be prepared" severe weather warnings for Central, Tayside and Fife, south west Scotland and Lothian and Borders for Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.
A yellow "be aware" warning is in place for the Strathclyde area.
Five schools in the Highland Council area are closed, according to the local authority's website.
In Aberdeenshire, the council warned that there had been some changes to school transport because of the weather, with some school buses not running.
In Glasgow, the Clydeside Expressway was closed westbound - leaving the city - at Finnieston due to an accident, but is now open.
Police said a car skidded on the ice and hit the barrier shortly after 06:00.

The M8 in North Lanarkshire was closed westbound at junction six from 04:30 until 09:30 causing long delays.
Northern Constabulary said the B9007 Ferness to Carrbridge road was closed at the snow gates.
The A9 Causeway Mire had also been affected by snow. Many side roads in the Caithness area are also affected by lying snow.
Drifting snow was making driving difficult on the A836 Tongue to Lairg road between Altnahara and Crask.
All other routes were open and passable with care.
Grampian Police said several routes were affected.
A number of minor routes in the Formartine and Buchan area had lying snow, as did the A920 Huntly to Dufftown road near Dufftown, the A939 Ballater to Corgarff stretch between Ballater and Gairnshiel, and the A939 Cockbridge to Tomintoul road from Corgarff to the Lecht Ski Centre.
Police said: "If travelling, drivers are advised to allow extra time for their journey and to ensure that both they and their vehicle are suitably equipped and prepared for changeable wintry weather, to exercise caution and drive according to the prevailing weather and road conditions."
In Dumfries and Galloway, the freeze caused a spate of accidents with at least eight vehicles involved.
The accidents were spread across the region from the A76 at Auldgirth to the A75 at Crocketford.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said: "We have seen a few incidents that have caused some disruption. That is why the Multi Agency Response Team and SGoRR remain operational.
"Our operating companies have also worked through the night, with over 120 gritters out on the trunk roads and motorways to treat every route at least once.
"We are all working hard to keep Scotland moving and get back to normal where disruption does occur, particularly in the north west where conditions are the most difficult.
"We urge the public to continue to exercise care; plan your journey, listen to police advice and check available travel updates."
