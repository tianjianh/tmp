[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Pack of animals' chased vulnerable man Ivor Miller

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight people who chased a vulnerable man until he threw himself out of a flat window in Glasgow have been called a "a pack of animals" by a judge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ivor Miller, 27, who has learning difficulties, was chased by the group after one member called him "a beast".
The 27-year-old sought refuge in a derelict flat and jumped out a second floor window suffering severe injury.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Norman Ritchie QC ordered a 17-year-old man to be detained for six months.
The judge told the eight accused: "This whole incident, some of which was captured on CCTV, is extremely disturbing.
"The group, like a pack of animals, turned on an entirely innocent young man for no good reason other than he behaved differently because he has learning difficulties."
Three of those who pursued Mr Miller were originally charged with attempted murder.
Michael Clare, 21, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, and two 17-year-old youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had their guilty pleas to charges of assault accepted.
All three admitted attacking Mr Miller by chasing him into the common close at 52 Howard Street, Glasgow, on 4 August last year.
All three, and another 17-year-old youth, a 16-year-old girl, a 16-year-old youth and 23-year-old David Newlands, from Maryhill, Glasgow, admitted committing a breach of the peace and placing Mr Miller in a state of fear and alarm.
Newlands also pleaded guilty to punching Mr Miller on the head in the Hootenanny pub in Howard Street.
Jade Park, 19, from Glasgow, who sparked the incident by falsely calling Mr Miller "a beast" admitted punching him in Jamaica Street and in the Crystal Palace pub.
Judge Ritchie sentenced a 17-year-old male to six months detention for assault.
He deferred sentence on Park, who is about to give birth, until June for good behaviour and imposed a community payback order on all the others and ordered then to perform 150 hours unpaid work in the community.
