Hernandez had been out since November with a groin injury but scored within 15 minutes of coming off the bench.
Josh Tymon added a second as new Hull boss Marco Silva enjoyed a debut win.
For Swansea manager Paul Clement - also taking charge of his team for the first time - defeat is a reminder of the hard work that lies ahead.
With both of these teams languishing inside the Premier League relegation zone, this competition was low down the list of priorities for both new managers.
But a first win since November will be warmly welcomed by Tigers fans, who will also take heart from a first clean sheet in 23 games.
With some Hull fans staying away in protest at the club's owners and just 210 making the trip from Wales, an official crowd of just 6,608 witnessed this contest.
Those that did turn up were rewarded with a reasonably open game, with Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic called on to make excellent saves from Ki Sung-yueng, Nathan Dyer and Fernando Llorente.
The hosts threatened only sporadically before going ahead, with Sam Clucas guilty of wasting two presentable chances and top scorer Robert Snodgrass firing wide.
The introduction of Hernandez gave Hull greater threat in attack and his presence told in the 78th minute after fellow substitute Shaun Maloney got behind the Swansea defence to present the Uruguayan with a straightforward finish.
And a third substitute, academy product Tymon, wrapped up the win in the dying seconds with his first senior goal.
Hull were forced to name a makeshift backline, with centre-backs Harry Maguire and Curtis Davies missing through injury and right-back Ahmed Elmohamady on Africa Cup of Nations duty.
Midfielders Jake Livermore and David Meyler were drafted in to the defence, but come the final whistle Silva had three midfielders in his back line with Tom Huddlestone covering for the second-half loss of captain Michael Dawson.
Hull, therefore, head into Tuesday night's EFL Cup semi-final first leg at Manchester United with question marks over each of their senior central defenders.
Hull boss Marco Silva: "It's important for me that our fans believe in our team because we need help.
"We need the other fans to support our team because to change the situation, to change our position in the table, we need them.
"With a good atmosphere it's better. If the atmosphere's not good, I want my players to focus on things happening on the pitch - but I hope the next game we can change the situation."
Swansea head coach Paul Clement: "The crowd, the atmosphere surprised me. I was expecting a bigger crowd.
"We found it strange. Maybe it was was stranger for Hull than it was for us. It was quiet, with not many supporters, which is different to what I've been used to recently.
"I thought it affected the intensity, there wasn't not much tempo to the game. We were looking for more than that. We're looking to play with much higher intensity."
