Police cordoned off an area of woodland in Barton-on-Sea after the remains were discovered by a member of the public on Tuesday morning.
They have been monitoring the scene around Long Meadow off Willow Walk, but have only just given any information about the investigation.
A spokeswoman for Hampshire Constabulary said no further details were available.
An eyewitness said there had been a "continual" police presence, with seven police vehicles and a helicopter as well as investigators in white overalls on the scene.
