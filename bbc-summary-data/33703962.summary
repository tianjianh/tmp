A security alert began after a suspicious object was discovered in Rosapenna Street on Wednesday morning.
Homes and businesses were evacuated as an army bomb disposal team moved in to examine the device.
DUP MLA William Humphrey said those responsible for planting the pipe bomb should "be taken off our streets and put behind bars".
He added: "There are people who don't want to see Northern Ireland moving forward, who have their own agenda, an evil agenda, and it needs to be rejected by society."
All roads in the area have been reopened and residents have been allowed to return to their homes.
Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly said those behind the pipe bomb were "attempting to drag us back to the past" and there was "no rationale or justification" for their actions.
"Whoever was behind this attack needs to realise they do not have the support of the local community and they should stop these pointless actions immediately," the North Belfast MLA added.
