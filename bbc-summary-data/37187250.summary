[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man drowned after going into a swimming pool with a woman he had been dancing with at a James Bond-themed swingers' party, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edmund Echukwu, 35, entered the pool at a private property in Radlett, Hertfordshire, with a woman before he got into difficulties.
The inquest heard how he went under the water and did not come up again. It emerged later that he could not swim.
County coroner Geoffrey Sullivan concluded his death was accidental.
The inquest in Hatfield heard how Mr Echukwu, who was born in Nigeria and lived in Edgware, Middlesex, attended the party at the Â£3m house in Theobald Street on 27 March 2015.
The woman with whom he was dancing was referred to only as Rachael at the hearing.
Giving evidence, she said: "I said 'I am going to the pool, do you want to come with me?'"
The pair entered the pool and gradually got closer to the deep end, the inquest heard.
She said: "He was by my side and this part of the pool is very deep. I couldn't touch the bottom. He just grabbed my neck and pulled me under the water. I had to push him away because I feared he would drown me and pull me under."
She said she wriggled free and swam to the side of the pool. When she looked back, she said his head and body were submerged.
Mr Echukwu, a father-of-three, was pulled from the water and attempts were made by party-goers and emergency services to resuscitate him. He was taken to Watford General Hospital where he died on 28 March 2015.
Mr Sullivan gave a cause of death as immersion and minor alcohol intoxication.
