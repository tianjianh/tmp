David Chadwick, 58, was released from prison recently having been sentenced to three years.
Dorset Police were searching for Chadwick who they said had breached his licence conditions.
On Saturday evening detectives said Chadwick had surrendered to police in Suffolk and would be returned to jail.
An appeal for sightings had been issued after Chadwick was spotted on a train. He had also hitchhiked as he made his way east across southern England.
Det Insp Joe Williams from the Dorset force said: "Earlier this evening David Chadwick presented himself to police officers working in Lowestoft, Suffolk. He will be immediately recalled to prison.
"I would like to thank members of the public, as well as the media, for their assistance in this investigation."
