The Tigers slipped into the relegation zone with two games to play following a 2-0 defeat by Sunderland last Saturday.
Maguire has a year left on his current deal, but is said to be interesting Tottenham, Everton and Liverpool.
"Obviously every footballer wants to be playing in the Premier League, myself included," said the 24-year-old.
The former Sheffield United centre-back has featured 28 times in the league this season for Hull, who visit Crystal Palace on Sunday.
"It's probably the greatest league in the world at the moment," he added.
"But I'm totally focused on Hull City staying in the Premier League, so new contracts etc - I'll be discussing those at the end of the season when the football has finished."
