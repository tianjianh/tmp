Spencer, from Ceredigion, Wales, has won a Â£250,000 investment and 50/50 partnership with Lord Sugar.
Lord Sugar said he went with his "gut feeling" to chose the winner of the 12th series of the BBC business show.
After learning of her win, Spencer who started her first business at 17, said: "I'm in shock, it's amazing!"
In the final, Spencer and Wood were joined by their former Apprentice colleagues to launch their businesses and make a TV advert.
They had to pitch their plans to 200 industry experts including Lord Sugar at London's City Hall.
Lord Sugar then grilled both candidates in the boardroom and admitted that he had "a very difficult task" as both were "very credible candidates".
After final pleas from the pair, he said: "It's a tough one, but I've got to make a decision, and go with my gut feeling. So, Alana, you're going to be my business partner."
Wood said he was "disappointed", but added: "I am really pleased for Alana.  She really deserves it, she's come really far in the process."
