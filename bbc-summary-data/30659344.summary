Spaghetti Junction maintenance work means months of delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers on motorways around Birmingham face disruption until July as two maintenance projects get under way, the Highways Agency said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One is at the M6 Gravelly Hill Interchange, known as Spaghetti Junction, and the other at junction 8 of the M6, where it joins the M5.
Repairs will be made to the concrete and drainage work will be carried out.
There will be lane, full carriageway and slip road closures and temporary speed limits in place, the agency said.
Jess Kenny, project manager for the schemes, said: "By undertaking the work now, we will reduce the need to carry out in the future emergency road surface repairs which are frustrating for road users, and will therefore minimise disruption in the long-term."
The work on the M6/M5 link road will involve maintenance to bridges, including the Ray Hall Viaduct, the River Tame Bridge and Wigmore Viaduct.
The road will be reduced to a single lane and the M6 junction 9 southbound slip road will be closed. A 50mph speed limit will be in place.
The project started on Monday and is due to be completed at the end of May.
The scheme on viaducts at Spaghetti Junction will involve work to four of the slip roads.
It is due to begin on 11 January and will be completed at the end of July, the agency said.
