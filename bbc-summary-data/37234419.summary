Fifth of calls to West Yorkshire Police the 'wrong type'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fifth of 999 and 101 calls made to West Yorkshire Police are not matters the force can deal with, it has said.

The force said its Wakefield headquarters had been fielding an increasing number of calls better suited to local councils or social services.
There has been an increase in calls relating to mental health issues due to council cutbacks, police said.
August saw 1,000 additional emergency calls a day compared to 2015.
The increase has prompted a call handler recruitment drive.
Recent time-wasting emergency calls include one from a man with a pizza "with not enough pepperoni" and a man needing a "lift to Halifax", the force said.
The 999 and 101 call handling department has over 200 staff, with an additional 46 being recruited to help reduce 101 call waiting times.
Tom Donohoe, head of the contact centre, said a rise in calls during  August was because of an increase in alcohol-related incidents related to the warm weather.
He said: "In the past month or so, we have seen a dramatic increase in the volume of calls and we have taken all necessary steps to ensure that every call is dealt with."
The number of calls West Yorkshire Police are not able to deal with has risen to a fifth due to "misdirected calls" which should be going to other agencies, Mr Donohoe said.
"It can be an extremely rewarding role, as the call handlers help someone literally in their darkest hour, but can also be frustrating as we deal with many calls which are not for the police."
