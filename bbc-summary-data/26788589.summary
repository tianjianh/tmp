[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal Shrewsbury Hospital baby death was 'avoidable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a baby boy from head injuries he suffered during his birth was "avoidable" a coroner has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jenson Christopher Barnett died on 18 June, two days after he was born at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.
Shropshire coroner John Ellery said he died from brain trauma caused during an unsuccessful forceps delivery. He was born by emergency caesarean section.
The hospital apologised to Jenson's parents and said changes had been made to make practices safer in the future.
In a narrative verdict Mr Ellery said it was not possible to determine which "pull or pulls using the forceps" caused the baby's injuries.
He ruled Jenson's death could have been avoided if "he had been delivered by forceps which were appropriately placed around his head or if this was unsuccessful then delivered by caesarean section".
The hospital apologised to Jenson's parents, Kate Langford and Andrew Barnett - who is also known as Barney - for "deficiencies identified in the care provided during his birth".
Medical director Dr Edwin Borman said: "We appreciate that this is an extremely difficult time for all the family.
"[We] would like to reassure them that the trust has taken this matter very seriously and has already made changes that strengthen safer practice."
