[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man in court over shooting near Bishopbriggs school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court charged with shooting a man near a primary school in East Dunbartonshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Burns, 55, from Paisley is charged with attempting to murder Ross Sherlock at Dornoch Place, near St Helen's Primary in Bishopbriggs.
Prosecutors claim he acted with another and the incident on 24 September 2015 was aggravated by organised crime.
Mr Burns made no plea or declaration during an appearance at Glasgow Sheriff Court and was remanded in custody.
Papers from the court allege that while acting with another, Mr Burns "with face partially masked, did present a handgun at him and repeatedly discharge said handgun striking him on the body to his injury and to the danger of life".
Mr Burns is due to appear in court again next week for a full committal hearing.
