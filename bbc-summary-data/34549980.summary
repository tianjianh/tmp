Andrew Moran and Paul Erskine sentenced for killing two men in Bathgate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two teenagers who killed two men in separate attacks in West Lothian have been given life sentences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Moran, 19, was ordered to serve at least 24 years in jail before he can seek release.
Paul Erskine, 19, was told he would serve a minimum term of 22 years for the murder of Steven Mitchell, 31, and the killing of Harry Reekie, 66.
The pair carried out the killings within 36 hours in Bathgate in September last year.
A judge told them at the High Court in Edinburgh that the cocktail of drink and drugs they had consumed may go some way to explaining their actions, but it in no way excused their crime.
Lord Kinclaven said: "There is no alternative to a life sentence. No other method of dealing with you is appropriate."
The judge told Moran and Erskine: "I have to bear in mind the whole circumstances of this tragic case."
He ordered that the pair be detained in a young offenders' institution.
Erskine's defence counsel, Ian Duguid QC, had earlier told the court the teenager had told a social worker that "he deserves everything that is coming to him".
Moran was previously convicted of murdering Mr Reekie following an attack at his home in Lothian Street, Bathgate, on 16 September and murdering Mr Mitchell at an address in the town's Marmion Road on 16 or 17 September.
Erskine was found guilty of killing the pensioner and murdering Mr Mitchell.
Mr Reekie had tape wrapped around his mouth and wrists and was repeatedly struck with knives as he was threatened and robbed of Â£400, a bank card and phones.
The victim died in January this year as a result of his injuries.
Mr Mitchell was stabbed to death at a nearby house where bloody footprints from Moran and Erskine's new trainers were left behind.
Mr Duguid said: "He really has no explanation apart from the fact he was on a cocktail of drugs and alcohol."
He added that the teenager continued to express his remorse for the families of both men.
Tony Graham, counsel for Moran, said he left his family at the age of 15 "essentially to fend for himself and had had little boundaries in place ever since".
Det Supt Kenny Graham, of Police Scotland, said: "Only Andrew Moran and Paul Erskine know why they chose to carry out such brutal attacks against Harry Reekie and Steven Mitchell.
"They have so far shown absolutely no remorse for their crimes and have refused to explain their motivations, something that the families and those closest to the victims would have appreciated to help them come to terms with their loss.
"In the absence of any explanation, it is reasonable to infer that they are both highly dangerous men who displayed no regard for their victims.
"My thoughts are today with the families and loved ones of Mr Reekie and Mr Mitchell who have been forced to endure tremendous anguish for more than a year."
