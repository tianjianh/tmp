Rita Ora says she's bracing herself for negative reviews about her performance as a coach on The Voice.

The singer replaces Kylie Minogue on the BBC One singing contest with series four starting this weekend.
"Opinions are going to come from everywhere. I mean they already have been but this time they will be 10 times more intense," she told Newsbeat.
"I've got to come to the reality, I am going to be an open book for the public."
The 22-year-old has barely had time to get used to her revolving chair but fears the online backlash.
The singer admitted she regularly reads online comments about her music, even those that are not complimentary.
And Rita says she'll do the same once The Voice is broadcast on television.
"I have said to myself, 'I can only be myself.'
"If I was to be someone else it would come out that I was lying because you can't be fake for eight hours straight while they are filming. You'll start to get exhausted."
Rita Ora will be joined on the judging panel by will.i.am, Sir Tom Jones and Ricky Wilson.
"I am ready for the ups and downs. I am happy I made this choice.
"Anytime I go on Twitter there's the good and the bad. I try to just blank out what I don't want and take in what I want to keep."
The Voice's signature feature sees contestants singing while the four coaches face the other way.
If one or more of the coaches like what they hear and decide to turn around - the contestant then has to decide who they want to mentor them.
Newsbeat was invited to a special screening of the first episode of the new series.
And it's quite clear that Rita plans to use the fact that she's the only female on the panel to her advantage.
"To me it's not about the flirting and that word's been used a lot today.
"This is how I really am and I try and make people feel comfortable.
"It's more about cracking the ice so they can achieve what they can in the audition.
"They might get a bit red in the face at first but they'll thank me."
As well as taking on the role as a coach on the show Rita also has two films due for release this year including a part in Fifty Shades of Grey.
