Tesco shoppers in Northampton were told to "sit" like dogs before they scrambled for cut price meat.

A video shot by Facebook user Johnny Lester in the Weston Favell store shows people forming a scrum as they cram their baskets full of bargain produce.
A woman is overheard calling the shoppers "disgusting". Mr Lester blamed the store for how the food was put out.
A Tesco spokesman said the "safety of our customers and colleagues is of paramount importance to us".
The video, which has been viewed by almost 1.5m people, starts with a number of Tesco customers surrounding a reduced counter at the store.
Someone is clearly heard telling them: "Sit, sit."
Staff have to fight their way out as customers dive in to grab the goods. Customers are seen piling baskets high with meat produce.
Mr Lester, who took the video on Monday, said he was "shocked and in disbelief".
"I had heard about it, but never seen it happen like that before," he said.
"Tesco were at fault. If you throw a load of trays on the floor like that with people waiting, what is going to happen?"
Former Northampton North MP and Green Party politician Tony Clarke said Tesco were "crass and irresponsible" for putting the food out in the manner they did.
He said: "They put their staff at risk and allowed their customers to wrestle on the floor in the hunt for a bargain."
A woman in the background of the video can be clearly heard saying: "I am sending this to your head office because they are disgusting."
The Tesco spokesman said an investigation had been held and the store manager "will take steps to prevent a similar situation happening again".
He said: "We are continually trying to improve the way we deal with surplus food, this includes making better reductions earlier in the day to make it easier for customers and colleagues in the evening."
