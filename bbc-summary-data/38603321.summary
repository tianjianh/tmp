The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has stripped the three of their gold medals, won in Beijing in 2008.

The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) last year ruled any nations with three or more positive tests would be banned for a year.
The IOC is retesting hundreds of samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games, using new techniques to uncover cheating that went undetected at the time.
Cao Lei, 33, took gold in the women's 75kg weightlifting event at Beijing, Chen Xiexia, 34, won the women's 48kg and Liu Chunhong, 31, was successful in the women's 69kg. All will now have to return their medals.
The failed retests were uncovered last year but the sanctions - announced by the IOC on Thursday - will clear the way for the IWF to act.
The IWF issued new measures before last year's Rio Olympics to crack down on doping in the sport.
Its executive board decided "national federations confirmed to have produced three or more anti-doping rule violations in the combined re-analysis process of the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games shall be suspended for one year".
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Russia and Belarus have already been banned by the IWF.
