Stormont talks: UUP leader Mike Nesbitt complains of 'secret' negotiations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Stormont talks are being conducted in a "Stalinist way, behind closed doors" Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Mike Nesbitt has claimed.

He said only the two biggest parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin, were involved in the talks.
He expressed concern a two-party deal would be financed by more borrowing.
But on Tuesday, DUP leader Peter Robinson said Mr Nesbitt "hasn't a clue what he's talking about, nor has he ever, when he's talking about numbers".
In response, the UUP leader told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme he was not going to get involved in a "slagging match" with Mr Robinson.
However, he said his own party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance were being left out of talks.
"Anybody who thinks that this is still a negotiation between five parties and two governments at Stormont House is misinformed. It's now between the DUP and Sinn Féin who are in a lock-down in Stormont Castle," Mr Nesbitt said.
"People will have to decide, when the document is finally published, whether it is a legitimate concern of mine to say that the borrowing is at a level that we're mortgaging our children's future."
On Tuesday, Mr Nesbitt expressed concern the two-party deal could involve £0.5bn of extra borrowing powers for Stormont, which has been in crisis mode for months over its budget shortfall and welfare reform.
But the UUP leader admitted to Wednesday's programme that his concerns were based on "speculation" as he did not know the content of the latest negotiations between the DUP and Sinn Féin.
He said he was getting information via statements the Irish prime minister made to the media.
Alliance Party minister Stephen Farry said he did not think Mr Nesbitt had "any firm foundation" on which to base his comments about borrowing and was "making things up in that regard".
Mr Farry said Alliance was "involved in the process" but was waiting for papers from either the two governments or the two largest parties.
"Virtually every talks process comes down to, in essence, a major deal being done between the two largest parties, that's been the case even if you go back to the Good Friday Agreement," he added.
The DUP, Sinn Féin and the Irish government have all said they are "hopeful" that a deal to resolve Stormont's problems could be reached this week.
