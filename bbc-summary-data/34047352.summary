She confirmed her place on the BBC's ballroom dancing competition while appearing on The One Show, where she used to work as a roving reporter.
Rani has presented a host of shows for broadcasters including BBC, Sky, Channel 4 and Channel 5.
She will take part in the 13th series of Strictly Come Dancing, which will begin on BBC One in September.
Rani co-presented Watchdog alongside Anne Robinson in 2009, and has hosted her own show on the BBC Asian Network.
She said: "When my mum first came from India to the UK, she'd watch the original series of Strictly [which was called Come Dancing] and would dream of dancing and wearing those gorgeous dresses and now I'm able to realise her dream.
"That makes me feel amazing. My mum devoted her life to me and my brother and it's great to be able to do things to make her proud."
The 37-year-old, who grew up in Bradford, attended the University of Leeds and then worked as a researcher for the BBC before embarking on a career as a presenter.
The 10th celebrity to join the line-up was former boy band singer Jay McGuiness from The Wanted.
He revealed his news as he appeared live on air with Matt Edmondson on BBC Radio 1.
Rani and McGuiness will join Jeremy Vine, Ainsley Harriott, Kellie Bright, Georgia May Foote, Katie Derham, Carol Kirkwood, Peter Andre, Daniel O'Donnell and Anthony Ogogo on the programme.
