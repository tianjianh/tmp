The 26-year-old, who played seven Tests in 2014, has scored 6,325 first-class runs at an average of 37.87.
"Sam is a high-quality cricketer," Middlesex managing director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
"We believe he will continue to develop, score thousands of runs for Middlesex and play a major role in us becoming a successful club again."
Robson, who was born in Australia, made his first-class debut for Middlesex in 2009.
"I think my best years are ahead of me," the opener said. "There were a number of positives from 2015 and hopefully we can build on these in future seasons."
