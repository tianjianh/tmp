Leeds Rhinos coach Brian McDermott hopes Australian hooker James Segeyaro will return to the club despite the player saying he is homesick.

Last week, chief executive Gary Hetherington said Segeyaro would stay at Leeds despite interest from the NRL.
The 26-year-old subsequently told the Australian Sunday Telegraph that he did not want to return to the UK.
"Some of the things he's said are disappointing. We expect him to be back," McDermott told BBC Radio Leeds.
"We made a commitment to James and he made a commitment to us.
"I spoke to him on the phone and he expressed some concerns to me about coming back."
He added: "We've got a contract with him and that's not to be broken lightly. I'm not talking about the legal part of it but if you look someone in the eye and say 'I'll see you whenever' and then say 'I'm not coming now'... I don't think you should do that too often in your life."
Segeyaro joined the Rhinos from NRL side Penrith in June and is contracted to the Super League side until the end of the 2018 season.
McDermott said the club were prepared should Segeyaro not come back to England.
"There's always a plan B. There's always a fluid list of players who are available," McDermott added.
"We hope he comes back and comes back in the right frame of mind but if he doesn't we have plans in place."
