#OpenNewsroomBBC is happening on 17 November so if you are interested in a BBC News taster and you are happy to share what you have learned via Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, then apply for a place by completing the form below.
This initiative is part of the national "Open Newsroom" day organised by the Creative Diversity Network (CDN).
The purpose of the CDN is to increase the diversity of broadcasting in the UK. Other CDN members include Sky and Channel 4.
We would particularly like to hear from BAME, young people with disabilities and young people from the broadest range of social backgrounds.
