Leeds United fans have criticised a "pie tax" which has been introduced on some match-day tickets at Elland Road.

The Championship club is set to raise the price of adult tickets in the South Stand by Â£5, but a 'meal deal' voucher will be included in the price.
A spokesman told the Yorkshire Post the club was "looking at ways to encourage supporters to use the catering".
Leeds Supporters' Trust chairman Michael Green said it showed the club was "out of touch with its supporters".
"It may not be on the same scale as some of the bigger issues the club has had to deal with since [chairman] Massimo Cellino arrived, but it is one of those things we could have done without," he added.
Cellino was banned by the Football League in October, having been found guilty of an offence under Italian tax legislation, but his ban has been deferred pending the outcome of his appeal.
In early November the Italian had a change of heart after announcing he was willing to sell his majority stake in the club to supporters.
Leeds are 17th in English football's second tier, having taken 19 points from the first 18 games of the season.
