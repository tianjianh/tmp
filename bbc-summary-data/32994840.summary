[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother warned a 999 call handler her son had a "violent nature" before he was Tasered and died, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Begley, 23, died in hospital two hours after he was shot by a police officer with the stun gun at his home in Gorton, Manchester, in July 2013.
His mother Dorothy called police after a row escalated with neighbours.
Manchester Civil Courts of Justice heard Mr Begley threatened to stab a neighbour as the 999 call was made.
Hugh Davies QC, representing PC Terence Donnelly, who is said to have shot the stun gun, and four other officers involved in the incident, read part of the transcript from Mrs Begley's 999 call to the court.
She had barred Jordan from leaving the house they shared after he had been accused of stealing a handbag by a neighbour amid threats of revenge.
Her son, who was a heavy drinker and used cocaine, was heard protesting his innocence and shouting at his neighbour, saying he will get a "knife right in his face".
Mrs Begley told the call handler: "There's going to be murder."
Mr Davies said: "He was a threat to other people with the knife in the mood he was in."
She replied: "If I let him go out he probably would have used it."
The court heard when police arrived Mr Begley was calm at first but became "extremely agitated" and swore at officers to get out of "his house".
Mr Davies reminded the jury Mrs Begley previously said as she left the house her son had a look on his face that said, 'mum help me' as the officer pointed the Taser at him.
Asked why she did not help, Mrs Begley said she did not think they would Taser him "because he was not doing anything" and he "did nothing that deserved being Tasered".
Mr Begley was Tasered from a distance of 70cm (27ins) then hit with "distraction strikes" as police restrained and handcuffed him, the inquest has heard.  He was not armed.
Mr Begley then become unwell and was admitted to hospital, where he died.
The inquest continues.
