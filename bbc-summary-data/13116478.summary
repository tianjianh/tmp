East Midlands Tourism released the results looking into the growth of the town.
Mike Carr, from East Midlands Development Agency said: "It's encouraging to see the growth."
One of Northamptonshire's biggest tourist attractions is the Althorp estate, home of the Spencer family.
Edward Crookes, Althorp Estates Director, said he had seen a significant rise in the number of people coming to the estate.
"The house has great history and great detail, we are really proud of what we have to offer," he said.
He added: "We are constantly trying to evolve the house and offer something new each year. That way we stay fresh and people come wanting more."
Rob Purdy from Northamptonshire Enterprise Limited said: "People who come here really enjoy the county and want to come back again.
"It's those repeat visitors that help tourism.
"Every place has something different to offer and it's good news that tourism is up in the county."
East Midlands Tourism released the results which found that inward investment in the county had also helped boost growth.
