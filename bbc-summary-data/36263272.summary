Joe Marler: England prop is seeing a sports psychologist

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England prop Joe Marler says he is seeing a sports psychologist to address his "lack of professional control".

Marler, 25, who plays for Harlequins, received a two-week ban for kicking Grenoble hooker Arnaud Heguy in the Challenge Cup last month.
The incident occurred on his comeback from a two-game ban for calling Wales forward Samson Lee a "Gypsy boy".
Marler, who has 42 international caps, said he needed to "get a grip" of his behaviour following the second ban.
Marler is free to play in Harlequins' European Challenge Cup final against Montpellier on Friday and England's game with Wales on 29 May.
He is now seeing sports psychologist Jeremy Snape but says he does not regret not seeking help earlier.
He told BBC Radio 5 live: "I just don't think I was willing to accept it until now because things hadn't really hit home yet
"It's been good so far. I just explore different ideas, different things, different strategies to put in place to actually say your mind is a tool that you need to work as hard as you do in the gym or on the pitch during skill work.
"It's just about whether you can unlock that or not."
Marler admitted his relief at only receiving a two-week ban for kicking Heguy, an offence which normally carries a low-end sanction of four weeks.
He expected to miss England's summer tour to Australia in June and said head coach Eddie Jones told him to "wind his neck in".
"I didn't think I'd play again this season," said Marler. "I thought I'd be having the summer off as well.
"I'm very lucky to be in a position to pull on the shirt for Quins again and even luckier that it's a final and a chance to get hands on a trophy."
