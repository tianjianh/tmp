A mother and three children were killed in an eight-vehicle crash on 11 August in Berkshire that involved four cars and four lorries.
Then on Thursday a three-year-old girl was fatally injured in an accident near Oxford involving seven cars and a lorry and died in hospital on Saturday.
Now an action group has been set up to look into making the road safer.
