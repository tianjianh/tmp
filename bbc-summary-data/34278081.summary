MPs urge fraud inquiry into banks over firm closures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Labour MPs want the Serious Fraud Office to investigate claims that high street banks have forced viable firms to close in order to recover loans.

A Carmarthenshire farmer and a Cardiff entrepreneur were named in a debate at Westminster as victims.
Ogmore MP Huw Irranca-Davies claimed "profitable businesses were destroyed".
Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the two men had had "a very difficult time" and their evidence was under "active consideration".
Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens told the Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday that thousands of people could have been affected by the "extensive practice of down-valuation", highlighted in a report by government adviser Lawrence Tomlinson in 2013.
That report claimed that RBS had put some "good and viable" businesses into default so it could make more profit, although lawyers then appointed by the bank to investigate the claims found no evidence to support them.
The two Welsh Labour MPs said there were similar allegations involving other banks, reassessing their investments in the wake of the 2007-8 financial crash.
Ms Stevens said: "We are left with a situation where it is alleged that a partly nationalised bank, having found itself in unfavourable business arrangements, has been able to manipulate matters to its advantage, steering successful companies into receivership, whilst at the same time depressing the valuation of those companies and individuals assets to augment the emergency funding it would receive from the taxpayer.
"It has been assisted in that by supposedly independent professional advisers who are embedded within the bank and who financially benefit from receivership appointments engineered in conjunction with the bank," she added.
Mr Irranca-Davies said: "Now is the time to shine a spotlight on the allegations of criminality, collusion and corruption.
"What these two cases illustrate may be the tip of the iceberg.
"We have heard that there are more victims suffering in silence, believing themselves helpless, after their profitable businesses were destroyed."
Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the evidence provided was being kept under "active consideration" by the Serious Fraud Office, although the cases individually did not meet the "threshold" of warranting specific SFO investigations.
"The two gentleman clearly have had a very difficult time," he said.
"The allegations have been considered in great detail and there has been close liaison with other law enforcing agencies and regulatory bodies to gather any relevant material that they may hold."
