Police received a number of reports of young people setting pallets and rubbish on fire at the Leckey Road and Westland Street.
Petrol bombs and missiles were also thrown in the Bishop Street and Magazine Street direction.
There are no reports of any injuries or any serious damage caused.
A pizza delivery van was also hijacked in the Iona Court area by two masked men and set on fire a short time later at Fahan Street.
PSNI chief inspector Andy Lemon said: "The local residents in this area have suffered once again due to the reckless actions of these youths, some as young as 10.
"I want to reiterate our message to youths involved in this kind of activity that you run the very real risk of being arrested and getting a criminal record which could affect your life for a very long time.
"Parents need to know where their children are, who they are with and what they are doing.
"Police will continue to work closely with community representatives, local elected representatives and other statutory bodies to address these issues in the area.
"I appeal to anyone with any information about those involved in the disorder last night to contact police at Strand Road."
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness tweeted on Monday night that he "unreservedly condemned" those responsible for the attacks.
