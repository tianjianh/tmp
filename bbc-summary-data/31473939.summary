Six Nations 2015: Wales want win to 'repay' fans says Rhys Webb

Wales are determined to beat Scotland to repay their fans after the 21-16 defeat against England in their Six Nations opener, says Rhys Webb.

The Ospreys scrum-half scored an early try but Wales failed to capitalise on leading 16-8 at half-time.
Webb, 26, says the second-half collapse against England has provided extra motivation to do well at Murrayfield.
"There's been an extra bit of sharpness in training. Everyone's positive. It's big for us to repay our fans," he said.

Webb says despite the defeat to bitter rivals England, he has received a largely positive response from the Welsh public, although he had "a couple of comments" that he "took on the chin".
Scotland were praised for a gallant display in their 15-8 defeat by France last weekend.
It came following an encouraging autumn campaign in which they beat Tonga and Argentina and threatened to cause an upset against New Zealand.
But they have lost their last seven meetings against Wales including a 51-3 defeat in Cardiff in 2014.
Wales have made two changes from their defeat against England, with wing George North making way for Liam Williams and tight-head prop Aaron Jarvis replacing Samson Lee, who is ruled out with concussion.

Webb is expecting a tough test against the Scots, but says Wales have nothing to fear.
"They can take a lot of positives from the game against France," said Webb.
"Obviously with the new coaching set up it's taken them in a slightly different direction and you can see that from the way they are playing and they'll be full of confidence going into the game.
"But our record is good against them and that's a positive for us and the boys love going to Murrayfield and playing so hopefully we can put a good performance in."
