Just over a year after breaking her spine, Scottish skier Charlie Guest has made it into the list of the world's top 100.

In November 2014, Charlie was training in Sweden when she lost control of her skis, veering off course into the forest and landing on a boulder.
After a year of rehabilitation, she is back in Austria training.
Following a race on Sunday, she has now been launched up the rankings for alpine slalom skiing to number 84.
Charlie, who has skied since she was seven, fought hard to get back in the game, and managed to make it to the world skiing championships just 11 weeks after the crash.
And last Sunday, when competing in a race in Austria, she achieved a result that has pushed her into the top 100 skiers in her category in the world.
Back home in Perth this week, she said: "It's been a turbulent journey. I've had a lot of ups and downs over the last year.
"After making it to world championships, I had a good few races back in Europe and I made loads of personal bests.
"But by the time we got to March, I had more back problems than I'd ever had before.
"It wasn't happening that well for me."
Charlie said that before her accident, making it into the top 100 was still her goal and now - just over a year later - she's delighted to have made that happen.
"We've come out this season with everything we were looking to get," she said.
"It's quite rewarding to have that after after a long periods of constant rehab and recovery and things going wrong."
She added: "We knew what kind of result I'd need to be able to get into the top 100.
"On Sunday, I had a race in Austria that I won by 1.4 seconds or something like that. Immediately we knew that that was going to be a good enough result to get me into the top 100.
"I was number 84 and it was really cool to see that next to your name.
"There's still a lot more work I want to do - I want to be number one in the world.
"Everything was really worth it in the end."
