Most of the injuries were minor, but several people had been taken to hospital, one official said.
The trains had come from Bakersfield and Los Angeles. They collided near Oakland Station at around 2200 local on Wednesday (0500 GMT Thursday).
A fire official told Associated Press one train had been stationary and the other was travelling at 15mph (24kph).
A passenger said there had been "an awful jolt" when the collision took place.
Oakland Fire Department battalion chief Emon Usher told AP the stationary train had been unloading passengers when it was hit.
He said several of 16 people injured in the collision had been taken to local hospitals.
The Oakland Tribune and KTVU-TV put the number of injured at 18.  They said most had suffered bruises and bumps, with one report of a broken arm.
Authorities said the injured came from both trains.
Amtrak said it had been a "low speed" collision between the "San Joaquin" train - travelling between Bakersfield and Oakland - and the Coast Starlight, which was on its way from Los Angeles to Seattle.
The wheels of both trains' lead engines had derailed, a spokesman said.
Train traffic through Oakland Station has been suspended and emergency services and rail inspectors are at the scene.
