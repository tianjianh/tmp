The Sakurajima volcano, on the island of Kyushu in Japan, has started erupting throwing lava and ash in to the air in spectacular style.

The smoke lit up the sky with bolts of lightning, caused by tiny pieces of rock, ash and ice rubbing together and making static electricity.
Sakurajima's last major eruption was in September. This area of the country sits on the Pacific "Ring of fire" and has more than 100 volcanoes.
The Ring of Fire is an area where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen a lot.
There have been no reports of anyone having been hurt by Sakurajima's eruption so far.
