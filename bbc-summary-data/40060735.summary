Former Glenn Hoddle Academy product Benbow, 26, scored 32 goals for the Glassboys in last season's Northern Premier League promotion near miss.
He also scored eight times in Stourbridge's run to the third round of the FA Cup, when they lost at Wycombe.
Lait and Benbow, who had spells at both Cheltenham and Burton, are Moors' first signings this summer.
Moors manager Liam McDonald has already signed striker Oladapo Afolayan, skipper Liam Daly, fellow defenders Joel Kettle, Kristian Green and Calum Flanagan and midfielders George Carline, Ashley Sammons and Simeon Maye on new contracts for the 2017-18 season.
The club have so far lost strikers Harry White, to Chester, Andy Brown, defender Connor Franklin, who joined Brackley Town, and keeper Danny Lewis.
Benbow and Lait are the latest members of Stourbridge's successful FA Cup side to move on following Dan Scarr's move to Birmingham City in January.
