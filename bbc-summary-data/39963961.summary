Scotland: Rory Hughes and Greig Tonks replace injured Sean Maitland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Backs Rory Hughes and Greig Tonks have joined Scotland's summer tour squad after Sean Maitland was ruled out through injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maitland injured his ankle ligaments in Saracens' Aviva Premiership loss to Wasps on Saturday 6 May.
Consequently, Gregor Townsend has called up Glasgow Warriors wing Hughes and London Irish full-back Tonks to his first squad as head coach.
Scotland face Italy, Australia and Fiji in their trio of June Tests.
Hughes, 24, has won two Scotland caps, the most recent of which came in the November win over Georgia.
Tonks, 27, has been capped six times, but has not featured for the national team since the 2015 Rugby World Cup warm-up victory against Italy in Turin.
"We've watched Greig [Tonks] closely this season," Townsend said. "He's done really well in a good London Irish side and played a lot of full-back, but also covered at centre and stand-off.
"He's a player that brings aggression and a really good kicking game, but also has the ability to step up at first and second receiver. Primarily we're looking at him as a 15, but it's positive he can cover other positions as well.
"Rory [Hughes] has had a really good season. He was on excellent form before the injury he suffered just before Christmas and got back to that form towards the end of the season.
"This is an opportunity for him to continue the good work he put in this season, in particular leading up to the autumn tests, where he was capped against Georgia."
Scotland tackle the Azzurri in Singapore on Saturday 10 June, before taking on Australia in Sydney seven days later, and complete their summer programme in the Fijian capital Suva on 24 June.
