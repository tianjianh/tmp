County Louth car crash: Three women killed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three woman who died after a car crash in County Louth in the Republic of Ireland were a mother and daughter and a family friend from County Donegal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men were seriously injured in the three-vehicle crash on the N2, the main Monaghan to Dublin road, south of Aclint Bridge near Ardee, overnight.
It is believed the 39-year-old driver, her mother, 69, and their 37-year-old friend were returning from holiday.
The men are being treated for their injuries at a hospital in Drogheda.
One of the men had been travelling in the same car as the three women who were killed.
The driver of another vehicle was one of those injured, while it is understood a man driving a third car was not hurt.
Fr James Sweeney, a parish priest from Bruckless, near Killybegs in County Donegal, said he knew all three of the victims and expressed his sympathy to their relatives.
"It is probably one of the worst tragedies I have come across in all my years working in parishes," he added.
"I would have had conversations with these people before and they were lovely.
"My understanding is that they were on a holiday abroad and were on their way home again to Donegal.
"People are devastated in this area."
Superintendent Fergus Treanor, from Ardee Garda (Irish police) Station, said: "We came across a very difficult scene.
"They were returning from a holiday which is terribly sad.
"An ambulance travelling back to Donegal also stopped at the scene to give their assistance."
The N2 road is closed between Ardee and Aclint Bridge as GardaÃ­ carry out an investigation at the scene of the crash.
