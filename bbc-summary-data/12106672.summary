Revenue totalled $23.5bn (Â£15.2bn), up 57% on the previous year, reinforcing the territory's position as the world's  most lucrative gambling market.
Earnings have been driven by an influx of gamblers from mainland China.
Macau - a former Portuguese colony returned to China in 1999 - is the only Chinese city where gambling is legal.
It opened up its gambling industry to foreign competition in 2002, triggering a building boom.
In 2007 gambling revenue there overtook that of the Las Vegas Strip in the US.
The figures for 2010 were released by Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.
As well as an annual record, gambling revenue also set a monthly record in December 2010 of $2.36bn - up 66% year on year.
