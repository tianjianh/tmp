[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash happened at the Bloomfield roundabout on the A75 Dumfries bypass at about 17:05 on 27 December.
Police have renewed their appeal for witnesses to the accident which involved a white Fiat Punto.
The 36-year-old driver from Locharbriggs suffered head and back injuries in the accident.
PC Stuart Delaney said: "We are keen to speak to the driver of a black-coloured 4x4 type vehicle that was either on the roundabout having entered it from the A701, Locharbriggs side, or waiting at the junction.
"Additionally, we are keen to speak to a driver who may have swerved into the bus stop on Glasgow Street, Dumfries, shortly before to avoid a collision with the white Punto."
