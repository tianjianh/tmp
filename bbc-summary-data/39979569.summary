The family of a newly-elected councillor who died suddenly aged 22 hopes to start a bursary in her memory.

Emily Price, from Huntingdon in Cambridge, studied maths and physics and was due to do a masters degree in Aberystwyth from September.
She became ill days after being elected to the town's central ward and died on 12 May.
By Tuesday, a fundraising page in Ms Price's memory had already raised more than Â£3,300.
Her family said they hoped to help disadvantaged students take the same subjects as Ms Price.
Aberystwyth University has opened a memorial book for students to pay their respects, which will stay open until Ms Price's funeral takes place on 2 June at Cambridge Crematorium.
It has also arranged for a bus to take students from Aberystwyth to Cambridge for the funeral - and they are encouraged to wear some yellow or purple, the university colours, to celebrate Ms Price's time there.
Her sister Katie Price said: "We talked to her university and they are also interested in honouring her.
"We're going to create some kind of bursary for future maths and physics students as this was a subject and a university that she was so incredibly passionate about."
She added any extra money raised would go towards a bench outside Ms Price's flat on Aberystwyth seafront "so that other people can enjoy the exact same view as she did".
A fundraising page set up by Ms Price's parents, Natasha and John, and her, sisters Hannah and Katie, reads: "Emily wanted to make a difference in the world and with your help we can continue her legacy."
