[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 5-2 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle went top of League Two for the first time this season as Charlie Wyke's second-half hat-trick helped them to a  convincing home win against Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Poor defensive marking from a corner by Chris Clements allowed Patrick Hoban to give Mansfield a sixth-minute lead with an unchallenged header from eight yards out.
Carlisle were soon level with a very similar goal though as Danny Grainger and Nicky Adams worked a short corner before Adams curled the ball into the box, picking out Jason Kennedy who was able to steer his header past Scott Shearer.
Most of the shooting came from distance, with Oscar Gobern going close for Mansfield and Shearer doing well to smother a 20-yard shot from Adams which bounced awkwardly in front of him.
Carlisle went ahead four minutes after the break when Adams cut in from the left to deliver a perfect ball onto the head of Wyke, who headed firmly past Shearer.
Wyke grabbed his second and Carlisle's third in the 62nd minute, rising highest in the penalty area to head Grainger's cross into the net.
He completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot in the 80th minute and took his tally to six goals in three games when he buried the ball in the bottom right-hand corner after the referee had spotted a handball offence during a goalmouth melee.
Mansfield grabbed a goal back when Mitchell Rose slotted home from close range, before Reggie Lambe added a fifth for the Cumbrians with a left-footed shot.
