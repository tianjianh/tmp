Holyrood devolution committee wants Trade Union Bill blocked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland should be exempted from the scope of Westminster's Trade Union Bill, MSPs on Holyrood's devolution committee have ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The committee said there was "widespread opposition" to the bill and called on the UK government to exclude Scotland from its reach.
SNP and Labour members have voiced strong concerns about the bill and made efforts to have it blocked.
A UK government spokesman said the bill was "clearly a reserved matter".
He added: "People right across the UK have the right to know that the services on which they and their families rely will not be disrupted at short notice by strikes backed by only a  small proportion of union members."
The Westminster bill would curb the powers of trade unions and make it more difficult for them to call strikes.
MSPs have made a series of attempts to block the bill north of the border, with SNP minister Roseanna Cunningham failing in a bid to lodge a special motion on the matter and Labour's James Kelly ejected from the chamber while protesting against the presiding officer rejecting that motion.
The Scottish Conservatives say the bill was "clearly" a matter reserved to Westminster, and Tory MSP Alex Johnstone dissented from the committee's conclusions and recommendations.
Trade union law is not a devolved matter (except in Northern Ireland).  It is for the UK government and parliament to decide.
Nicola Sturgeon's request for power in this area to be transferred to Holyrood will not be granted.
The UK government is also determined that turnout thresholds for strike ballots should apply across Britain.  This was a Conservative manifesto commitment.
However, as I understand it, consideration is being given to Scottish opposition to other parts of the trade union bill.
In theory, it's possible for the sections abolishing check-off and regulating facility time not to be applied in Scotland (Under check-off employers collect union subscriptions at source. Facility time is paid time off for workers to carry out union duties).
That does not mean this will happen. It may not.  But it has yet to be formally ruled out by UK ministers.
The devolution and further powers committee took evidence on the potential impact of the bill in Scotland, and have now submitted their report to MSPs.
Members said that if the UK government was not willing to amend the bill, the Scottish government should use "any means available" to encourage the House of Lords to intervene.
They also said that if the bill was not amended, extra regulation-making powers should be given to Scottish ministers to rule on matters relating directly to public services in Scotland.
Committee convener Bruce Crawford said there was "widespread opposition" to the legislation in Scotland.
He said: "We recognise the UK government wishes to pass this bill despite there being no real evidence to support its position.
"It is unlikely, therefore, to heed our call to halt the legislative process in the UK parliament so that the bill does not become law in any part of the UK.
"That being the case, the committee recommends the UK government removes Scotland from the territorial extent of the bill, through amendments in the House of Lords at report stage.
"Without these amendments, Jeremy Hunt will in practice have regulation-making power over industrial relations in the NHS in Scotland."
