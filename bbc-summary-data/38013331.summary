[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kevin Nugent placed in caretaker charge of Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Assistant manager Kevin Nugent will take caretaker charge of Charlton Athletic until a new permanent boss is appointed to replace Russell Slade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nugent, 47, was Slade's number two and has previously had spells as caretaker manager at Swansea and Leyton Orient.
The League One side sacked former Orient and Cardiff boss Slade on Monday after less than six months in the job.
Nugent will be assisted by first-team coach Simon Clark and Chris O'Loughlin, who has joined the staff at The Valley.
Charlton have dismissed reports linking O'Loughlin with the manager's job, stating he will not become their new boss.
O'Loughlin has had a spell as manager of Belgian side Sint-Truiden, which is part of a network of European clubs owned by Charlton owner Roland Duchatelet.
The Irishman has also been head coach of AS Vita in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and had stints on the coaching staff at Orlando Pirates in South Africa and Melbourne Victory in Australia.
The Addicks, who are 15th in the table, host Port Vale on Saturday.
