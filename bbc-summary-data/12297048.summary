[SN]TITLE[SN]
Three accused over Newquay hotel fire to face trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three people have been remanded to stand trial at Crown Court accused of safety breaches after a fatal fire at a Cornwall hotel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three people died in the blaze at the Penhallow Hotel in Newquay in 2007.
John McMillan, Nicola Burfitt and Martin Trucker were remanded in their absence by magistrates at Bodmin to face trial at Truro Crown Court.
They are due to appear in March. The case is being brought by Cornwall Fire & Rescue Service and Cornwall Council.
Mr McMillan is a director of the company which owned the hotel. Miss Burfitt was its group administration director.
Mr Trucker was employed by Hawthorne Safety Consultants at the time of the fire.
An inquest on Joan Harper, 80, Monica Hughes, 86, and her 43-year-old son Peter, all from Staffordshire, returned an open verdict last year.
