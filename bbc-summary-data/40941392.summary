[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A murder inquiry has begun into the death of an English man who was found injured outside a house in County Mayo in the Republic of Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victim was 21-year-old Joseph Deacy, from St Albans, Hertfordshire.
A passer-by called the emergency services after finding Mr Deacy with head injuries outside the house in Gortnasillagh, Swinford, on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital in Mayo and later transferred to Dublin's Beaumont Hospital, where he died on Sunday.
The state pathologist carried out a post-mortem examination and on Tuesday, GardaÃ­ (Irish police) said the death was being treated as murder.
Investigators have carried out a forensic examination of the scene and an incident room has been set up at Claremorris Garda Station.
Mr Deacy was understood to be visiting a friend in the Republic of Ireland at the time of his death.
At his home in Hertfordshire, he was heavily involved in Gaelic football and was a senior player for his local club, St Colmcilles.
His fellow players paid a warm tribute on the club's website, describing Mr Deacy as a teammate and a friend.
"He has been a key member of the squad in recent years and has been very important to the success that the team has achieved recently", the website said.
"It is difficult to say goodbye to anyone at any age but when it happens to someone so young it is especially difficult.
"He will be sorely missed by us all."
