Police said he was last seen the previous day and are appealing to anyone who saw him on either day to come forward.
Det Ch Insp Iain Smith said: "He was a man who was well known in the local community."
He added: "We are keen to trace anyone who knows Mr McKandie, who may have seen him that weekend or has any information about what happened to him.
"Mr McKandie's home is part of a small collection of houses in a fairly remote area and we're looking for anyone who may have been in the area or passing through that weekend to come forward with information about anyone they may have seen in the area.
"We're particularly interested in the hours between midday on Friday the 11th and Saturday afternoon."
