WWI Gallipoli memorials in Deal, Bury and Warwickshire listed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three memorials linked to the Gallipoli landings in World War One have been listed or had their listing upgraded to mark the centenary of the campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gallipoli campaign was fought on the Turkish peninsula in 1915 in an effort to capture Constantinople.
It resulted in considerable losses for Britain, her allies and the Turks.
The war memorials in Warwickshire, Kent and Greater Manchester are among up to 2,500 being listed over five years to mark the 100th anniversary of WWI.
The 29th Division War Memorial, in Stretton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire, has been upgraded from Grade II to Grade II* and is thought to be the most significant single memorial in Britain associated with the Gallipoli campaign.
It marks the spot where King George V reviewed the men of the 29th Division in 1915 before they embarked for Gallipoli where they suffered heavy losses.
St George's Church War Memorial Cross in Deal, Kent, has been listed at Grade II*, and was originally a private family memorial to two sons, one of whom, Arthur Tisdall, was killed at Gallipoli.
He was in command of 13 Platoon, D Company, Anson Battalion, and was awarded a Victoria Cross for his bravery.
Later, it was decided to add the names of other men from the parish who died as the war progressed.
The Lancashire Fusiliers memorial, in Gallipoli Gardens, Bury, Greater Manchester, has been upgraded from Grade II to Grade II*.
The regiment suffered notably heavy losses when a large allied force landed in the Dardanelles intending to take Constantinople from the Turks.
In a ten-month stalemate, more than 1,800 Fusiliers were killed, and the regiment was awarded six Victoria Crosses.
Three commemorative ceremonies will be held in London on the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings on 25 April.
There will also be a service in Gallipoli, in Turkey, the day before.
Troops from Australia and New Zealand also took part in the campaign and the date of the landings is known as Anzac Day.
