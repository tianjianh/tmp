After his loan spell at Orient he moved back to Tottenham, making his first appearance in the second leg of their Europa League match against Hearts.
He went on to play six times in the cup and scored his first Tottenham goal against Shamrock Rovers.
In late December Kane decided to go on loan to Millwall until the the end of 2012 season and scored nine goals in 27 appearances.
His efforts meant he was awarded Millwall's Young Player of the Season award.
Kane spent pre-season with Tottenham in the 2012-2013 season and made his Premier League debut, when he came off the bench, during a match against Newcastle United.
In the summer of 2012 he joined Norwich City on loan for the full season but got hit with an early injury and had to go back to Tottenham for treatment.
At the start of 2013 he moved to Leicester City on loan for the rest of the season, to help with their push for promotion from the Championship into the Premier League.
He scored on his debut but only made 13 appearances.
His good form started in last year's season when he scored his first goal at White Hart Lane in the League Cup.

After such an amazing season England boss Roy Hodgson couldn't resist calling him up to the international squad for the first time for the games against Lithuania and Italy.
But England captain Wayne Rooney has warned everyone to give Kane time to adjust and not expect him to score as many goals internationally as he has in the league this season.
Rooney said, "Although he has done really well, we have to give him room to breathe rather than smothering him and demanding a lot at an early age."
England Vs Lithuania kicks off at 7.45pm on Friday at Wembley Stadium.
