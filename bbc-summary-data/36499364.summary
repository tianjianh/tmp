Piper helps to keep the runway clear at a small airport in Michigan in America.
Sometimes birds can cause problems for planes and helicopters as they try to take off, so some airports use loud noises to try to scare them away.
However, this airport says that Piper has been much more effective at keeping the birds away by barking at them and chasing them.
