[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leadership contender Liz Kendall has dismissed calls for her to pull out of the contest and back another candidate to defeat Jeremy Corbyn.

It follows a YouGov poll for the Times putting left-winger Mr Corbyn ahead in the race and Ms Kendall fourth.
Senior Labour figures, including ex-PM Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson, have warned against a victory for Mr Corbyn.
But Ms Kendall aides said suggestions she should back Andy Burnham or Yvette Cooper were "not going to happen."
Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor, said "pressure has been mounting" on Ms Kendall to withdraw from the race.
But our correspondent said aides to the Leicester West MP dismissed the calls, accusing Mr Burnham's and Ms Cooper's camps of "fuelling" the idea.
One source said: "Both Andy and Yvette have seen their numbers fall this week following the flip flop over welfare and that's what is making these campaigns try and make Liz somehow the problem to distract from their own issues."
The source said that under the preference voting system it would not make any difference, even if Ms Kendall pulled out.
The Labour leadership race has been the subject of widespread debate after a YouGov poll this week suggested that in the final round of voting Mr Corbyn could finish six points ahead of bookmakers' favourite Mr Burnham.
The poll suggested Mr Corbyn could receive 43% of first preference votes, ahead of Mr Burnham on 26%, Ms Cooper on 20% and Ms Kendall on 11%.
Taking second preferences into account, the poll - of 1,054 people eligible to vote in the contest and carried out between Friday and Tuesday - pointed to a 6% victory for Mr Corbyn.
Speaking to the Times, Lord Mandelson warned the Labour Party's existence as "an electoral force" was at stake.
"Those of us who stayed and fought to save the Labour party in the 1980s will be experiencing a growing sense of deja vu," he told the Times.
"The last five years have left us with a terrible legacy to overcome with the existence of the Labour Party as an effective electoral force now at stake."
On Tuesday, former prime minister Mr Blair warned Labour would not win again from a "traditional leftist platform".
Mr Blair said Labour the leadership contest was being presented as a choice "between heart and head", but added that people who said their heart was with Mr Corbyn should "get a transplant".
And former adviser to Mr Blair, John McTernan, told BBC Newsnight two of the candidates should withdraw in favour of an "anyone but Corbyn" candidate.
Labour is due to announce its new leader at a special conference on 12 September.
