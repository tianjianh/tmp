The 25-year-old, who previously played for Pro12 outfit Scarlets between 2013 and 2016, returned to Ebbw Vale for his second spell with the club in June.
While on the books at Scarlets, Lewis played 36 times for the region's feeder club Llanelli, scoring 353 points.
"Josh is a promising fly-half," Bath's director of rugby Todd Blackadder said.
"Josh will provide added depth and competition, which will undoubtedly help to drive the team forward," the former All Black told the club website.
"He's shown glimpses of what he can do in Wales and I'm excited to see him fulfil his potential here at Bath."
Lewis added: "It's a huge opportunity for me to continue developing my all-round game, and I'm looking forward to the challenge."
