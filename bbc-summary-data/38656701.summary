A low-scoring match saw the pair share the first two frames before the Australian opened up a 4-1 lead.
England's world number 14 Carter pulled it back to 4-3, but the 2012 Masters champion won the next before clinching victory with a 117 break.
Earlier, Marco Fu beat Judd Trump 6-5 in a thrilling final-frame decider.
Hong Kong's Fu had fallen 3-0 and 4-2 behind, but recovered to make breaks of 80 and 102 in the last two frames.

Englishman Trump started brightly with breaks of 102, 87 and 67, and further runs of 79 and 112 took him one away from victory, before Fu fought back.
Fu, runner-up in 2010, faces Northern Ireland's Mark Allen in the next round at Alexandra Palace on Thursday.
A high-class encounter saw the pair make 14 breaks over 50 in the best-of-11 match.
Fu's victory was the third first-round match to go to a decider following O'Sullivan's win over Liang Wenbo and Allen's victory over John Higgins.
"I have done it the hard way," he told BBC Sport. "I missed three balls and was 3-0 down. I just tried to concentrate on the good things I had been doing.
"Maybe there was a few nerves at the start. No matter how many tournaments you have won, this is an extra buzz."
Last month, Fu was 4-1 down before winning eight frames in a row to beat Higgins in the Scottish Open final to claim the third ranking title of his career.
Fu added: "When I am in good form, I handle the mistakes better now. I feel stronger when I miss a few balls, it does not matter to me, I can keep going."

I feel sorry for Judd, he did not have a single chance in the final frame but Marco took those last few balls well.
It was an absolutely wonderful spectacle. Fu is 39 and playing the best snooker of his career.
