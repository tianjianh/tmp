Wales coach Warren Gatland has named an entirely new XV to the side beaten 39-21 by the All Blacks at Eden Park.
Bradley Davies and Alun Wyn Jones started at lock last Saturday, but Charteris hopes to begin the second Test in Wellington.
"It's a good opportunity," said the 33-year-old, who has 66 Wales caps.
"If you don't believe you've got a shot at making the Test team there's no point playing."
Wales are looking to end a run of 27 consecutive defeats by the All Blacks - a winless run stretching back to 1953 - and to beat New Zealand for the first time on their own soil.
Charteris admits Tuesday's game against the Chiefs is an audition for the second Test in Wellington, but says Wales must avoid playing as individuals as they try to prove a point to selectors.
"As long as we stick to our structures and play as a team and are successful, then the boys will have a chance to put their hand up and hopefully put pressure on those who had the shirts on Saturday," he said.
Charteris leads Wales for the first time at the FMG Stadium Waikato, something he says came as "a bit of a surprise".
He added: "To be captain is obviously a big honour.
"I'm not much of a shouter, but hope to encourage the boys.
"If we all put the work in, put in the hard shift - which we'll need to do - then I'll be happy."
The Chiefs, second in Super Rugby's New Zealand conference, are without eight internationals for the game.
Charlie Ngatai, Brodie Retallick, Sam Cane, Tawera Kerr-Barlow, Seta Tamanivalu, Nathan Harris, Aaron Cruden and Damian McKenzie are all part of the New Zealand squad for the Test series and have not been released back to the Chiefs.
But Charteris says Wales will not take the two-time Super Rugby champions lightly, given they have won nine of their 12 games this season.
"They've obviously got a hell of a team and it must be a hell of a squad because those All Blacks boys haven't played every week," he said.
"They've got some very dangerous players, some very good strike runners out in the backs and their pack is one of the best in the competition.
"They are very well organised, obviously very well coached.
"At line-out time and scrum time, they're going to pose a real problem for us because they've been together that long and know each other that well.
"That will be a big challenge for us."
