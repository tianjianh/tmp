The single-decker vehicle crashed into the front of the property in Holmer Green, near High Wycombe, on Saturday afternoon.
Three passengers were injured, and a man and woman inside the house in Wycombe Road were also hurt. No-one else on the bus was injured, it is understood.
Carousel Buses has been approached for comment.
"Fortunately the two occupants of the property were able to leave the property with only minor injuries," a police spokesman said.
A structural engineer and contractors were working with a recovery team on Sunday to try to remove the bus, which was left embedded in the front of the house.
Police have appealed for people with information to contact them but no-one was arrested.
The spokesman said: "It was lucky no-one sustained serious injury."
