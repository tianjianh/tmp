Jimmy Savile abuse reports: At-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newly published reports on Jimmy Savile's links with hospitals and children's homes reveal the late DJ abused patients, staff and visitors at institutions over many years.

The main focus is on Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, where he is believed to have assaulted more than 60 people - the youngest aged eight.
Other reports on NHS hospitals and a Department for Education investigation into Savile's abuse have also been published.
The BBC looks at the key revelations.
The report found Jimmy Savile was an "opportunistic predator" who abused victims between 1968-92.
Savile had full and unsupervised access to all areas of the hospital for more than 20 years - even to clinical areas.
The entertainer sexually abused more than 60 patients, staff and visitors at the hospital. This included an eight-year-old patient, a pregnant mother in her 20s, and a 19-year-old paralysed woman in a wheelchair. Almost half the victims were under 16, and the crimes included rapes.
Savile's reputation as a "sex pest" was an "open secret" among junior staff and some middle managers. Working as a hospital porter, he was given a room in an accommodation block used by female students.
A number of Savile's victims complained to staff but none of the informal complaints were "taken seriously or escalated to senior management". One formal complaint made by a patient's father was dropped due to the victim's ill health, but it should have been reported to police.
Senior managers at the hospital were probably never told about Savile's inappropriate behaviour or the sexual assault claims.
Over the past 40 years, Stoke Mandeville employed three doctors who were subsequently convicted of sex crimes against patients.
A woman who was a patient at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the 1970s has described being sexually assaulted there by Jimmy Savile when she was 18. She said: "It was repulsive, it was horrible... I was stunned." The woman told nurses about the assault, but was advised to ignore Savile. "They thought it was funny really," she said.
Another woman who worked as a nurse at the same hospital said the abuse she had been subjected to had "ruined" a decade of her life.  She told the BBC Savile had sexually abused her over an 18-month period - when she was aged 17 to 19 - assaulting her when she had been preparing milk feeds for children and even after she had been admitted to the staff sick bay.
A report by former barrister and NHS executive Kate Lampard reviewed how Savile could have abused victims at some 40 NHS hospitals across the country and set out lessons learned.
She warned elements of the Savile story could happen again, and said there would always be people who tried to gain undue influence within institutions such as hospitals.
She also indicated "the need for us to examine safeguarding arrangements in NHS hospitals, the raising of complaints and matters of concern, and how managers and staff respond to complaints".
Reports into Savile's activities in relation to other hospitals and hospice premises have been published. A total of 44 reports have now been published. The latest include:
The DfE has reviewed reports by local authorities into allegations of abuse by Savile at number of children's homes and schools.
Children's Minister Edward Timpson said none of the investigations had been able to reach "firm conclusions" about whether abuse took place.
"Although many of them say the informant was credible, the lack of corroborating evidence has prevented them from reaching a definitive conclusion," he said.
Dr Androulla Johnstone, lead investigator into Stoke Mandeville abuse, told a press conference: "All NHS services should be alert to predatory sexual offenders like Savile who can be placed in a position of trust and authority." She said those to whom the attacks were reported had ''failed'' in their duty to protect, but denied allegations of a "cover-up" by staff.
Hattie Llewelyn-Davies, Buckinghamshire NHS Trust chair, said: "On behalf of the NHS organisations that existed at that time and those that exist now, I would like to say sorry to all of Jimmy Savile's victims. I know how difficult it must have been for you to come forward and tell your stories after such a long time."
Lawyer Liz Dux, who represents 44 of the Stoke Mandeville victims, said it "beggars belief" that the report had found no evidence of senior staff having been aware of the abuse.
A Downing Street spokeswoman announced that a consultation on possible mandatory reporting of child abuse would now be extended to cover vulnerable adults. She said the PM's view was that "we absolutely must look at what lessons can be learnt from today".
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said people were "too dazzled or too intimidated to confront the evil predator we now know [Savile] was", but that vulnerable people had been let down. He said he would be accepting 13 recommendations in principle that were made in Ms Lampard's report.
Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham called for a more formal inquiry into the role of the Department of Health, ministers and hospital chiefs in giving Savile power at Stoke Mandeville. He said: "The question that will be growing in the minds of people hearing this news today is this, 'Where is the accountability?'"
