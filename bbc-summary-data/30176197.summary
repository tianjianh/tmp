Rare film has been captured of the anglerfish, or black seadevil, off the coast of California.

The female anglerfish, which appeared in the animated film Finding Nemo, has a distinctive illuminated rod hanging from its head.
Researchers from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) spotted the fish at a depth of 600m.
"Deep-sea anglerfish are strange and elusive creatures," said Bruce Robson from the organisation.
"[They] are very rarely observed in their natural habitat.
"Fewer than half a dozen have ever been captured on film or video by deep diving research vehicles."
The fish is named Melanocetus and the example in the film is thought to be 9cm in length.
In the video narrated by Mr Robson, he described how the light attached to the fish is used to attract prey.
"When a fish or a squid swims up, it is quickly inhaled by the angler's huge mouth and trapped by its long sharp teeth," said Mr Robson.
He explained that males of the species were much smaller and lacked the illumination and pole.
The fish in the video has a broken tooth.
"We have no idea whether it will be replaced by another when it falls off," said Mr Robson. "So far, as we know, there is no tooth fairy in the deep ocean."
The anglerfish had a role in Finding Nemo when she tried to entice Dory and Marlin with her light.
