The show, a romantic drama set in the American South in the 1920s and '40s, received five nominations but left Sunday's ceremony empty-handed.
The show, which opened in New York in February, will close on 26 June.
Martin confirmed the news on Twitter, telling fans they had "two more weeks-ish" to see its "incredible" cast.
"Thank you for shining so brightly for us!" the show's producers wrote on their own Twitter feed.
Martin and Brickell performed with the show's cast at Sunday's Tony awards, where Bright Star was up for five awards including best musical.
The show, which tells of an unwed mother whose daughter is put up for adoption, received positive reviews but has earned only moderate returns at the box office.
Martin and Brickell have recorded two albums together: 2013's Love Has Come for You and 2015's So Familiar.
The first album, whose title track won its creators a Grammy for best American roots song, formed the basis of their on-stage collaboration.
This year's Tonys were dominated by hip-hop musical Hamilton, which received a record 16 nominations and ended up winning 11.
