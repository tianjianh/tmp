Report reveals Garda financial irregularities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Garda Síochána (Irish police) is to publish a report on financial irregularities at its training college.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The force's internal audit section examined financial transactions over a number of years at the college in Templemore, County Tipperary.
Its report revealed that money was being spent on gifts and entertainment, and identified a non-transparent system of accounting.
The Garda has been embroiled in a number of controversies recently.
Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan said that while the accounting practices would not be acceptable by today's standards, there was no misappropriation of money or misuse of public funds.
Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Frances Fitzgerald told the Dáil (parliament) on Tuesday that the report raises serious governance issues and will be referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee.
Meanwhile, Commissioner O'Sullivan is to give evidence to the Oireachtas (parliamentary) Committee on Justice and Equality on Thursday.
She will face questions over revelations on fixed charge notices and breathalyser test figures.
Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin of Sinn Féin, who chairs the Justice and Equality Committee, said members wanted assurances "that there can be no repeat of these outrageous facts".
On Tuesday, the government announced it was planning two investigations into the Garda.
Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny announced an independent review of the force.
A second investigation will probe the wrongful convictions of almost 15,000 motorists, and apparent false data on breath tests.
Last week, it emerged that almost one million drink-driving tests recorded by police in the Republic of Ireland did not actually take place.
In addition, police have admitted a separate error that caused almost 15,000 wrongful traffic convictions.
Mr Kenny also said on Tuesday that the government continues to have confidence in Commissioner O'Sullivan.
She was already facing questions over her leadership because of allegations of a smear campaign against a whistleblower, Sgt Maurice McCabe.
Sgt McCabe was one of two officers who raised concerns years ago about the alleged deletion of penalty points from the driving licences of well-connected offenders.
Speaking during Leaders' Questions in the Dáil (parliament), Mr Kenny said of the independent review: "We continue to see a list of unacceptable revelations about the operation of An Garda Síochána.
"The government believes that the level of public concern is now so profound that it's now time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent, root-and-branch review of An Garda Siochana."
Exact details of the independent review are to be outlined next week.
In the meantime, an external inquiry is being set up into the erroneous Garda statistics and prosecutions.
The Garda commissioner is also due to meet the chairwoman of the Policing Authority, one of the force's watchdogs, over her handling of the scandal before the end of the week.
