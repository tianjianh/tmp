Brian McKandie was found beaten to death with a "heavy weapon" in his home in Rothienorman on 12 March.
Police Scotland released CCTV of a Subaru Impreza.
Det Ch Insp Iain Smith said: "The owner of the vehicle has been spoken to and we can confirm it is unrelated to the investigation."
He explained: "We are still appealing to the public for help in identifying two vehicles which were seen at Mr McKandie's address on 11 March.
"The vehicles are an old-style silver Ford Fiesta motor car and a burgundy/maroon coloured estate car, possibly a Volvo.
"In addition we would like to hear from anyone who knew customers of Mr McKandie or who was a customer."
Police believe he may have known his killer.
Crimestoppers has offered the reward of up to Â£10,000 for information that leads to conviction in the case. The charity stressed the reward would only be paid if information was passed to Crimestoppers directly.
