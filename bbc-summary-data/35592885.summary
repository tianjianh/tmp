[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby climbed to fifth in the Championship table as Jacob Butterfield's goal against Blackburn earned a first home league win of 2016.

Butterfield produced a fine finish from the edge of the area after the Rovers defence had failed to clear properly.
The visitors, with one win in 11 league games, had plenty of possession but struggled to create chances.
They went close to equalising in stoppage time when midfielder Jordi Gomez headed against the bar.
Having gone eight league matches without a victory, Derby have now won back-to-back games for the first time since December.
Blackburn, who are eight points above the relegation zone, had a great chance to equalise before the interval.
Danny Graham, a former Derby loan signing, held off Richard Keogh before turning Jason Shackell.
But from 10 yards out he spooned the ball over the bar.

"We challenged the players before the game that we would like a clean sheet and I thought the two centre-halves were magnificent, they headed everything. Blackburn threw everything into the box and I thought we defended magnificently.
"That's six points in two games, back-to-back wins home and away and I'm very pleased for the players because they've put in a shift and have been brilliant in the last two games."
Blackburn Rovers manager Paul Lambert:
"I am proud of the way we played, there's a way to lose a game and I thought we were excellent. We have been playing well for a few weeks, there were some big performances, and I think the lads are starting to play.
"We had some great positions and maybe the one thing you could say was we never had the right weight of pass or the right decision. But other than that, for work rate and endeavour, we couldn't ask for any more."
