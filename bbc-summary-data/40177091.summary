Wadsworth trial: Jury retires to consider verdict

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury trying two ex-BBC radio presenters accused of sex offences against under-age boys has retired to consider its verdict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Wadsworth, 69, and his wife Julie, 60, of Leicestershire, deny five charges of outraging public decency.
Mrs Wadsworth also denies 11 charges of indecent assault and her husband denies nine allegations of the same offence.
She accepts having sexual encounters with "young men" but has repeatedly denied they were under age.
Mr Wadsworth has told Warwick Crown Court he was present when sexual activity took place in a secluded area between his wife and males but they were not under the age of consent.
Prosecutors allege the couple, from Broughton Astley, encouraged under-age boys to take part in sexual activity in woodland near Atherstone between 1992 and 1996.
Barristers representing the couple told the court on Monday they were victims of "poisonous and untrue" allegations made by one of their alleged victims.
