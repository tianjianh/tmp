Maxwell's protest at the awarding of a penalty, which cost victory at home to Sheffield United, led to him being hit by an "object" thrown from the crowd.
Maxwell was left with a similar facial injury to the one suffered by West Bromwich Albion's Chris Brunt.
"The response from the referee was that it was his own fault," said Pressley.
"It was not just heard by Chris Maxwell. It was heard by another witness, another of our players. We will make sure that we report that type of comment to the appropriate governing body, as it is completely unacceptable within the game.
"Chris was hit with an object. It was a bit like the Chris Brunt incident. It could quite easily have taken his eye out.
"The one thing we can't accept is a comment like that from an official.
"Regardless of Chris Maxwell's actions, nothing can condone what then occurred. That type of comment is totally unacceptable."
Boyeson was officiating at the Highbury Stadium as a late replacement for the originally appointed senior match official Richard Clark.
BBC Sport has contacted the Football League but is yet to receive a reply.
West Bromwich Albion's Chris Brunt was recently struck by a coin thrown by one of the Baggies' own following after the FA Cup fifth-round exit at Reading. He had gone to the away fans' section to give his shirt to a fan. Police made an arrest.
On the same weekend, Chelsea said they would impose life bans on supporters who threw coins at Manchester City players.
The Football Association is also investigating alleged coin-throwing incidents on the same day at Stoke and QPR.
An object was allegedly thrown at Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland during his side's 2-1 victory over Aston Villa, while QPR players were apparently targeted as they celebrated a goal in their 2-0 Championship win over Birmingham City.
Police made three arrests at Loftus Road, one for racially aggravated assault on a police officer, one for entering the pitch and one for a public order offence. All three men arrested have been bailed pending further enquiries.
