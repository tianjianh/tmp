The 29-year-old takes over from Glen Chapple, who has become part of cricket director Ashley Giles' backroom staff in a player-coach role.
Liverpool-born Smith has spent his whole career at Old Trafford and was the club's player of the year in 2014.
"I was lucky enough to have an meeting with Ashley and he offered the job," he told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"I was over the moon. It's not every day you get to captain your boyhood club that you've grown up with and it's a truly great honour."
Last summer, Smith took over 50 wickets in the County Championship for the first time and hit 773 runs, including seven half centuries, but they were relegated to Division Two.
The Red Rose have also confirmed that fellow all-rounder Steven Croft will be vice-captain for the upcoming season.
