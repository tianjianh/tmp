A wayward emu found wandering around a driveway in Cambridgeshire has been reunited with its owner after an appeal by the RSPCA.

Nicknamed Eric by the charity, the bird was discovered after going walkabout in the village of Kirtling, near Newmarket, on Saturday evening.
His owner Anne-Marie Kirby, who lives nearby, came forward on Tuesday to claim her emu, whose name is Monty.
She said she was thrilled he was back, as was his emu "girlfriend" Mathilda.
Inquisitive Monty took a stroll along a driveway in The Street after being "spooked by something" on Saturday, the RSPCA said.
He was captured by the homeowners and kept in their stable overnight.
RSPCA inspector Jane Folly appealed for his owner to come forward, believing the tame emu was someone's pet.
"This must have been quite an unexpected sight for the member of the public - not the sort of animal they normally see walking up their driveway," she added.
Ms Kirby said she was very relieved Monty was safely back with Mathilda, who had been "pining" for him.
