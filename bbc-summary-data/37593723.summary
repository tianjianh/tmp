[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 3-1 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City moved top of the Championship after a deserved win over bottom side Rotherham United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wes Hoolahan twisted and turned smartly inside the area before rolling in the opening goal as the hosts dominated.
The Canaries had plenty of chances to double their lead before Cameron Jerome touched Hoolahan's cross into the net.
Dexter Blackstock turned in Darnell Fisher's cross for his first Rotherham goal, but Steven Naismith's tap-in sealed the points.
Hoolahan and Alex Pritchard combined well to cause plenty of problems, and the Canaries duly extended their unbeaten league run over United to 10 matches and leapfrogged previous leaders Huddersfield.
However, the Yorkshire club can go back to the top with victory over Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday.
Rotherham offered little in attack, but gave the home fans a few nervous moments late on with Jon Taylor having a goal ruled out for offside when he turned in a rebound.
The Millers, who have won just one of their past 17 league matches, remain three points adrift at the bottom.
Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"We had a lot of the ball, created lots of chances and the only complaint I could make is that we didn't win the game by a bigger margin.
"In the first half I thought we were a little bit wasteful because it could easily have been 3-0 at half-time and I don't think they would have had any complaints.
"When we made it 2-0 I thought we would comfortably see out the game but then a wee bit of sloppiness on our part lets them back into it.
"I think we are where we deserve to be (at the top of the table) because you don't get there by chance. But as I keep saying there is a long way to go yet."
Rotherham boss Alan Stubbs:
"We were playing against a Premier League group of players in all but name and when we made it 2-1 we gave them a little scare.
"Norwich are a good side and they deserved to win the game but the lads gave it a good go and had we been up against a lesser side we might have got something from it.
"It's the easiest thing in the world to accept your fate, it's much harder not to accept it and go out there and try and do something about it. That's what I told the players at half-time and I thought they did well in the second half.
"The lads are going out there and doing the best they can and that is all you can ask of them. If they keep doing that, and keep working hard, things will turn for them, I am sure of that."
