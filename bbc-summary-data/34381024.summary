Sex with offender police officer Clare Sherman-Potts sacked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Suffolk police officer has been dismissed for having a sexual relationship with a "prolific" offender.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clare Sherman-Potts, 25, who had been working with offenders, was told by Temporary Chief Constable Gareth Wilson at a disciplinary hearing that she had a "glowing record to this point".
The hearing revealed the relationship began following a party in Ipswich in April.
She was dismissed for gross misconduct.
The case was heard at Suffolk Police headquarters at Martlesham Heath, where the offender was only referred to as "Mr A".
The hearing was told that on 2 June she spoke to someone, described as "non-police", about the relationship and was advised she needed to inform the Police Professional Standards Department.
She made "full disclosure" on 4 June.
Mr Wilson said she had had an "exemplary record" after five years of service and had worked with offenders since November.
She would have been aware her relationship was inappropriate, but had continued to supervise Mr A.
She had breached two Police Conduct Regulations - honesty and integrity, and discreditable conduct.
Mr Wilson said he had two options - a final written warning or dismissal without notice - but said the circumstances were "so serious" he had to choose the latter.
PC Sherman-Potts was represented at the hearing by the Police Federation - the professional association for rank-and-file officers.
Mick Richardson, the federation's secretary in Suffolk, said she had offered her resignation four months ago, but legislation did not allow officers to resign when charged with gross misconduct.
He said: "Officers are under an awful lot of stress and she followed her heart and not her head.
"I have no problems with these hearings being public, however, I don't support the idea that an officer should be disallowed from resigning or retiring ahead of that hearing."
