Notts County chief executive Jason Turner will now also fill the role at the Women's Super League One side.
"Although it hasn't always been easy, it's been a very rewarding role," Alexander told the club website.
"I would like to thank all the players and the staff for their hard work in what has been a tough season, with lots of challenges for everyone involved."
Notts County Ladies are sixth in WSL1 ahead of Sunday's home game against Chelsea.
