Public Health England (PHE) said it was investigating 11 confirmed cases following visits to Huntley's Country Store, Samlesbury, near Preston.
PHE advised anyone feeling unwell after attending a lambing event staged at the farm outlet between 29 March and 24 April to seek medical help.
It said the farm store no longer posed a risk to the public.
The health body said three people remained in hospital following complications from the E. coli O157 infection. A fourth person has been discharged and is recovering at home.

PHE said all contact between animals and the public at the premises had now ceased so there was no longer any risk to the public.
PHE consultant for Cumbria and Lancashire Dr Ken Lamden said the outbreak is believed to have started before Easter.
"Investigations are still on going and all public health measures have been put in place," he said.
"The owners are co-operating fully and we are working closely with them and with colleagues across health and local authorities."
He said symptoms of E. coli O157 included bloody diarrhoea, which could be serious, or milder forms of the infection which are usually "self-limiting" and clear within seven days.
Dr Lamden said the best protection against E. coli O157 was thorough handwashing particularly after contact with animals, after going to the toilet, after handling raw meat products and before eating.
