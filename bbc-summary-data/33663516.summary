[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a Northern Ireland man who died Ibiza have requested a second post-mortem examination as efforts continue to repatriate his body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Drennan, from Newtownabbey, County Antrim, was found dead in his hotel room on Sunday, less than 24 hours after police escorted him off a plane.
Friends of the 21-year-old have claimed he sustained head injuries in custody.
However, Spanish police say there were no sign of violence when they carried out an autopsy on Mr Drennan.
The family's solicitor, Michael Madden, told the BBC that a problem with the paperwork in Ibiza means that his body may not be brought back home until Monday.
The Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, a charity based in Newry, County Down, is assisting the Drennan family with the repatriation arrangements.
The Republic of Ireland's state pathologist is on standby to carry out a post-mortem when the body arrives in Dublin.
