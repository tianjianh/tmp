Benin have been preparing to host Equatorial Guinea in an 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Sunday despite being banned from global football.

The Confederation of African Football (Caf) has told BBC Sport that no decision has yet been made on whether to cancel the Group C match.
The Fifa Congress gave its Council the power to readmit Benin.
The suspension can be lifted when a new  Benin Football Federation (FBF) Executive Committee has been installed.
Fifa suspended the FBF from global football after a court ruling in the country blocked upcoming elections.
Benin's minister of sport Oswald Homeky said: "We are still in discussions with the protagonists of the crisis in the football federation. We remain hopeful."
A Squirrels squad is in Cotonou training for the match while the already eliminated Equatorial Guinea cancelled a friendly against Uzbekistan in Tashkent on Thursday, because of the qualifier.
The Equatorial Guinea Football Federation say they are hopeful that they can re-organise the friendly against Uzbekistan as soon as possible.
If there is no word from Fifa then Benin will be disqualified from the Nations Cup campaign.
"If by the date of their game they are still banned they will be logically eliminated," Caf explained.
Fifa say they are following the situation in Benin.
"We are monitoring the situation. While there seems to be some progress, we can't anticipate any outcome," world football's governing body told BBC Sport.
Benin are currently the best second-placed side in the competition with eight points.
They are two points behind Mali who play South Sudan on Saturday in the other match in the group.
