A woman and two teenage boys have been jailed following a drugs turf war which led to the stabbing of a man in Essex.

Drug dealer Anton Levin, 24, from Dagenham, east London, was found dead at a flat in Southend in November.
Chelmsford Crown Court heard the killing involved rival drug gangs.
Danielle Russell, 26, was jailed for 11 years and six months and two boys - aged 16 and 17 - were sentenced to 10 years and four months each. They had all been found guilty of manslaughter.
All three were also found guilty of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm on another man and guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery.
Mr Levin was stabbed and died at Russell's flat in St Ann's Road on 19 November.
He had just graduated from Greenwich University.
The court was told Russell lured Mr Levin and his friend Abdullatif Abdulkadir to her flat.
There the two teenagers - one from Thurrock and the other from Basildon - and a 27-year-old man, who has now fled the country, were waiting for them.
Mr Abdulkadir told the court his friend was stabbed in the femoral artery.
Judge Christopher Bell said the killing was part of a pattern he had seen across Essex - of drug dealers coming out of London and encroaching on the turf of existing drug gangs in the county.
He also praised the "outstanding police work" that led to the arrest of the young men, two days after the attack.
Ch Insp Simon Werrett said: "This was another unnecessary death linked to gang activity in Essex.
"The defendants have never any shown remorse for the attack and the needless loss of life."
