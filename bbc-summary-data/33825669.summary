Republican 2016 debate: How it unfolded on Twitter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A total of 10 candidates made the cut for the first televised Republican debate in the 2016 presidential race - but the focus was always going to be on frontrunner Donald Trump.

The billionaire businessman has dominated headlines since descending on an escalator in Trump Tower, New York, to announce his candidacy in June.
Thursday's debate offered his rivals a chance to close the gap on the outspoken populist - but would they seize the opportunity?
First they were forced to stand around looking awkward while the Fox News presenters waited for the green light.
Once the beauty pageant was over, it was presenter Megyn Kelly who took aim at Mr Trump, asking him about derogatory comments he's made in the past about women.
Mr Trump was having none of it though, insisting he'd only taken issue with one woman - liberal actress Rosie O'Donnell - before rallying against political correctness. The crowd loved it.
Ms O'Donnell, presumably watching at home, was less enthused.
Each of the candidates eventually got a chance to speak, although some of them took a less obvious line than others - like neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
Jeb Bush, the early frontrunner who has slipped behind Mr Trump in recent polls, was eager to point out he was more than just another Bush. Unfortunately, he chose slightly ambiguous language.
The audience were still scratching their heads when Ted Cruz popped up to say what America really needed was its own version of Egyptian strongman Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, which struck some as a bit odd.
Mr Trump then reappeared to clarify his relationship with Democrat rival Hillary Clinton. Sure, he'd spoken to her husband on the phone and given money to her in the past, he told the audience, but he had an explanation.
Around this point, a few of the candidates were finding it hard to get a word in. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker looked a little lost and Ben Carson seemed to have disappeared.
Chris Christie and Rand Paul, however, were determined to be heard and went into battle against each other over mass surveillance and fighting terrorism. It got pretty personal pretty quickly.
While the others caught their breath, Mr Trump returned to talk about building a wall along America's border with Mexico to tackle illegal immigrants.
This is a favoured topic for the businessman but it was the first time he'd mentioned including "a big beautiful door" on the wall to let legal immigrants through.
Earlier in the night, Rick Perry had been forced to deny saying "Ronald Raven" in the second-tier Republican debate - sending Twitter's meme-makers into meltdown.
So, did anyone manage to deliver a fatal blow? We'll have to wait for the next round of polls to find out.
Meanwhile, in the blue corner...
