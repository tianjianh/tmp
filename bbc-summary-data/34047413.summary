Tomorrow Come Today, by bestselling sci-fi novelist Gordon Dahlquist, was named the winner of the James Tait Black prize for drama.
The Brooklyn-based playwright picked up his award at a ceremony in Edinburgh.
The two other shortlisted dramas were The James Plays by Rona Munro and Incognito by Nick Payne.
The prize was launched in 2012 when Britain's oldest literary awards, the James Tait Black Prizes, were extended to include a new category for drama.
It is presented and judged by students and staff at the University of Edinburgh in association with Playwrights' Studio, Scotland and the Traverse Theatre.
Tomorrow Come Today is set in the near future where the wealthy are able to prolong life by switching their bodies for newer, healthier ones.
It was first produced by Undermain Theatre in Texas.
Rona Munro's trilogy chart the lives and deaths of King James I, II and III of Scotland, who ruled the country throughout the 15th century.
Incognito by Nick Payne interweaves three stories, all focussing on neuroscience.
Chair of the judging panel and Regius Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at the University of Edinburgh, Greg Walker, said: "All three shortlisted plays display striking and original talent and each has made a lasting impact in theatre - making it a very challenging job to select a winner.
"The engaging innovation of Gordon Dahlquist's ominous science fiction drama stood out in the end, and we are delighted to celebrate his work at this evening's event."
Previous winners of the drama prize include Rory Mullarkey's Cannibals and The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning by Tim Rice.
