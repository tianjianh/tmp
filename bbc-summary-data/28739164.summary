Parts of Scotland have been badly hit by high winds and heavy rain in the wake of what was Hurricane Bertha.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has almost 40 flood warnings in place, covering Aberdeenshire, Speyside, Moray, Caithness and Sutherland, and Tayside.
Moray Council said it was evacuating about 200 homes at risk of flooding in Elgin.
And ScotRail said train travel was being severely impacted by flooding.
Forecasters said more heavy rain and strong winds were likely overnight, affecting much of Scotland.
They warned of difficult driving conditions and the risk of further localised flooding, with gales around exposed northern coasts.
It advised commuters to avoid rail travel between Aberdeen and Inverness, and Perth and Inverness.
Elgin was one of the worst affected areas. Reader Alastair Mackie said the main rail line "looks more like a canal".
Roads in Moray and the Highlands were badly hit.
Among the worst affected routes were the A838 Durness to Tongue road, which was closed at the south end of Loch Eriboll.
The B873 Altnaharra to Syre road has been shut at Grumbeg Bridge, while fallen trees have closed the B827 Skiach to Evanton road.
The A835 was also shut by a landslip near Ullapool, disrupting travel between the town and Inverness. Part of the A938 at Duthil near Carrbridge fell away.
The Keith Show was cancelled due to the severe weather.
The Met Office's amber warning for rain - meaning "be prepared" - is for the Grampian and Highlands and Eilean Siar areas, and there is a wider yellow warning for the rest of eastern and northern Scotland.
By early Monday morning, Lossiemouth had recorded almost a month's rainfall in 12 hours, while gusts of 50mph swept through Aberdeenshire.
