The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the APL Vanda was towed into Southampton port on Saturday night.
It said the port's vessel traffic services sent eight tugs to help the 369m-long (1,210ft) ship, which was forced to carry out a "controlled grounding" at Bramble Bank.
The agency said no damage or pollution had been reported.
