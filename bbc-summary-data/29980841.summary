The men behind Do They Know It's Christmas are expected to announce the line-up on Monday for Band Aid 30.
Bob Geldof and Midge Ure first gathered a group of musicians together in 1984, raising Â£8m for famine relief in Ethiopia.
Do They Know It's Christmas was recorded again in 1989 and 2004.
Geldof and Ure will be hoping to gather some of today's most popular music acts including One Direction, Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith.
It is thought the money raised will go towards the fight against Ebola in West Africa.
The original track featured the voices of George Michael, Bono from U2, Duran Duran and Bananarama, among others.
The single was the catalyst for the cross-continent Live Aid concerts in London and Philadelphia, which raised more than Â£40m.
The 1989 incarnation of Band Aid was produced by the Stock, Aitken and Waterman stable, largely featuring their artists such as Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Sonia.
Band Aid 20, marking 20 years of the record, included the likes of Coldplay, Dizzee Rascal, Ms Dynamite, Will Young and Robbie Williams.
Bono, Sir Paul McCartney and George Michael from the original record returned for the collaboration, which was released to raise money for Sudan's troubled Darfur region.
