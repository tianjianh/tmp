North and South Ayrshire councils are taking over services run by Premier Home Care (Scotland) Ltd after looking at a number of options.
The local authorities are hiring all 97 Premier staff affected by developments.
The change will take effect as soon as Premier ceases trading on Friday.
Premier has been providing home care services to 219 people in Ayrshire.
In North Ayrshire, 104 people receive 1,200 hours of care per week, while 115 receive a total of 884 hours in South Ayrshire.
North Ayrshire Council's cabinet member for health and social care, Anthea Dickson, said: "There were clearly a number of things we had to consider during our detailed talks with Premier Home Care and all other interested parties.
"But our primary concern was always the service users and ensuring there was no disruption to the service both in the short term and as we move forward in the longer term.
"We have a really good track record of care provision and I'm confident that by taking on the service in-house we can move forward seamlessly and continue to provide a high standard of care".
She added: "I'm also delighted we're able to safeguard the jobs of so many of the Premier Home Care employees."
South Ayrshire councillor Rita Miller, portfolio holder for health and social care, said: "I'm very pleased that, as far as our service users are concerned, it will be very much business as usual and we're contacting them directly to provide that reassurance. Our focus will be to ensure a smooth and seamless transition over the weekend and the continued provision of the best possible service."
