The university said staff are assisting the police in every possible way in looking at a "support department".
An internal inquiry has also been ordered by the university.
Police Scotland confirmed the investigation is under way, and that it involves a former employee of the university.
A statement from the university said: "The University of Edinburgh alerted the police to an issue relating to potential financial irregularities within a support department.
"This is now the subject of an internal inquiry at the University and a Police Scotland investigation.
"The university will be assisting the police in every way possible with their inquiries. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time."
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "We have received a complaint regarding concerns over the management of finances at Edinburgh University by a former employee.
"The Economic Crime Unit has a positive line of inquiry and while our investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."
