The 19-year-old has been included in Wales' squad for the summer Tests against Tonga and Samoa.
Giles was called up for the senior squad as injury cover for last year's tour of New Zealand and was named for the autumn internationals but is yet to be capped.
"Growing up I wanted to play for Wales and get that cap," Giles told Scrum V.
"It would mean the world and be a proud moment for myself and my family.
"I've had a little taste of it in training and I'm more hungry than ever.
"Hopefully I can push on to keep fighting for that place and keep fighting for that jersey."
Giles was an unused replacement when Wales beat Japan in November and missed out on Six Nations selection through injury in his breakthrough season.
Swansea-born Giles made his Ospreys debut as a replacement against Treviso in September 2016, crossing for a try in 64-10 Pro12 win.
The Wales Under-20 international scored 14 tries during the 2016-17 season, including a hat-trick against Lyon in the European Challenge Cup.
