Glasgow Subway four-week closure set to begin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Subway is closing for four weeks while modernisation work is carried out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) said all services would be suspended from 2 July. They are due to resume on 1 August.
A replacement bus service is being provided for passengers during the closure.
It will follow the subway route, with additional direct services to the city centre operating from key stations.
'Life-expired'
SPT said the work was essential to ensure a reliable service in the future, and comes ahead of the introduction of driverless trains in 2020.
Strategic project manager at SPT Stuart McMillan said: "We need to replace the concrete and the rails in this section in order to maintain the on-going reliability of the service.
"This part of the system was installed in the 1970s modernisation and it's now life-expired and we need to take this work in advance of us bringing new trains into the system."
Park and ride facilities will be available at Bridge Street, Kelvinbridge and Shields Road. Services will run every five minutes at peak times and every 10 minutes during off-peak.
All passengers will pay £1 for a single journey, £2 for a return and £2.50 for an all-day ticket. Child fares will be 50p for a single and £1 for a return.
The Glasgow subway is the third oldest underground system in the world and is 120 years old this year.
It is currently undergoing a £288m modernisation plan to upgrade or replace trains, signalling, platforms and stations.
All the information on the subway suspension and the replacement bus service is available on the SPT website.
