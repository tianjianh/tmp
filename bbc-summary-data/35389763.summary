Defender Chris Bush headed home midway through the first half from Greg Tempest's corner to the back post.
Bush nearly doubled the home side's lead just before half-time but his effort was well saved by visiting keeper Steven Drench.
Guiseley's Nicky Boshell and Adam Boyes drew saves from Paul Farman, while the Imps' James Caton hit the bar late on.
Lincoln City manager Chris Moyses told BBC Radio Lincolnshire:

"We just wanted three points to put that bad run to a end. Three points doesn't describe the way we played but I'm just pleased we hung on in there and defended valiantly.
"It's just nice to win a game of football. They cut loose as they had to, but it was good to defend like we did and to have some nice bits of play and we could have had a couple of extra goals ourselves.
"Callum (Howe) and Luke (Waterfall) have done really well for us but there's no hiding the fact that we've been conceding goals so we needed to change something and that's what we did.
"What we've probably been missing is an old head and a strong experienced centre-half like Jamie [McCombe] is a massive asset."
