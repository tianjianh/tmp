Harry Studley was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital with a head injury after he was shot at a block of flats in Bishport Avenue, Hartcliffe, Bristol, on Friday afternoon.
Police said the shooting was a "potentially negligent act".
A man, 24, and a woman, 23, who are not related to the baby, have been arrested in connection with the shooting.
Harry's parents Amy Allen and Edward Studley said in a statement issued through the police: "We very much appreciate the help and support of our family, friends and local community at this very difficult time.
"We are concentrating our focus on our son Harry's recovery and would appreciate if we could have our privacy respected in order to allow us to do so."
Police, who believe Harry received the injury from one pellet, say they are not looking for anyone else.
Det Insp Jonathan Deane, from Avon and Somerset Police, said officers were focusing on "unravelling the full circumstances leading up to this tragedy".
He added: "Our thoughts are with the child's family and they are being given all the help and support they need.
"I'd like to thank the local community for their patience and understanding while we carry out our inquiries and reassurance patrols will be carried out tonight and tomorrow.
"If any residents have specific concerns then please speak to your neighbourhood team."
