The shooting of a man by police during a seven-hour siege in North Ayrshire is to be investigated by the PIRC.

Specialist firearms officers confronted the 24-year old on Saturday at about 12:15.
Police Scotland said his injuries were not life-threatening.
The man had barricaded himself into a property on Bankfaulds Avenue in Kilbirnie at about 05:30 and is said to have fired a crossbow.
The PIRC has now officially confirmed they will investigate. The injured man is being treated in hospital and nobody else was hurt.
It is thought to be the first time officers have used their guns in a real-life situation since the formation of Police Scotland on 1st April 2013.
Locals reported seeing smashed windows and a man waving a machete.
A spokeswoman for PIRC said: "The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner has been directed by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to investigate the discharge of a conventional firearm during an incident at a residential address in Kilbirnie.
"It is reported that during the incident, a 24-year-old man was shot by police at around 12:15, following the alleged discharge of a crossbow at officers.
"A report on the Commissioner's findings will be submitted to the COPFS in due course."
The injured man was taken by ambulance to Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, for treatment. Nobody else is being sought in connection with the incident.
In December 2015, Police Scotland staff gave visiting US law-enforcement leaders lessons on how to avoid gun use.
The Police Investigations & Review Commissioner (PIRC) is an independent organisation which investigates serious incidents involving the police. The PIRC also scrutinises the way police bodies in Scotland respond to complaints from members of the public.
