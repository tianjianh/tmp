Leigh Griffiths says a domestic treble will be "the last piece of the puzzle" for Celtic after they completed an unbeaten Scottish Premiership campaign.

Celtic's 2-0 win over Hearts ensured the champions finished with 34 wins and four draws from their 38 games.
Having already beaten Aberdeen to win the League Cup, they face the Dons in next Saturday's Scottish Cup final.
"If we bring our A-game, the treble will be the last piece of the puzzle," Griffiths told BBC Scotland.
"We've been talking about the treble quietly, but as professionals, it's the old clich√© - we need to take it one game at a time.

"But as the season went on, we just kept getting stronger and stronger. It was a fitting tribute today in front of the home fans."
The striker, who has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season, says manager Brendan Rodgers has been instrumental in Celtic's prolific success.
"I don't think anybody would've thought we'd have gone the season unbeaten," Griffiths, 26, said. "But it just shows the character and mentality we've got in that dressing room.
"It's all down to the gaffer - he's instilled that from day one, and we can see why he's managed at the top in England.
"I didn't think in my wildest teams it would be possible for a team to go unbeaten a whole season, but we just try to keep pushing on."
Manager Rodgers, in his first season at the club, said it was an "incredible achievement" for his players to remain unbeaten on their way to the title, the first Scottish team to do so across a 38-game league season.
No team had stayed unbeaten for a season in Scotland's top flight since Rangers did so in 1888-89, over an 18-game season.
"The group have worked so hard for all the records they have broken, and they thoroughly deserve it," the former Liverpool boss said. "It's been a great season.
"You come in and plan to win. However, to perform like we've done is truly remarkable. The club is very much together as one.
"It's an incredible achievement. I am a Celtic supporter so I know what it feels like. The fans' enjoyment is the most important thing for me and I think they have a good feeling."
The league finale may prove to be Patrick Roberts' final outing at Celtic Park, with the Manchester City winger's loan spell expiring at the end of the season.
"I'm not going to say anything about my future," Roberts said. "I'm just going to enjoy today, enjoy being invincible, and once we've done that we'll prepare for the (Scottish Cup) final.
"I can't say much because I don't know what's going to happen. This is an unbelievable club, for me it's up there with the greatest, and I have had the pleasure of playing for them. I just want to say thanks to these beautiful fans."
