Kenny McLean insists Aberdeen can end Celtic's unbeaten domestic run - and derail their bid for a treble.

The Dons host the Premiership champions on Friday night before Scotland's top two clubs meet again in the Scottish Cup final on 27 May.
"We want to show we can beat Celtic, because we know we've got the players that can," McLean, 25, said.
"I think we are the best team to stop the unbeaten run - and stop the treble."
Aberdeen were brushed aside by Celtic in November's League Cup final and have lost all three of the sides' previous league encounters this season.
"There is a lot at stake because we want to have momentum going into the final," former St Mirren midfielder McLean said. "That's what it's all about now.
"We've not taken anything from Celtic this season and we're disappointed from that.
"We have done well, but ultimately we've not picked any points up, which is disappointing, no matter how well you do.
"Picking up points against Celtic would be a massive boost for us and it would give us confidence going into the final.
"They've been outstanding, the best team in the league by far this year, so we know it's going to be a tough task, but we've definitely got the ability in the squad to hurt Celtic."
McLean has scored five goals this season, helping Derek McInnes's side all but secure second spot in the top flight.
With three league games remaining, the nine-point advantage and significantly superior goal difference Aberdeen have over third-placed Rangers should ensure they finish as runners-up.
"At the start of the season, a lot of people didn't think it would be the case, but we were always confident with the squad and ability we had," added McLean, who has one Scotland cap.
"It's been a real togetherness this season from everybody; the relationship between the fans and players and staff has been excellent.
"We've always been confident that we can be the nearest challengers to Celtic and we've proved that again, and proved most people wrong, I would say.
"And it's just up to us to keep pushing ourselves on and keep being in that position, to keep channelling ourselves to get better."
