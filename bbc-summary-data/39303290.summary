Manchester United have not lost any of their six previous meetings with Anderlecht - which includes a club-record 10-0 win in their first European fixture.
The Red Devils, under legendary manager Matt Busby, thrashed the Belgians in the European Cup preliminary round second leg in September 1956.
The sides last met in the 2000-01 Champions League first group stage - Andy Cole's hat-trick helping United to a 5-1 win at Old Trafford before they lost 2-1 in Belgium.
Anderlecht, who are Belgium's most successful team with 33 domestic titles, finished as Pro League runners-up in 2016.
They finished top of the league at the end of the regular season last weekend, two points clear of Club Brugge before the end-of-season play-offs.
