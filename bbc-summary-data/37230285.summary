Tom Jackson, 30, died a week after he was stabbed as he tried to shield Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 21, from an attack at Shelley's Backpackers in Queensland.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk nominated him for a posthumous bravery award.
Ms Ayliffe-Chung's family said words could not describe his bravery.
Latest updates and reaction
Mr Jackson, from Congleton, Cheshire, died in Townsville hospital on Tuesday after suffering head injuries when he went to help Ms Ayliffe-Chung, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire.
Ms Palaszczuk wrote on Twitter: "Tom Jackson's actions of putting his own life before the life of Ms Ayliffe-Chung is an extraordinary act of courage and deserves recognition.
"That's why I have today written to the Australian Bravery Decorations Council to nominate Mr Jackson for a posthumous bravery award."
She told Queensland Parliament in Brisbane: "I have also spoken with Tom's father Les. Les has asked me to pass on his thanks for the support his family is receiving from the community as well as the thanks from the local police, paramedics, and all the staff at the ICU at Townsville Hospital.
"These were tragic events and on behalf of Queenslanders I offer our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those involved."
Ms Ayliffe-Chung's mother Rosie Ayliffe, from Derbyshire, said she thought she had done something wrong when police came to break the news of her daughter's death.
"Mia was vivacious and extremely funny. She didn't take any prisoners. She had a cutting wit but she was a very compassionate girl. She had a deep love, particularly for small children," she said.
"If [the killer] is capable of contrition and of realising what he's done, I feel pity for him because he now has to live knowing that he's killed two beautiful, strong, exceptional people."
Nicola Hawkridge-Chung, Mia's sister, praised Mr Jackson's actions and said their thoughts were with his family.
"I want Mia to be remembered as a care free, generous, considerate young woman who was at the beginning of her life and who gave so much to other people.
"I don't think there are any words to describe what [Mr Jackson's] done, and what he tried to do, for Mia. Not many people would have that level of bravery to put themselves in harm's way especially considering what was happening at the time."
Les Jackson said his son's death had left the family "bereft" and the world "a poorer place".
His sister Liv Jackson said: "There is nothing in this world that can prepare you for the pain and heartbreak of losing a sibling and a friend, but there is great comfort in knowing that he was mine."
A Youcaring fundraising page set up by Tom's friend Shoshana Palatnik to help the family has received donations of more than Â£10,500, which will go to Mr Jackson's parents.
Queensland Police said they would upgrade a charge of attempted murder against a 29-year-old man to murder when he appears at Townsville Magistrates' Court on October 28.
Smail Ayad is alleged to have killed Ms Ayliffe-Chung and caused the injuries that led to Mr Jackson's death, as well as harming 12 police officers.
Police have said they were investigating whether Mr Ayad had an "obsession" with Ms Ayliffe-Chung, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire.
