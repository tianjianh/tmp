Cambridge Parker's Piece football statue plans on show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sculpture designs to mark Cambridge's contribution to the rules of football are to go on display after a Subbuteo-style statue was rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Proposals by four artists for the Parker's Piece statue can be seen in the Grand Arcade on Monday.
An idea to create a Subbuteo-type referee was scrapped before the public consultation stage last year.
City councillor Carina O'Reilly said the statue could become a "significant landmark" for the city.
It has been claimed the original rules of football were developed by students playing on Parker's Piece in 1848 and that the city centre green is the birthplace of football.
A plaque at the city centre park already celebrates how the "Cambridge Rules" became the "defining influence on the 1863 Football Association rules".
The Football Association, however, said although "elements" of the Cambridge Rules were in its own version, there were "a number of differences".
Artists Neville Gabie together with Alan Ward, Kenny Hunter, Nayan Kulkarni and Mark Titchner have submitted proposals.
They include a granite slab inscribed with the rules in different languages, a mirror-like design and bench, a life-size bronze of a female referee and a word sculpture.
People are now being asked for their opinions on the designs until 5 December.
One sculpture will be chosen by city councillors on 15 January.
The work, which could cost up to Â£115,000, will be paid for by ring-fenced public art money from developers.
