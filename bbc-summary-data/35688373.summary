Nigerian FA and Sunday Oliseh embroiled in row

The Nigerian Football Federation and former national team coach Sunday Oliseh have traded insults following the latter's resignation.

Oliseh quit on Thursday, blaming contract violations and unpaid wages.
On its website the NFF said it "categorically denies the allegations" and accused Oliseh of not reciprocating the respect it showed him.
"We find it strange that Mr Oliseh waited to receive monies owed him before resigning," the NFF added.
"Two days before his resignation, he had passionately appealed that we unite as one force to fight the battle on the football field with the Egyptian national team.
"We had no idea he was selling a dummy."
Oliseh responded in an interview with BBC Sport that he felt was not "only playing against my opponents but I felt I was also playing against my own federation, especially the technical committee".
He added: "Members of the federation were going public to criticise the team, even though we were winning. When you have played 14 games and you have lost only one competitive match and one friendly, I don't see what there is to complain about."
But the NFF statement, which was issued on Monday, stressed that Oliseh had violated several clauses in his contract and embarrassed his "tolerant employers" on several occasions.
"Contrary to the terms of his contract, Coach Oliseh went on air several times to talk about the NFF's finances and in a derogatory manner," the statement read.
"He went on air to insult Nigerians in what is now known as his 'YouTube rant' wherein he made serious allegations against the Nigeria media, which he has failed to substantiate.
"In it, he also noted that he didn't want the job of the Super Eagles Chief Coach but was prevailed upon to accept it.
"It is clear that without claiming to be perfect and working under considerable financial difficulties, not only did the NFF support Mr. Sunday Oliseh in his capacity as Chief Coach of Super Eagles, it actually showed lots of restraint in the face of aggravated impulsive behaviour by the coach bordering in some cases on insubordination."
Nigeria have swiftly reappointed Samson Siasia as coach to replace Oliseh.
Despite their technical director Shaibu Amodu rejecting an offer to take temporary charge of the Super Eagles, the NFF has ensured a coach is in place for the upcoming Nations Cup qualifiers against Egypt.
The first task for Siasia, who is in charge of the national U-23 side, is to prepare the team for the Nations Cup qualifiers against Group G leaders Egypt at home on 25 March and the return match four days later.
