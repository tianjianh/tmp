People living near a proposed site for a non-league football club's new ground are being asked for their views.

Cambridge City Football Club wants to build a 3,000-capacity stadium, with 300 parking spaces, two floodlit pitches and a gym open to the public.
The proposed site is on green belt land just north of Sawston, a village to the south of Cambridge.
The club wants to gather residents' opinions on the proposal before it puts in a formal planning application.
Its plans are being included in South Cambridgeshire District Council's local plan, which will set planning policies for the area.
Residents have raised concerns about increased traffic and parking problems at the proposed new stadium site, which is at a former tip at Dales Manor Business Park.
The Southern League Premier Division club has played at its current home, Milton Road, since 1922.
It sold the stadium to a property developer in 2006 and is in line to receive 50% of the profits from any future development of the site.
In February, Cambridge City Council approved plans for 138 homes to be built at the stadium, meaning the team will leave the ground at the end of this season.
The club is looking for a temporary home to play at until a permanent stadium is built.
Club president Len Satchell said: "We are having to move from our historic ground in Cambridge and find a new home for the club.
"It has been good to have the help of the council.
"We hope the community will join in the debate and make their views known."
The local plan consultation for Sawston closes on 6 May.
