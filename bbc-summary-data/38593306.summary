It was thought baboons did not have the throat muscles needed to make vowel sounds.
But after scientists analyzed more than 1,300 sounds made by 15 Guinea baboons they realised that  sounds similar to vowels a,e,i,o,u were found in their voice, whether mating calls, grunts, barks, or even yaks.
The research points to some monkeys having the physical ability for language for millions of years.
It's hoped that these finding will reveal more about how human language began and developed.
