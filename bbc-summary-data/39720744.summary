[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Johnson killed 70-year-old Trevor Hadlow in Gillingham, Kent, on 20 November, 2016.
The 18-year-old was also found guilty of dangerous driving for a separate incident a few months before, when he ploughed his car into a traffic warden.
Body-cam footage caught the moment Johnson accelerated into David Drury.
Johnson, of Shannon Place, Sheerness, Kent, pleaded guilty to manslaughter whilst committing the theft of a trailer, but was also on trial over the traffic warden incident, in which he pleaded not guilty on two charges.
Earlier, the jury decided unanimously on a guilty conviction for dangerous driving, but not guilty on the charge of attempting to cause Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH).
The conclusion of the trial means Johnson's conviction over the death of Mr Hadlow can now be reported.
On 20 November 2016 Johnson drove a white Peugeot van on to a farm in Capstone Road, Gillingham, and hitched up the trailer.
Mr Hadlow lived and worked on the site as a handyman. He saw Johnson and closed the gate to stop him but Johnson drove straight at him and left.
The pensioner managed to get back to his caravan but collapsed and died from his injuries. His body was discovered two days later.
Four months prior to this Johnson drove his car into the traffic warden in Eastchurch High Street on the Isle of Sheppey.
On 8 July David Drury had asked Johnson to move his car from lines next to a pedestrian crossing.
As Mr Drury began printing a parking ticket Johnson accelerated, mounted the pavement and drove at the warden.
Kent Police connected the two incidents while Johnson was in custody over Mr Hadlow's death.
Johnson has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced for both offences on 16 June 2017.
