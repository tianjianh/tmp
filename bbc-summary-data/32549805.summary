Ex-mayor Lutfur Rahman was found guilty of corrupt practices at the High Court last week and removed from office.
Four of the allegations, which had not been previously reported, are "now being assessed to see if a criminal investigation should be carried out", police said.
The force said the allegations were highlighted in the High Court ruling.
It has been granted an extension for criminal proceedings to be brought about and appointed a detective superintendent from its homicide and major crime command to oversee a review of the 200-page report published by the court last week.
It said it was considering the new material in connection with 47 of the allegations originally reported.
The Met added: "The MPS takes any allegations of electoral fraud or malpractice very seriously, as we are committed to ensuring a free and fair election."
