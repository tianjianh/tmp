[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating a rape in an Aberdeen city centre park have issued a fresh appeal for information a week after the attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old woman was attacked in Union Terrace Gardens early last Thursday.
Police Scotland said officers would be carrying out patrols in the area.
Five men and a woman - who may be students - seen leaving Belmont Street about the time of the incident are being urged to come forward.
Det Insp Jacqui Campbell said: "There will be a police presence in the area tonight, as there always is in the city centre, and we are hoping that with it being a week on from the incident that this will help jog people's memories.
"If you were in the Union Terrace, Union Street, Schoolhill or Rosemount areas between the key times of 3am and 4am last Thursday and saw something untoward which could assist us, please get in touch on 101 or speak to any officer.
"Last Wednesday would have been a busy student night and lots of people would have been going about.
"We would urge anyone with information to contact police or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 if you wish to remain anonymous."
