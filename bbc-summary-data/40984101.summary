Barrow 1-1 Maidenhead United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow and Maidenhead shared the spoils in a draw at Holker Street in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The promoted Magpies arrived in Cumbria looking to extend their three-game unbeaten run and perhaps push into the top spots with a second away win of the season.
Adrian Clifton set them on their way with a close-range finish in the 27th minute.
But 10 minutes after the break a Barrow free-kick found Moussa Diarra, who rose highest to head the ball beyond Carl Pentney for an equaliser.
Barrow, unbeaten in four heading into Saturday's clash, pushed hard for a late winner but Tanzania's Adi Yussuf could only ruffle the side-netting with his rasping shot.
Maidenhead were denied, too, as Stuart Moore made a fine stop against Christian Smith.
