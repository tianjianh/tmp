'Temperamental' rail crossing to be updated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "temperamental" rail barrier that has repeatedly broken down is to be updated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There have been more than 15 closures of the crossing in West Dyke Road, Redcar over the past 18 months, the town's Labour MP Anna Turley said.
Strong winds regularly mean the crossing has to close for safety reasons, causing traffic disruption.
Work will begin in the next few weeks to install custom-built telescopic sliding barriers.
Network Rail said the work had been fast-tracked.
A spokesman said a start date would be confirmed early next week.
"The new barrier system should bring an end to the frequent failures and closures that have brought our town centre to a standstill,"  Ms Turley said.
