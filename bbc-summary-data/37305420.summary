Dublin bus strike: Thousands of passengers affected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of commuters are having to make alternative arrangements as Dublin bus services have been cancelled for a second day because of a 48-hour strike over pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood more than 400,000 daily passengers are affected by the strike.
Dublin Bus has said it expects its services to operate as normal on Saturday morning.
Two more 48-hour strike actions are planned for this month.
These are set for 15 and 16 September and 23 and 24 September.
Police have said bus lanes are only for use by taxis, emergency vehicles and vulnerable road users such as cyclists while the strike is on.
Unions say they will review progress next week and an all-out strike has not been ruled out.
The dispute arose after Dublin Bus unions rejected a Labour Court recommendation of a general 8.25% pay award for employees over a period of three years (or 2.75% per year) without productivity changes.
Dublin Bus has said it accepts the recommendation, which it said will add 30m euros (£25.29m) to payroll costs over that period.
However, the company estimates that the 15% sought by the unions would cost at least 50m euros (£42.17m), which it says it cannot afford.
