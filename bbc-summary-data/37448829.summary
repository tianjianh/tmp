Water supplies have been restored to properties across Edinburgh after a main burst.

Six homes were flooded with damage caused to properties in Orchardhead Loan in Liberton.
Some parts of the city lost water supplies following the burst which happened at about 23:30 on Thursday.
However, a spokesman for Scottish Water said engineers had introduced backfeeds to the area while they continued to work on the burst main.
The areas affected included the city centre, the Old Town, Canongate, Liberton, Prestonfield, Little France and The Inch.
Edinburgh City Council ‚Äèsaid St Leonards Nursery School and Hope Cottage Nursery School were closed as they had no water supply.
Scottish Water said its priority was to continue working on the repair which was "progressing well".
Stephen Jenkinson, 40, said the source of the flood was from a burst water pipe under his garden in Liberton Brae.
He told the BBC Scotland news website: "At 11.30pm last night I heard a rush of water and a rumble and the house started to shake so I looked out of the window and water was pouring across the garden and running down the side of the house in a torrent.
"My cellar is 4.5ft high with water and I have been up all night with my neighbours trying to find out what to do.
"The water was cascading down the street and it moved a car into my neighbour's garden.
"I had to carry my children while wading through the water at 1am and the hole, the water created, goes down about 15ft."
He added: "We have been told we cannot live in the house just now so we will be staying with my parents.
"We are very upset and my wife is devastated. We have lived in the house for 10 years and now we are being told our garden will have to be dismantled using JCBs to reach the pipes."
He said a similar incident happened 14 months ago at a nearby house.
Mr Mark McEwen, Scottish Water's customer service general manager, earlier said: "This burst is linked to a valve on our network which manages water pressure throughout the city. A problem appears to have occurred with the valve overnight and this has led to the burst water main in Liberton and potentially one other burst.
"We apologise for any disruption to customers in terms of the water supply and, of course, to customers affected by flooding where the burst occurred.
"We will do everything we can to restore normal water supplies to affected customers as quickly as possible and we have staff on site now to help customers affected by flooding."
Customers were warned that they may experience discoloured water as the pressure begins to build and should run their cold kitchen taps at half pressure.
Anyone experiencing an airlock should contact Scottish Water on 0800 0778 778.
