Becky Hill featured on Gecko, with club DJ Oliver Heldens, which charted in June.
The 20-year-old never won The Voice but says being on the show has been "no hindrance" to her career.
Two years after getting to the semi-finals she is now releasing her first solo single, Losing.
"It doesn't matter how well that song does, whether it's number one or number 100. I'm so proud of that track," she tells Newsbeat.
"It explains more than what it's about. It's about my meeting with [DJ/singer] MNEK, my friendship circle in London, me being signed, my adventures.
"They all spurred off from losing and if it does really well in the charts then bonus."
Since appearing on The Voice in 2012, Becky has been on tour with Rudimental and had another top 10 hit with Wilkinson on his track Afterglow.
For those songs by Rudimental, Wilkinson and Oliver Heldens, she's been the "featured" artist.
On her future gigs, she doesn't know whether those tracks will be put in her set.
"By the time I'm doing an hour-long set I'll have had an album out.
"People remember you for the good music you make, not for the other good music you had. So as long as I make good music then people will remember me for that, not for the features I've been on."
She denies that being a featured artist will have any negative effect on her solo career as it goes forward.
"You could have said the same about The Voice," she says. "The Voice hasn't been a hindrance to me at all."
First gig I went to: It was James Morrison when I was 14 in Birmingham. He was amazing and I was at the back singing all the words annoying everyone around me.
First song that had an impact: JoJo's Leave (Get Out) was the first song I sang publicly when I was 11. It is such a tune.
Guilty pleasure: Anything that's really cheesy pop music.
First gig I ever did: I did our local festival in Worcestershire called ArleyFest. About 500 people went and there were artists on the bill I'd never heard of before.
Biggest gig to date: I played MTV Malta with Rudimental and there were about 50-thousand people.
Artist I'd love to support: My music is nothing like theirs so I wouldn't be picked as a support. It's Bon Iver. His voice, his writing, his production, his leftfield approach to things , I just love him.
First album I bought: Elephunk by the Black Eyed Peas
Song that annoys me: Oh what's that song about wanting to marry the girl but the dad that won't let him? (When told it's 'Rude' by Magic!) That stupid tune.
