"The joke has worn thin. I'm tired of having your opinions ascribed to me. Pls tweet under your own name. Thanks", the author had tweeted to the account.
The handle with more than 30,000 followers adopted a "faux Rushdie persona" and engaged in debates with right-wing accounts.
The owner immediately capitulated and changed his handle to @IndiaExplained.
"It gave me a chance to pay homage to Rushdie and other writers while being able to reflect and comment on things that matter to me", the owner of the account, Rohit Chopra told Indian news website Scroll.in.
But many Indians online have taken exception to Sir Salman's stance, accusing him of both lacking a sense of humour and clamping down on freedom of expression.
With its new name, the account has promised to provide "satirical and political commentary on India".
It is just one among a number of Indian parody Twitter accounts which have courted controversy with those tried to send up.
In one instance, the office of former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asked Twitter to block the account of @PM0India (which used a zero instead of a 'O') because of "objectionable content", which "could be mistaken as the official account of the PMO and have serious ramifications."
