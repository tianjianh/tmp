For the prosecution, David Lee said Watford fan Mr Cruwys had travelled with friends by train to watch the match and visited three pubs before the game, which ended in a 2-2 draw.
Mr Lee said following the match Mr Cruwys and his friends walked towards the train station and planned to have a drink on the way, but they encountered a group and Mr Cruwys was knocked down, kicked and attacked.
The trial continues.
