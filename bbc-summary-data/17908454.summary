The attack took place near the town of Sayun, in the eastern province of Hadramawt, as the men travelled by car from an oil field to a local airport.
Five masked gunmen reportedly pulled up alongside their vehicle and opened fire before fleeing. A second Yemeni inside the car was seriously wounded.
Security officials said they believed the assailants were linked to al-Qaeda.
A Total official told the Reuters news agency that the soldier who died had been sitting in the front passenger seat of the vehicle.
The Frenchman, who was in the back, was shot in the leg, he added.
It is not yet clear whether the second injured man was another soldier or a Total employee, but the Total official said he was in a critical condition in hospital after being shot three times in the chest.
