[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build a classical stone bridge across the Downs in Bristol have been approved by the city council.

The bridge, for pedestrians and cyclists, over Bridge Valley Road would complete a missing link in the circular route around the Downs.
Engineer Dr Adrienn Tomor, from the University of the West of England, said she was "delighted".
She said planning conditions needed to be finalised and an independent charity set up before fundraising could start.
Dr Tomor, who proposed the scheme, together with the Friends of the Downs and Avon Gorge group (FODAG), and will be involved in its construction, said she believed the bridge would "provide great improvements for pedestrians and cyclists at a busy and dangerous junction".
She said: "This is the first time that a substantial stone bridge has been approved for construction during the past 100 years.
"Granting planning permission represents a new era for masonry arch bridge construction in the UK and Europe."
Jack Penrose, from FODAG, said: "We're extremely pleased the city council has approved such an important project.
"It'll be infinitely safer than what's on offer at the moment."
