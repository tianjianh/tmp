Taylor, 28,  won her country's first gold by beating Estelle Mossely of France in the lightweight final.
It was an 18th major title for Olympic champion Taylor, from Bray in County Wicklow.
Portlaoise fighter O'Reilly, 22, then earned a unanimous points verdict over Xaybula Musalov of Azerbaijan.
Taylor had shaded the first round against her 22-year-old opponent and went on to control the fight, winning the other three rounds on all the judges' cards.
"This means so much to me," she said.
"I wanted to win so much for my country and my family.
"It's a bit of a relief to sit here with the gold medal. I felt a lot of pressure this week as always.
"Now I have got every single major title out there and it is great to add this one to the list.
"Onwards and upwards, the best is yet to come. I think I am as hungry now as I ever was.
"People on their way up want to take my place so it is up to me to continue to improve and it is great to produce great performances each time.
"People at home think I just stroll through these competitions but every fight is hard fought and hard won."
Meanwhile, Belfast's bronze medallist Sean McComb has qualified for the World Championships in Qatar in October.
He gets the place because the man who beat him in the semi-finals, Albert Selimov of Azerbaijan, won the lightweight gold on Saturday.
