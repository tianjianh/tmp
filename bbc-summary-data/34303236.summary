Sir Steve Redgrave opens Marlow Rowing Club watersports centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five-time Olympic champion Sir Steve Redgrave has returned to his old rowing club to open a new watersports centre following a devastating fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marlow Rowing Club's boathouse, on the Berkshire side of the River Thames, was damaged in a blaze in August 2011.
The club has replaced the building with a watersports hub after raising £1.1m and securing a £1m Sport England grant.
It will provide facilities for a number of activities, including rowing, canoeing and triathlon.
Sir Steve was joined at the opening by fellow Olympians Katherine Grainger, Zac Purchase and Naomi Riches.
The new building also houses a gym, changing rooms, a large boat storage facility and a club room with bar and balcony.
The public will get a chance to look inside the centre during an open day on Sunday.
The 2011 fire, which was not believed to have been deliberate, destroyed 60 boats and some of the club's treasured memorabilia.
