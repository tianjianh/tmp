Our BBC 100 Women octogenarians are ambassadors for ageing gracefully, in a world which sometimes appears obsessed with eternal youth.
They share with us their thoughts on embracing the ageing process.
In this video we will  hear from Louise Schwartz, a former bar owner in Jamaica; Kamini Kaushal, an Indian Bollywood star; Jenni Rhodes, a British model and textile designer; Nawal el-Sadaawi, an Egyptian author and feminist campaigner; and Tin Tin Yu, a football super fan, from Myanmar.
Video produced by Tammi Walker and Kate Fisher
