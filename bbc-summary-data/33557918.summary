New Zealand's growing attraction for workers

It has long been like a fractious, but ultimately friendly, relationship between siblings.

To New Zealanders, their big brother across the Tasman Sea in Australia was always brash and exciting. Lured by the prospect of well-paid jobs and sunshine, the Kiwis have traditionally flocked west in vast numbers.
But things are changing. New Zealand has a renewed sense of confidence, and buoyed by the international success of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies it is not only foreign tourists that are heading to Middle Earth. Others are seeking fresh opportunities in a "rock star" economy.
For the first time in 24 years, more people are now heading east from Australia to New Zealand.
The end of a long mining boom in Australia and the rebounding of its trans-Tasman neighbour's fortunes are among the main factors.
"We've been describing New Zealand as a rock star in the sense that it has been outperforming almost all of the other developed world economies over the past couple of years," says Paul Bloxham, HSBC's chief economist for Australia and New Zealand
Recent figures show that employment growth in Australia is running at 2%, while across the Tasman Sea the Kiwis are enjoying rates of more than 3%.
The government in Wellington is expecting a budget surplus within the next year or two, while its counterpart in Canberra can see only deficits ahead.
At the heart of the Kiwi recovery are construction booms in Auckland and post-earthquake Christchurch.
"The tide has turned a little bit now and we are seeing Australians suddenly taking more notice of what's going on in New Zealand that has an economy which is growing really strongly," says Peter Townsend, chief executive of the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce.
"New Zealand has the second-largest diaspora in the world, as I understand it on a per capita basis, so we have a million Kiwis living offshore.
"It is the New Zealand way to go offshore and experience new things, and the economic positioning of New Zealand now and the rebuild of Christchurch is attracting some of those Kiwis back home," he says.
Official reports show that New Zealand had a net inflow of 100 migrants from Australia in April - the first month that the land of the Long White Cloud has had an overall gain from its larger cousin since 1991.
Those numbers might be relatively small, but they show that a long-term loss of talent has been arrested, at least for now.
Kiwis are inveterate travellers, but, crucially, it seems more are deciding to come home after spending time in Bondi Beach in Sydney and beyond.
The rivalry between these two Antipodean nations is legendary. There is at times tension. Australians often have to brush aside barbs that they are arrogant and rude, while Kiwis will feel they bear the brunt of far too many jokes about sheep.
Although bonded by a shared wartime history at Gallipoli in 1915, when they fought as independent nations for the first time, Australia and New Zealand will scrap and argue over almost anything.
"It is always fun to talk to the West Island [Australia] and say you are welcome to come over," quips New Zealand's Economic Development Minister, Steven Joyce.
"We have donated a lot of labour to Australia over the last 25 years. It was one of the things that we as a government felt was really important. Not for bragging rights over the Australians, although that's a bit of fun, but actually the more important thing is you can't have an on-going drain of your key talent out of the country all the time."
New Zealand is increasingly on the radar of more young Australians, who have traditionally sought work in the boom mining states of Western Australia and Queensland, or further afield in Asia or Europe.
A year ago, Dylan Matthews was so eager to kick-start a new life in Christchurch that he slept rough in a park before finding a job. The 21-year old now works as a hotel receptionist after leaving behind his friends and family back home in the port city of Newcastle, north of Sydney. He couldn't be happier.
"I'm glad not to be there anymore, especially now. I'm glad I did leave because there are not many jobs there at the moment," he says.
"I'm not surprised it is changing with what is going on in Australia and then what is going on here as well,  [with] the amount of jobs in Christchurch.
"Then if you see what is actually on offer over here as well in terms of travelling, it is pretty good."
But New Zealand's migration shift is not just about work-hungry Australians and homesick Kiwis. Government statistics have shown the country had an overall gain of 56,800 people in the year to April, well up from the 34,400 the year before.
Migrants from India, China and Britain top the list.
In Christchurch, the Brits are the second largest group of foreign labour behind the Filipinos.
Andrew Pountney, from Worcestershire, works for Hawkins Construction and he's relishing the opportunities in New Zealand.
"I don't miss fighting for work [in the UK]," he says. "We were at the back end of a recession when we left and the company I was working for was really struggling with securing work, but there is no end of work here in Christchurch at the moment, so I've got no complaints."
Across the city, another British expatriate hired by Hawkins, Rebekah Sanderson from Leeds, has fitted seamlessly into a new life 11,000 miles from home.
"Even though the pace of work here at the moment is frenetic, there is still more work-life balance here than there was in the UK.
"Life here is just too good. It is too nice a way to live to give it up anytime soon," she says.
For many foreigners, the Land of the Long White Cloud has a silver lining.
