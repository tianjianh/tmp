[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A French minister has criticised the selection of an English song as the official anthem for French supporters at the Euro 2016 championship.

Andre Vallini, Secretary of State for Development and Francofonie, said it was "incomprehensible" for the French team's song to be in English.
Mr Vallini also berated the French entry at the Eurovision song contest, because of its English chorus.
The minister urged Francophones on Twitter to "rise up".
"At a time when we are defending the place of the French language in international institutions, and especially European institutions... it is incomprehensible that for these two big popular events, the French language throws in the towel," Mr Vallini added.
France is hosting the football tournament, which begins next month.
The song, I Was Made for Lovin' You, was originally performed by Kiss and is being performed for the event by French group Skip The Use.
The Eurovision entry, performed by Amir, is called J'ai Cherche (I Have Searched).
