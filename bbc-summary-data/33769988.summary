Police patrols are set to be stepped up at an artificial beach in Nottingham after a man was stabbed during a fight near fairground rides.

One man was injured in the head and hand with a penknife and the other was arrested following the fight in Old Market Square, on Sunday afternoon.
A 30-year-old man has since been charged with GBH and possession of an offensive weapon.
Police said it would increase patrols for "public reassurance".
Witnesses said children were watching as the two men fought in between rides, which were later taped off by police while they examined the scene.
Lee Clarke, who manages the beach, said the attraction was "completely safe".
Mr Clarke said: "It has been a difficult weekend but it has happened and we have moved on from it.
"It is an isolated incident and it didn't actually take place on the beach, it happened just off the Market Square. As they were fighting it went over towards the fountains and unfortunately fell in between two of the fairground rides.
"The beach is completely safe, we do have security on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
Insp Jez Ellis said: "We identify events like the beach through our operational meetings and increase patrols in those areas.
"We haven't had any incidents on the beach that would have warranted an increase in staffing. However, we are increasing patrols in the immediate future for public reassurance."
