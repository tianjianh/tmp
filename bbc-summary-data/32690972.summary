Schalke have suspended Kevin-Prince Boateng and Sidney Sam indefinitely following Sunday's 2-0 loss at Cologne.

Ex-Ghana forward Boateng, 28, played 59 minutes of the Bundesliga match while Germany winger Sam, 27, was absent.
The club, managed by former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo, blamed a "lack of mutual trust" and told both players they can find new teams.
Midfielder Marco Hoger, who played the full 90 minutes against Cologne, has been suspended for a week.
Hoger, 25, joined the club from Alemannia Aachen in 2011.
Sam was signed last summer from Bayer Leverkusen on a four-year contract while former Tottenham and Portsmouth player Boateng joined from AC Milan in 2013 on a three-year deal.
A club statement read: "Schalke sporting director Horst Heldt announced there would be consequences after Sunday's defeat away to Cologne and the first action taken has been: Kevin-Prince Boateng and Sidney Sam have been suspended with immediate effect.
"Marco Hoger is suspended from training and first-team action up to and including Saturday, 16 May."
Schalke, who lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16, still have two games remaining of the Bundesliga season.
