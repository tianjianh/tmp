Ethan Ampadu: Exeter City 'best place' for teenager's development, says Paul Tisdale

Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale feels highly-rated teenager Ethan Ampadu's career will be best served by establishing himself in the first team.

Ampadu, 16, was voted Wales' Young Player of the Year earlier this week.
He has attracted interest from top-flight clubs after a series of good performances for the League Two side.
"I'd like to think there's a substantial period of time where playing in our first team is going to aid him with his progress," he said.
Ampadu became the club's youngest-ever player when he made his debut aged 15 years and 331 days old in August.
"He's a fabulous young talent - he's committed himself to us over the past couple of years when he could have left us earlier to go to anther club," Tisdale added to BBC Sport.
"The variables change at so many other clubs - you might sign for a club at 17, but by the time you're 18 the manager's gone and everything changes.
"But here there's been a very consistent approach, at least you know what's in front of you."
Exeter have a track record of producing young players who go on to impress at a higher level, with Middlesbrough captain George Friend, Swansea's Matt Grimes and Bolton's ex-Derby and Crystal Palace full-back Dean Moxey all coming up through their ranks.
"If you can guarantee playing for Exeter City under a stable environment, encouraged to make mistakes but do your best, and progress and improve your game very quickly, there's no better place.
"Matt Grimes' scenario is as good as you'll get in terms of playing 40 or 50 games for your hometown club and then getting a very good move."
