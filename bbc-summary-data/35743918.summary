[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Caledonian MacBrayne and Serco have submitted final bids for the new £1bn contract to run Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services.

State-owned CalMac, which currently operates the services, and Serco Caledonian Ferries Limited are the only two companies competing for the work.
The new contract covers an eight-year period.
Scottish ministers are expected to make a decision before the end of May on who will run the services.
The routes involved link the west coast mainland with the Inner and Outer Hebrides.
The tendering process was the source of a dispute between unions and CalMac and the Scottish government last year.
Following the row, an independent panel was set up to provide assurances about the process reported that it was being done in a "fair and open" manner.
Martin Dorchester, managing director of CalMac Ferries Ltd, said: "I believe the bid we submitted last week is an outstanding piece of work and makes a compelling case for CalMac to win this hugely important contract.
"I'm confident we will be the clear winner when a decision is reached in May and, if so, I'm determined that we'll deliver our best service levels yet."
Jonathan Riley, Serco bid director for Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services (CHFS), said: "After two years of eating, sleeping and breathing CHFS I am delighted to confirm that we have submitted our communities-led ferries proposal.
"My team have put their hearts and souls into this. I have worked in the UK transport industry for over 30 years but I have to admit that I was humbled by the knowledge and passion from the people who rely on these lifeline services."
