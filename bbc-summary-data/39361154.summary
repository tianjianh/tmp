The boy, who was 16 at the time of his arrest last year, faces up to life in jail. Police alleged he tried to obtain a gun and bomb-making instructions.
It was the second time Australian police have intercepted a terror plot targeting the national holiday.
Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.
At the time of his arrest last year, the teenager had left school and started a trade apprenticeship.
"A plea has been entered and the matter is on its way to finalisation," his lawyer, Upol Amin, said on Friday, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
The case will return to Parramatta Children's Court next month.
In 2015, a 15-year-old British boy was sentenced to life in prison for plotting to behead police officers at an Anzac Day parade in Australia.
