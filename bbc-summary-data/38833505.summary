[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A solicitors' firm acting for families affected by the baby ashes scandal in Aberdeen has submitted 171 cases for compensation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The deadline set by Aberdeen City Council for claims related to Hazlehead Crematorium passed at 17:00.
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together at the crematorium and given back to relatives of the adult.
The parents of the infants were told there were no ashes.
Thompsons Solicitors told BBC Scotland they were dealing with 171 cases.
Aberdeen City Council said it could not confirm the number of claims it had received.
The council announced in December last year that it had approved a new financial compensation scheme for those affected.
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
