Andrew Scott, 27, was last seen leaving his home in Winterborne Whitechurch to go fishing at Ringstead Bay on Monday.
A coastguard-led search was stood down on Tuesday evening.
A Dorset Police spokesperson said a body believed to be Mr Scott was found off the coast of the White Nothe in Weymouth.
A formal identification has not yet taken place, but Mr Scott's family and the coroner have been informed of the discovery, police said.
In a statement released on Wednesday his family said: "We are desperate to have Andrew home safe and well with us."
Lifeboats, coastguard teams and the coastguard helicopter were initially dispatched at about 21:00 BST on Monday.
Rescue teams found his bright-orange dry bag containing his car keys, mobile phone and clothing at the White Nothe headland, while his car was discovered parked at nearby Ringstead Bay.
