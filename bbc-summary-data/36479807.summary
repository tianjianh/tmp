Wales wing George North says it will be hard to match the southern hemisphere style of play when they face New Zealand in the first Test on Saturday.

Warren Gatland's side will take on the All Blacks in a three-game Test series, as well facing Chiefs on 14 June.
"The way they play, the speed of the ball, numbers in contact, it's a completely different game," North said.
"Which is why it is such a hard task to try and match that with what we play up in the northern hemisphere."
North says it has been beneficial for Wales to arrive in New Zealand ten days ahead of the first Test against the three-time world champions, following a long season which included a World Cup campaign last autumn.
"It's a huge task for us. We know that especially after a long season as well, but to come and play the world champions at home was always going to a massive task," North told BBC Wales Sport.
"We needed some time to get over the jet-lag, which is a nightmare, recharge and then turn our minds to the first test on Saturday. It's been good for us and good for the boys to have this time here.
"A three test series in such a short period is going to be tough but we're all ready for it."
Armed with the task of beating the All Blacks after 26 unsuccessful attempts, it will prove a formidable task for North his teammates, but he is looking forward to the challenge.
"We've got to try and contain and defend really. It'll be good so see where we are at the end of it," North added.
"The team have been working hard now for more than a year what with the World Cup and now we've come here.
"It's a huge challenge and to win here would be a huge achievement for the team."
