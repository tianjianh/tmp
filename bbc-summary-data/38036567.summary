Footage appearing to show a tram driver nodding off at the controls on the same line where a crash killed seven people is being "urgently investigated".

The clip, apparently captured on a passenger's mobile phone in April, was sent to the Sun newspaper.
It said the video had been recorded about three miles from the site of the 9 November derailment in Croydon, south London, which also injured 51.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was "extremely concerned" by the footage.
In the 30-second clip, a driver - who is not the same one who was involved in last week's fatal crash - appears to drift in and out of sleep as the tram moves along.
He is seen apparently struggling to remain upright, and passengers can be heard expressing shock as the tram approaches the next stop.
Mr Khan said people would be "understandably very worried" by the footage, and called for an immediate investigation.
"I will make sure any necessary action is taken, and that all steps are taken to make sure these trams are as safe as possible."
The BBC has not been able to verify the footage for itself, but Transport for London said it was carrying out urgent inquiries.
A Transport for London spokesman said it had asked operators First Group to take all necessary action and report back as soon as possible.
First Group said it had not previously seen the video, but added: "If the situation is as it appears then this is completely unacceptable and appropriate action will be taken."
Crystal Palace and Manchester City fans fell silent ahead of their Premier League fixture on Saturday as they paid tribute to the victims of the Croydon tram crash.
Both sides and their supporters observed a minute's silence in honour of the six men and one woman killed in the tragedy on November 9.
Two of the victims - Dane Chinnery and Philip Seary - were Crystal Palace supporters.
In addition to the tram crash victims, the supporters also remembered Harry Davies - a 19-year-old Crystal Palace fans who passed away last month.
The tram that overturned on 9 November had been carrying about 60 people.
An interim crash report found it had been travelling at 43.5mph in a 12mph zone and found no evidence of any track defects or obstructions.
An investigation also found no malfunction of the braking system.
The seven people killed in the crash were Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Logan, 52, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, and Robert Huxley, 63, all from New Addington, and Mark Smith, 35 and Donald Collett, 62, both from Croydon.
A further 51 people were taken to hospital, with eight of them suffering injuries described by London Ambulance Service as serious or life-threatening.
The driver of the tram was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and is currently on bail.
