The nominations for the 2017 Brit Awards will be revealed in a live Saturday night show on ITV, organisers have announced.

The broadcast will feature performances from Olly Murs, Craig David and Christine and the Queens, all of whom are likely to be up for awards.
Nominations have previously been pre-recorded and broadcast later on ITV2.
The revamp comes after the Brits overhauled their voting system in an attempt to improve diversity.
More than 700 new pundits were invited to take part in the selection process, with big increases in the number of minority and female voters.
The nomination launch show will be hosted by Emma Willis, with more guest performers to be announced in the coming weeks.
Craig David was famously snubbed at the 2001 Brits, going home empty-handed despite receiving six nominations.
But the star, who has enjoyed a renaissance in 2016, seems to hold no grudge.
"I'm absolutely thrilled to be involved with The Brits this year," he said in a statement. "[It] always showcases the best of British and international music and highlights how important our industry is on a global scale."
The launch show will take place on 14 January, with the main ceremony taking place on 22 February at London's O2 Arena.
Michael Buble is due to host the ceremony, but may be forced to pull out as he cares for his son Noah, who was recently diagnosed with cancer.
