The 33-year-old made his Ulster debut in 2008 and has scored 745 points in 113 appearances for the Kingspan Stadium team.
Humphreys has also played for Leicester Tigers and London Irish.
"My body is telling me it's time to stop - I feel blessed to have enjoyed such a long career, the highlight of which is winning 100 Ulster caps."
Humphreys has played eight times for Les Kiss' men this season, including four starts, and has scored two tries.
"Throughout his rugby career, 'Mini Humph' has been one of the stand-out attacking 10s in European Rugby," said Ulster operations director Bryn Cunningham.
"However, it is possibly his organisational and communication skills with players around him, often unseen by those watching, that made Ian such an influential person to have around the team."
The former Ballymena Academy student enjoyed successful stints in England with Leicester (2005-2008) and London Irish (2012-2014).
