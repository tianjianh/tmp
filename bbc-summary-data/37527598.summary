[SN]TITLE[SN]
Braintree Town 1-1 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
York boss Jackie McNamara was left to decide on his future after watching his side concede a late penalty in their draw at Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McNamara declared in midweek that he would resign if the Minstermen failed to get a "positive result" from the trip to Braintree, and was just moments away from York's first win in 30 away league games thanks to Simon Heslop's early strike.
But Lee Barnard tucked home an 88th-minute penalty to leave McNamara to ponder his future, with York winless in seven games and just above the drop zone.
The former Celtic player had made his win-or-bust call in the wake of a 6-1 defeat to lowly Guiseley on Tuesday night, and he was indebted to his goalkeeper Kyle Letheren, who saved a 12th-minute Simeon Akinola spot-kick and then made a string of saves before Braintree finally broke through.
