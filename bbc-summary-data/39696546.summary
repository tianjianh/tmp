Worcester Warriors director of rugby Gary Gold has extended his contract with the Premiership club for another year after saving them from relegation.

The 49-year-old, who also has Premiership coaching experience with London Irish, Newcastle and Bath, arrived in January on an interim basis.
Since then, Worcester have won four of his eight games in charge.
"I've been blown away by this group of players and thoroughly enjoyed coming to work," the South African said.
"I wanted to make sure we were safe in the Premiership before I sat down to discuss it with my family. I've got two young kids who haven't really had dad at home for a length of time.
"But I love what I do. I'm very lucky to work in the environment that I do and I have agreed to stay on for another year."
Warriors' Easter Saturday home win over Bath, coupled with Bristol's home defeat by Wasps, was enough to send their West Country rivals down instead.
Gold, who has already signed 38-year-old former Ireland and British & Irish Lions international lock forward and Warriors captain Donncha O'Callaghan on a new deal at Sixways, is expected to supplement his coaching staff.
That followed the key signing of stand-off Ryan Mills on a new contract to maintain his rapport with South African international scrum-half Francois Hougaard, who signed an extended deal last season.
till  will follow suit.
Gold says that his decision to stay on for another year was not part of his original plan when he arrived in January.
"It was never my intention to stay," he told BBC Hereford & Worcester. "This was never a long-term gig.
"I was just going to come in, in a consultant capacity and work with Carl Hogg and the coaches but it's just gone so well here. I didn't expect come in to a club languishing in the doldrums and enjoy it as much as I have.
"I want to build on the work we've done as a group. On paper next season, we'd still be one of the favourites to go down and that's something we need to work at.
"I know the big thing was staying up this season, but 11th is still a bit embarrassing and, with an atrocious away record too.
"Worcester have never been a top six side and I don't believe we're in a position to win this competition, but we want to compete and I do believe we can improve vastly."
