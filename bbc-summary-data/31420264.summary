Named Spot, the dog-inspired robot has been created by the tech giant's Boston Dynamics division.
It's designed to be used both inside buildings and on rough ground.
So what does Google want to do with robots like Spot?
The BBC's technology reporter Rory Cellan-Jones says Spot's development is for research and "any products for people to use are quite a long way away."
"Watch out, though - Spot is getting smarter and may one day decide he's had enough of getting kicked around," he joked.
