[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have made a fresh appeal for information at the site where a teenager was raped in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman was walking along Newmills Road in Balerno at 00:30 on Thursday, 27 August when a man threatened her and raped her in a field.
Detectives have said they have a "full DNA profile" of the suspect.
They have urged people to come forward with names of anyone seen acting suspiciously at the time or since the attack.
The attacker was white, about 6ft tall, of slim build, and possibly had long hair.
At the time, he was wearing a grey hoodie and dark jeans. He may also have spoken with an Edinburgh or English accent.
Det Insp Grant Johnston said: "We have a full DNA profile of the suspect and part of my appeal today is for anyone with information who suspects that they may know the person who was responsible to get in touch with us immediately.
"Through the DNA process they can then be quickly eliminated."
