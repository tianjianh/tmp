£7,000 of steak stolen from Cullybackey butcher's shop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steak worth £7,000 has been stolen in a break-in at a butcher's shop in Cullybackey, County Antrim.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The steak was in 30 boxes which were stolen from the shop on the Dreen Road some time between 20:30 GMT on 16 December and 07:00 GMT on 17 December.
A power washer and cash were also taken.
Police want to hear from anyone with information about the burglary or from anyone who is offered meat for sale "in unusual circumstances".
"Aside from the criminal aspect of purchasing stolen meat, there are also some very obvious health implications for anyone consuming meat from a non-reputable source and we would strongly advise against this on that basis as well," Ch Insp Stephen McCauley said.
