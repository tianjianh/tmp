An Edinburgh high school is planning to immunise "vulnerable" staff and students after a pupil contracted measles.

James Gillespie's High School said the immunisations would be carried out on 12 October.
The school told parents it had been informed "too late" to take any preventative measures.
NHS Lothian said the case at the school was part of a wider increase in measles in the area.
In a letter to parents of pupils at the school, business manager David Anderson said: "Unfortunately by the time we are informed of an infection it is too late to apply preventative measures for the current outbreak.
"However, we are trying to arrange immunisation on Wednesday, 12 October, for vulnerable staff and students to protect against future outbreaks.
"NHS Scotland will provide us with details of students who they believe have not had the full course of vaccinations and we will aim to target those students and give them further information and consent forms to take home."
A spokesman for City of Edinburgh Council said: "In line with the guidance of NHS Lothian letters have been issued to parents advising of the situation and including facts on measles vaccinations."
The MMR immunisation programme prevents against measles with the first dose given soon after a child's first birthday and the second dose before they go to school.
The NHS said some people were at greater risk of complications if they contracted measles, including pregnant women, babies under 12 months of age and people who have weakened immune systems.
