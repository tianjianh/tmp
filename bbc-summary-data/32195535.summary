Kevin Carr set off from Haytor, Devon in July 2013 completing one to two marathons a day.
The route included deserts, arctic climes, high altitude mountains and covered 26,232km (16,299 miles).
His challenge was to become the fastest person to run around the world. The attempt is yet to be ratified by the World Running Association.
The previous record was set by Tom Denniss of Australia who also ran across 20 countries on five continents.
Speaking on his return to Devon following his 621 days of running, Mr Carr said: "I'm overwhelmed. It was an amazing finish, the support and turnout was incredible.
"It's been an incredibly huge strain these last few weeks to get here in time to do the record. It was never meant to come down to this much of a nail biter.
"I had numerous set backs. I broke the record by less than one day."
The challenge saw the fitness instructor run across: Europe, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, South America and Ireland.
Along the way he had to avoid snakes, scorpions, wild dogs, wolves, bears and mountain lions.
Mr Carr said he saw 26 bears in five weeks during the trip: "One actually stalked me and that was probably the most terrifying moment of my life," he said.
Through his late teens and early 20s the runner said he suffered with depression and went through a bad suicide attempt so wanted to compete the feat to raise money for mental health charity SANE and the British Red Cross.
