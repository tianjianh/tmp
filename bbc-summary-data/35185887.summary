Plans for a £30m snow and leisure centre have had 95% positive feedback in a public consultation, developers say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 557ft (170m) indoor ski-slope, ice wall, trampoline park, climbing walls, cafes and shops are proposed for Middlehaven.
Plans will be submitted for council permission in early 2016.
Teesside-based Cool Runnings (NE) said comments received suggested there was a "real appetite" for the scheme.
The development, which the company expects to create about 350 jobs, is part of the regeneration of Middlehaven, with more than £150m already being spent on housing, leisure and business developments.
