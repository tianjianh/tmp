Up to 200 jobs could be at risk at an insurance company with centres in Bristol and Newcastle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eldon Insurance Services, founded by entrepreneur Arron Banks, is "entering into a period of consultation" about restructuring part of the business.
Staff at Bristol's Go Skippy insurance offices were sent home on Monday while the consultation period got under way.
The firm has not confirmed reports that it is diverting work to South Africa for a trial period.
Staff told the Bristol Post they had been told on Monday to leave the offices while the firm trialled moving call centre work to South Africa, and they had not been told if they would be coming back. They have been sent home on full pay.
Eldon Insurance Services, which has offices in Bristol and Newcastle, carries out claims and administration for car insurance firm Go Skippy.
It was founded by Mr Banks, a local entrepreneur who made the news last year when he donated Â£1m to the UK Independence Party.
In a statement, the company confirmed it was "entering into a period of consultation with up to 200 members of staff across the business".
It read: "Following three years of intense and rapid growth, Eldon is undertaking the consultation period with selected staff as part of a strategic initiative to restructure an element of its business model.
"Consultation has commenced with employee representatives and is continuing and so, it is not appropriate to comment further now."
The company said that it aimed to "assess the strongest areas of success and set in place solid foundations for future growth and profitability across its centres in Newcastle and Bristol".
Go Skippy's offices are in Cribbs Causeway. Conservative MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke Jack Lopresti told the BBC: "We have just been made aware of this and we will be making contact with the company to see if there is anything we can do to help."
