South Yorkshire Police were called to Spring Close View, in Gleadless, at about 16:20 GMT on Monday.
The 33-year-old victim is said to be in a critical condition.
The force said the dog's owner, 36, had been arrested for offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and released on bail.
The dog was seized by officers and is being held in police kennels.
A force representative said it had been "visually confirmed as a Pit Bull Terrier-type dog".
The breed was banned in 1991 but owners are allowed to keep their dogs if they are deemed not to be dangerous.
One neighbour said: "I just heard a bit of commotion and I heard someone run past and say 'I'll get the ambulance'.
"The next thing I saw the ambulance and they were wheeling him out.
"He looked in a bad way. There was blood all over his face."
Another neighbour said: "All I heard was a load of noise on the landing. I looked up and he's said 'The dog's got his neck'.
"So I've run up and had a look in the house, I've never seen anything like it in my life."
