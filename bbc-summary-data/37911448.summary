The girl was left shaken and scared following the incident which happened between Kellie Wynd and Menteith View at about 23:30 on Saturday 29 October.
The suspect was white, aged 16-25 and was about 5ft 11in tall.
He spoke with a strong Scottish accent and wore dark trainers and a top with dark sleeves.
Her father told BBC Scotland: "This is a horrific experience for any family, but fortunately we are a strong unit supporting our daughter."
"She is lucky to be surrounded by a wonderful group of friends and I would appeal for anyone who has any information to contact the police.
"There must be someone in this area who knows who this person is or knows something that could help."
