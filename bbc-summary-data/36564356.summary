Belgium - ranked second in the world - lost 2-0 to Italy in their opening game.
Italy, who beat Sweden 1-0 on Friday to seal their progress into the last 16, take on the Republic in Lille next Wednesday.
"He thinks he is going to be able to make the Italian game," O'Neill said of Walters on Wednesday.
Wes Hoolahan's opener for the Republic against Sweden at the Stade de France was cancelled out by a Ciaran Clark own goal.
"If that performance doesn't lift you, nothing will," said O'Neill.
"We will have to show the same attitude again, go and compete and be strong on the ball."
