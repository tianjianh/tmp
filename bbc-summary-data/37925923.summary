Midsteeple Quarter vision takes shape in Dumfries town centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community-led initiative is looking at potential ways to "breathe new life" into Dumfries town centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Midsteeple Quarter project has been developed as a response to a string of shop closures.
Initial plans will be discussed at the Bakers Oven building on the town's High Street later this month.
Over two days on 15 and 16 November it will become a "project hub" for the venture and is seeking public input on how to take the scheme forward.
Matt Baker of community development trust The Stove Network said: "Dumfries has seen the closure of 18 businesses in the last four months, and Midsteeple Quarter is an urgent response to this.
"Without help, the situation is likely to get worse.
"This is a bold initiative that will see local people developing their own High Street as a contemporary living, working, socialising, learning and enterprising hub."
