Christopher Tester, 37, from Torquay in Devon, was wounded during a robbery at his parents' restaurant on Christmas Day.
His sister, Vicky Tester, said he was still in an induced coma.
The crowdfunding campaign was set up as Mr Tester did not have travel insurance.
The fund is still accepting donations with a new target of £110,000 to pay for ongoing specialist care.
Mr Tester had being flown to the neighbouring island of Guadeloupe for specialist treatment.
Ms Tester said: "I really hope within the next 24 to 48 hours he will be back on the plane to the UK.
"It's absolutely critical he gets back to the UK. He's stable, he's extremely lucky to be alive, but he needs some urgent treatment.
"He's still in an induced coma now. They brought him out of the induced coma to see how he responded. He did say a few words to my mum and dad.
"I can't comprehend what my parents are going through. It's been extremely difficult for them. They're tough, I'm really proud of them."
Ms Tester said her brother had planned to spend three weeks with his parents on the Caribbean island.
