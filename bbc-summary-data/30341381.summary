Inbetweeners star James Buckley: 'My house is haunted'

If you enjoy getting creeped out then James Buckley has a chilling real-life story he's decided to share.

During an interview about his upcoming horror film, the Inbetweeners star revealed he believes his own home is haunted.
He explained how he came to the conclusion, when a few years ago his young son seemed to react to an "invisible man".
"He'd just started talking," James remembered.
"He was standing at the bottom of the stairs and I was watching him.
"He was waving towards the top of them and pointing and laughing. So I said to him 'what are you doing mate?'
"He said, 'It's the man, the man, he's being funny.'
Cue images of any horror film featuring an innocent child and an malevolent presence.
"With that I just walked off and I thought 'I'm not even going to go into that'. I was in complete denial. I'm scared of ghosts and aliens."
Buckley was talking horror because of his part as a cameraman in The Pyramid, about a group of archaeologists who explore a newly-discovered... well you can guess.
"I'd never done a horror film before so it was quite nerve-wracking for me. I'd done comedy for years, it was almost like breathing so doing something new is dead exciting."
Even though it's a fairly straight-up horror movie, Buckley says he did get to throw in some of his trademark comedy.
"The director told me that I could ad-lib and improvise and try to be funny which made me feel a bit more comfortable."
Sadly though, there were no off-set Inbetweener japes.
"Yeah, I couldn't exactly do that thing of winding Joe Thomas (Simon in the Inbetweeners) up. These people were quite talented and respectful. It was a good learning curve to work with talented American folk.
"The Inbetweeners is over so I've got to take the job seriously."
