Norfolk 'paedophile ring' case: Key defendant declines evidence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman alleged to be at the centre of a paedophile sex ring has refused to provide evidence in her defence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marie Black, 34, from Norwich, denies a total of 26 allegations of abuse including child rape.
She has been on trial at Norwich Crown Court for two months with five other women and four men from Norwich and Romford who deny sexual abuse charges.
The defence cases began on Tuesday with Ms Black's barrister declining to offer any defence evidence on her behalf.
Sarah Elliott, QC, defending Ms Black, said: "I do not seek to put any further evidence before the jury as part of her case."
Judge Nicholas Coleman said the jury may take inference from that decision not to call Ms Black to give evidence.
Another defendant Jason Adams, 44, a former cleaner at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, denied all sexual offences against five children.
But he has admitted four charges of cruelty and ill-treatment. including injuring a child.
"I neglected the children. I ill-treated them. I completely acted in the wrong way, frightened them," he told the court.
He blamed his actions on working nights, tiredness and temper.
The jury has previously heard criticism of social workers and foster carers in the way the children's allegations were recorded.
The defendants are Marie Black, 34, from Norwich; Michael Rogers, 53, from Romford, Carol Stadler, 59, Anthony Stadler, 63, Nicola Collins, 36, Andrew Collins, 52, Judith Fuller, 32, Denise Barnes, 34, Kathleen Adams, 84, and Jason Adams, 43, all from Norwich.
All deny all the charges they face.
The trial continues.
