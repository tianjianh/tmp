Fans spilled onto the pitch after the Edinburgh side beat Rangers 3-2 with a goal in injury time.
The Ibrox club said a number of their players were assaulted by Hibs supporters during the pitch invasion.
Last week, a man admitted running towards Rangers goalkeeper Wes Foderingham and gesticulating in an offensive manner after the match.
Hibernian said the sanctions handed out were life bans and indefinite bans. It has not been revealed how many fans have been banned.
The club's chief executive, Leeann Dempster, said: "While Police Scotland will continue with their own inquiries, we will continue to review what happened and take the action we think appropriate to protect the club's good name.
"We will also co-operate fully with the independent commission established by the SFA.
"We have initiated contact with the supporters informing them of our decision. We will continue to identify and impose appropriate sanctions against others involved in unacceptable behaviour."
Police Scotland have set up a dedicated email address to receive images and video which captured scenes of disorder after Saturday's Scottish Cup final.
The final ended in chaos when thousands of Hibernian fans flooded onto the pitch as they claimed their first Scottish Cup success in 114 years.
Some Rangers fans also made it past stewards and on to the pitch, leading to a period of fighting between the two sets of supporters before mounted police and stewards restored order.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.
Rangers players received their cup final medals in the dressing room.
