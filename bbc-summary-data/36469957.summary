Pupils from P7 to S6 at the Community School of Auchterarder were shown how to restart a heart as part of the Save a Life for Scotland campaign.
The campaign aims to train half a million people to be able to carry out the procedure.
The Auchterarder event was also open to the public.
The British Heart Foundation, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Trossachs Search and Rescue and NHS Tayside helped provide the CPR training.
The school believes it is the largest such event held in Scotland.
Head teacher Stuart Clyde said: "The pupils are absolutely loving it.
"We thought it would raise the awareness much more if we made it a whole school event.
"We've also included the P7 pupils from the three associated primary schools in our area.
"We have the assembly hall split into two so at any one time there can be 100 people watching the training video and then go to the other side which is kitted out with about 50 mannequins to practice their skills on."
