The Vikings led the table after winning six of their first seven games but slipped from the top after losing to Warrington on 25 March.
Betts' side currently lie in fifth place in the table and face league leaders Warrington again on Friday.
"I don't see our form being that bad, we've just lost some games," Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"We've lost some momentum to look at the table, but internally we're still doing some good things."
After conceding 108 points in their opening seven matches, Widnes' fortunes have changed of late, with the Vikings conceding 103 points in their last four games.
"It's about doing the little things well, keeping the confidence high and doing the things we did at the beginning of the year with the same kind of determination," he added.
"We know we've got to get moving back in the league but Warrington are saying the same thing and there are guys who are fighting to get some momentum in their league positions."
