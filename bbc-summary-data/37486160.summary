Several homes and businesses were badly affected when the River Dee burst its banks in December.
It happened as Storm Frank battered Scotland.
The cost of the clear-up ran into millions of pounds, much of which was for repairing and refurbishing flood-damaged council houses. The Queen also met some of those involved in the recovery effort.
The Queen visited a row of shops which were affected, including HM Sheridan butchers.
Co-owner John Sinclair said: "We lost all stock and machinery under about 3ft of water. There was nothing left.
"Luckily, through staff work and good insurance, we managed to get going again and, but it wasn't easy.
"The first few weeks everyone stuck together and that's something the Queen seemed to know about. She was really impressed with the way it's been turned around and she was full of praise for all the help from everywhere, as we all are."
