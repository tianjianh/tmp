Leon Pryce, Mahe Fonua, Jordan Thompson, Fetuli Talanoa, Carlos Tuimavave and Josh Bowden helped the home side to a 26-6 half-time lead.
Josh Griffin scored Salford's only first-half try but they improved after the break, with Junior Sa'u scoring twice and Niall Evalds also going over.
Jack Logan and Jamie Shaul got on the scoresheet for the hosts.
The home side needed only four minutes to get on the board as Danny Houghton fed Pryce for a clear run to the line.
Griffin took an offload from Sa'u to go over for Salford's first points, before Hull took complete control by scoring five tries in 25 minutes.
New Zealand back-rower Frank Pritchard was heavily involved in Fonua's try, while Thompson took former Salford prop Scott Taylor's pass to go in under the posts.
Tuimavave powered over three minutes after sending Talanoa clear in the corner as Hull opened up a 20-point lead at the break.
Pryce's offload set up Bowden to score, Sika Manu's flick pass created a try for Logan, while Shaul collected his own kick for an eighth Hull try of the match.
Good work from Ben Murdoch-Masila saw Sa'u go over and the centre grabbed a second try seven minutes from time, while Evalds also crossed as Salford put up some fight in the second half.

Hull FC head coach Lee Radford: "It was a little bit scrappy in the second half - it wasn't the prettiest - but to score the points we did, I'm over the moon.
"We let some sloppy tries in. Our boys have played together once and I thought that showed. But in the main, I can't complain."
Salford head coach Ian Watson: "We gave Hull too much ball and made silly errors. Defensively, they were just running over us and it became a snowball effect.
"We're confident in the ability we've got in there but we need to work hard on doing the little things really well for each other and working hard as a team.
"We need to come out against St Helens (on Thursday) with the right mentality defensively. If you don't defend, you're not going to win anything."
