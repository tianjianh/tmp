Women's Super League One: Chelsea Ladies 2-1 Notts County Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Katie Chapman goals gave Chelsea Ladies victory over Notts County Ladies to move within seven points of WSL 1 leaders Manchester City Women.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lady Pies had taken the lead through Jo Potter's effort from the edge of the area, after Gemma Davison had missed a penalty for Chelsea.
The hosts levelled when Chapman nodded in Karen Carney's corner.
And the Blues captain headed home Hannah Blundell's delivery to earn her side a third successive league win.
Defeat leaves sixth-placed Notts winless in their last seven matches in all competitions.
Chelsea Ladies boss Emma Hayes:
"Good teams find ways to win games. We missed the penalty and then they go 1-0 up, but we found another gear and our captain comes through with two fantastic headers.
"We found a way to win when we weren't at our best. That's down to character.
"I'm very proud of the players as we're still very much in the hunt for a Champions League place and we're going to fight to the death for our title."
Notts County defender Laura Bassett:
"I thought the performance from the team was absolutely outstanding. Each and every player gave absolutely everything.
"We executed our game plan and frustrated Chelsea time and again. If you were to ask them, they would say that we are a tough side to beat and I think with the chances that we created we're left feeling really disappointed.
"Our performances have been really, really good recently but we just haven't been getting the right results."
