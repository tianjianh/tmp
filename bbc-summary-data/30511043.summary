Energy supplier Ecotricity has confirmed it is exploring an option to develop land at junction 13 near its headquarters in nearby Stroud.
According to the Stroud News and Journal, Dale Vince - who runs the firm and owns the football club - wants a new site to meet his club ambitions.
Mr Vince has been the chairman of the conference side since 2010.
He founded Ecotricity fifteen years prior to that and has grown it into a company with almost 150,000 customers.
