[SN]TITLE[SN]
Martin Dorchester no longer leaving role at CalMac

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Martin Dorchester is to remain as managing director of Caledonian MacBrayne Ferries after previously announcing he was standing down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Dorchester said in October last year that he would leave the post in March 2017.
He said a move to nationalise ferry services had changed his mind.
Following talks with CalMac's board and Transport Minister Humza Yousaf, he said he had decided to stay on to help the company through this new phase.
Mr Dorchester's role includes being chief executive of CalMac's parent company David MacBrayne Ltd.
CalMac operates ferry routes on Scotland's west coast.
