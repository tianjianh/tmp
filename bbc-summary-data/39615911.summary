Williams, a two-time world champion, has not won a ranking event since February 2011 and failed to qualify for this year's World Championship.
But Griffiths believes Williams, who he used to coach, can add to his tally of 18 ranking titles.
"He's a really tough great match player and he's still got it in him," he said.
"I think he can still win tournaments - he says he can't - and if he won one more tournament I think he would win a few."
Williams' last ranking title came at the German Masters in February 2011, when he beat Mark Selby in the final.
He reached the final of the China Open early in April, losing to Selby.
The 42-year-old was one of five Welsh players who missed out on a place at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield after losing in the last qualifying round.
Griffiths, the 1979 champion, is not concerned Ryan Day is the only Welshman competing for this year's world title.
"It's disappointing that all five lost but I don't think that'll ever happen again," Griffiths told BBC Wales Sport.

"I think there's still plenty in Michael White, Jamie Jones and Daniel Wells who hasn't had a bad season.  I feel they can do better. "
Griffiths is also upbeat about Day's prospects as the world number 16 prepares to start his campaign against Chinese qualifier Xiao Guodong.
If Day wins he will face defending champion and world number one Selby in the second round but Griffiths feels the 37-year-old from Pontycymer near Bridgend could cause an upset.
"Ryan's had a really great season," Griffiths said.
"He came really close to beating Barry Hawkins in the World Grand Prix final in Preston in February.
"He's been playing great snooker and if he can produce that here you never know what's going to happen."
