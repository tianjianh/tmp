The victim was attacked near Silverburn Shopping Centre, while walking on an underpass towards Boydstone Road from Fairhill Avenue, at 12:00 on 2 August.
She was not seriously injured but left shaken by the assault.
Police said the woman may have been "specifically targeted" as one of the men was known to her. They have appealed for witnesses.
Det Insp Graeme McLachlan said: "This attack happened in broad daylight close to a busy shopping centre and it is understood that the victim may have been targeted because she was known by one of the men involved.
"Officers have been carrying out extensive inquiries, however, we still need to speak to anyone who may have been in the area around the time of the incident.
"In particular, we would like to speak to two women and a man, who had blond hair and was wearing a dark-coloured tracksuit, possibly as part of a work uniform, who were seen walking in the direction of Fairhill Avenue as the incident was taking place.
"Anyone who was in the area around the time of the incident and saw what happened, or witnessed anything out of the ordinary, is asked to contact the public protection unit at London Road Police Office."
One of the men being sought is described as white, between 40 and 49 years old and of medium build. He was wearing a black coat and jeans.
The second man is described as white, between 30 and 40 years old and of slim build. He was wearing a dark tracksuit.
The third man is described as white and between 30 and 40 years old. He was wearing a red hat and green t-shirt.
The fourth man is described as white and in his mid-30s.
