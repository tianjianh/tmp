The Blues want to relocate to Wembley for three years and a £20m-a-year deal has reportedly been agreed.
But they have also held talks with the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) about a temporary move to the Olympic Stadium, which will become West Ham's home from next season.
Chelsea are also understood to be considering a switch to Twickenham.
Officials from the Stamford Bridge club held a meeting with LLDC chiefs at the end of last year, although no final decision has yet been reached and a groundshare with the Hammers is thought to be unlikely.
West Ham would need to agree to such a move, but their tenancy contract with the LLDC does allow for such an arrangement.
It would mean West Ham receiving a significant discount on their £2.5m-a-year rent for the 60,000-seater stadium.
West Ham will pay the sum each year over the 99-year lease.
The club were awarded tenancy of the London 2012 stadium in 2013 - and at least £272m has been spent to convert the site for use as a Premier League ground.
West Ham have contributed £15m towards those costs, with the deal made public following a legal battle involving owners LLDC.
The club played their last game at the 35,000-seater Upton Park, also know as the Boleyn Ground, on Tuesday, fighting back to beat Manchester United 3-2.
Slaven Bilic's Hammers side finish their season at Stoke City on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Tottenham are close to a deal with the Football Association to play their 2017-18 home games at Wembley while their new stadium is completed.
