The 22-year-old Walsall-based judoka is part of a 13-strong Great Britain team competing in Russia from 21-24 April.
Livesey and Danny Williams are the only team members who did not compete in last year's European Games.
The Kazan tournament is the last major championships before this summer's Rio Olympics, giving competitors the chance to earn valuable qualifying points.
The qualifying period ends on 30 May, after the IJF Masters in Guadalajara, Mexico.
Two members of the team - Colin Oates and Ashley McKenzie - have won European medals, while Williams will make his first appearance at the event since 2012.
Wales' Natalie Powell, who won -78 bronze at this year's Paris Grand Slam, said: "My year so far has gone relatively well.
"Winning my first Grand Slam medal has to be the high. However, the Europeans has been my main focus from the start.
"Just missing out on a medal last year was devastating so I will be looking to put my best performance in this year and get on the podium."
Nigel Donohue, British Judo's performance director, believes the team will go to Kazan with "great confidence" and "high expectations".
"The team on the whole across the IJF World Tour have performed well and won a number of Grand Prix and Grand Slam medals and defeated some of the best players in the world," he said.
