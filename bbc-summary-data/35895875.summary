The tapes will go up at Brandon Stadium for another new season on Friday night when Coventry Bees host Leicester Lions in an Elite League local derby.

But, after 87 years of speedway at Brandon, it will be the start of their final season at their long-time home.
And they are not the only long-established Midlands club looking for a new home as National League side Cradley Heath are in the same boat.
Coventry have already identified a possible new track for next season.
But the site lies on the border between Coventry and Rugby, so the Bees still face plenty of planning issues before the proposal becomes reality.
And the only one apparent certainty is that Brandon will finally close at the end of this year to be turned into housing.
Cradley Heath, who enjoyed their greatest days in the 1980s, are a lot further from finding a solution to their problem.
Since returning to the sport six years ago they have been forced to share with other clubs while they work with Dudley Council to find a suitable site for a stadium in their traditional home.
This year they will be back sharing with Wolverhampton at Monmore Green.
"We'll never give up," says Cradley Heath director, Nigel Pearson - one of the best-known names of televised speedway.
"It's still our aim to take the Heathens back to a place of our own.
"There's been an exhaustive site search but there's nothing constructive to report, which is very disappointing."
