Sixteen people were injured, four seriously, after the crash that happened on Tuesday last week.
However several rides, including the Smiler and Oblivion are still closed to the public.
See Martin 'Live at Alton Towers' - he spoke to children on the first day it reopened.
Merlin Entertainments, who own the park, had also closed three other rollercoasters at other theme parks for safety reasons.
Dragon's Fury and Rattlesnake rides at Chessington World of Adventures are still closed.
A Chessington spokeswoman said its two rides were safe, but staff working on them needed further training before they could be reopened.
Merlin Entertainments said Alton Towers is now open again.
It's been carrying out checks to make sure that the rides and park were safe for everyone.
Are rollercoasters safe?
Accidents on rollercoasters are extremely rare - the chance of being injured whilst on a ride is one in 24 million.
The company say they have added safety procedures to "reinforce the safe operation of our multi-car rollercoasters" which were "effective immediately".
