Up to 100 firefighters are tackling a major blaze that broke out close to one of the UK's busiest railway stations.

Trains have been delayed because of the fire in London's Battersea, just metres away from Clapham Junction station.
Fire crews were called at about 21:00 BST to Parkfield Industrial Estate, where flames were leaping above the rooftops alongside the railway line.
Southern Trains warned of delays on trains across the whole of its network, with services running at reduced speed.
London Fire Brigade despatched crews from Lambeth, Brixton, Tooting, Chelsea and Peckham to the scene in Culvert Place, after it received its first call at 20:51.
"Eight fire engines and around 60 firefighters and officers have been called," a spokesman said, before it was confirmed the crew numbers had later been increased.
"The fire is affecting an industrial unit and smoke from the blaze can be seen from miles around.
"Brigade 999 control officers have taken around 90 emergency calls to the incident."
The brigade urged people living close to the estate to keep their doors and windows shut because of the smoke.
Station manager David Farr, who was at the scene, said: "This is a large fire and crews are working hard to get it under control.
"The cause... remains unknown and fire crews were expected to remain at the scene into the night."
In a tweet, Southern Trains said delays would last into the early hours, with all lines shut between Clapham Junction and Victoria.
"We are unable to run any services into or out of London Victoria at present," it said.
"Passengers are advised to travel to London Bridge or Blackfriars and change where necessary. Tickets will be valid on Thameslink Southeastern South West Trains, London Underground or London Bus."
