Almost 95% of accident and emergency patients in Scotland are being treated within four hours of waiting, according to newly-released figures.

The figure is up from the average of 91.9% recorded in March, but below the 98% national standard set in 2007.
The Scottish government said it wanted to see all A&Es reach a target milestone of 95% by September 2014.
Health Secretary Alex Neil said his plan to reduce waiting was continuing with a further Â£6.8m investment.
He explained: "There is no doubt that unscheduled care continues to be a priority. As we continue to deal with the requirements of an ageing population, we are seeing an increasing requirement for more effective unscheduled care.
"That is why we continue our actions to improve unscheduled care in Scotland and this latest funding will help to ensure people are seen quickly and treated effectively."
In June 2013, six NHS Boards achieved the waiting time standard of 98% of patients admitted, transferred or discharged from A&E within four hours. The remaining eight NHS Boards recorded more than 91%.
In June, Greater Glasgow and Clyde recorded the lowest figure of 91.7% and Tayside recorded the highest at 99.2%.
The total number of people attending accident and emergency departments increased from 1.60 million in 2008/09 to 1.62 million in 2012/13.
