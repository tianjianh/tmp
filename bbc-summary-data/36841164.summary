[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicestershire struggled after bowling out Gloucestershire for 183 as 15 wickets fell on day one at Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Having decided not to contest the toss, the visitors had Chris Dent caught behind in the first over and reduced Gloucestershire to 69-5 before lunch.
Jack Taylor (51) steadied things before he was bowled by Ben Raine (4-57).
In reply, the Foxes lost Paul Horton lbw to the first ball of the innings but fellow opener Angus Robson (49 not out) guided them to 122-5 at the close.
Gloucestershire, who will go top of Division Two with a victory, will be without captain Gareth Roderick for six weeks because of a broken finger.
