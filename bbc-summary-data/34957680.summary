The temporary ban will take effect from Monday until 4 January 2016.
Michelle McIlveen said the aim was to help people during the busiest traffic period of the year.
She said the ban had worked well in previous years and was "well received" by business organisations.
Andrew Irvine, Belfast City Centre Management Company, said shoppers and traders would "benefit greatly from this initiative".
