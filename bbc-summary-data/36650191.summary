London Irish: Grant Doorey departs as assistant coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Irish have confirmed assistant coach Grant Doorey has left the club after relegation from the Premiership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Doorey joined Irish last summer as part of former head coach Tom Coventry's coaching staff, having previously been defence coach at Auckland Blues.
He is also a former assistant coach to Italy, Japan and the Barbarians.
His departure follows that of New Zealander Coventry and fellow assistant Richard Whiffin after the club held a review of its rugby department.
"The harsh reality of relegation is that we have to adjust our resources to those that can be sustained in the Championship," Exiles chief executive Bob Casey told the club website.
"Grant contributed to our efforts as we endeavoured to retain our Premiership status and we're grateful to him for that."
