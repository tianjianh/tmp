Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, Ian Henderson, Callum Camps and Peter Vincenti scored to give Dale a 4-1 win over Gillingham and end a 11-game winless run.
Saturday's victory moved the side into 10th place, easing pressure on Hill.
"They see the infrastructure that we've put in place and the processes to be even more successful," 47-year-old Hill told BBC Radio Manchester.
"I'm fortunate enough that I've got very intelligent owners who can see through not winning a game since early January."
Rochdale's win was their first in the league since 2 January, when they beat Walsall 2-0, and although Hill was pleased with the three points he believes he has nothing to prove.
"I'm the most successful manager this club has ever had and there are plenty of clubs up and down the country who'd take me tomorrow," he said.
Hill's side are seven points outside the League One play-off places, but with games in hand on many rivals, and he is looking forward to the remaining 10 matches.
"We play a lot of teams below us and I think that could give us some impetus going into the next stage of the season," he added.
