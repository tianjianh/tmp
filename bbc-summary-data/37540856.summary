Sparta Prague's goalkeeper said "women belong at the stove" after a female assistant referee failed to flag an opponent offside during a league game.

Tomas Koubek, speaking after Sunday's 3-3 draw with Brno, added: "Women should not officiate men's football."
Injured midfielder Lukas Vacha, meanwhile, described the official, Lucie Ratajova, as "the cooker".
Koubek later posted a picture of his wife and daughter on Facebook and said he wanted to "apologise to all women".
Vacha said his "comment was directed to a specific error which affected the outcome of the game, not for any other women".
Brno midfielder Alois Hycka was several metres offside before scoring the final goal of Sunday's match in injury time.
The Czech Football Association's disciplinary committee is due to deal with Koubek's remarks on Thursday.
