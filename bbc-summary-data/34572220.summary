Joe Cole says his move to Coventry City "just seems right" after signing on a 35-day emergency loan from Aston Villa.

"Primarily, it's just about playing football," the 33-year-old, who won 56 England caps, told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire. "You're a long time retired in this game.
"Over the last few years I've had a terrible time with injuries.

"I've not played regularly. But I tweaked things in the summer and I've had four good months of training."
Cole, who is in the second season of a two-year contract at Villa, has played little more than an hour of first-team football this season.
But he came off the bench to good effect in Villa's 5-3 League Cup win at home to Notts County in August, which eventually went to extra time.
But, after spending more than three weeks getting this deal across the line, Sky Blues manager Tony Mowbray insists that Cole is fit enough to start.
And, after becoming a father for the third time when his wife gave birth to a boy on Sunday, Cole "will definitely be involved" when promotion-chasing Coventry travel to face Rochdale at Spotland on Tuesday night.
"I was looking at options to go out on loan and needed a team who play football the right way," said Cole. "Coming to Coventry just seems right.
"I've not got in the team at Villa as they have spent a lot of money this summer on players who need time to settle in.
"I knew Tony Mowbray has a reputation for managing teams who like to pass it and I just want to get that buzz again.
"It doesn't matter what your name is and what you've done, when you step out there, nothing matters."
After Saturday's disappointing 0-0 home draw with Blackpool, Coventry go to Spotland in fifth place in League One.
Meanwhile, Mowbray has confirmed the Sky Blues will not be pursuing their interest in former Manchester United winger Chris Eagles, who is now expected to sign for another League One side Bury.
