There is speculation that ex-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will replace him in the summer, but the Dutchman intends to honour his three-year contract.
Van Gaal told reporters: "Next year you will see me again."
United host Leicester on Sunday hoping to close the gap on the top four and deny the Foxes the victory that would hand them the title.
Van Gaal added: "We always knew that the process would take three years. I wanted to sign only for two years. The club wanted me to sign for three years, not me.
"Every week for six months I have been 'sacked' - and yet I am still here. But this has happened to me at every club I have been at."
