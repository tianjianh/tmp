The 24-year-old lock, a former rugby league player, has been part of Fiji's sevens squad for the past two years.
He scored a try in Fiji's 43-7 win over Team GB in the Olympic final in Rio.
"Bill is a hugely talented player," said Edinburgh coach Alan Solomons. "He is big, powerful and explosive and I believe he will add huge value."
Mata, who is 6ft 5in (1.97m) and 18st 3lb (116kg), can also play in the back row.
"My goal was to win the gold medal for Fiji and we got it," he said. "Now my goal is to perform well for my new team.
"I am excited about signing for Edinburgh, and am looking forward to playing for the club.
"I am also excited about arriving in the city and meeting my new team-mates."
Edinburgh, beaten 34-16 at Cardiff Blues in their opening Pro12 match on Saturday, host Scarlets at Murrayfield on Friday.
