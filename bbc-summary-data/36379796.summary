The 21-year-old, who can play in the middle or on the wing, played 42 games in 2015-16 as the Saddlers missed out on promotion in the play-offs.
He had a year left on his existing deal, which was agreed last summer, but has extended his stay until 2018.
"I've played a lot more games this season and I'm really enjoying my football at the moment," Morris said.
"This is a great club for young players to develop and we've got a good group of young players coming through at the moment."
