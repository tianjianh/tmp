The main race started at 09:00 BST and closures were in place until 14:00.
Among the competitors were Swansea Harriers' runner Matthew Rees, who stopped close to the end of April's London Marathon to help David Wyeth, who was struggling with exhaustion, over the line.
The reunited pair completed the Swansea race within minutes of each other.
