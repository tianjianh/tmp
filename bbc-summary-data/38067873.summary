Jobs lost as plant hire firm collapses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 250 staff, including 50 in Scotland, have been laid off by administrators following the collapse of a Manchester-based plant hire group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
EY were appointed administrators for Hewden Stuart, Hewden Properties, Interlift and The Rigging House.
A total of 133 employees, including 27 in Scotland, will be transferred to Ashtead Plant Hire Company after it bought three divisions of the group.
Parties interested in other assets are asked to contact the administrators.
The Scottish job losses include 28 roles at Hewden's Queenslie depot in Glasgow and 19 posts at Grangemouth. The other three redundancies are spread between Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness.
Joint administrator Sam Woodward said: "Management has been attempting to operationally reshape the business to focus on higher margin and quicker returning assets and services.
"However, this has proven challenging with the group's capital structure and the recent trading environment.
"Management recently undertook a number of initiatives including approaching new funders and potential acquirers to recapitalise the business, but unfortunately these efforts proved unsuccessful."
