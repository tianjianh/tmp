[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 4-0 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lewis Alessandra's double helped Hartlepool move six points clear of the League Two relegation zone with a convincing win over Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alessandra's goals were added to by Padraig Amond and Nathan Thomas to ensure third-bottom Pools took the spoils.
Crewe dominated the opening period, only to fall behind on the stroke of half-time as Rhys Oates' cross found its way to Alessandra - whose effort nestled in the corner via defender Ben Nugent.
George Ray and Jordan Bowery spurned chances to level, before Pools grabbed a second through Amond.
The striker, with his back to goal, flicked the ball over the head of Ray, knocked it past onrushing goalkeeper Ben Garratt and poked his 12th league goal of the campaign into an empty net.
Crewe nearly pulled one back immediately as Joe Fryer brilliantly denied Bowery, yet their hopes were soon dashed.
