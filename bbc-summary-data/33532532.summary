Images show Joaquin Guzman pacing his cell at Altiplano jail several times on Saturday evening before heading into the shower area and disappearing.
A small hole leading to a tunnel has since been found and a massive manhunt is under way.
It is the second time Guzman, known as El Chapo or "Shorty", has escaped jail.
He broke out from a Mexican high-security prison in 2001 and was not recaptured until 2014.
Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said officials at Altiplano jail prison must have helped him in his latest escape.
Three senior prison officials, including the director of the jail, have been dismissed.
The escape tunnel was more than 1.5km (1 mile) long.
It measured 1.70m in height and led to a building outside the prison perimeter.
Security officials said it could have taken a year to build.
It has emerged that Chapo Guzman fled despite wearing a monitoring bracelet and being subject to 24-hour surveillance.
A reward of 60 million pesos ($3.8m; Â£2.4m) for his capture has been offered.
Guzman's rise to head of the Sinaloa cartel made him one of the world's most wanted drug trafficker.
The cartel controls much of the flow of cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine to the US.
Before his recapture in 2014, the US state department had offered a reward of up to $5m (Â£3.2m) for information leading to his arrest.
His wealth is estimated at $1bn (Â£630m).
