He coached the national side from 1979 to 1990, taking charge of 96 matches.
Born in Newcastle, Reagan played as a winger for York, Hull, Middlesbrough, Shrewsbury Town, Portsmouth and Norwich before taking up coaching.
England's assistant coach Marieanne Spacey said on Twitter: "Martin Reagan, my first England Women's coach. A gentleman who everyone that came into contact with him walked away smiling."
During his tenure, Reagan handed debuts to former striker Spacey as well as Hope Powell - who went on to manage England.
