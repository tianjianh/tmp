The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil Scottish tour begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first professional tour of the classic Scottish play The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil in over two decades has launched in Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new tour begins at Dundee Rep Theatre after a successful revival there last year.
The Dundee Rep Ensemble production will visit Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Inverness and Glasgow over the next six weeks.
The play tells the story of Scotland's history, from the Highland clearances to the arrival of oil.
It was written by John McGrath and first performed by the 7:84 Scotland group at the "What Kind of Scotland?" conference in Edinburgh in March 1973.
Director Joe Douglas said he was "overwhelmingly excited" about the musical drama's Scottish tour.
He said: "We've not toured for a wee while, so that's really exciting just to be doing it.
"But to be doing it with this play and to be taking the Cheviot out to lots of different places all around Scotland is going to give it a different flavour wherever it goes.
"I think it speaks to lots of different aspects of Scottish identity."
The play will run at the Rep until 10 September.
It will then visit the Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh, His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen, Eden Court Theatre, Inverness and the Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, until 22 October.
