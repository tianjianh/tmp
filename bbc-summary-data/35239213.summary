The 17-year-old midfielder is currently with IK Start in his native Norway.
Ajer made his senior debut with Start in 2014 and has become a regular for the Tippeligaen side. He has also been capped by Norway Under-17s.
Defending champions Celtic, managed by Ajer's countryman Ronny Deila, are currently three points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership.
Ajer, who has captained his club on occasion, scored eight league goals last season as Start avoided relegation via the play-off.
