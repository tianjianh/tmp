[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three men aged 23, 42 and 56, and a woman aged 48 have been released on police bail pending further enquiries.
A 19-year-old man has been released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
A 27-year-old man remains in custody.
Earlier, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that although the arrests took place in Ballymena, those arrested were not all linked to each other.
The people were all detained on Thursday morning.
Officers also carried out searches and removed a number of items for further examination.
In a statement, Det Ch Insp Deirdre Bones, from the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, said: "It is important to note that although these arrests all took place in the Ballymena area, the suspects are not all linked to each other.
"This is not about organised sexual abuse by a group of people. The arrests are part of a wider PSNI investigation focused on child sexual exploitation."
