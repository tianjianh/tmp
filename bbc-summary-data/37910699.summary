"We have always been very vocal about the importance of family and the love we have for our children.
"Luisana and I have put our careers on hold in order to devote all our time and attention to helping Noah get well.
"We have a long journey in front of us and hope that with the support of family, friends and fans around the world, we will win this battle, God willing."
