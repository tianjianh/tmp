Leeds United have promised to give fans who buy a season ticket for 2016-17 a refund of up to 50% - if the club fail to reach the Championship play-offs.

Fans who buy a ticket before the end of May will receive 25% of their money back if the club sell less than 15,000 tickets by the end of July or 50% if they sell more than that amount.
Leeds have not finished in the top six of the second tier since 2006.
The Elland Road side can not finish in the play-off places this season.
The club said in a statement: "We are more determined than ever to gain promotion from the Championship and are fully committed to doing everything we can to return this great club to the Premier League in 2016-17.
"With the full support of our fans, we believe we can achieve this goal next season."
Leeds have not played in the top tier of English football since relegation from the Premier League in 2004.
Head coach Steve Evans said on Monday that he believed he was the right man to lead the club back to the top division.
