Keogh review: Hospital death rates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fourteen NHS trusts in England have been investigated as part of a review into higher-than-expected hospital death rates.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The inquiry, carried out by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, England's NHS medical director, was set up following the Mid-Staffordshire Hospital scandal.
A report into high death rates at two hospitals in Mid-Staffordshire earlier this year found there were hundreds more deaths than expected, with patients let down by poor standards of care.
The table below shows how the 14 NHS trusts covered by the review scored in two measures of mortality. A score much above 100 is higher than the national average.
All of the data has been standardised to take into account the different case-mix at hospitals - for example, hospitals that treat more elderly patients might be expected to have higher death rates.
