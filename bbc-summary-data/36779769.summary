Jamie Donaldson says a return to form at this week's Open Championship at Royal Troon would give his dwindling Ryder Cup chances a huge boost.

The Welshman's singles victory over Keegan Bradley clinched the Ryder Cup for Europe in 2014.
This year's event in the United States just over two months away and the 40-year-old is likely to miss out having missed the cut in his last four events
"It's been frustrating so far," he said.
"But this week is The Open and anything can happen and it's a good week to turn the fortunes.
"It's not far off, I like links golf so there's no reason I can't get a great week this week."
With ranking events fast running out ahead of the 41st Ryder Cup at Hazeltine in Minnesota, Donaldson is set to miss out on one of the nine automatic places.

And his chances of securing one of Europe captain Darren Clarke's three wildcard picks seems slim.
The world number 79 admits dividing his time between the PGA and European Tours this year in an effort to pick up Ryder Cup ranking points has left him feeling fatigued.
"The form has not been as I'd have liked due to probably playing too much golf here there and everywhere," Donaldson added.
"I've not had much to play with this year. I've been playing America with nine or 10 events out there, played decent but no great results.
"The game wasn't there last week and the last few weeks I've just not been at the races due just to tiredness
Donaldson will tee off alongside former Open champions Louis Oosthuizen and Padraig Harrington in the first round at 08:25 BST on Thursday and says its vital he starts well.
"You've got to make your score on the front nine on this golf course and see if you can hang on the back nine," Donaldson said.
"It's just a case of going out there and keeping the ball in the short stuff and making a score from there."
