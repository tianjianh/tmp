The worst loss of life was the 45 killed in the 1986 Chinook crash.
Another 17 lost their lives in a failed Dan Air take-off in 1979, and two helicopter crashes in 1990 and 1992 claimed six and 11 lives respectively.
The memorial consists of a stone horseshoe-shaped structure.
It has two teak benches and the names of all those who were killed are listed.
Thousands of pounds were raised to build the memorial.
