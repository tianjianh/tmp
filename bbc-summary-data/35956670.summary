Georg Niedermeier's own goal gave Pep Guardiola's side a half-time lead, which David Alaba doubled.
Daniel Didavi fired into the top corner for Stuttgart, but Douglas Costa's long-range shot sealed Bayern's win.
Borussia Dortmund, in second, can cut the gap to five points with a win at Schalke on Sunday.
Bayern need a maximum of 11 points from their final five league matches to secure the title for Guardiola before he leaves to join Manchester City at the end of the season.
The Bayern boss rotated his squad with Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg trip to Benfica in mind, beginning with Thomas Muller, Philipp Lahm, Costa and Thiago on the bench.
But he brought on Muller after just 27 minutes, concerned that Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal was in danger of getting sent off after making two reckless challenges and collecting an early booking.
Stuttgart captain Niedermeier scored at the wrong end as he stretched to prevent Franck Ribery's cross reaching Robert Lewandowski.
Austria international Alaba added another early in the second half, showing neat footwork before beating goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton at the near post.
Didavi, Stuttgart's leading scorer, improvised superbly to pull a goal back with just under half-an-hour left as he hooked the ball past Manuel Neuer while on the ground for his 11th of the season, but Costa's 25-yard drive ended hopes of a comeback.
Augsburg moved out of the bottom three as they came from a goal behind to win 2-1 at Werder Bremen, who dropped into the relegation play-off place.
Alfred Finnbogason and Hong Jeong-ho scored for the visitors after Florian Grillitsch's first goal of the season had put Bremen in front just before half-time.
Hoffenheim are three points above Bremen after a third victory in four games as they won 2-0 at next-to-bottom at Eintracht Frankfurt.
Darmstadt improved their survival chances with a 2-1 win at Hamburg, while Ingolstadt are eighth thanks to a 1-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach.
