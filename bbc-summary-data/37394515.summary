[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 2-3 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Henderson's late penalty saw Rochdale beat 10-man Millwall 3-2 win at The Den.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Callum Camps' well-taken early strike from 12 yards was cancelled out two minutes later by Millwall striker Aiden O'Brien's close-range finish.
It was Gregory who doubled the Lions' tally to give them the lead before the break, coolly slotting his penalty down the middle on his 100th appearance.
Keith Hill's men improved after the break and grabbed an equaliser through Calvin Andrew's powerful header after a superb free-kick from Joe Bunney.
The hosts then had to cope without Ben Thompson for the final 15 minutes after the midfielder picked up a second yellow for a rash challenge.
It looked like it would end all square before Henderson calmly slotted the spot-kick to win the game in the third minute of added time after Steven Davies was fouled by Nadjim Abdou.
