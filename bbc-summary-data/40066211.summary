Kelly Brewster, 32, from Sheffield, was among 22 people who died in the suicide bomb attack at a pop concert at Manchester Arena on Monday.
Her family paid tribute to a "selfless, soft and kind hearted heroine" who shielded her sister Claire Booth and 11-year-old niece from the blast.
About 300 people gathered in the city to release balloons and pay tribute.

Her cousin Donna Brewster said: "She's a hero and she deserves to be remembered a hero and not some evil person's victim. She was a hero that night and I, for one, am so proud of her and I know my family is."
She described the 32-year-old as "a much-loved girl".
"She was such a lovely girl. It's so touching all the support the family's had," said Ms Brewster.
The balloons were released in Richmond Park to the tune of the One Direction song What Makes You Beautiful.
Floral tributes were laid in the Peace Gardens including a large bouquet by Sheffield boxing champion Kell Brook.
The former City School pupil attended the Ariana Grande concert with her sister and niece, who are both among the injured in Manchester.
Mrs Booth has a broken jaw and her daughter has two broken legs, according to reports.
Donna Brewster said: "They're both not great but we'll get there and we'll support each other. We're a very strong, loving family. We're very close. But the family will never be the same without Kelly."
Kelly Brewster's partner Ian Winslow confirmed she had died on Facebook on Wednesday.
The couple had recently put a deposit down on a new home and were planning to start a family.
