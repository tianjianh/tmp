[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Private Housing (Tenancies) Bill creates a streamlined system aimed at protecting tenants from the threat of unfair eviction and big rent increases.
The Scottish Association of Landlords had claimed the bill could drive some renters out of the market.
After a lengthy debate in which a number of amendments were considered, MSPs voted for the bill by 84 to 14.
The provisions are aimed at creating a modernised system which is easier for tenants to understand.
During debate of the bill, Housing Minister Margaret Burgess announced that if the SNP are re-elected in May, fees will not be charged for tenants or landlords going to a tribunal.
Ms Burgess, who is stepping down at the Holyrood election in May, said the bill as it stands will allow tenants to feel "more secure in their homes".
She it was necessary to legislate to "rebalance" the relationship between landlords and tenants a fairer one, adding that there had been a "collaborative" approach to the bill.
Student accommodation is exempted from the bill, but Ms Burgess said in the private rented sector all tenants should be treated the same, including students.
Labour supported the government, with Ken Macintosh said the bill could have been done better and done sooner, but described it as "a good step forward".
The Scottish Conservatives did not support the legislation, with Alex Johnstone saying the government had come down on the side of the tenant and saying more should have been done for landlords.
He said: "We should have done more to create a proper balance between landlord and tenant."
The Lib Dems also backed the bill, while Green MSP Patrick Harvie said Holyrood should be more "bold" and "radical" to close the gap between the social rented sector and the private rented sector.
Provisions of the Private Housing (Tenancies) Bill include:
