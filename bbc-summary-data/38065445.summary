Ann Maguire: Husband criticises review into teacher's murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The husband of murdered teacher Ann Maguire has criticised a review into her death.

Mrs Maguire, 61, was stabbed by student Will Cornick at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in 2014.
Her husband Don said an investigation published this month, which said the killing could not have been prevented, "felt like the bare minimum".
The Leeds Safeguarding Children Board (LCSB) said its report was conducted by a well-qualified independent reviewer.
Mrs Maguire was killed in a classroom at the school, where she had taught for more than 40 years. She was working part-time and planned to fully retire later that same year.
Her husband told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that the review left no-one any better informed about what had happened.
Until all the the circumstances which led to his wife's death are known, he said, "it's possible that lives could be at risk in British schools".
He added: "This shouldn't be about trying to make everything seem okay and hoping it doesn't happen again.
"They're going through all this time and expense to find partial answers to these questions. If we really want to learn and protect teachers and pupils we have to know every detail of this case. "
Mr Maguire has previously called for an independent inquiry into her death.
"For a teacher to be murdered by a pupil in a classroom in the UK means it should be treated in the most serious of manners," he said.
He said the board's report should be a serious case review, but the LSCB said such reviews are only for cases where a child is the victim.
"These kind of learning lessons reviews are always done when terrible events happen, and the departments always say it could have been prevented but not predicted. It feels like they've done the bare minimum."
Mark Peel, chairman of the Leeds Safeguarding Children Board, said the review conducted into Mrs Maguire's death was "in no way less credible than a serious case review".
He added: "The independent reviewer, Nick Page, was well qualified for the role, as he's completely independent of Leeds City Council, is the chief executive of another council and has a background in education.
"If Mr Maguire wasn't happy with his appointment he could have objected to it, as he did do with the person who was initially given the role."
The Department for Education said the secretary of state could not make a decision on whether an inquiry is necessary until a coroner's inquest had concluded.
A five-day hearing is due to begin next March.
Mrs Maguire was murdered by Cornick on 28 April 2014 when he was aged 15, and was the first teacher to be killed at work in England in 18 years.
Cornick, who pleaded guilty, was given a life sentence in November 2014 and ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years in custody.
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.
