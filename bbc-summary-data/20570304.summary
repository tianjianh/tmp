[SN]TITLE[SN]
England women 32-23 New Zealand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England women matched their male counterparts and secured a big win over New Zealand as they sealed a 3-0 series victory over the world champions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kat Merchant and Emily Scarratt scored early tries for England before Rawina Everitt crossed for New Zealand.
Further tries from Merchant and Roz Crowley put England 24-10 up before Selica Winiata crossed on half-time.
Jo Watmore added a fifth try and Scarratt's boot did the rest, Kendra Cocksedge's late try mere consolation.

1 Dec: England 32-23 New Zealand
England head coach Gary Street said: "Obviously we're hugely delighted to have won here at Twickenham and to wrap up the series in front of a big home crowd. The players, as a group, were once again outstanding and they showed tremendous mental strength to get through this series and win it 3-0.
"There is a lot of trust in this group and that shows every time a squad member pulls on the England shirt. We may not have won a World Cup for many years but we are definitely the number one side in the world at the moment."
England produced some superb flowing rugby at Twickenham, with the backs profiting from the good work of the forwards to run New Zealand ragged on occasions.
The Black Ferns had the edge in the maul but they could not cope with England's pacy all-round game.
New Zealand showed attacking intent from the off but after early pressure England broke out from their own 22 as Natasha Hunt took a quick tap penalty.
Watmore made good ground, producing a couple of trademark hand-offs, and Merchant supported well to scorch over in the corner.
Three minutes later Scarratt latched onto Katy McLean's neat chip and full-back Scarratt converted her own try to make it 12-0.

2006: New Zealand 25-17 England
2002: New Zealand 19-9 England
New Zealand hit back as Everitt crossed for a converted try but the hosts were soon back on the front foot, with Merchant beating three tacklers and taking another one over the line with her for an unconverted try.
Kelly Brazier landed a penalty for New Zealand as the scoreboard continued to kick over but England had the upper hand and they added a fourth try, converted by Scarratt, as prop Crowley finished off another fine attack.
New Zealand are not world champions for nothing though and, with England down to 14 after Heather Fisher was sin-binned, Winiata scored in the corner to make it 24-15 at half-time.
The visitors cut the gap to six points soon after the restart as Brazier squeezed over a penalty, but that was as close as they would get.
The Black Ferns lost Aroha Savage to the sin-bin and Watmore made them pay with a fine try after an arcing outside break, and Scarratt soon added a penalty to give England a 32-18 lead.
Cocksedge cut the gap for the world champions but England ended the game on top and looked the more likely scorers at the final whistle.
