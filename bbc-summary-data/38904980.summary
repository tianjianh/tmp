It is the second time the Shrimps have paid their players late this season.
Italian businessman Joseph Cala's purchase of the club has been delayed by a court order from Brazilian Diego Lemos, who says he still owns the club through holding company G50 Holdings.
Former co-chairman Abdulrahman Al-Hashemi has financed the wages payment.
Manager Jim Bentley told BBC Radio Lancashire that the players were informed they had been paid a few hours before their 1-0 win at Leyton Orient, to keep them unbeaten in 2017.
"Just before our pre-match match meeting at four o'clock we were advised we had been paid, so that was great as it gave the lads a lift," said Bentley.
"We've done it without getting paid recently and credit to the lads, as they have been fantastic in 2017 so far."
