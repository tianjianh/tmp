Allan Stanley, 76, from Nefyn, was given first aid by lifeguards but died on his way to hospital.
Mr Stanley and his wife Diane ran a homeware shop in Penrhos, near Pwllheli.
Mr Stanley's son Russell told the Daily Post: "We are all absolutely devastated."
A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: "We are providing support to the family of a British national who sadly died in Malta on 18 June."
The couple had a long-term let on Gozo and were two months into their trip when the accident happened.
