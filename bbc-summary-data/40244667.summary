A 2-0 victory in Nashville sealed the best-of-seven series as they claimed the trophy for a fifth time in six final appearances.
Patric Hornqvist gave the Penguins the lead with 95 seconds left, and Carl Hagelin scored into an empty net.
Victory meant they became the first team to retain the title since the Detroit Red Wings in 1998.
Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was named the most valuable player of the series for the second consecutive year.
"A good chunk of the team were returning but for the new guys it's pretty special," said Crosby.
"This was our goal at the beginning of the year - we knew it hadn't been done in a long time. To be able to accomplish it is a great feeling."
