Friday's second singles rubber will be between Kyle Edmund and Vasek Pospisil.
Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot will contest Saturday's doubles rubber against Daniel Nestor and Pospisil.
Captain Leon Smith has confirmed world number one Andy Murray will not compete for Great Britain this weekend, saying it is the "right thing for him to do".
"We all miss Andy because he is such a great influence on the team both on and off the court," said Smith.
"Like we saw last year [in the match against Serbia when he watched as a spectator], he puts a lot of interest and care into this team."
World number three Milos Raonic pulled out of the Canadian team with an injury, meaning the hosts are without a top-100 singles player.
