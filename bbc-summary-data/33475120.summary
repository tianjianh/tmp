[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Davenport, 18, from Chelmsford, admitted murdering Ashley Woolley in the city's Oaklands Park last December.
Mr Woolley, also 18, died in hospital after being stabbed in the neck and body.
Davenport, who is understood to have had a fantasy about murdering somebody, was jailed for life at Chelmsford Crown Court and will serve at least 18 years.
Mr Woolley's father Trevor Woolley said he would have liked to see the death penalty for people like Davenport.
Mr Woolley told how he was wrapping up presents for his children when he learned Ashley had been murdered.
"Our world stopped at that point and it has never started since," he said.
"Ashley had befriended him because he was the loner of the class and Ashley, being Ashley, said 'come on, join the party'.
"We know that his killer had a fantasy about murdering someone and Ashley, being the only one in the class that had befriended him, well he then chose him as his victim.
"We went and saw the CCTV of it and you see Ashley coming out and he runs up behind him and stabs him.
"Ashley knew nothing about what was about to happen. He stabbed him in the neck and then, on the floor, and stabbed him in the kidney and liver.
"I am still trying to get through the loss of Ash. He loved life, he was cheeky, he was funny and if he saw somebody down he would tell a joke and try and make them laugh."
Mr Woolley said he would like to see a return of the death penalty for cases such as his son's, as Davenport had shown no remorse and because of the way in which his son was lured to his death.
