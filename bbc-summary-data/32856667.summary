James Craigen's three-year spell with Partick Thistle has ended, with the 24-year-old Englishman among five players being released by the Glasgow club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He is joined by fellow midfielders Dale Keenan and Chris Dillon, plus defenders Ben Richards-Everton and Ryan Finnie.
Craigen, who joined Thistle from Edinburgh University, has made 30 appearances this season.
Keenan, the 20-year-old who arrived from East Fife in 2013, had made eight first-team appearances this term.
Richards-Everton signed from Tamworth last summer, but the 22-year-old England C cap spent the season on loan to Airdrieonians, making 19 appearances for the League One side.
Former Scotland Under-19 cap Finnie joined Thistle after leaving Rangers in January, but the 20-year-old failed to break into the first team at Firhill.
The 19-year-old Dillon did not break into the Thistle first-team and made one appearance this season on loan to Berwick Rangers.
