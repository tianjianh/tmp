'Sexually motivated' Newport teacher suspended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Newport teacher has been suspended for his "sexually motivated" behaviour with students.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth James, 27, was a department head at Lliswerry High School.
He admitting buying alcohol for students and communicating through texts and social media, but denied kissing a girl and sharing nude photos with another.
A disciplinary hearing proved all the charges against him and banned him from the classroom for 12 months.
James, of Pontprennau, Cardiff, was investigated after one of the girls reported him to another teacher for sending dozens of text messages over the summer.
When questioned, the other girl confirmed she and James had exchanged pictures of themselves in their underwear and in the nude.
She confessed to having a "crush on him".
The Education Workforce Council hearing was told James joined pupils after a sixth form party - and kissed a girl after tricking her to look in another direction.
He also bought students a round of drinks in a Cardiff nightclub.
Case presenter Melinka Berridge told the hearing: "He engaged in contact with students for his own sexual gratification.
"James failed to maintain professional boundaries with them and failed to uphold public confidence and trust in his profession."
James moved to St Joseph's Roman Catholic High School in 2015, and was suspended after the allegations were made.
He must go on a Child Sexual Exploitation course before he can apply to teach again.
