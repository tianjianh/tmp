The 22-year-old made 44 appearances for Falkirk last season, helping Peter Houston's men to the play-off final.
His performances earned him a place in the PFA Scotland Championship team of the year.
"You know what you get with Danny, a solid, hardworking goalkeeper and a great all-round character," Houston told the official Falkirk website.
"The improvement in his game throughout last season was fantastic and I'm sure he will continue that development over the course of this season."
Falkirk just missed out on promotion last season after losing 4-1 on aggregate to Kilmarnock in the Premiership play-off final.
Rogers, who has been capped at under-21 level for the Republic of Ireland, said: "I'll never forget those play off matches last year and the atmosphere at them all was incredible.
"That was my final memory of last year and I can't wait to make many more this season."
He also told the Aberdeen website: "Obviously I would like to be the number one at Aberdeen, but at the moment it is just important that I continue to develop and I think the best place for me to do this at present is Falkirk.
"I had a couple of different options on where I could head, however after enjoying a great season last time out it only made sense to return."
