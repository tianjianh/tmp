County Championship: Sam Northeast puts Kent in charge against Sussex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Northeast missed out on a maiden double century as Kent's batsmen dominated day two against Sussex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After resuming on 310-3 the hosts lost Darren Stevens for 63 but Kent captain Northeast and Alex Blake (61) put on a fifth-wicket partnership of 127 runs.
Northeast (190) eventually fell to Steve Magoffin but a cameo from Callum Jackson (38) saw Kent all out for 575.
Sussex lost Harry Finch early in their reply but Chris Nash (48 not out) guided the visitors to 69-1 at stumps.
Northeast is six runs away from becoming the first batsman to score 1,000 Championship runs in 2016.
