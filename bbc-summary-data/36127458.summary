Former Reading and West Bromwich Albion boss Steve Clarke has expressed his interest in succeeding Ronny Deila at Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic.

Neil Lennon, the former Celtic boss, and former Wigan Athletic manager Malky Mackay have already said they would want to be considered.
Deila announced last week that he would stand down at the end of the season.
"There are a lot of good managers out of work and Celtic is a great club," Clarke told Sky Sports.
"If they want to give me a call, it would be nice."
Norwegian Deila, whose side are on course to win a fifth consecutive Scottish title, expressed frustration at being unable to improve his side, who exited both domestic cup competitions at the semi-final stage and also had poor results in European competition.
Former Scotland full-back Clarke spent most of his playing career in England with Chelsea after joining from St Mirren.
He was assistant manager at Newcastle United, Chelsea, West Ham United and Liverpool before taking over at West Brom but has been out of work since being sacked by Reading in December.
"Celtic is a massive club and anybody that comes from the west coast of Scotland understands the size," said the 52-year-old.
"Next year will be fantastic with Rangers back in the top flight.
"Aberdeen made a good fist of it this year and hopefully Hibs will come back up through the play-offs from the Championship and it can be a really exciting league next year.
"It's a big job and Celtic I'm sure have it in their own mind who they want to go after and who they want to target and we should just let Celtic get on with their business."
Former Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo, who has been out of management since leaving Bundesliga club Schalke 04 in May, was more guarded about whether he would be interested in the Celtic job.
"I don't know," said the 45-year-old. "If ever it comes up, I will think about it."
Former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager David Moyes remains the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Deila.
However, the 52-year-old, who is also believed to be interested in the vacancy at Aston Villa, has stated that he will make a decision about his future in the close season.
