Police have dropped an investigation into Labour MP Keith Vaz after allegations about his private life were made in a Sunday Mirror story.

Mr Vaz, 59, quit as Home Affairs Select Committee chairman in September after the paper claimed he paid for the services of two male escorts.
According to the newspaper, the MP indicated to one of the men that he would pay for cocaine, although he said he would not use the drug himself.
No-one has been charged, police said.
The Metropolitan Police Service's special enquiry team began an assessment process to see "what criminal offences - if any - may have been committed".
On Friday, a force spokesman said: "Following that assessment, which included obtaining early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, the MPS started an investigation in November.
"During the investigation new information was received and additional advice obtained from the CPS, following which the MPS has made the decision to close the investigation with no person being charged."
The Sunday Mirror story in September included photographs and secret recordings it said were of Mr Vaz with the sex workers in a north London flat that he owns.
Drugs, including cocaine, were mentioned during a secretly-recorded conversation.
The recording also included a discussion about using a party drug known as poppers.
Mr Vaz had opposed government attempts to criminalise the drug. Ministers later announced it would remain within the law.
Following the initial allegations, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he would be writing to Scotland Yard calling for Mr Vaz to be investigated for misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to supply controlled substances.
Scotland Yard launched an investigation last month after receiving a letter asking officers to look into the matter.
Mr Vaz, the Leicester East MP and a married father-of-two, resigned as chairman of the influential Home Affairs Select Committee two days after the Sunday Mirror's report.
He previously said in a statement: "I welcome a full investigation as a means of establishing the true facts and I am confident the police will pursue all lines of enquiry.
"I will cooperate with the investigation in any way I can."
He joined the Commons justice committee in October.
