[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sokol Muja, 27, was backing a people carrier out of a bay at a car wash on Llantarnam Industrial Estate in Cwmbran when he hit Dave Fields, 75.
He admitted causing death by careless driving at Cardiff Crown Court.
Judge Eleri Rees gave Muja, from Cwmbran, a six-month suspended sentence and banned him from driving for two years on Friday.
Mr Fields had taken his car to be cleaned and was stood waiting when Muja reversed into him, causing him to fall and hit his head. He died in hospital five days later.
Muja also admitted driving without insurance and in accordance with the provisional licence he holds.
He was ordered to carry out 250 hours of community work and told to pay Â£350 in costs and a victim surcharge.
Judge Rees said: "Your action resulted in a tragic and needless loss of life and you will have to bear the burden of guilt throughout your life."
Afterwards, Mr Fields's daughter-in-law Kathy said: "He deserved to go to prison for what he did but I suppose we just have to accept it.
"It seems he paid just a small price for the immense harm he has caused."
