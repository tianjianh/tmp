[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Calls have been made for a room in Wrexham where heroin users can inject safely under supervision.

North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said a so-called "fix room" could reduce drug deaths and the spread of infection.
He said the proposed plan came in response to Rhosddu residents' concerns over dumped hypodermic needles.
Mr Jones' comments come after a similar facility was recently announced for Glasgow.
The Glasgow centre, which will be the first of its kind in the UK, will aim to address the problems caused by users who inject on the city's streets.
Similar schemes already operate in 10 other countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Holland and Switzerland.
Mr Jones said: "At the moment, all you're getting is the authorities treating the symptoms of substance abuse and drug addiction rather than the underlying causes.
"Drug addiction should be treated as a public health issue rather than as a criminal matter."
If given the go-ahead, he said the rooms could also offer "wrap around" services such as health care, counselling, housing and welfare advice.
He said he also wanted to see a heroin-assisted treatment centre, which would see "chaotic" addicts prescribed medicinal heroin to help them beat their addiction.
He added this would also help tackle low-level street drug dealing.
Mr Jones said he was in discussion with members of Wrexham council about how such a project could work.
He added: "This approach would be better for those suffering from the blight of addiction, society in general and the residents of Rhosddu in particular.
"The people who make a good living out of drugs are the organised criminals. They are the people we need to be going after with all our might."
