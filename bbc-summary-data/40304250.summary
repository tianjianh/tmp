The parents of 15-year-old Laura MacIntyre, from Barra, said she was making "small yet steady progress" but had a long recovery ahead of her.
Laura's friend Eilidh MacLeod was killed in the suicide attack last month after a concert by Ariana Grande.
A total of 22 people died at Manchester's MEN Arena.
In a message posted on a community Facebook page, Laura's family wrote: "Michael, Nan and family would like to thank everyone for their continued support for Laura.
"Laura is making small yet steady progress and every day sees some improvement in her condition. She is now managing to eat and drink which has enabled the removal of the feeding tube.
"She is being cared for exceptionally well by nursing and medical staff at Manchester's Children's Hospital. Laura has a long road ahead and we are extremely grateful for all the support."
Laura and Eilidh, both pupils at Castlebay Community School on Barra, had travelled to the concert with Eilidh's mother who was due to meet them afterwards.
In the days after the suicide attack it was confirmed that Eilidh was among the dead, while Laura was found in hospital. She was said to have suffered "horrendous injuries".
A funeral mass for Eilidh MacLeod was held on the isle of Barra on 5 June.
