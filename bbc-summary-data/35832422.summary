G4S Medway unit to take 'selected' young offenders again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A young offenders' unit at the centre of abuse allegations is to start accepting some new inmates again following a series of inspections.

The Youth Justice Board had stopped sending children to the Medway Secure Training Centre in Rochester after an investigation by the BBC's Panorama.
The programme included footage showing staff mistreating and abusing inmates.
But Justice Secretary Michael Gove has agreed individuals can be admitted if considered in their "best interests".
The freeze on admissions to Medway, which is run by G4S, was imposed following the Panorama programme in January which highlighted claims of abuse relating to 10 boys.
Five men have been arrested on suspicion of either child neglect or assault and bailed until April.
Five members of staff were sacked and three more suspended, while the unit's director, Ralph Marchant, stood down.
But while the Ministry of Justice has ordered a moratorium on the "usual" placement of children at Medway - which takes 12-to-17-year-olds both on remand and convicted - it has said children can be admitted "on a case-by-case basis".
This must be in consultation with their relatives and the relevant Youth Offending Team.
A spokesperson for the Youth Justice Board, which oversees the entire system, said the move followed a number of visits to Medway from independent organisations, including Ofsted, HM Inspectorate of Prisons and the Office of the Children's Commissioner.
"None of these agencies have identified any immediate safeguarding concerns," she said.
"This view is supported by the findings of our own enhanced monitoring activity, which has not uncovered any new evidence of staff misconduct or inappropriate practice."
The Medway Improvement Board's formal review of the unit in the wake of the Panorama programme is expected to report at the end of the month.
Paul Cook, managing director of children's services at G4S, said: "We have been working hard to review every aspect of our recruitment, training, reporting and governance processes to address the issues identified... earlier this year, and it is encouraging that the Youth Justice Board will start to place young people at the centre once again."
He said that although G4S recently announced its intention to withdraw from children's services, including at Medway, the company was "committed to the welfare of young people at the centre and responding to the serious issues raised at the beginning of the year."
