[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fire crews were called to Annesley Hall, on Mansfield Road, in Annesley, at about 01:40 BST.
Two of the three floors at the Grade II listed hall were severely damaged in the blaze, Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue said.
The hall was the ancestral home of the Chaworth-Musters family and was visited by the poet Lord Byron. About 30 firefighters tackled the fire.
It has been targeted by vandals previously, after being sold off by the family in 1972.
The building, which was on the English Heritage at risk register, has its origins in the 13th Century but was remodelled in the 17th and 18th Centuries.
Groundsman Paul Genders said: "I'm devastated because it has got such a lot of potential and is a stately home with a lot of history connected to it."
Nottinghamshire Police said it was investigating the incident along with the fire service.
