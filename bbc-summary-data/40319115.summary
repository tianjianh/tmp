The scrum-half, son of former Scotland centre Graham Shiel, touched down for the second time to snatch a 24-17 victory with the last play.
Glasgow Warriors-bound centre Robbie Nairn scored the Scots' other try.
After losing to New Zealand, Scotland had beaten Ireland, Italy and Wales to reach the fifth-place play-off.
The victory in Georgia was the second by a Scottish rugby team over its Australian counterparts this weekend, with Gregor Townsend's senior side beating the Wallabies on Saturday.
Under-20s head coach John Dalziel, assisted at the championship by former Edinburgh flanker Roddy Grant, will now take charge of Scotland Sevens.
