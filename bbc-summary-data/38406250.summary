The US president-elect said Mrs Conway, who was his third campaign manager, had "played a crucial role in my victory".
She will have an office in the West Wing, where she will be the highest-ranking woman in the White House.
Mrs Conway, who is a regular on television news programmes, joined the campaign in July.
The president-elect also appointed three other top aides to White House roles.
Sean Spicer will be press secretary, Hope Hicks will be director of strategic communications and Dan Scavino will serve as director of social media.
Of Mrs Conway, Mr Trump in a transition team statement: "She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message."
The 49-year-old Republican strategist had previously suggested her other role as mother to four young children might deter her from taking on a high-level White House job.
"Mom of four is not [in] most job descriptions," she tweeted earlier this month.
Mrs Conway - who has been dubbed the "Trump whisperer" - was the first woman in American history to lead a successful US presidential campaign.
A veteran pollster, she was credited with helping to steady the Trump campaign after a 2005 video leaked to the media in which the businessman was heard making obscene comments about women.
Earlier this month, Mrs Conway suggested that she was seeking an outside advisory role similar to David Plouffe or David Axelrod, who both served as outside advisers to President Barack Obama after helping in his campaigns.
"I want to thank the President-elect for this amazing opportunity," Mrs Conway said in a transition team statement.
"A Trump presidency will bring real change to Washington and to Americans across this great nation."
