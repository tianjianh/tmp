In an effort to rally as much support as possible, the club has said that under-16s can watch for free.
Season ticket holders will be able to bring a friend for free.
Under-16 Motherwell fans have also been offered the chance of free tickets.
Inverness, who beat Dundee 2-0 on Wednesday night, are expected to release more details on Thursday.
