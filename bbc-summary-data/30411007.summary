A pop-up show by folk-rock band Skerryvore will be among the highlights of the programme.
An outreach scheme will encourage people from Lochside, Lincluden, Summerhill and Stakeford to take part in the Burns Night street carnival.
More activities will be announced ahead of the celebrations, which runs over nine days from 23 January 2015.
Hue and Cry, The Undertones and comedian Craig Hill are headlining the main festival.
Dumfries Provost Ted Thompson said: "Dumfries and Galloway Council is fully supportive of Big Burns Supper which is a major highlight of the year and we want to see everyone get a chance to take part and enjoy the fun.
"Taking the festival to the community is brilliant and it's great to get more people from north-west Dumfries taking part in the carnival and all that's going on during the nine days around Burns Night."
Sixteen lantern making workshops will take place across north-west Dumfries as part of the outreach initiative.
Lanterns will be one of the main features of the carnival, as 2015 is the Unesco Year of Light.
Plans are also being put in place to provide a free minibus to the 140 events at the festival.
Artistic director Graham Main said: "Our festival within a festival in north-west Dumfries really sums up the spirit of Big Burns Supper.
"The whole idea is that it is for the community, created by the community and we want everyone, of every age to have the chance to get involved - no matter where they live.
"We are really looking forward to announcing which other acts will be putting on performances in north-west Dumfries - and we can promise people that they have some real treats in store."
