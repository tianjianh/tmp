Stephen Lewis, 41, from south Wales, died after a crash involving his bicycle and a Skoda Citigo near Ilfracombe, north Devon, on Monday.
Devon and Cornwall Police has appealed for witnesses.
On Wednesday, the father-of-three's family said they were "in shock".
In a tribute, they added: "Steve was a wonderful husband to Helen, much-loved daddy to Rebekah, Lowri and Cian, as well as being a loving son, brother, uncle and friend.
"We cannot believe this has happened and are all in a state of shock at Steve being taken from us in the prime of his life.
"He loved his job as a Police Community Support Officer and would get much satisfaction in being able to help people in times of need."
Mr Lewis, who had been a PCSO since 2006, was on holiday when the fatal accident happened.
Emergency services were called to Ridge Hill at Combe Martin around 07:30 BST.
Another rider, a 43-year-old man, cycling with Mr Lewis was treated for minor injuries, while the female driver of the car was not hurt.
Mr Lewis, described as a "great ambassador" for South Wales Police, suffered serious injuries and was pronounced dead at North Devon District Hospital.
Colleagues have paid tribute to Mr Lewis, who was stationed with the community safety team at Neath, Neath Port Talbot.
He was a keen triathlete and was in training for Ironman Wales in September, having competed in the event last year, when he died.
Mr Lewis also played rugby for his local clubs Cwmtwrch and Ystradgynlais, in Powys.
