The 29-year-old agreed a summer move to the French side in January, but opted to pull out of the transfer following Bayonne's relegation from the Top 14.
Tait, capped 38 times by England, has been with Tigers since joining from Sale Sharks in 2011.
"Mat has enjoyed one of the most consistent seasons of his career this year," said boss Richard Cockerill
"He has played at the very highest levels of the game and has a lot of experience for a player still in his 20s. We look forward to his continued input as part of the senior core of the Leicester squad."
Tait began his career at Newcastle Falcons in 2004 and won his first international cap as an 18-year-old during the following year's Six Nations.
He played for England against Barbarians at Twickenham on Sunday, but was not included in Stuart Lancaster's 50-man World Cup training squad.
