India v England: 'Lack of application could cost tourists the match'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a very disappointing day one of the third Test for England, and that morning session where four wickets fell might well cost them the match.

It proves that winning the toss is only part of the deal. You don't get 400 runs in your back pocket, you have to get out there and bat well too.
We can excuse Haseeb Hameed from criticism because he got one that bounced but England lost three heavyweight wickets to poor shots.
Joe Root seemed to have a lapse of concentration while facing the first ball after drinks, Alastair Cook cut at the first ball that Ravichandran Ashwin bowled and Moeen Ali went for a hook shot with two men out in the deep.
When you're batting first on a pitch that is likely to deteriorate, you've got to work hard and get runs. I'm afraid the application from those three was lacking.
Look down the order and even Jos Buttler, who had played really well, and Ben Stokes played poor shots. If you sat down and watched the wickets in succession, you'd shake your head and say "what on earth is going on?" Far too many gave their wickets away and, closing on 268-8, it will probably cost them.
Jonny Bairstow is playing magnificently at the moment - his bat is coming down beautifully straight and you can see that by the number of times he hits to mid-off and mid-on.
It's a real shame he did not get his hundred but I don't think there is anything he could have done about his dismissal for 89.
He was well forward and was given out lbw - correctly, as it turned out - but it's the sort of decision that six years ago would never have been given before the DRS system was brought in.
Bairstow and Stokes bat well together and encourage each other. Once again their partnership, worth 57, was the start of a bit of a recovery. England only lost one wicket in the afternoon, which showed that the pitch is playing perfectly.
People who say they should take the wicketkeeping gloves off Bairstow should consider what a damaging impact that would have on his confidence. That would be like telling an all-rounder who bowls that he's not going to bowl anymore.
He views himself as being the all-round England package. He has worked very hard and both his batting and wicketkeeping have come on in leaps and bounds.
Lancashire's Buttler had played only one first-class match in 13 months before replacing Ben Duckett for this Test but often it doesn't matter, you can just walk out and bat.

When you're playing at this level, you can go out with a blank sheet of paper, you haven't got any past in this series and the bowlers haven't got you out before. You can go out there and play quite positively.
I thought Buttler played really well, some lovely clean shots, and he was really angry at the way he got out for 43 with a tame drive to cover. All that hard work was gone. However, there is a mental toughness you only get through playing.
It could have been a lot worse for England because the fast outfield has probably added 20 runs to their score, while India's fielding was dreadful.
The hosts have got a lot of work to do in that department - they dropped far too many catches and their ground fielding is poor. Cook was dropped twice and Bairstow gave a couple of chances. If India click in the field, England are really going to suffer.
It is a very, very big day for England tomorrow. They have got to get what they can from these last two wickets and bowl India out. They need to bowl their boots off, take every half chance that comes their way and hope for some luck.
Three of India's batsmen are in good form - Murali Vijay, Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara - and if India post 350-400 then I suspect the writing is on the wall.
