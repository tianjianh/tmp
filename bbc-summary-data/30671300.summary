A man has been charged in connection with three suspected drugs-related deaths in Suffolk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adrian Lubecki, 19, from Ipswich, is charged with being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.
Police believe the deaths of three men in Suffolk and a fourth man in Telford, Shropshire, could be linked to a dangerous batch of ecstasy.
Officers urged anyone in possession of the red triangular pills marked with the Superman "S" logo not to take them.
Mr Lubecki, of St Matthews Street, also faces a charge of possession with intent to supply a Class B drug.
He is due to appear at Ipswich Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Two other men arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs have been released on bail while police inquiries continue.
Two men from Ipswich who died have been named locally as Justas Ropas, 22, and Gediminas Kulokas, 24.
They died on Christmas Eve and New Year's Day.
The deaths of John Hocking, 20, from Rendlesham in Suffolk, and a 27-year-old from Telford, who both died on New Year's Day, have also been linked to the drug.
Mr Hocking's friend Jack Harrison, of Martlesham Heath, urged people to learn from his death as it had "hurt a lot of people".
He described how their group of friends had released lanterns into the sky in his memory on Friday.
"He had the biggest heart. He was a truly one-of-a-kind type of bloke - he carried an energy with him.
"It's a horrible situation which people have to deal with."
A fifth man, from Provan Court estate in Ipswich, who was reported as being unwell along with Mr Kulokas, was taken to hospital by air ambulance in a serious condition but is now recovering, police said.
Suffolk Police said a 37-year-old man was taken to Ipswich Hospital when he became "unwell" in the early hours of Sunday and told officers he had taken a "S" marked tablet.
The man, who lives in the town, has since been discharged from hospital.
He had initially been arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly.
