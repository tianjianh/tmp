Budgie smugglers, glamping and listicles are some of the more eye-catching new entries to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED).

The latest update also includes the likes of "bovver", made famous by comedian Catherine Tate.
A number of internet slang acronyms such as FWIW and ICYMI have also made the new list.
They are some of the more than 1,000 new words and senses, and nearly 2,000 fully revised or expanded entries.
"Budgie smugglers" is an Australian term used since the 1990s that refers to a pair of tight men's swimming trunks.
"Glamping" is a shortened form of the phrase "glamorous camping", used to describe a camping with luxuries and accommodation more associated with hotel stays.
"Listicles" are a recent invention of the internet age, describing online newspaper or magazine articles presented in the form of a list.
In the latest update, the OED acknowledges the "inescapable factor of modern life is our increasing reliance on computers and digital communications".
It has included acronyms such as FWIW, short for "for what it's worth", and ICYMI, "in case you missed it", which are used frequently on social media and in text messaging.
"Bovver" makes the list thanks to Catherine Tate's teenage character Lauren's much-repeated catchphrase "Am I bovvered?".
"Dudettes", meanwhile, has been in use since 1883, five years after the more commonly used male equivalent "dude" came into use.
The next update to the OED is due in September.
