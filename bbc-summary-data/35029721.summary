[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Davies takes his place, while wing Jeff Hassler, number eight Dan Baker and props Nicky Smith and Aaron Jarvis replace Eli Walker, Paul James, Dmitri Arhip and James King in the changes from the Boxing Day win at Scarlets.
Dragons make five changes from Sunday's defeat by Cardiff Blues.
Scrum-half Sarel Pretorius and prop Boris Stankovich return from injury.
They replace Charlie Davies and Phil Price, while prop Lloyd Fairbrother and back-rowers Ollie Griffiths and Ed Jackson come in for Brok Harris, Nic Cudd and Lewis Evans.
Dragons' defeat to the Blues ended a three-match winning streak in all competitions, while Ospreys have won their last four Pro12 games.
Ospreys centre Josh Matavesi starts having avoided punishment after being cited for a tackle on Gareth Owen during the win at Scarlets.
His side have a proud derby record to defend, having not lost to another Welsh side at Liberty Stadium since Dragons won there in October 2010.
"It was an important win on Boxing Day but it won't count for much if we don't follow it up with a good performance against the Dragons," said Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy.
"We're expecting a difficult afternoon against the Dragons, as is always the case. They'll come here full of confidence, so we'll have to be at our best."
