The visitors led at the end of a tight first half, with tries from Declan Patton and Jack Hughes cancelling out efforts from Junior Sa'u and George Griffin.
Kriss Brining's touchdown put the hosts in front before Warrington levelled the game through Jack Johnson's score.
Sa'u won it when he crossed for the second time from a grubber kick.
Tony Smith's side are bottom of the table, with their only win so far this year coming against Brisbane in the World Club Series.
Salford, narrowly beaten at Leeds last week, had failed to register victory over the Wire in their nine previous attempts.
Centre Sa'u touched down for the winning score from Michael Dobson's kick through before Gareth O'Brien kicked the goal and a late penalty to secure the two points.
Warrington host champions Wigan on Thursday with Salford next in action when they travel to Wakefield a week on Sunday.
Salford coach Ian Watson: "We showed grit and determination especially after a few 50/50 calls went against us. The result is very pleasing as a group.
"Our game management has been very good all year and Michael Dobson was again first-class.
"We are happy with where we are, especially after everyone was writing us off before the season. We are learning and improving every week and trying to go forward with consistency.
"Beating a very good team like Warrington will give us belief for the rest of the season."
Warrington boss Tony Smith: "We were up for the Brisbane (World Club) game in a big way and put in an enormous effort. Maybe it flattened us but it's far from the end of the world for us.
"We know we are going to get some form together especially in the dry weather.
"At this stage of the year, you will get these kinds of results. I don't think you can determine who will win or come last in the competition in the first few weeks.
"I thought it was a spasmodic performance and our game management wasn't terrific. We will keep working hard."
