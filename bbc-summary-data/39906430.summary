Chloe Lou Farrell, 22, from Colwyn Bay, Conwy county, died after a tractor overturned at The Warren resort near Abersoch at about 19:20 BST on Friday.
Paramedics attended but she was pronounced dead at the scene. Police and the council are investigating what is believed to be a work-related death.
In a statement, Miss Farrell's family said she will be "greatly missed".
"She was fun, outgoing and had a great sense of humour. She lived life to the full and loved spending time with her many friends."
Miss Farrell, who worked in her family business Crime Prevention Services, was "passionate about Abersoch", the statement added, having spent holidays there since she was two years old.
"She loved being out on the boat and jet-ski and had spent long summers working in the village.
"Everyone is absolutely devastated. Chloe will be greatly missed by everyone who was fortunate to meet her and who held her in great affection."
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said it was notified of the death and it was being treated as a work-related incident.
But as the HSE does not regulate the leisure and retail industry, it said the matter would need to be referred to Gwynedd council.
A spokesman for the council said officers from its public protection service would work with North Wales Police to investigate the "tragic" incident.
Bobby McGhee, chief executive of the Haulfryn Group which owns the resort, said: "Our thoughts and sympathies are with family and friends at this extremely difficult time.
"The emergency services are conducting a full investigation into the accident and what caused the owner's tractor to overturn.
"Once that is established we will issue a further statement."
Dewi Wyn Roberts, independent councillor for Abersoch, said the community was "shocked" by the incident "and the loss of life to one so young".
"My thoughts, and the thoughts of the community as a whole, and condolences, are with the lady's family and friends," he said.
"The safety of those who use the area is paramount to us," he added.
Mr Roberts said the resort had a boat-launching facility and while he did not know the circumstances surrounding the incident, he urged caution around tractors and boats.
The park, which is described as an exclusive holiday home resort, remained open on Saturday.
