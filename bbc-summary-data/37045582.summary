[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doubts have been cast over whether one of Wales' biggest celebrations of equality will take place in 2017.

Thousands of people turned out to Pride Cymru in Cardiff on Saturday, to march through the city before making their way to Cooper's Field for events.
The city council said there were "challenges" over the date next year, as the field would be used as a Champions League final fan zone.
Pride Cymru chairwoman Lu Thomas said she was "disappointed".
Speaking to BBC Radio Cymru's Taro'r Post programme, she said council officers told her no events would take place at Cooper's Field this time next year because of re-turfing work after the hosting of the fan zone.
Ms Thomas said there was nowhere else suitable in the city and organisers did not want to take the national event away from the capital.
She said: "It is inconceivable that the capital city of Wales may not have a Pride event in 2017.
"However, we believe that a solution to the current situation can be resolved."
In response, a council spokesman said: "The council has not cancelled the 2017 event, but there are challenges with some of the dates in next year's diary.
"The council events team are currently assessing all alternative possibilities and will continue to work closely with the organisers and continue to support the event."
Saturday's parade was the fifth through the city's streets -  a spectacle that attracted 1,000 people last year.
South Wales Police officers joined the parade and showed support for the LGBT community with a new Pride car.
It will tour the area, promoting the importance of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities and raising awareness of hate crime.
The force's LGBT network chairman, Scot Anderson, said the move was partly influenced by a shooting in a USA gay nightclub where 49 people died.
"Since the tragic events in Orlando, the LGBT community has been shocked to its core," he said.
"Officers and staff have a clear message, we stand together, to protect and keep you safe."
