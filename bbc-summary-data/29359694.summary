"I have dreamt of seeing the Brabham team back on the track, winning at the highest level," said Brabham, 49.
"Who knows where that could lead? Back to Formula 1, I hope."
The Australian said it was not feasible to rebuild the team from scratch and hopes "a new model of open source racing" will succeed.
Brabham last competed in F1 in 1992 with Britain's Damon Hill behind the wheel.
Founded in 1962, the team won the drivers' World Championship in 1966 through Sir Jack Brabham - the only man to win the title in his own car - in 1967 through New Zealander Denny Hulme, and in 1981 and 1983 with Brazilian Nelson Piquet.
