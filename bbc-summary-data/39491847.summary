Leeds defender Liam Cooper has admitted an FA charge of violent conduct after a "stamp" on Reading's Reece Oxford.

The 25-year-old missed United's defeat at Brentford on Tuesday, but is yet to find out the length of his suspension.
The incident, which was not seen by the match officials, occurred in the 75th minute of Saturday's Championship match, which Reading won 1-0.
"We spoke to Liam and decided together to plead guilty for the recklessness of it," said Leeds boss Garry Monk.
"But 100% not for any intent - Liam's not that type of lad, we know that, and he's very clear on that as well."
Centre-back Cooper could face a longer ban than the standard three matches, the Football Association said.
A panel of three former top-level referees reviewed the video footage to determine whether Cooper committed an act of violent conduct.
The FA said it had submitted a claim that the usual three-match ban was "clearly insufficient".
Monk added to BBC Radio Leeds: "We'll have to see what it [the ban] is and then understand it and take it from there."﻿﻿
