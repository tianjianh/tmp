Couch, fifth in the synchronised 10m platform final with partner Lois Toulson, scored 332.80 to finish fifth.
But Barrow, 27, could not emulate her former partner in the 10m synchro and finished 23rd with a score of 277.40, with only the top 18 progressing.
The semi-final starts at the Maria Lenk Centre at 14:00 BST on Thursday.
"It was hard to stay focused for such a long time in a 28-diver preliminary round but it was pretty steady," said 27-year-old Couch from Plymouth.
"Three of my dives were really good so hopefully I can do those again tomorrow and the two that I dropped a little bit hopefully I can step them up.
"I had a shaky start but I had a talking to myself when I got to the handstand and shook things up a little as I was a little bit flat to start off with."
Barrow said: "I wanted to finish with a better score than that. The journey has been really tough but I got here on a good score and I wanted to do that again. There are no excuses for why I didn't.
