Craig Cooke was arrested in Huyton, Merseyside, on 15 December 2015.
The 24-year-old claimed he had intended to use the Molotov cocktails to "scare" a man who rejected his advances after they met online, prosecutors said.
Cooke, of Hartsbourne Avenue in Belle Vale, admitted making and possessing an explosive and possession of a bladed article at Liverpool Crown Court.
He was jailed for three years four months on Thursday.
After the sentencing, Det Con Ian Young said "a quick-thinking member of the public" had alerted police to Cooke "acting in a suspicious manner", and he was arrested at the scene".
"We don't know what would have happened that night if Cooke hadn't been detained," he said.
"Thankfully, no-one was injured and this man has now been taken from our streets."
