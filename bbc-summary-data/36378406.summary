Holloway, 23, scored eight goals in 64 games for Wycombe, having joined in 2014 following his release by Newport.
Neal, 30, played eight times for Port Vale before being released, while he also had a loan spell at Bury in March.
Cairns, 23, was released by Rotherham on Friday after failing to make an appearance for the Championship club.
"I think the aim should be to get promoted," Holloway told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"My agent has a really good relationship with the people here and he said how good they are and they'll look after me.
"I came over to see the facilities and obviously they speak for themselves, so it's a no-brainer when you see those."
