[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 0-0 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promotion-chasing Scunthorpe United's winless run was extended to three games as they played out a scrappy goalless draw at home to Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
While neither side lacked endeavour, there was a notable absence of clear-cut chances at both ends of the field, although Scunthorpe's Luke Daniels was undoubtedly the busier of the two goalkeepers.
Twice he denied Simeon Jackson from inside the box before pushing a 68th-minute shot from Joe Edwards onto the bar after the Saddlers wing-back had caught Levi Sutton in possession.
Daniels also came to the Iron's rescue late on after the lively Erhun Oztumer opted to have a go at goal from 30 yards.
At the other end of the field, Scunthorpe struggled for ideas and a spark in the final third as they failed to score for only the fifth time this term.
Full-back Harry Toffolo had their best effort of the game six minutes before the break, but shot straight at Walsall stopper Neil Etheridge.
Following Saturday's 4-1 defeat at Bolton, Walsall's third draw in four away matches was at a cost, as they lost midfielder Flo Cuvelier on 37 minutes with a calf strain.
Cuvelier was on his longest run of injury-free appearances (11) since the second of his two loan spells with the Saddlers in 2012-13.
