A case of H7N7 bird flu has been confirmed at a poultry farm in Lancashire, the government has said.

All birds at the farm in Goosnargh, Preston, are being humanely culled, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.
A temporary control zone imposed on Friday at the affected farm has now been replaced by a 10km surveillance zone and an inner 3km protection zone.
Public Health England says the risk to the public is very low.
The restrictions mean all poultry farms around the infected premises are not allowed to move poultry, captive birds or other livestock except under licence.
Defra's chief vet Nigel Gibbens said the restrictions were "part of our tried and tested approach to dealing with previous outbreaks".
He advised bird keepers to "remain alert" and report any suspected cases to the Animal and Plant Health Agency.
The H7N7 strain is highly contagious in flocks and can cause deaths in birds, but is "very rare" in humans, the NHS says.
The NHS website says no humans have been infected with bird flu in the UK.
The Food Standards Agency has said there is no food safety risk for consumers.
