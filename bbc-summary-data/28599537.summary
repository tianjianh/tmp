The Dorset line from Swanage to Wareham was closed by British Rail, and ripped up in seven weeks, in 1972.
Swanage Railway volunteers rebuilt it from 1976, and it ran its first passenger trains on 5 August 1979 on a few hundred yards of track.
Pete Frost, a volunteer driver on the 5.5-mile (8.8km) heritage line from Swanage to Norden Park and Ride, was one of the first people to gain access to the site after the British Rail closure.
Next year, a regular service on the 10-mile stretch between Swanage, Corfe Castle and Wareham is set to run, for the first time in 43 years.
