A Cardiff theatre producer has admitted falsifying bank statements to show £29,000 was available to fund a play in order to obtain the money himself.

Freelance worker Michael Salmon, 30, from Grangetown, led the production Cosy at Wales Millennium Centre.
He pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud at Cardiff Crown Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned for sentencing.
The deception took place between May 2015 and February 2016.
Salmon had written a false letter in support of the production to the Arts Council of Wales and produced false bank statements showing £29,000 was available to fund it.
He also made a false representation to Arts Admin Ltd, saying a grant of £26,394 was going to be spent on it.
Salmon was released on bail and will be sentenced on 16 June.
Wales Millennium Centre managing director Mathew Milsom said no funding contributions or applications were made.
He added: "Michael Salmon was a freelance producer for the play Cosy and not directly employed by Wales Millennium Centre.
"The centre's involvement in the project extended solely to some technical support and presenting the production at the centre."
