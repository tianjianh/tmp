[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
RNLI Kessock, coastguard personnel and police made searches of the river and Inverness Harbour on Sunday night after the alarm was raised at 17:20.
Police Scotland said the man was reported to have gone into the river at the Greig Street footbridge.
The man is believed to be in his 40s and wearing dark clothing, police said.
The latest search has also involved checks of Inverness' harbour and marina.
It had been hoped a coastguard helicopter would join the effort, but bad weather prevented the aircraft and crew being involved.
