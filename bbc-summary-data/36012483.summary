[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two people had to be rescued from a car after becoming stranded by the sea on a tidal causeway in Northumberland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rescue mission took place on the road that leads to the island of Lindisfarne - also called Holy Island - on Sunday afternoon.
The couple were eventually saved by the coastguard and taken back to dry land.
Northumbria Police said they were "safe and well" and the vehicle would remain on the causeway until it was safe to return.
Warning signs at either end of the road urge drivers to check the tide times, which explain when it is safe to cross each day.
The island is a popular tourist destination and wildlife haven and has a population of about 180.
