The Made in Hull display marks the start of the city hosting the year-long arts festival.
Organisers said it would feature live video, archive footage, images and sound "to tell the story of the city and its people over the last 75 years".
The event runs every evening for a week starting on 1 January.

It is being co-ordinated by Hull-based documentary film-maker Sean McAllister.
Other artists involved include Zsolt Balogh, who worked on the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympic Games and Invisible Flock, who have recorded audio on the city's streets and the crowd at a Hull City game.
Martin Green, CEO and director of Hull 2017, said the display would be "a thrilling, evocative and thought-provoking start to Hull's year as UK City of Culture".
He added: "It is inspired by the concept of the son et lumiÃ¨re, but with one of the finest documentary filmmakers working today at the helm it will be a bit different - as you might expect in Hull."
