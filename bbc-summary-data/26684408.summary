[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Piggin, 18, is alleged to have planned attacks on targets in Loughborough, Leicestershire, including a mosque, a cinema and a school.
The trial was shown a video of the teenager spray painting hate messages and hurling a Molotov cocktail bomb.
He denies two Terrorism Act charges but admitted having explosives.
In the latest video shown to the trial at London's Old Bailey, Mr Piggin is seen spraying "No more mosques!" on a wall of Loughborough leisure centre on a path at the back of the building.
Another video shows him lighting a rag stuffed into a bottle full of fuel, commonly known as a Molotov cocktail, and then throwing it against the same wall.
The jury was told that at the time up to 12 children were using a creche in the building, which has an outside play area.
In the shaky video, Mr Piggin, who has Asperger's Syndrome, is seen walking over to the bomb and inspecting the flames, which lick up the wall of the leisure centre.
He can be heard saying "we are the URA, we just done a Molotov". Earlier in the hearing, the jury was told "URA" stood for the Urban Revolutionary Army.
Mr Piggin, of Beaumont Road, Shelthorpe, admits three charges of possessing explosives but denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism and having a document containing information likely to be useful for committing or preparing an act of terrorism.
He also denies possessing the Mujahideen Poisons Handbook, which is banned under terrorism laws.
The trial continues.
