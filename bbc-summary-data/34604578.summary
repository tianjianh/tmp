Islands SNP MP asks Scottish government to delay MPAs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An SNP MP has called on the Scottish government to delay its planned introduction later this year of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Angus MacNeil said the government should listen to the concerns of fishing communities in his Western Isles constituency.
He said there should be a delay to allow additional powers to be agreed for island communities.
The SNP government sees MPAs as a way of better protecting marine habitats.
Their introduction has support from conservation charities and elements of the fishing industry, including creel fishermen.
Mr MacNeil has made his call a day after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who was on a visit to Skye, invited islanders to have their say in a consultation on proposals that could see additional powers given to island communities.
He said there were "significant disagreements" between the fishing industry and the Scottish government directorate Marine Scotland about the management of MPAs.
Mr MacNeil said: "At a time when new powers are being considered, when more control of the marine area could be one of them, it seems prudent that this process is delayed.
"Therefore one aspect of my response to Nicola Sturgeon's wise call to consult over island powers, is to urge caution on the draconian MPA plans as these will be economically damaging to islands and are an example of something better dealt with in the islands where their effects will be felt."
He added: "I remain very concerned about the possible economic impact of proposed management plans for the MPAs and I think the Scottish government should take its time in coming to a final decision when so much is at stake."
Last month, MSPs heard opposing views from the fishing industry on Scotland's 30 MPAs.
The rural affairs, climate change and environment committee heard concerns from some fishermen that the management of MPAs would harm their business.
Creel fishermen and scallop divers welcomed limits on some fishing methods such as scallop dredging.
The committee was gathering evidence from the industry on the roll-out of MPAs in places such as the Small Isles and Sound of Barra.
Leaders representing trawler owners and crews from the Clyde and up the west coast to Lochinver said restrictions on fishing grounds in winter would deny boats sheltered waters during stormy weather.
They also criticised Scottish government agency Marine Scotland's consultation on MPAs.
