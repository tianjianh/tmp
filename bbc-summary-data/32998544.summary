Southern rail engineers vote over 'impossible targets'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 engineers at Southern rail are to be balloted for industrial action over issues including new rosters and "impossible work targets".

Rail, Maritime and Transport union members will vote in the coming weeks amid claims that industrial relations have "comprehensively broken down".
The union is also seeking a four-hour cut in the working week to 35 hours.
A Southern spokesman said the rail operator was aware of the issues and "dialogue with the union is ongoing".
He added that it had received no formal notification from the RMT union that it intended to ballot its members.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the union would not stand by while "agreed policies, procedures and agreements are unilaterally ripped up by Southern".
"Southern is a company intensively under the spotlight over its performance at the moment and RMT will not have our members scapegoated for failures at the top by outrageous and intimidatory demands to meet impossible work targets and through attacks on working conditions.
"The union is in no doubt that the pressure on these staff to deliver impossible targets compromises safety in what is clearly a safety-critical environment," he said.
Southern runs services between London, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Kent.
