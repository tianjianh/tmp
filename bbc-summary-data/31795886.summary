Michael Burden, 76, needed to be moved from Leicester's Royal Infirmary (LRI) to a rehabilitation unit in Market Harborough.
His daughter Emma Purcell said the time he had to wait was unacceptable.
Arriva, which supplies the non-urgent ambulance transfers, apologised to the family for the "unacceptable" delay.
Mr Burden, who is now recovering at St Luke's Hospital, was in a waiting area at the LRI on Wednesday.
Mrs Purcell said:  "I went in and saw him sitting in a chair. Just a chair with his little bag packed next to his feet where he'd been since 9.30 that morning.
"All the staff on the ward are as frustrated as you are, because they can't do anything."
Asiya Jelani, Arriva spokesperson, said: "Delays of this nature are unacceptable and we do understand the impact they have on both patients and their families.
"We have made many improvements to the service we provide in Leicestershire over the last year and we continue to work closely with our NHS colleagues to identify ways in which we can further improve the service we provide."
A spokesperson for the Clinical Commissioning Group for East Leicestershire and Rutland, which commissions healthcare services for the NHS, said Arriva's performance was being monitored closely but it had been "adversely affected by the unprecedented demand and pressures on the healthcare system this winter".
