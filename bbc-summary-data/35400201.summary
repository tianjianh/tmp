The company has three bases in Scotland - Aberfoyle in Stirling, Peebles in the Borders and Crathes in Aberdeenshire.
Go Ape said the turnover represented a growth of 3% over the year.
Its 400m (1,312ft) zip wires at Aberfoyle, in the Queen Elizabeth Forest park, are two of the longest in Britain.
The Peebles centre in Glentress Forest has the highest zip wire in the country and the facility at Crathes includes a skateboard zip wire.
The company said it had seen revenue increase to £20m across the UK in 2015 - an 8% rise year-on-year.
Jerome Mayhew, managing director of Go Ape, said: "Despite one of the rainiest Scottish summers in history, we achieved a record turnover in Scotland in 2015, showing that regardless of the weather, there's still strong demand for outdoor-based activities from Scots who love living life adventurously.
"Our Scottish customers can swing through the tree-tops on zip wires and tackle obstacles and rope crossings in the great outdoors, whilst enjoying some of the country's most breathtaking scenery."
