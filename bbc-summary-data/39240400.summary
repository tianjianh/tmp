Dunfermline Athletic 0-1 Ayr United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ayr survived relentless pressure in a brave performance to take three huge points in their battle for championship survival.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dunfermline made a strong start and twice went close through Joe Carle and Michael Moffat.
But Ayr took the lead with a Ross Docherty header which sneaked over the Pars goal line, his first goal of the season.
Ayr clung on and defended desperately to claim all three points.
Cardle had an early goal-bound shot cleared by Conrad Balatoni before Moffat cracked the post with a glancing headed.
Ayr looked shaky in defence, but they dragged themselves back into the game after looking like they might be swamped by the Pars whirlwind start.
Docherty fired wide from the edge of the 18-yard line, turning and sweeping the shot past the post.
Dunfermline continued to threaten though and John Herron powered a header just past the post after a whipped cross from Callum Higginbotham on the right.
Dunfermline made a flying start to the second half and Moffat immediately forced keeper Greg Fleming to tip his drive over the bar.
But Ayr it was who struck first when Docherty powered a header down which evaded a forest of legs to cross the line.
That emboldened them and Michael Rose and Alan Forrest brought good saves from Pars keeper Sean Murdoch in quick succession.
Dunfermline's Joe Cardle then squandered a fine chance, sclaffing his shot wide of goal, before substitute David Hopkirk forced Fleming into a full length diving save.
The result keeps Ayr United above St Mirren, and moves them just three points behind eighth placed Dumbarton with a game in hand.
