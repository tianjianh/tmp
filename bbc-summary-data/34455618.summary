Community organisation says new refugee strategy needed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A refugee community organisation says a new strategy is needed to help refugees integrate in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northern Ireland is expected to offer shelter to more than 100 refugees a year over the next five years.
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness has said that the first arrivals could be here in December.
Jason Kouame of the Northern Ireland Community of Refugees and Asylum Seekers said: "The main problem is how much free housing is available".
Mr Kouame said: "Governments are bureaucracies and there needs to be changes for practical things like getting information from the HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) and securing housing. If these changes are not in place, charities will have to provide resources."
Speaking in the Assembly yesterday, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness acknowledged the need for a new integration strategy to improve the bureaucratic difficulties for refugees settling in Northern Ireland.
Mr McGuinness said: "We will continue to work with NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and stakeholders to understand the experience of refugees and asylum seekers and provide our support throughout."
An initial group of between 50 and 100 displaced people will be accommodated, with others arriving in phases.
Mr McGuinness also confirmed that a contribution will be made towards education expenses.
Education Minister John O'Dowd has asked his officials to prepare for the arrival of "significant numbers" of refugee children.
The Deputy First Minister said his department was seeking clarification on the payment of health and social care bills.
Mr Kouame said that securing employment and having access to free English classes will be vital for refugees  settling in Northern Ireland.
"These things can stop people being fully integrated."
Mr Kouame also said that a small number of refugees who have previously been settled in Northern Ireland have had to deal with racism.
He said: "There have been racial attacks in the past.  If someone here has been waiting for a house for 18 months and someone else comes in and gets the house, work has to be done with community groups to ensure there are no problems."
