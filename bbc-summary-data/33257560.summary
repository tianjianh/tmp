Ipswich Town sues Suffolk Police over 'illegal charging' for match-day policing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town is suing police for more than £500,000 of "illegal charging" for match-day policing costs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Suffolk Police was paid £511,869 for keeping order on the streets around Portman Road, the club's owners said.
They claim the force should not have demanded payment for policing the public areas surrounding the ground between 2008 and 2013.
The case comes after Leeds United successfully sued West Yorkshire Police for match-day policing costs.
A  judge ruled charges could not be levied for policing public land on match days, but only for providing services on land under the club's control.
A High Court writ issued by Ipswich Football Club Company Ltd said it had been the victim of "illegal charging" in relation to league, cup and friendly games since July 2008.
Barrister Hugh Southey QC said the club signed two agreements with police to pay charges for "supply of special police services" on match days, ranging from £5,926 to £25,242 per match.
Mr Southey said because the charges were levied for "public order policing on public land", Suffolk Constabulary had no legal power to collect them.
He said the club had written to police to request reimbursement but "no substantive response" had been received.
An Ipswich Town spokesman said: "The matter is with both respective legal advisors and the club has no further comment at this time."
A Suffolk Police spokeswoman said the force was aware of action being taken but could not comment further "due to ongoing legal proceedings".
