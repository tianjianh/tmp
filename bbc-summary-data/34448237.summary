Ethan Brady-Rainey from Llangollen was killed in the incident near the Pontcysyllte aqueduct last Wednesday.
At the opening of an inquest on Monday, the coroner was told that the Denbighshire schoolboy had hit his head on a rock after falling.
The hearing heard that the boy's friends did not witness the accident. The inquest was adjourned until 2016.
Police have already said that the death of the Ysgol Dinas Bran pupil is not being treated as suspicious.
Staff at his school paid tribute to the student last week, describing the Year 8 pupil from Trevor as "very happy, bubbly and kind".
"He was a keen sportsman who represented the school at football and attended conscientiously. He will be sadly missed by all at the school," they said.
A full inquest hearing is expected to be held in February.
