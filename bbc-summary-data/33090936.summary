Lord Saville: Bloody Sunday teenager Gerald Donaghey was "probably" carrying bombs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lord Saville, who chaired the Bloody Sunday inquiry, stands by his finding that one of those who was killed, Gerald Donaghey,  was "probably" carrying nail bombs when he was shot.

The 17-year-old was one of 13 people shot dead on 30 January 1972 by the Army in Londonderry.  Another man died five months later.
The teenager's family maintain that the bombs were planted by the RUC.
Lord Saville said he would be willing to meet with families of victims.
The Saville Report, published on 15 June 2010, was heavily critical of the Army and found that soldiers fired the first shot.
It also found that Gerald Donaghey was "probably armed with nail bombs but was not a threat at the time that he was shot".
The 17-year-old was a member of the IRA's youth wing, but witnesses said he did not have any bombs on him.
The family of Gerald Donaghey have been campaigning for years to clear his name.
Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Lord Saville said he has examined in detail the evidence put forward by his relatives.
"We spent some 120 pages investigating all the evidence connected with that particular aspect of the case and we weren't sure, but we thought on the balance of probabilities that he probably did have the nail bombs on him.
"I've read some of the material produced by those that disagree with that conclusion but I'm afraid that doesn't persuade me."
Lord Saville said he doesn't believe there is a strong enough case for an explanation as to how the bombs were planted on Gerald Donaghey.
"We did look at it in the most enormous detail and I am satisfied on the evidence that we received that we reached the right conclusion - but it was only on the matter of probabilities.
"Naturally I wanted to look at it just in case they were able to persuade me that we had got it completely wrong but they were unable to do that, and I remain of precisely the same view that we expressed in the report."
Lord Saville said he would be prepared to meet some of the Bloody Sunday families, including relatives of Gerald Donaghey, but he would not talk about the case in detail.
Gerald Donaghey's niece Geraldine Doherty has described Lord Saville's offer of meeting her family as a "token" gesture.
"He was the scapegoat for the rest of them all, they had to give them something. There's still that stain on Gerald and he's not fully vindicated," she said.
"The only reason we would want to meet him is to find out why he came to that conclusion on the nail bombs. It's just a courtesy, a good will gesture.
"As long as I live, I will never give this up for my uncle to get his name cleared properly."
