[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour to run North Ayrshire council as minority

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour will continue to run North Ayrshire Council despite a surge from the Scottish Conservatives in the local elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the first meeting of the council since the 4 May poll, Labour emerged as the minority administration.
After the previous local council elections in 2012 it had been the SNP which formed a minority administration.
But by-elections and boundary changes between 2012 and 2017 led to leadership of the council switching to Labour.
The council make up is now:
At the meeting councillor Ian Clarkson was chosen as provost and, following a vote, Joe Cullinane was named council leader.
Provost Clarkson was elected unanimously and will continue in the role he first took up last August.
He said: "I am deeply honoured to once again be elected Provost of North Ayrshire.
"It's a role I have grown to love over the past few months and I'm looking forward to getting out and about to meet people across the whole of North Ayrshire.
Following the 2012 election the SNP formed a minority administration, replacing the previous Labour minority administration which had existed from 2007-2012.
It had been the first time time for over 30 years that Labour has not been involved in running the council.
