Walter Scott killing: Mourners hear shooting was 'act of racism'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The killing of Walter Scott by a police officer in South Carolina was motivated by "overt racism", mourners at his funeral have heard.

Hundreds of people attended the service at the Ministries Christian Centre in North Charleston to remember the father-of-four, who was shot last week.
Officer Michael Slager was charged with his murder, after a video of the shooting emerged.
Reverend George Hamilton said Mr Slager was a disgrace to the police force.
He told mourners: "We will not indict the entire law enforcement community for the act of one racist."
Mr Scott's coffin was draped with an American flag and flanked by members of his family as it entered the church on Saturday.
Chairs were placed outside to accommodate the large number of people who turned out for the service.
The 50-year-old was shot several times as he ran away from Mr Slager, who had initially reprimanded him for a broken rear light on his car.
His relatives said Mr Scott probably fled from the officer out of fear of being jailed over missed child support payments.
The shooting occurred as heightened scrutiny is being placed on police officer shootings, particularly those that involve white officers and unarmed black suspects.
Tyrone Johnson, who went to school with Mr Scott, described him as a friendly person, who "never met an enemy".
"There are a lot of people out here, just paying their respects to him and his legacy," he added.
Mr Slager has been held without bail and faces up to life in prison if convicted of murder.
