Scottish FA reveal chair for cup final disorder commission

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edward F Bowen, a former sheriff principal for the Lothian and Borders, will chair the independent commission into the Scottish Cup final disorder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Violent clashes and vandalism marred Hibernian's win over Rangers as thousands spilled onto the Hampden pitch at the final whistle.
Mr Bowen CBE QC will establish the commission immediately.
And he will provide the Scottish FA with a report into the "security and risk management procedures" deployed.
The SFA has asked for the report to be presented by 31 July.
The SFA's compliance officer has also initiated an investigation into the scenes at the cup final, from a "football regulatory perspective".
A statement from the governing body says the independent commission will consider whether:
Rangers said some of their players were assaulted by Hibs supporters during the pitch invasion, while the victorious Edinburgh club has already imposed bans on a number of their supporters.
