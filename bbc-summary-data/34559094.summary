Nathan Cleverly's bid to earn a world title fight took a blow after a points defeat by Andrzej Fonfara in Chicago.

The 28-year-old Welshman saw the verdict of three judges go in Chicago-based Polish fighter Fonfara's favour.
Cleverly suffered a broken nose in the WBC International light heavyweight title bout, which both men saw as a step towards bigger things.
Promoter Eddie Hearn said: "On the way to hospital. Broken nose and needs blood drained from his ear, but is OK."
Cleverly was hit after the bell in the second round but the former WBO world champion was on top at that stage.
Yet by the seventh round Cleverly had blood splashed across his face, his nose taking the biggest toll as Fonfara found his range.
Cleverly, who suffered a third career loss, all of which have come in his last six fights, could not change the complexion of the fight as Fonfara exercised control until the final bell.
Fonfara was given the verdict by 115-113 from one judge and by 116-112 from two.
