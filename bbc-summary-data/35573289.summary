West Indies, whose senior team are struggling, beat India by five wickets in Bangladesh to seal the title.
Pacemen Ryan John and Alzarri Joseph each took three wickets as West Indies bowled out India for 145 in Dhaka.
Keacy Carty made an unbeaten 52 and Keemo Paul 40 as Windies chased down the total with three balls to spare.
It is the first major title for the West Indies at any level since Darren Sammy's senior team won the ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka in 2012.
And it raises hopes that they have a crop of young players who could make their mark in senior cricket.
Test and one-day captain Jason Holder and former skipper Chris Gayle were among the senior players to praise the "future stars" on their maiden title.
Under-19 skipper Shimron Hetmyer said: "We were not supposed to be the champions, but we did it. Words can't explain how good I feel."
The Twenty20 side are currently in dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) over player payments for the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 in India.
The WICB has set the players a deadline of 14 February to accept the terms on offer, and any players who refuse the remuneration package will not be considered for selection for the tournament, which starts its Super 10 stage on 15 March.
In addition, the one-day side has dropped below Bangladesh and Pakistan in the ICC rankings to miss out on qualification for the 2017 Champions Trophy.
And the Test side, who once went unbeaten for 15 years and 29 series between 1980 and 1995, now sit eighth in the ICC rankings.
