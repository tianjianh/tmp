The footage shows a man taking the money intended for the Daisy Chain Trust from Tapa on Shore Place, Leith.
At first the owners thought the bucket had been misplaced, but checked their CCTV when it failed to turn up two weeks later.
Police are appealing for witnesses to the theft which took place on 20 September at about 10:20.
There was about Â£90 in the bucket.
Tapa owner Daniel Shearon said the staff member on duty that day had been in a back office when the theft happened.
He said: "We are very upset about this.
"On Tuesday 20th of September at about 10:20am, the man on the left of the picture opportunistically entered the restaurant and stole our charity box while the man on the right kept watch from outside.
"We know the CCTV pictures of the men aren't great but Police Scotland would love to know if anybody recognises either of them.
"We're determined to turn this terrible act into a positive, as the charity we were collecting for is very close to our hearts.
"We love the charity because it's run entirely by volunteers, so 95% of the money raised goes directly to those who need it most.
"Their biggest fund-raising event of the year is coming up very soon at Oxenfoord Castle and is called the Chuffs Extravaganza- we'd love it if you could go along and support them."
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police in Edinburgh are investigating following the theft of various items from a restaurant in Leith.
"The incident happened around 10.30am on Tuesday 20th September at a premises in Shore Street.
"A charity collection bucket was stolen along with alcohol and inquiries are ongoing to trace those responsible.
"Anyone with information that can assist police with their investigation is asked to come forward."
