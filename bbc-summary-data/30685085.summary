Oldham sponsor threatens to pull out if Ched Evans signs

One of Oldham Athletic's biggest backers has told Newsbeat he'd pull out if the club signs convicted rapist Ched Evans.

Craig Verling, whose company sponsors a stand at Boundary Park, said: "There's no way, in any way, shape or form we'll support a rapist."
Evans was set to join the Latics on a long-term deal on Monday.
But more than 25,000 people have signed an online petition urging Oldham not to sign the Welsh international.
Verling, who's managing director of Verlin Rainwater Solutions, said he wouldn't hesitate in ditching the club should the 26-year-old sign.
"My views as a family man, running a family business, is that we do not wish to support Oldham if Ched Evans signs.
"That's our stance on it. Whether people think my opinion is right or wrong doesn't really bother me."
Oldham Athletic's Chief Executive has declined to say whether the club will sign Ched Evans.
Neil Joy read a statement outside the club's Boundary Park ground in which he said the club would "continue to have conversations" with the Professional Footballers' Association and "conduct due diligence" on the potential signing of Evans.
"The young generation that are going to Oldham Athletic shouldn't be exposed to someone like Ched Evans," said Verling.
"I'm for people having a second chance in life. Ched Evans should have a second chance, but it should not be in the public eye - and it certainly shouldn't be as a role model to young people."
Evans has always maintained his innocence and an investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission into his conviction is ongoing.
"If he went to court and he was found not guilty, it would change 100%," Verling admitted.
"But the fact of the matter is he's not shown any remorse. And if he was to apologise this late on it would only be to further his career.
"The apology should have come way, way, way before now."
The League 1 club are no strangers to controversy.
In 2007 they signed Lee Hughes, the former West Brom striker who had recently been released from prison after causing death by dangerous driving.
Verling wouldn't support a similar move for Evans, but said he would continue to support the club should they back out of any deal.
"I'd support 100% the decision not to sign him. If Oldham Athletic didn't sign Ched Evans then as far as I'm concerned nothing's changed."
