The Kitchener memorial in Orkney is among those in line for financial assistance.
The monument, which sits on an exposed cliff edge, and faces extensive weathering - is getting £30,000.
Memorials in Helensburgh, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Huntly, Tullibody and Keiss have also received War Memorials Trust funding.
The recipients are:
Frances Moreton, the director of War Memorials Trust, said: "The charity is delighted at the level of interest in this scheme and the enthusiasm of people across the country to do something about the condition of their memorials.
"There are still plenty of funds available for the right projects so get in touch to see if we can help your local war memorial."
