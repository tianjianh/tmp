The 27-year-old footballer was found dead at home on Sunday, a day after he led his side in a 4-0 League of Ireland win over Drogheda United.
The cause of death is not yet known but a post-mortem has been carried out.
His funeral was held in Londonderry's St Columba's Church hours before it hosts Martin McGuinness' funeral. Irish President Michael D Higgins is attending both services.
Mourners began arriving at Long Tower Church about an hour before Ryan McBride's funeral.
The feeling among those at the church remained one of shock at the sudden death of Derry City's 27-year-old captain.
"It's been an awful week for the city," one said, reflecting not just the death of Ryan McBride, but also former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness.
Before the service, members of the club's youth squads and women's team lined the entrance to the church, with the club's traditional colours of red, white and black on full display.
Teammates walked alongside the hearse as it approached on the short journey from the city's Brandywell area. Flowers within the coffin spelled out the word "captain" and depicted McBride's jersey - number five.
The player was buried in the city cemetery.
During the service, an emotional Kenny Shiels - the manager of Derry City - read out a poem in tribute to his captain on behalf of the players and staff at the club.
McBride's death is the latest tragedy to befall the club following the death of striker Mark Farren and the Buncrana pier tragedy, which claimed the lives of family members of winger Josh Daniels a year ago.
"He epitomised everything about our club and our city," said Derry City chief executive Sean Barrett.
"Of the words that have been thrown around probably my favourite one is 'warrior'.
Derry City manager Kenny Shiels said the death was "hard for everybody to take" and that he was "the perfect example to any young player coming through".
Since his debut in 2011, McBride had not only become a mainstay of the club's defence, but a fans' favourite.
He made more than 170 appearances, with more than 50 as captain after he took over the role permanently two years ago.
A self-professed quiet man off the pitch, McBride said it was a "different story" on it. "I switch on and then I'm in game mode," he said.
Republic of Ireland footballer James McClean, a former team mate of McBride at Derry, said he was "a warrior that literally would throw his body on the line when he pulled on that Derry City jersey, a club that meant so much to him".
