[SN]TITLE[SN]
New home for 'slaughter-free' Ahimsa dairy farm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK's first "slaughter-free" dairy farm has moved to a new permanent home - where it hopes to provide a model for other farms to copy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dairy cows are usually culled when they get older and cannot produce as much milk, and their male calves are normally killed or sold for meat.
At the Ahimsa dairy in Rutland, oxen are put to work and cows can "retire".
The farm was previously on rented land in Leicestershire but has secured its future with land bought in Manton.
Nicola Pazdzierska said that while their milk was more expensive, many people were willing to spend the extra.
"We charge a lot more for the product but part of that money is going into our cows' pension fund, and at the same time, we don't think milk should be a cheap product," she said.
"In London a pint of craft beer can sell for Â£6.20, so we don't think it's unsustainable for our milk to sell for Â£4.50 a litre at a farmers' market, or Â£3.50 for members.
"We want to make the model replicable so other farms can follow."

The Ahimsa Dairy Foundation was founded in 2011 and originally produced milk in partnership with an organic farm in Kent.
The organisation was inspired by the farm at Bhaktivedanta Manor, in Hertfordshire, which is run by the Hare Krishna movement, after being donated by Beatles musician George Harrison.
The cows would produce milk in Kent and retire to the Ahimsa farm in Groby, in Leicestershire.
All of the organisation's 30 animals now live at the new farm in Manton, Rutland, and all of the milk production is there too.
In future, the farm aims to produce its own cheese and also create a visitor centre.
