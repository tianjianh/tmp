Jamie Clark, 28, lost fingers on his left hand after being arrested for a "domestic incident" in Burry Port, Carmarthenshire.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is looking into the matter, which happened in Llanelli on 20 June.
Dyfed-Powys Police said the man "suffered an injury while in custody".
Mr Clark, of Burry Port, was arrested after an argument with his girlfriend. He has since been released on bail.
He said officers restrained him while he was in a cell, but he put his hand out as they tried to close the door.
"My hand actually went in between the hinge of the door and I knew my middle finger was severed immediately. I've never felt pain like it."
After his hand was released, he said the other two fingers were left "crushed and twisted".
A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman said: "We can confirm an incident occurred on the night of Monday 20 June, whereby a male required hospital treatment after suffering an injury while in custody.
"The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."
The IPCC said: "We received a referral from Dyfed-Powys Police after a man suffered a serious hand injury while in custody.
"After assessment we have decided we will conduct an independent investigation into how the man sustained the injury, and his period in custody."
