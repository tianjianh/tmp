Reading manager Jaap Stam was full of praise for in-form striker Yann Kermorgant after his brace in their win against Blackburn Rovers.

Four goals in the past three games from Kermorgant have solidified Reading's place in the Championship play-offs.
"Yann's a quality player and everyone knows that," Stam said. "He's important for the team in everything he does."
Victory against relegation-threatened Blackburn lifted Reading to third ahead of Huddersfield's match with Norwich.
Kermorgant, 35, last week confirmed his intention to retire at the end of next season when his current contract with the Royals ends.
The former Bournemouth, Charlton and Leicester City player has now scored 13 league goals this season for Reading, who have won their past three games.
"In heading a ball, he's got a lot of quality," Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire. "He's real class, especially if you deliver the type of crosses to him that we did tonight."
Reading travel to Norwich on Saturday, holding a nine-point cushion over seventh-placed Fulham with six games remaining.
