Brexit delay claim in Amina Al-Jeffery 'locked up' case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A post-Brexit vote surge in Irish passport applications has hit the case of a Swansea woman claiming to be held in Saudi Arabia against her will.

Amina Al-Jeffery, 21, had complained her father locked her up in a Jeddah flat, which he has disputed.
But the High Court was told on Friday that a face-to-face meeting with Ms Al-Jeffery's solicitor had not happened due to passport delays.
The case has now been adjourned until February.
In August, Mr Justice Holman said her father had to "permit and facilitate" his daughter's return to England or Wales by 11 September, but she has not returned.
A further hearing was told that restrictions on Miss Al-Jeffery had been eased.
But the judge said he wanted to hear the outcome of a meeting with the woman's solicitor Anne-Marie Hutchinson to resolve the issue "once and for all".
However, the High Court was told that meeting has still not taken place as Irish national Ms Hutchinson required a new passport to accommodate travel visas.
The court was told there was a backlog in passport applications following June's vote to leave the EU.
"There you have it. The reach of Brexit has even impacted on progress in this case. Who would have foreseen it?" said the judge.
