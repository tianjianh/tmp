Marwan Koukash: Salford owner takes on chief executive role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salford Red Devils owner Marwan Koukash is to take on chief executive duties at the Super League side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Kuwait-born businessman and racehorse owner will take on the role from Martin Vickers.
Koukash, 57, took over Salford in January 2013 when the club were in financial difficulty.
"I've been involved in the club for the last three years and I really didn't take direct control of what goes on," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"It is a business I have now learnt a lot about and I want to try and put my business and commercial skills into action here and be involved in the day-to-day running of the club.
"In terms of rugby, I assure everybody out there, I have no involvement in the boss (director of ruby Tim Sheens) as I call him, as he is the one who will make all of the decisions."
