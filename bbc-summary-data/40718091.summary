Disenchantment is set in the crumbling medieval kingdom of Dreamland and according to Groening, is about "life and death, love and sex".
It will be released 10 episodes at a time. Groening is also an executive producer on the show.
"Matt's brilliant work has resonated with generations round the world," said Netflix vice-president Cindy Holland.
"We couldn't be happier to work with him on Disenchantment.
"The series will bear his trademark animation style and biting wit and we think it's a perfect fit for our many Netflix animation fans."
Among the characters in the new series are hard-drinking young princess Bean, her feisty elf companion Elfo and her personal demon Luci.
The series will feature the voice talents of Broad City's Abbi Jacobson (Bean), Academy Award-winning screenwriter Nat Faxon (Elfo) and Man Seeking Woman's Eric Andre (Luci). The Mighty Boosh star and new Great British Bake Off host Noel Fielding will also voice a character.
Groening said: "It is also about how to keep laughing in a world full of suffering and idiots, despite what the elders and wizards and other jerks tell you."
There have been more than 600 episodes of The Simpsons, which was first broadcast in December 1989.
