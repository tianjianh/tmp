[SN]TITLE[SN]
New dog poo offence to be considered in Daventry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dog owners caught without the means of clearing up after their pets could be fined up to £1,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daventry District Council already uses three dog control orders (DCOs) targeting dog foul, dogs in play areas and dogs on leads.
The "new power" proposed by the council would force dog owners to show how they would clear up after their animals.
The council admits the idea, to be decided on Thursday, could be "controversial".
Owners caught without a bag or other means of collecting dog mess could be issued with a £100 penalty notice, with the potential of a £1,000 court fine if left unpaid.
A spokesman for the council said: "The proposed new power to enable our officers to require dog owners to produce the means by which they will pick up after their dogs has the potential to be controversial.
"The consultation process will give the public an opportunity to lobby against the use of this power or alternatively provide essential support to its introduction."
