The Belgium midfielder, 25, pulled up in the 81st minute of Saturday's 3-1 win over Swansea at Liberty Stadium.
Guardiola said De Bruyne's injury is "not big" and he should return in "two and a half to three weeks".
He also confirmed captain Vincent Kompany will return in two to three weeks from muscle fatigue.
The prognosis means De Bruyne could return for City's Champions League tie against Barcelona on 19 October.
