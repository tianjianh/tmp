That is about a fifth of all pedestrian and cycling casualties in the capital.
However the mayor's office said fewer people were seriously hurt on the roads in 2014 and fatalities were at a low.
Green Party London Assembly Member Jenny Jones said hit-and-runs were increasing due to the high number of people driving illegally in London.
She said: "I think London's hard pushed traffic police do a great job, but there are not enough of them. The Met Police really must act urgently to ensure that drivers take responsibility for their actions."
The number of pedestrians injured in hit and runs in 2014 rose by 169 from the previous year. The number of cyclists injured in hit-and-runs for the same period rose by 120 to 1,014 in total.
Most of the injuries were not serious though, and the number of people killed or seriously injured by hit-and-runs last year fell by 7%  - the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured in the same period fell by 12%.
London Cycling Campaign's Tom Bogdanowicz said: "This level of lawlessness must be tackled as a priority including action to take unlicensed and uninsured cars and lorries off the road."
Sarah Williams, from Living Streets which represents pedestrians, said: "It is shocking that people trying to go about their day are being injured and killed on our streets. London's streets need to be made safer places to walk."
The mayor's office said the mayor was investing nearly Â£1bn in cycling infrastructure and in tackling illegal, dangerous and careless road behaviour.
The Met said it has a specialist investigation team for roads policing and transport which concentrates on serious collisions.
