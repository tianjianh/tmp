Rugby league convert Ben Te'o missed training on Monday as England continue to prepare for Saturday's first Test against Australia in Brisbane.

The uncapped Leinster centre, 29, sat out the action with "muscle soreness".
"It was on the advice of the medical department," said England defence coach Paul Gustard. "He's all good and has settled in really well."
New Zealand-born Te'o is competing with Luther Burrell and Owen Farrell to make his debut at inside centre.
England, coached by Australian Eddie Jones, face the Wallabies in three Tests.
