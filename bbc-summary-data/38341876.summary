The 41-year-old former Northampton Saints and Clermont Auvergne man will take over as attack coach in interim chief Rob Howley's team.
It is a role normally held by Howley, who is in charge of Wales while head coach Warren Gatland is on British and Irish Lions duty.
Former England fly-half King was Howley's half-back partner at Wasps.
King was Northampton's attack coach when they won the Premiership title in 2014, but left the East midlands club earlier this year and is set to take up a position at Montpellier next season.
Cardiff Blues' Matt Sherratt filled to role for Wales during the autumn internationals when Wales beat Argentina, Japan and South Africa but lost to Australia.
He is returning to the Blues to concentrate on his regional duties.
"We are really pleased to bring in Alex for the Six Nations, but we would also like to thank Matt for all his hard work and effort during the autumn," said Howley.
"Alex is an experienced, highly-respected attack coach and we are delighted to have him as part of our team."
King played alongside Howley when Wasps did the English Premiership and European Cup double in 2004 under coach Gatland.
"This is a hugely exciting opportunity for me personally," said King.
"It is a real privilege to be asked and I am now really looking forward to meeting up with the coaches, the rest of the management team and particularly the talented Welsh players."
