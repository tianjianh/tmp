[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 1-1 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Maguire fired his fifth goal of the season to earn Oxford a 1-1 draw with Charlton at the Kassam Stadium and deny the Addicks a first win in five.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Russell Slade's men went in front through a 54th-minute penalty by Johnnie Jackson.
U's right-back Phil Edwards handled Ademola Lookman's deep free-kick and Jackson calmly planted the spot-kick straight into the middle of the goal as Simon Eastwood dived to the right.
That was the first goal Oxford had conceded for over five and a half hours.
However, they equalised on a swift counter-attack in the 67th minute as substitute Kane Hemmings picked out Maguire making a run to his right, and Maguire drove beyond Declan Rudd from 14 yards.
Both teams produced some free-flowing passing football in the first half.
Rudd saved superbly to turn Chey Dunkley's header for a corner and Marvin Johnson twice went close with angled shots.
Eastwood raced off his line to block Lookman's shot with his legs and late in the game the U's goalkeeper brilliantly tipped over Josh Magennis' point-blank header.
Charlton finished with 10 men as Harry Lennon was shown the red card in the 94th minute for his second foul on Liam Sercombe.
The draw extended Oxford's unbeaten league run to four games.
