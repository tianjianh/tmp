[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eastleigh 1-1 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lowly Southport marked their first game under new boss Steve Burr by battling back from a goal down to claim a draw at Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sandgrounders sacked Andy Bishop after a miserable run of four defeats in their last five games although there appeared to be more defensive resilience under Burr as they repelled their opponents in a dour first half.
Eastleigh continued to put the pressure on after the interval and their persistence paid off when a low cross was half cleared, and Mikael Mandron curled into the top corner in the 51st minute.
The hosts continued to dominate but their failure to score a second came back to haunt them as James Gray equalised almost immediately after coming off the bench by converting James Caton's cross in the 71st minute.
