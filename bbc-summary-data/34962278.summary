The final film in the Hunger Games series has held onto the top spot at the US and Canada box office, despite competition from Pixar's new release.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 took $51.6m (£34.3m) on its second weekend in North American cinemas.
The Good Dinosaur, in contrast, could only muster $39.2m (£26m) from its first five days on release.
Creed, a continuation of the Sylvester Stallone Rocky series, opened in third place with a $30.1m (£20m) haul.
Both The Good Dinosaur and Creed opened in cinemas on Wednesday to take advantage of America's Thanksgiving holiday.
Mockingjay - Part 2, the final outing for Jennifer Lawrence's futuristic tyranny-battling Katniss Everdeen character, has now made more than $440m (£292.7m) worldwide.
But according to the Box Office Mojo site, its 10-day takings in North America - which currently stand at just short of $200m (£133m) - are $25m (£16.6m) down on what its immediate predecessor had grossed at the same point in its release one year ago.
The Good Dinosaur, Pixar's second release of 2015, tells of a friendship between an Apatosaurus and an infant caveman in an alternate reality in which dinosaurs have not become extinct.
The film, which had a troubled production history, had the third lowest North American opening in the company's history, with only A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2 faring less well with what were far more limited debuts in comparison.
Creed, in which Stallone's Rocky Balboa character becomes the trainer to the son of his former adversary Apollo Creed, attracted an audience primarily made up of males aged 25 and over.
Ryan Coogler's film, part of which was shot in Liverpool, has received glowing reviews from critics, one of whom said it was "the best Rocky film since the [1976] original".
Spectre, the latest entry in the James Bond series, is ranked fourth in this week's chart, with The Peanuts Movie charting in fifth place.
The latter, which brings Charles M Schulz's Peanuts characters to the big screen in computer-animated form, will be called Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts Movie when it is released in the UK in December.
Victor Frankenstein, a new version of Mary Shelley's monster story starring James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe, failed to make much of an impression, earning just $3.4m (£2.3m) in its first five days in cinemas.
