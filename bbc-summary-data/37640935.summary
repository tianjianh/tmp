[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Angus Robertson has been named as the new deputy leader of the SNP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Moray MP replaces Stewart Hosie, who stood down following newspaper revelations about his private life.
Mr Robertson defeated Edinburgh East MP Tommy Sheppard, Alyn Smith MEP and Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny to take 52.5% of the votes cast.
About 120,000 SNP members were entitled to vote in the contest, with the winner announced at the party's conference.
Tommy Sheppard received 25.5%  of the votes, while Alyn Smith received 18.6% and Chris McEleny 3.3%.
Speaking from the stage of the SNP conference at the SECC in Glasgow, Mr Robertson thanked those who supported him and said he was "absolutely bowled over" to have been elected.
He said: "I think it makes perfect sense for the leadership team of the SNP to be made up of our leader in the Scottish government and Parliament, Nicola Sturgeon the first minister, and the leader of the SNP at Westminster.
"I think it makes perfect sense that our leadership team reflects Scotland - Nicola as a fantastic representative of this great city in central Scotland - myself a parliamentarian living, working and representing a part of rural Scotland.
"We are the Scottish National Party, the clue is in the name. We represent the whole of the country and everybody who lives here regardless of where we come from and we should never forget that."
Mr Robertson told members that his party was "the most effective party" in Scotland and that there were "big challenges ahead".
He added: "We are very, very close to independence and we must start campaigning right now to persuade people who didn't vote yes in 2014."
Angus Robertson first arrived at Westminster after being elected as the MP for Moray in 2001. He is also the SNP's leader at Westminster, a role which allows him to quiz the prime minister every week at PMQs.
A former BBC journalist, he reportedly joined the SNP at the age of 15 after being handed a leaflet by Charlie Reid of the Proclaimers.
During the contest to replace Stewart Hosie, Mr Robertson cited his "excellent working relationship with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon" and his proven track record in senior positions within the SNP as proof of his suitability for the role as deputy leader.
When he formally launched his bid, he asserted that Scotland was "on the brink of independence".
