We'll be hearing honest, heart warming accounts from young people as they share their innermost feelings in the pursuit of being #BodyPositive. And in doing so we hope you feel like you can share your story too.
Meet Nicole, she's 17. She's at college. She's dances, horse rides three times a week, is in the athletics team, and has a part-time job as a lifeguard. Sounds normal so far. But Nicole has to balance that with taking 30 tablets a day and having regular physio. She has cystic fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis is one of the UK's most common life-threatening inherited diseases. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a single defective gene. As a result, the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, become clogged with thick sticky mucus resulting in chronic infections and inflammation in the lungs and difficulty digesting food.
This is Nicole's story.
