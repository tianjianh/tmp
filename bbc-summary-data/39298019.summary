Channel Four have finally revealed the new Great British Bake Off line-up.

Paul Hollywood remains as a judge and will be joined by Prue Leith.
Prue is already a well-known food writer.
It's the presenting line up which is more surprising.
Comedian and writer Sandi Toksvig will be joined by Noel Fielding.
Noel is a comedian and actor.
Channel 4 boss Jay Hunt says "Paul and Prue have huge amounts of expertise and warmth.  I'm looking forward to seeing them putting our great new bunch of amateur bakers through their paces."
Bake Off will start on Channel 4 after being on the BBC for many years.
