The pair follow head coach Vern Cotter in extending their deals until 2017, with the New Zealander having signed a new contract before the World Cup.
Taylor joined the Scotland set-up in 2012, with Humphreys arriving in 2013.
Cotter described Humphreys and Taylor's deals as "very good news for the national team and for the development of future Scotland players".
"They are good people who have contributed a great deal towards the standards we set and the style we play, continually offering new and innovative ways to raise the bar for the Scotland team," he added.
In recent weeks, Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend and Edinburgh counterpart Alan Solomons have also signed new deals until 2017.
Taylor serves as defence coach for both the national team and the Warriors, who he helped steer to the Pro12 title last season.
"It's been an absolute pleasure to work with the national team and I feel that we've made massive strides in all the areas of our play," Taylor told the Scottish Rugby website.
"Our performances in the Rugby World Cup are a really good example of how this team is moving forward and I think there are bigger and better things ahead as we target the Six Nations over the coming years."
Forwards coach Humphreys, who won 35 caps for Wales, agrees that Scotland can achieve success over the next few years.
"I've really enjoyed my time in the role and it's great to extend my contract because there's bags of potential in this team," he explained.
"Over the next 18 months or so I believe we'll really start to see this team realise that potential and it'll be hugely satisfying to be part of something that could be quite special."
