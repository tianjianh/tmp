[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS trust is to be prosecuted over the drowning of an 18-year-old patient at one of its facilities, the BBC has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connor Sparrowhawk suffered an epileptic fit while in a bath at Slade House in Oxford in July 2013.
Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust eventually admitted responsibility and offered his family compensation.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) told the BBC it will now prosecute the trust.
Following the announcement, Mr Sparrowhawk's mother Sara Ryan said: "I still feel really sad about it.
"I just feel we've been put through the mill. We have been treated appallingly and a young man should be doing whatever he would be doing right now.
"He should never have died."
The HSE said it was prosecuting the trust "under Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 following its investigation into the death of a patient under its care".
A jury-led inquest in October 2015 found that "failings" by trust staff contributed to Connor's death.
The trust's boss Katrina Percy resigned in October amid public pressure.
Slade House closed in 2014 and the building is being transferred to Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust.
Andrew Smith, the former MP for Oxford East who is not standing at the next election, said: "I was pleased to learn this news just as my time as MP was ending."
Southern Health provides mental health services to patients across Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.
It is also facing prosecution over alleged failings at Melbury Lodge, Royal Hampshire County Hospital, where a patient sustained serious injuries during a fall from a low roof.
