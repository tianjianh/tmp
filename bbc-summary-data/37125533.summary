Swansea City manager Francesco Guidolin says he will not be the man to pick a successor to captain Ashley Williams.

Guidolin wants to bring in a replacement for the central defender following his switch to Everton.
"I am optimistic about replacing Ash. I speak frequently with the chairman. We haven't rushed," he said.
"I use my experience to work with players chosen by the club, this is my philosophy. But we are working for transfers, we need a central defender."
Guidolin insists that while it is down to chairman Huw Jenkins to identify and secure transfer targets, he is happy to offer an opinion as Swansea seek to replace Wales captain Williams following eight years with the club.
The Swans did not want the 31-year-old to leave the Liberty Stadium.
"I can say something as I know many players in the world - but it is not a problem for me to use players chosen by the club," said Guidolin.
"We have time I think."
Guidolin also said he will not seek to replace Andre Ayew following his switch to West Ham.
Swansea have signed Spanish strikers Fernando Llorente and Borja Baston, but Ayew was one of four forwards to leave the Liberty Stadium.
"No, I don't feel we need a direct replacement for him," said Guidolin, adding: "With the squad, I am happy."
Swansea's new US owners will be at the Liberty Stadium for the first time for the visit of Hull City on Saturday.
However, they will not see Borja, who is out with a thigh injury.

Wales defender Neil Taylor will also be absent from the starting XI as he has dropped behind Scotland's Stephen Kingsley in the pecking order.
Guidolin has warned Taylor - who played every minute of Wales' Euro 2016 campaign - he has a battle to get his place back in the starting XI.
"Yes I have almost two teams, 25, 26, 27 players at the moment, but the most important thing is I have almost two teams," the Italian explained.
"For Stephen Kingsley and Neil Taylor for example, it will be a good fight and a good competition. I feel competition can improve the team.
"The season is long, we hope to do well in cup games and have the opportunity to see many players.
"I like to manage with a lot of players. Sometimes a good player could be on the bench or in the stands, but that is my job, to choose and to win, if that is possible."
