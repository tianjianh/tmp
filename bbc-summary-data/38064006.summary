Flood warnings follow heavy Borders and East Lothian rainfall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flood warnings have been put in place across the Scottish Borders and East Lothian following heavy overnight rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency alerts cover areas including Eddleston, Romannobridge, Peebles, Greenlaw and Haddington.
Water levels had been rising after "heavy and persistent rainfall" overnight.
Owners of cars in the Cuddyside area of Peebles were asked to move vehicles due to high river levels.
Travel has been disrupted in many parts of the Borders with standing water a problem on routes including the A72 near Peebles, A68 towards Edinburgh and the A1.
In total, five flood warnings were out in the Borders at one stage - two for the Eddleston Water from Shiplaw to Crossburn, through Eddleston and then down through Peebles itself.
One warning is for the Lyne Water from Romannobridge to Lyne Station, while another is for the River Blackadder from Greenlaw to Allanton in Berwickshire.
In East Lothian a warning covers a stretch of the River Tyne in Haddington.
Levels on the Jed Water from Camptown to Jedburgh were also causing concern but a warning has since been lifted.
There is also a lower level flood alert out for Borders rivers generally.
