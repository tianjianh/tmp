The man's green Thruxton bike was involved in a collision with a red Honda Civic on the A85 at Lix Toll at about 12:30 on Sunday.
The 53 year old was flown to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow by air ambulance, where he is in a serious condition.
The road between Crianlarich and Lochearnhead was closed for five hours.
The motorbike was travelling on the eastbound carriageway while the car was driving in the opposite direction.
The female driver of the car and her male passenger were not injured in the crash.
Sgt David Ross of the road policing unit in Stirling said: "Our inquiries into this incident are ongoing and as part of this effort we are appealing to members of the public - I would ask anyone who was travelling on the A85 and who saw these vehicles to please get in touch with police."
