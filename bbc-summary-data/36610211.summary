[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts have appealed for clearer communication from Uefa after suffering two Europa League fixture changes.

The first leg on 30 June against Estonian side Infonet was switched to Tynecastle hours after Monday's draw.
And, the following day, the second leg was moved forward 24 hours, which Hearts say inconvenienced their fans.
"The club has requested that the Scottish FA make representation to Uefa," the Scottish Premiership club said on their website.
Hearts want the SFA to recommend "that the communication process between participating clubs, their national associations and Uefa be reviewed and improved".
They say that fans "who had moved quickly to book flights and accommodation" had been adversely affected.
"Having been assured that all deliberations of the competitions committee had been concluded, and decisions taken were final, we released this information to our supporters," they said.
"No further communication was received from Uefa to the club prior to them issuing their finalised list of fixtures, which showed that a further change had in fact been made, moving our away leg from Thursday 7 to Wednesday 6.
"This change was made without any reference to either Hearts or, indeed, FC Infonet.
"In this instance, the club can only repeat its apologies for the inconvenience that these events have caused and trust that supporters will recognise that we did everything possible to provide timely and accurate information to our supporters, including sending representatives to Nyon."
