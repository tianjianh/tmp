[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is imperative that those involved in modern day slavery in Wales are caught and brought to justice.

That is the message from police and other experts gathering for a special event highlighting the issue on Friday.
Victims are due to share their experiences at the All Wales Anti-Slavery Conference in Llandudno.
Gwent Police officers who rescued a man who worked unpaid for 13 years on a Newport farm are also taking part.
Det Supt Mark Pierce from North Wales Police, who is the lead officer for the force on tackling slavery and human trafficking said: "It's imperative we identify and prosecute those responsible and make our communities safer.
"Human trafficking is serious and organised crime with those involved likely to be involved in the other serious crimes like drug production, kidnapping and the criminal use of firearms."
Among the guests also expected to address the event is the new UK independent slavery commissioner, Kevin Hyland.
North Wales Police are also launching a 'Say No to Slavery' campaign on its website on Friday.
