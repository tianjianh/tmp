The Swifts enjoyed their fair share of possession in the first half but the Crues had the better of the chances, with Coleman thwarting the champions on a number of occasions.
Gavin Whyte's shot was turned onto the post by the left foot of Coleman and the visiting stopper also produced a fine save from Paul Heatley's shot on the turn.
Diarmuid O'Carroll's overhead kick flew over the bar, while Owens's header clipped the outside of the post.
Robinson grabbed his second of the season by nodding in after Richard Clarke's corner was headed across goal.
Owens opened his account midway through the second half and the big forward added a second after turning past two defenders.
Snoddy played a neat one-two with Jordan Forsythe before slotting home across the keeper into the bottom corner.
The victory makes it three league wins in a row for the defending champions.
