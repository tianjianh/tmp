Five mature trees thought to be over 60 years old have been poisoned in Lancashire, the Woodland Trust said.

The beech trees were found with drill holes at their bases in a wood near Accrington known as Laund Clough.
The trust believes a weed killer, "likely to be glyphosate", was used. A spokesman said the trees would now have to be removed at a cost of Â£2,000.
A Tree Preservation Order is in place, meaning the incident is being treated as a criminal offence.
Lancashire Police have been informed of the incident which happened close to nearby housing.
Colin Riley, site manager, said: "During my fifteen years at the Woodland Trust, I have never seen damage on this scale.
"I cannot fathom why someone would wilfully destroy trees in this way - especially given their age and protected status."
He added: "Our native woods suffer enough from threats such as tree disease and a changing climate - without someone setting out to intentionally kill them."
Laund Clough is a popular local wood for nearby residents, mainly used by dogwalkers and children.
