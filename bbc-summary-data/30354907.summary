The Erddig Glow is a light display that illuminates the National Trust's 18th Century building and its walled garden.
With frozen gates and trees, coloured up-lighters, static projections and feature lighting, the event attracted hundreds of visitors for Friday's opening night.
It will take place every Friday and Saturday in December.
