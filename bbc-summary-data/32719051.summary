Umbrella body Ski-Scotland said The Lecht, Glenshee, Nevis Range, CairnGorm Mountain and Glencoe Mountain operated for a total of 463 days.
Last season the sites opened on 441 days.
The season involved 230,634 skier days. There were 235,303 in the 2013-2014 season.
A skier day means one person who skis or snowboards on one day. Many of the same people return to the slopes several times during the season.
Ski-Scotland said the latest season generated Â£23.2m for the Scottish economy.
Heather Negus, of Ski-Scotland, said: "In many ways, this season was very similar to last year's.
"We had excellent snow at most resorts and the five snowsports areas were able to operate for a total of 463 days, better than last season's 441."
