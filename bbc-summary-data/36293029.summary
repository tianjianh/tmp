An exhibition celebrating the salty tang of the six-week school summer holiday has seen the seaside recreated in a former steel mill.

Pete McKee, an artist from Sheffield, has created 6 Weeks To Eternity to evoke childhood memories of being on holiday.
The show is on display at Rotherham's Magna Science Adventure Centre until Sunday.
It features McKee's paintings and snaps and artefacts from contributors.
"The highlight of my holiday was getting a couple of quid off me mum and me dad at Cleethorpes and going into the arcades", he said.
For the exhibition, he has added deckchairs, 1970s car and a caravan.
Nicola Siddall said "Part of the six weeks holiday were spent on the east coast with aunties, uncles and cousins all going away for the same week and hiring caravans.
"Here's our version of The Von Trapp family dressed in curtains!"
Rob Naylor said: "Club trips were wonderful fun, they stopped the coaches at a cafe halfway there and handed each kid a fizzy orange and crisps (to give you something to be travel sick with on the last bit of the journey? Always worked for me!)
"When you arrived they gave each of us five bob to spend. In later years this rose to 10 bob, but it still didn't last long in the penny arcades."
Ms Siddall also has fond memories of going to the park during the holidays.
"We'd usually go with the neighbours and make a day of it. This would have been my first taste of the six weeks holiday as I'd only just started school in 1976 when this was taken", she added.
