Hull City have reappointed Tony Pennock as first-team coach.

Pennock, who had been managing Welsh Premier League side Aberystwyth Town, left the Tigers in January when Mike Phelan was sacked.
He will now assist new boss Leonid Slutsky after the Russian was appointed as Marco Silva's replacement.
Hull have also appointed former Wales U21 goalkeeper Pat Mountain as their goalkeeper coach. Mountain has spent the past nine years with Wolves.
"I'm delighted but a little bit shocked too. It's been a bit of a whirlwind few days but I couldn't be happier to be back," Pennock told the club website.
