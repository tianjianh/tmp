The 22-year-old moved to Rugby Park in September on a three-year deal after agreeing an early release from Hearts.
He played in 22 matches for Killie but only started three times after manager Lee Clark arrived in mid-February.
Capped six times for Scotland at under-21 level, McHattie has signed a 12-month deal at Stark's Park, joining boss Gary Locke once again.
Locke took McHattie to Kilmarnock, having coached the left-back during his time at Tynecastle.
"I know exactly what he's capable of and it's great we've been able to get him signed because I know he's decided to come to us despite considerable interest from other top clubs," Locke told the Rovers website.
