The British and Irish Lions have been boosted by the news that Johnny Sexton took a full part in squad training on Thursday and Sean O'Brien is on the verge of a return to full fitness.

Fly-half Sexton trained in Kildare after having a head injury assessment (HIA) following Leinster's Pro12 semi-final defeat by Scarlets.
Flanker O'Brien missed that match because of a "tightness in his calf".
O'Brien has done some running but has yet to return to full training.

The Leinster pair are training in Ireland along with the rest of Warren Gatland's squad before Monday's departure for the 10-game tour of New Zealand.
"Johnny has trained all week, he's absolutely fine," said Lions coach Andy Farrell.
"Sean is nearly there, he's progressed really well. He's back to a bit of straight-line running. They're just managing him making sure that we don't break him down too early."
