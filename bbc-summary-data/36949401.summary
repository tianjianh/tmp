Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves squeezed past League Two Crawley to reach round two of the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Championship side Wolves went in front through Joe Mason, who turned in a rebound after Jed Wallace hit the post.
But Enzio Boldewijn, who had earlier seen an effort blocked on the line by Conor Coady, headed the equaliser for visitors Crawley from a corner.
Coady touched in Jon Dadi Bodvarsson's knock-down to secure victory, while Crawley's Mark Connolly was sent off for a second bookable offence late on.
