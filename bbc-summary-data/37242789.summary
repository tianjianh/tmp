Child indecent images complaints treble in three years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of recorded crimes involving indecent images of children in Wales more than trebled in the last three years, new figures have shown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Figures obtained by children's charity the NSPCC showed 1,321 complaints recorded since 2013.
The total annual figure rose from 201 in 2013 to 629 in 2015.
Des Mannion, of NSPCC Cymru, said social media sites should make a "serious commitment" to tackling the issue.
The 629 recorded crimes - which included complaints for the three forces that provided comparable figures - were released after the charity submitted a Freedom of Information request to Wales' four forces.
This asked for the number of recorded complaints for the possession, distribution and production of indecent images of children for 2013, 2014 and 2015.
South Wales Police saw the highest number of recorded crimes with 480, followed by Dyfed-Powys Police with 412 and North Wales Police with 320.
Gwent Police only provided figures for 2015 - 109.
Across the UK, the total number of recorded crimes for the possession, distribution and production of indecent images of children rose from 4,530 in 2013 to 10,818 in 2015.
