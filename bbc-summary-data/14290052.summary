Peterborough ice cream man Wajid Hussain banned over chimes

An ice cream van owner has been banned from trading - because he played his chimes for too long.

Residents in Peterborough complained after hearing Wajid Hussain's van driving along to Teddy Bears' Picnic.
Officials say he was using the tune for longer than the four seconds he was allowed to play it.
The city council also refused his licence because of complaints relating to his parking and where he was operating.
Licensing regulatory officer Darren Dolby said it sent a strong message to other vendors to abide by trading laws.
The council received a total of 14 complaints about Mr Hussain, who trades as Adam Ices, over a three-month period.
These included parking his van dangerously, trading without consent in certain areas of Peterborough and playing his chimes for longer than allowed.
Only two of the complaints related to the van's chimes.
Members of the city council's licensing team gave evidence that Mr Hussain had been given a number of verbal and written warnings to comply - but this advice had been ignored.
Mr Dolby said: "We are pleased that the decision to revoke Hussain's licence was upheld by the committee."
A spokesman from the Ice Cream Alliance, the UK trade association for ice cream manufacturers and retailers, said: "The restrictions on chimes are part of a national code of practice which ice cream sellers have to adhere to.
"We have asked the government to relax these restrictions but until they do, all our members are advised to work within this code."
Mr Hussain told the BBC he did not wish to comment.
