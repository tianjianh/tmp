Druids Heath victims in 'fear' as police publish names

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Victims of two criminals are "living in fear" after their names were published on a police notice posted through people's doors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The leaflet listed people Benjamin Wilson and Jamie Wood had been ordered not to contact, including some they had targeted in Druids Heath, Birmingham.
But victims whose names appeared on the leaflet said they were not consulted by West Midlands Police beforehand.
The force said the notice had been distributed "proportionately".
Wilson and Wood each admitted four charges at Birmingham Crown Court on 12 March, including damaging property, having a bladed instrument, and putting a person in fear of violence by harassment.
Both were given a 13-month sentence suspended for 18 months, told to complete 100 hours unpaid work and also subjected to a criminal behaviour order.
Under the terms, they have to stay out of certain areas and are forbidden from contacting several people.
The poster advising people of the order was posted through doors in Druids Heath, but some of those named said they were not consulted about being included.
One, who claimed the two men have previously terrorised and threatened people, said they had only found out they appeared on the notice after a friend sent them a text.
"I am very disturbed. I thought we were protected. These leaflets have been put through doors," they said.
"No wonder people don't come forward when they see crimes.
"I have been named and shamed and I have done nothing wrong."
A friend of one person named on the notice said: "These two...are dangerous individuals and they target a family in the area."
Supt Peter Henrick, from Birmingham South Police, said 30 leaflets were distributed "to help enforce the conditions of the order".
Since it was imposed, he said, Wilson and Wood have complied with all the terms.
"We have spoken to almost all of the individuals who the pair must not contact to inform them of the order and what to do should the pair try and contact them."
