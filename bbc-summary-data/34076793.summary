[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia secured a 23-run (D/L) win over Ireland in a rain-interrupted one-day international in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An opening stand of 139 between David Warner (84) and Joe Burns (69) gave the Aussies, fresh from their Ashes defeat, the foundation for a big score.
However, the tourists were reduced to 222-6 when they closed their innings following a rain delay.
Ireland were set a target of 181 from 24 overs and were skittled out after Ed Joyce and Niall O'Brien put on 86.
Steve Smith started life as Michael Clarke's successor by opting to bat first at Stormont following a lengthy delay.
Man-of-the-match Warner and debutant Burns scored at 6.36 runs an over in a dominant onslaught before Craig Young dismissed the latter.
Australia never quite enjoyed the same comfort thereafter, Tim Murtagh nipping out Warner and George Bailey, with Andy McBrine adding Glenn Maxwell as the momentum slipped.
Shane Watson, not seen since the first Ashes Test, finished 26 not out from 25 balls.
Ireland, initially chasing 195 in 27 overs, lost openers Paul Stirling and William Porterfield inside two overs before a gutsy third-wicket fightback.
Veterans Ed Joyce (44) and Niall O'Brien (45) put on 86 in just 12.4 overs, but neither man could go on.
Maxwell's off-spin was expensive but accounted for both top-scorers.
Only Stuart Thompson backed the pair up with a score above 20 as Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins each took two wickets.
Nathan Coulter-Nile finished with three wickets as he returned at the death to end things early by taking the last two scalps
