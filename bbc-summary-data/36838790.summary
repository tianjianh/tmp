[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland jockey run over by an ambulance following a race in Italy is hoping to return to competitive action within the next two months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Meehan's leg was run over by the on-course ambulance at Merano after he was knocked unconscious in a fall.
The county Down man suffered a broken leg and needed 27 stitches in a facial gash but is now recovering "well".
"It will be another six weeks, I'd say, and probably two months until I'm race-riding again," said Meehan, 22.
"I had the operation and it's just a case of recovery now."
Meehan - whose father has worked in the ambulance service in Northern Ireland for 30 years - returned to his homeland for surgery on his broken leg and facial injuries and is now continuing his recovery at home.
The Crossgar man was put in the recovery position after his fall but then suffered his broken leg when the ambulance reversed over his outstretched leg and came to rest while still on top of him.
Meehan, who had been based with Jonathan Geake in Wiltshire, appears unlikely to return to Italy this autumn.
He is hoping to make the most of his British-based contacts when he does come back.
He said: "The season in Merano ends in October, so whether I would be able to get back in time I'm not sure."
