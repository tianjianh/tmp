The 37-year-old has scored 12 goals in what has been a disappointing campaign for the Ibrox side.
In his third spell at Rangers, Miller has done enough to convince manager Pedro Caixinha he is worth a new deal.
"I was delighted when he (Caixinha) let me know that he sees me as part of his squad next year and what his plans were," Miller told the Rangers website.
"With the new manager coming in over the past two months it was important that he settled into the club, assessed his squad and fortunately enough he has made the right decision.
"When a new manager comes in everybody's future is started to be thrown into doubt a wee bit, whether they have contracts or not.
"He let me know a few weeks back his thoughts and what he'd seen and then it was just a case of getting things tied up with Stewart Robertson and Andrew Dickson.
"I was always confident that the manager would see the work that I have been doing every day in training, the commitment to the cause and since he's come in I think I've maintained a decent level of performance and consistency. I was always hopeful I would stay on.
"I am over the moon to get it signed and I'm looking forward to the last few games of the season and then building towards a better, more competitive year next season."
Miller joined Rangers from Hibernian in 2000 but left the club the following year for Wolves. Following spells at Celtic and Derby County he rejoined Rangers in 2008, leaving again in 2011 before returning in 2014.
The striker has hit 42 goals in 126 appearances in his third spell, but boss Caixinha says Miller brings much more than goals.
"It is fantastic for everyone at the club that Kenny has agreed to stay with us for another year," the manager told Rangers' website.
"I have been greatly impressed by his professionalism and leadership both on and off the field since I arrived here, and I believe his performances demonstrate he still has so much to offer us."
