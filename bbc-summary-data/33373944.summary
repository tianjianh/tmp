[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three health boards overspent by a total of £50m last year, despite the Welsh government giving the NHS an additional £240m to deal with extra pressures.

Besti Cadwaladr, Hywel Dda and Cardiff and Vale boards did not manage within their allocated budgets for 2014/15.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford told AMs on Thursday they needed extra money to pay for some services and salaries.
All three must now draw up plans to recover the money.
Mr Drakeford said recovery of the money must be achieved in a way "which will not prejudice the continued provision of safe, sustainable and quality healthcare".
The remaining health boards - Powys, Aneurin Bevan, Cwm Taf and Abertawe - operated within their budgets for the financial year.
