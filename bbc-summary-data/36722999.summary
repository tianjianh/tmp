Oldham Athletic: Motherwell and NI assistant Stephen Robinson set for Latics job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motherwell and Northern Ireland assistant manager Stephen Robinson is set to be appointed as the new Oldham Athletic boss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Latics have been looking for a new manager since the departure of John Sheridan, who left to take over at Notts County.
If Oldham do appoint Robinson, the 41-year-old is likely to end his Northern Ireland role.
Robinson is being tipped to name Ian Baraclough as his assistant.
The duo worked together when Baraclough was manager of Motherwell between December 2014 and September 2015.
Former Northern Ireland international Colin Murdock is believed to have been instrumental in sealing Robinson's move to the League One club.
Robinson's work within the Northern Ireland international youth structure has included a stint as Under-21 manager.
Last week, Oldham added former Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest manager Sean O'Driscoll to the coaching staff and gave him a role in helping the board appoint a new manager.
The club said last week that Peter Shirtliff would be remaining on the coaching staff but it was announced on Wednesday that the former Sheffield Wednesday player had left the role "for personal reasons".
Steve Evans, most recently of Leeds United, rejected the offer to manage Oldham despite agreeing personal terms.
