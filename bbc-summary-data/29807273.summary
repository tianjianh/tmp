Ebola diary: How do you tell a child they can't touch mum?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's Holly Taylor's third day in Sierra Leone where Ebola has killed more than 1,200 people and left thousands of families in crisis.

The 26-year-old is there as part of her work with Oxfam, to tell the stories of the people living with the disease.
But it's hard not to think of her home in Oxford when she hears what people are facing.
Holly's been talking to Mary, a community health worker.
"Mary told me about her friend who lost 10 family members from the same house - how sad she felt, and that she was praying to the Lord to take Ebola away from the world.
"I can't even imagine losing 10 of my own family. That's too much grief to even think about."
"I spoke to my mum today about coming home, she said that her and dad had joked that I can't come to visit them for 21 days.
"And my boyfriend's dad told me that he hadn't told anyone at work where I was because they would worry he would get infected.
"Whilst it's all jokes, I had a small glimpse of what it must be like to be a family member of someone who has died or a survivor - no-one trusting you or wanting to be near you.
"It must be awful for a woman losing her husband to Ebola, having no source of income, being ostracised by the community all at once.
"Normally when someone dies you have loads of support. But people who've had someone in their family die from Ebola don't have that."
Holly's in the Tengeh town area of the capital, Freetown, where she's been spending time with the local community health workers who've been trained by Oxfam.
One of them, Priscilla, works at a hospital where there have been Ebola cases.
"She's worried about coming home. Her child and nieces are so happy to see her that they run and hug her.
"She's worried that if she gets ill she will infect them, because how do you tell a child that they can't touch their mother?
"Imagine the burden of knowing that you are putting your children's lives in danger, but if you don't work you won't have food on the table."
"I just have so much respect for the community workers. They're putting themselves at further risk.
"When I asked them why they were doing it they just said 'I love my community."
As night falls in Freetown, the streets are eerily quiet.
"Freetown is normally a rowdy city and lots of fun, but all of the bars and pubs are closed. It's a sleepy city now."
