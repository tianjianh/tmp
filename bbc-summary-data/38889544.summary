[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 2-1 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton Town made it three home wins on the spin as they beat struggling Swindon Town 2-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A second-half own goal from Lloyd Jones gifted Cobblers the lead, while Luke Norris headed a late equaliser only for John-Joe O'Toole to grab the winner moments later.
The hosts were quickly out of the blocks, Marc Richards fired wide and Keshi Anderson's effort was kept out by Lawrence Vigouroux.
The Cobblers should have broken the deadlock from a seventh-minute penalty when Fankaty Dabo fouled Anderson. But Richards missed a spot-kick for the second time in three games as Vigouroux saved his effort.
The home side continued to create chances, Michael Smith headed off target and also shot wide while Richards saw his near-post header saved by Vigouroux. In between, Charlie Colkett forced Cobblers keeper Adam Smith into action.
Smith was denied by Vigouroux before Dion Conroy squandered Swindon's best chance when he shot over the crossbar.
After the restart, Swindon came into the game more. Ben Gladwin shot wide and Raphael Rossi Branco's header was saved by Smith.
But Cobblers finally broke the deadlock in the 64th minute when Jones could only help the ball into his own net after Smith flicked on Neal Eardley's cross.
Cobblers almost doubled their advantage when Anderson hit the post from the edge of the box. Hiram Boateng was thwarted by Vigouroux as Cobblers looked for the vital second goal.
Swindon mounted some late pressure and equalised in the 81st minute when James Brophy raced down the flank and his cross was headed home by Norris from close range.
But O'Toole won it just a minute later when he turned Matt Taylor's inswinging corner in at the near post, while Richards was twice denied by Vigouroux in the closing stages.
