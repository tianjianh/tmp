Mike Flynn believes keeping Newport County in the Football League would strengthen the club's case amidst fears over their future at Rodney Parade.

The Welsh Rugby Union want to take over Newport Gwent Dragons and the ground. They have said they will "call the shots" over tenants County.
"Let's start by keeping them in the Football League then worry about what pitch we play at," said manager Flynn.
County are six points adrift in League Two and face Crawley on Saturday.
The club signed a 10 year lease to play at Rodney Parade in 2013.
Flynn says the continuing speculation over the ground has not affected the players.
"They are a good bunch of lads, they have just been getting on with their jobs, since I have been here. They just get on with things," added Flynn.
"None of us really know. I don't think they (the WRU) have spoken to the board or anybody. That needs to come first because at the end or the day I still think we have a long lease.
"That is something I will let the board, directors and chairman worry about.
"I don't need any added motivation, keeping Newport County in the Football League is the only motivation I need."
The WRU, Newport RFC and Dragons boards have ratified the deal, but it requires 75% support of Newport rugby club's shareholders for the agreement to go ahead.
The WRU want to take control of the region and the ground on July 1.
Their plan is to lay an artificial 4G pitch to cure water logging problems, but artificial pitches are not allowed in the Football League.
