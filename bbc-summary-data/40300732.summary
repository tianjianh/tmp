[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mountain rescue volunteer from Caernarfon has been recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours list.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harvey Lloyd was conferred a British Empire Medal for services to mountain rescue, mountaineering and heritage in Wales.
He was a member of Llanberis Mountain Rescue team in the 1970s until the 1990s, rescuing walkers off Snowdon.
Meanwhile Clara Jones, from Llangefni, Anglesey, 74, was appointed an MBE for services to the Women's Institute.
Commenting on the honour, Llanberis Mountain Rescue team secretary Phil Benbow said Mr Lloyd had helped make the team a success.
At the time of his involvement, the volunteers rescued about 50 people a year from the areas around Snowdonia National Park.
Last year it attended 270 incidents, which Mr Benbow said was down to the increasing popularity of Snowdon as a visitor and hiking attraction.
He said: "Harvey was a well respected and highly regarded member of the team when he was living in the area, and contributed to the great success of the team."
