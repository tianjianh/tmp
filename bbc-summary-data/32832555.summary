Police identified Andre Marshall, 29, as the man found dead in Urmston, Greater Manchester on Wednesday.
Marshall, was jailed in 2008 for assault and possession of a firearm, following an attack at a gym in 2007.
He was a member of the Gooch Gang from Manchester's Moss Side, that was involved in clashes with rival gangs in the 1990s.
A post-mortem examination revealed Marshall he died of gunshot wounds, said a police spokeswoman.
He was found fatally injured next to a car on Manor Park, at about 07:30 BST on Wednesday.
Ch Supt Mary Doyle, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "We do not believe this was a random attack and we are still working to establish a motive which, as of yet, is not known."
In the mid 1990s, Manchester had been dubbed "Gunchester" by the media with gangs' names related to the streets in their patch; Gooch Close, Doddington and Pepperhill among others.
