Paul Lambert is keen to make a quick return to football after announcing he will leave Blackburn in the summer.

The 46-year-old Scot is unsurprised at being linked with former club Celtic as he mulls over his future.
Celtic will have a vacancy when Ronny Deila leaves at the end of the season while Lambert will depart Ewood Park after they play Reading on 7 May.
"You'll probably get all that [speculation] with Celtic," Lambert told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"The only connection I've got with Celtic is I played eight great years there. Fantastic club; great club," the former Scotland midfielder added.
"You like to think you've done your little bit to give them a hand in that time. Some great moments up there.
"As of this minute, I'm back to square one where I was when I left Aston Villa [in February 2015]."
Former Colchester United boss Lambert joined Blackburn in November.
Rovers currently sit 18th in the Championship, with Lambert winning 10 of his 31 games in charge so far.
He started his managerial career at Livingston in 2005 and joined Wycombe Wanderers the following year, helping them reach the 2007 League Cup semi-finals and the 2008 League Two play-offs.
He also won successive promotions with Norwich City, taking them from League One to the Premier League before joining Villa in 2012.
"I'll go and start to get on my cycling bike again for another few miles and see what happens," added former Scotland midfielder Lambert.
"Listen, I want to get back into football. That's normal. I think things here just weren't quite right."
