It comes after police revealed that four men have killed themselves in the UK in the last year after becoming victims of "sextortion".
Last month, the PSNI said that 100 webcam blackmails had been reported to them so far in 2016.
NI man Jimmy, in his 20s, exchanged photos, including sexual images, with a woman he met through a dating app.
"Literally 10 minutes after I'd sent her my profile I got a message saying 'what would you do if I sent these photos to your friends and family?'" he said.
Jimmy said the woman then told him to subscribe to live webcam websites and then demanded money by wire transfer, messaging him "every few minutes to check where I was".
"She started sending me photos of my family from my social media contacts, saying she would send the pictures to them.
"It was really stressful and I didn't know what to do. I caved in and sent her Â£150. She said she wanted Â£300 but I said no, deactivated my social media account and went to the police.
"I was so worried about what my friends and family would think. I've spoken to my mum about it, that was tough enough, but I still can't talk to anyone else."
In June 2015, Ronan Hughes, a 17-year-old from Coalisland, took his own life having been the victim of webcam blackmail.
Last month, a 31-year-old man appeared at Bucharest municipal court in Romania, charged with producing and distributing indecent images of children as well as blackmail as part of the investigation into Ronan's death.
PSNI Det Ch Insp James Mullen said everyone needed to be aware of the risks involved online, especially on social media.
"Webcam blackmail usually involves people being lured into taking off some or all of their clothes in front of their webcam, only to be told that you have been recorded and that the video will be posted online and/or shown to the victim's contacts unless a fee is paid - usually a substantial sum of money," he said.
"Sometimes, the victim is also enticed into performing intimate acts.
"Police are committed to fully investigating this type of crime when it is reported to us, however, we want to do all we can to raise awareness so this doesn't happen at all."
