Councillors backed plans for the Â£43m development after a controversial proposal for a casino was shelved.
About 200 jobs are set to be created as part of the project at Bournemouth Pavilion Gardens, in Westover Road.
The new building will also feature rooftop gardens with sea views, subject to planning permission.
The pavilion currently houses a dance centre, ballroom and theatre and culture chiefs are also looking at proposals to create a drama centre for the Arts University College within another vacant part of the building.
Councillor Ian Lancashire, from Bournemouth Borough Council, said he hoped the development would "kick-start" further investment.
"We welcome the decision not to include a casino within this project - the new plans fit much more closely with our aspirations of providing family-friendly attractions and will generate higher footfall in this part of town.
"Making better use of town centre land will be a major driver in improving our economy and profits from this landmark scheme will move forward restoration of our historic pavilion."
It is expected that the two Odeon cinemas already operating close to the site will relocate into the building, opening up further redevelopment in the town.
Developer Trevor Osborne said: "The cinemas in Westover Road are keen to relocate to our new development and we hope to continue our commitment to the town by regenerating the buildings they leave behind."
The proposed cinema development remains subject to planning approval and funding.
