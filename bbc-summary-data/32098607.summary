Yemen crisis: Houthi rebels are Iran stooges, says Hadi

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yemen President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi has accused Iran of destabilising the country, calling Houthi rebels the "stooges of Iran".

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia says military intervention in Yemen will continue until the country is "stable and safe".
The move comes after a third night of airstrikes by a Saudi-led coalition hit cities across the country.
The conflict has been described by correspondents as a proxy war between Sunni Arab nations and Shia Iran.
President Hadi was speaking at an Arab League summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, days after having to flee Yemen as rebels advanced on his stronghold of Aden.
He plans to stay abroad until the situation settles, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riad Yassin said.
The Saudi-led Operation Decisive Storm has the support of several Arab League members. It was sparked by Wednesday's rebel advance towards Aden - a push that air strikes have failed to stop.

Iran is the spectre hanging over this gathering of Arab leaders. When a coalition of Sunni-led states began bombing Houthi rebels in Yemen three days ago, this was a shot across the bow for Shia Iran.
The intervention is an attempt to curb Iran's growing influence in the Arab world, as well as to save the presidency of Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Both will be difficult tasks.
While other leaders at the summit made veiled references to Tehran, President Hadi - who just days ago was in hiding - was blunt. He described the Shia Houthi rebels who are trying to topple him as "Iranian stooges".
Yemen is now the backdrop for a larger conflict which already looks like a proxy war between Sunni states - especially regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia - and Iran. What's unclear is how far Arab leaders are prepared to take this conflict, or how much it may escalate.
Whilst leaders spoke at the summit, huge explosions rocked Aden as war planes struck an arms depot.
The UN is pulling its staff out of the capital Sanaa, hours after the Saudi navy evacuated dozens of its own and foreign diplomats from the country.
The fighting risks "disastrous consequences" for the Yemeni people, the UN warned - it is already the poorest country in the Middle East, with over 60% of the population requiring aid.
With no sign of an end to the current military campaign, the Yemeni president said that military intervention must continue until the Houthi rebels surrendered.
At the summit, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for the creation of a joint Arab military force to deal with "unprecedented threats" in the region.
Egypt has already pledged planes, warships and troops to the coalition. President Sisi referred to "foreign interference" in Yemen - a coded reference to Iran, according to analysts.
On Friday night, Mr Yassin said there was an "arrangement" for ground troops of the Saudi-led coalition to deploy in Yemen.
Iran is alleged to be supporting the Houthis. The rebels officially deny this, but senior figures have been seen in the Iranian city of Qom and there are unconfirmed reports of Iranian pilots flying Yemeni planes, reports the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner.
Speaking after President Hadi, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for negotiations to avoid "a long, drawn-out conflict".
The Houthis have said their aim is to replace Mr Hadi's government, which they accuse of being corrupt.
Rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi has vowed not to surrender to what he called the "unjustified aggression".
Iran has also criticised the Saudi intervention. "They have to stop," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Friday.
Since the air campaign began, at least 39 civilians - including six children under the age of 10 - have been killed, Yemen health ministry officials say.
