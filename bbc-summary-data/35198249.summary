The Chiefs are second in the Premiership, having not lost since the opening day of the season, and are still in with a chance of qualifying from their European Champions Cup pool.
"The more positive aspect is there's definitely room for improvement," hooker Yeandle told BBC Radio Devon.
"We've finished Christmas in the top two and going into the new year it brings a whole new challenge."
Exeter only missed out on last season's Premiership play-offs on points difference, after finishing level with fourth-placed Saracens, who went on to win the title.
The Chiefs are now in their sixth season in English rugby's top flight and are in their best-ever position at Christmas, with Rob Baxter's side having a four-point buffer over third-placed Leicester and 12 points over fifth-placed Northampton.
"The way we're progressing, there's nothing we can't achieve. Even in my time here, I'm in my fourth season, the maturity and the development we've shown is beyond belief," said 26-year-old Yeandle.
"We've gone from just establishing ourselves in the Premiership to becoming a noticeable force and teams are starting to do a lot more homework and a lot more studying and analysing of working out how to play us.
"That shows the development we've had not only as players, but also the way we've been coached as well and the recruitment we've had.
"Players are coming to the Chiefs because they want to be here as they can see where the club's going and how far we've come from."
