Head coach Eddie Jones wants the Northampton hooker to replace Chris Robshaw for the Six Nations campaign.
Hartley, 29, has recently been sidelined with concussion and a rib injury, but will feature for Northampton against Scarlets in the European Champions Cup on Saturday.
The England squad will gather for the first time under Jones at a training camp after this weekend's games.
Harlequins flanker Robshaw has been captain for the past four years, but came in for heavy criticism during England's poor World Cup campaign.
Meanwhile, Jones has confirmed that World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson and ex-Australia flanker George Smith will carry out "informal" coaching roles with England during the Six Nations.
"They will come in and help the players at various times," he said.
"George will definitely come in next Wednesday to help the back rowers. But it's very informal. He's not a coach as such, he's doing it out of friendship.
"He's one of the best defence breakdown forwards in the world. He will help our aspiring number sevens."
