Ken Clarke false sex abuse claims trial: Roger Cook 'had never heard of' accused

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
TV presenter Roger Cook told a court he had "never heard" of an ex-child actor who claims he was molested by former chancellor Kenneth Clarke while working on his show The Cook Report.

Ben Fellows, 40, told reporters the Conservative MP for Rushcliffe, Nottinghamshire, assaulted him in 1994.
At the Old Bailey he denies perverting the course of justice by making false claims about the MP.
But Mr Cook said he did not believe Mr Fellows had worked on the show.
Mr Fellows, from Redstone Farm Road, Olton, Solihull, claimed the politician plied him with alcohol and carried out a sexual assault while he was working as an undercover actor for The Cook Report, on ITV.
He said a number of people who had also worked on the show at the time were aware of the assault.
In 2012, he told national news reporters about the alleged assault and stories were published in print and online.
Mr Cook, who presented the investigative programme and had some editorial control, was asked what, if any, dealings he had with the defendant.
He replied: "None whatsoever. I had never heard of him."
He said he would have known if Mr Fellows worked on the show.
Jurors were told Mr Cook only became aware of the allegations against Mr Clarke after the show was cancelled.
Mr Cook said: "It would have been an enormous story if that allegation was made."
The court has heard how police interviewed members of The Cook Report team who all said they were unaware of the allegation.
When officers checked out Mr Fellows' version of events, they concluded they were false and began treating him as a suspect rather than a victim, the court heard.
After Mr Fellows was arrested, he said The Cook Report staff were too afraid of losing their jobs or "falling foul of the establishment" to corroborate them.
The case continues.
