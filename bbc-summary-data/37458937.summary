[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Wilder's Blades could have grabbed an early advantage as they bossed possession and opportunities, Paul Coutts going closest with a deflected effort which spun just wide of the post.
But it was Fleetwood who took the lead against the run of play.
Chris Long, returning from injury, stole in from the left, taking advantage of some slack defending and his effort from a tight angle deflected into the path of David Ball, who stroked home from close range for his fifth goal of the season.
Billy Sharp could easily have levelled shortly after but his 18-yard drive was tipped over by Chris Neal.
But Fleetwood came more into the game as the half went on, Ball coming close to doubling his tally, denied by Simon Moore after a fine through ball from Kyle Dempsey.
The end-to-end action continued after the break, Ball once again involved as Fleetwood looked to stretch their lead, with Long denied by Moore.
Sharp then raced in behind the hosts but Neal's flailing legs denied John Fleck from inside the six-yard box.
The Blades looked like drawing level but Fleetwood and former Blades man Martyn Woolford almost set up a second when he raced down the right and crossed for Ash Hunter, whose flicked header forced a fingertip save from Moore.
When all seemed lost for the visitors Chris Hussey was allowed space on the left and Ebanks-Landell rose through a crowd at the back post to power home.
