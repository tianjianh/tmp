Salford Red Devils forward Gareth Hock has withdrawn his transfer request and committed his future to the club.

Hock, 31, asked to leave the Red Devils at the start of September, a request approved by chairman Marwan Koukash.
The former Wigan and Widnes player has just finished the first season of a four-year contract.
"I realise I upset a fair few people and I can only apologise to them, and say that I firmly intend to make things right next season," Hock said.
"When I signed a long-term deal at the start of 2014 it was never my intention to be seeking a move within 12 months."
Hock was close to a move to Australian National Rugby League side Parramatta Eels before opting to join Salford just over a year ago.
He scored on his Super League debut for the club against Wakefield, the first of six tries from 15 appearances during the campaign, but the Red Devils finished 10th, despite owner MKoukash's large investment in the squad.
Hock's career has been littered with controversy; he was handed a five-game ban for grabbing a referee in 2008, suspended the following year for testing positive for cocaine, given a seven-match ban for making contact with a referee and removed from England's World Cup squad following a breach of discipline last year.
"I had been through what was a frustrating time for me personally," Hock told the Salford website. "When I experienced my recent suspension from the game, I began to feel that I needed a change of environment.
"I did have offers to play elsewhere in Super League, and in rugby union, but I now appreciate what a truly good club the Red Devils are and I'm sure we are going to have a big year next year."
