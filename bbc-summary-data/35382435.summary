The 30-year-old Czech signed a one-year deal last summer following his release from Hibernian.
He has played 19 games this season, having missed six weeks after sustaining an ankle injury in October.
Earlier this week, Kris Doolan, 29, signed a new deal, keeping the striker at Thistle until the end of the 2018-19 campaign.
Doolan, who joined the Glasgow club in 2009 from junior club Auchinleck Talbot, has scored seven goals in 21 appearances this season and was delighted to extend his stay.
"It shows the ambition of the club as well that they are willing to give out such a long contract and it also shows my loyalty to the club," he said.
"I've been breaking a lot of records goalscoring-wise. Every time I score, I seem to catch someone on the all-time list.
"I'm closing in on 100 goals for the club and I'd like to break that barrier as quickly as I can.
"I'm closing on the top 10 of all time as well so that's something I have my eye on as well."
However, midfielder Ryan Stevenson left Thistle this week, with the club announcing that the 31-year-old had gone "by mutual consent" after a spell on loan to Ayr United.
Stevenson, previously of St Johnstone and Ipswich Town, joined the Glasgow club from Hearts in 2012 but played his last game for Thistle in November.
