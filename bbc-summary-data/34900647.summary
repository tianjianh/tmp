Earlier, two Palestinian girls stabbed and wounded an elderly Palestinian man in Jerusalem, apparently mistaking him for an Israeli, Israeli police said. One of the girls was shot dead.
A Palestinian assailant was also killed in an attempted stabbing in the northern West Bank, the military said.
They were the latest in a recent wave of stabbing attacks targeting Israelis.
A surge in violence over the past two months has left 18 Israelis and dozens of Palestinians dead.
Many of the Palestinian fatalities have been attackers, shot by their victims or security forces. Other Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank or in cross-border violence in Gaza.
Monday's deadly stabbing took place at a petrol station on one of the main roads between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, which cuts through the West Bank, the Israeli military said.
The Israeli soldier, 18-year-old Pte Ziv Mizrahi, died at the scene.
The Palestinian attacker also stabbed and wounded another soldier before he was shot dead, according to the military.
It came hours after two Palestinian girls, aged 14 and 16, used scissors to attack a 70-year-old Palestinian man outside Mahane Yehuda market in central Jerusalem.
CCTV footage showed one of the suspected attackers lunging at a man before being shot by police. The other suspect was also shot. The older girl died.
An Israeli man was reportedly also wounded by bullet shrapnel.
In another incident, a Palestinian was shot dead when he tried to stab Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint near Nablus in the northern West Bank, the military said.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government would revoke the work permits of the families of Palestinian attackers, the Jerusalem Post newspaper reported.
Mr Netanyahu also said security checks on Palestinian vehicles would be stepped up across the West Bank.
The surge in violence began in September when tensions at a flashpoint holy site in Jerusalem revered by Jews and Muslims boiled over, amid rumours that Israel planned to relax long-standing rules to strengthen Jewish rights at the complex. Israel has repeatedly denied such claims.
