The Cavan woman ended the tournament on two under while fellow Irish competitor Stephanie Meadow was two over.
Meadow, from Jordanstown, fired a 72 and she finished in joint 31st.
South Korea's Inbee Park won the gold medal on 16 under, five clear of world number one Lydia Ko of New Zealand while China's Shanshan Feng won bronze.
Great Britain's Charley Hull shot a 68 to finish tied for seventh on eight under as women's golf returned to the Games for the first time since 1900.
Maguire finished top amateur at the recent British Open when she shared 25th place.
Meadow, 24, came third in the US Women's Open in her first season as a professional in 2014 but has struggled over the last 18 months.
The death of her father from cancer last year was a devastating blow for the Ulsterwoman and she has dropped to 473rd in the world rankings.
Meadow was a late inclusion in the Olympic field after the Dutch pair Anne Van Dam and Christel Boeljon were withdrawn from the 60-strong field for not meeting their country's qualifying criteria of being in the world's top 100.
