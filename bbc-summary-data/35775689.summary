The trio were all part of the Great Britain squad that won the Davis Cup in 2015 - their first title in 79 years - and are the first names to be confirmed for the event which starts on 18 June.
"We will have a strong contingent of highly-ranked international players," said tournament director Paul Hutchins.
"That's made even better by welcoming a number of the British Davis Cup team."
Edmund, 21, is the British number three and world number 82, while 25-year-old Evans - the British number four - played in the team that started their Davis Cup defence against Japan last weekend.
British number five Ward, 29, played a key role in the Davis Cup victory, coming back from two sets down to beat John Isner as GB beat the United States in a thrilling first-round tie.
Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin beat American Sam Querrey in straight sets to win last year's Nottingham final.
