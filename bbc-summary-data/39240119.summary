[SN]TITLE[SN]
Everton v Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton left-back Leighton Baines should be fit after recovering from the back problem he suffered last weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Muhamed Besic lacks fitness after a lengthy lay-off and James McCarthy, who has a hamstring injury, is also out.
Hull are without Everton loanee Oumar Niasse, who is ineligible against his parent club, while Evandro is again absent with a calf problem.
Markus Henriksen is back in training after a shoulder injury but is unlikely to feature on Saturday.
Michael Dawson, Dieumerci Mbokani and Ryan Mason remain sidelined.
Steve Wilson: "Romelu Lukaku is poised to become the first Evertonian to hit 20 league goals in a season since Gary Lineker - unfortunately he may also be poised for a Goodison exit.
"The richest contract the club has ever offered has been rejected, and a stand-off between the club's hierarchy and the player's representatives seems certain to ensue.
"If Lukaku does leave - and that is by no means certain - Everton might even reconsider their stance on Oumar Niasse.
"Expensively recruited by Roberto Martinez - and quickly consigned to the margins - the Senegalese forward has scored four goals in 10 games on loan at Hull.
"Unfortunately for the Tigers - and probably much to Everton's relief - Niasse is ineligible to play against his parent club."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman on the future of Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley: "If Everton is not a club with a lot of ambition I would not be manager.
"But I am not so afraid about his [Lukaku's] situation because the player has more than two years on his contract. Everyone knows what can happen in football but you need to respect your contract.
"Ross [Barkley] is a boy from Everton and what we need to show for him is the best reasons to stay, and of course his situation is different because his [contract] is running out next season.
"Football is a business and you make decisions at the end of the season. He needs to sign a new contract, if not you need to sell the player. It is not an ultimatum but that is normal - that is business."
Hull City head coach Marco Silva: "Of course we do need to improve our performance away. In some [away] games we have improved, we've shown progress, but the results achieved are not the best.
"Only against Man United [a 0-0 draw] we had a very good result, but the others no, and our last performance away against Leicester was not the best, that's clear.
"We need to improve this situation and we've worked this week in a bid to take points."
Everton's build-up to this game has been overshadowed by the news that leading scorer Romelu Lukaku has turned down a new contract.
I don't see the Lukaku situation affecting the outcome of this game, though, or his performance.
