[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh ran in nine tries to move top of European Rugby Challenge Cup Pool 5 with victory over Timisoara Saracens in Romania.

Early tries by Michael Allen and Viliame Mata, three from Stuart McInally and two from Nasi Manu put Edinburgh in firm control.
Stephen Shennan got Timisoara's first score in the first half.
Mata's second-half try and Manu's third of the game continued the rout before Shennan replied with his second.
Acting head coach Duncan Hodge's side join Harlequins on five points, with the top two meeting at Murrayfield next Saturday.
Stade Francais and Timisoara Saracens prop up the group and meet in Paris on Thursday.
Hooker McInally set up wing Allen to cross within the opening minute and fly-half Jason Tovey converted.
And debutant Mata, who won an Olympic gold medal with Fiji sevens in the summer, soon crossed and Tovey's kick took the visitors to 14 points.
Driven mauls led to captain McInally's initial brace, Tovey unsuccessful with the first conversion but knocking over the second.
Scrum-half Valentin Calafetnanu's penalty at 14-0 down and wing Shennan's try after McInally's first had given the Romanians some reward for their first-half endeavours.
But the visitors finished the half strongly with McInally going over to complete his hat-trick, Tovey missing the conversion.
Flanker Mata offloaded for Manu's first try and the number eight went over again soon after, Tovey adding the extras on both occasions.
Edinburgh were not done there as Mata crossed again early in the second half and Manu's tap and break extended the hosts' misery, Tovey converting both.
Shennan went over for the hosts and Calafetnanu maintained his record with the boot.
