Prop Murray McCallum ploughed through from close range on 17 minutes but Italy hit back to lead 7-5 at the half-time interval.
Winger Robbie Nairn galloped 60 metres to touch down, with full-back Blair Kinghorn and back-row Ally Miller making sure of a bonus point.
Giovanni Licata, Daniele Rimpelli and Pierre Bruno were Italy's try-scorers.
Fly-half Adam Hastings knocked over two conversions and a penalty as Scotland moved into second place in Pool B behind England.
However, they are unlikely to progress to the semi-finals as the best runner-up from the three sections and are facing the play-offs for places five to eight.
It is the first time the Scots have won two group games at the tournament after opening with a win over Australia and suffering a heavy loss to England.
