Mike Samwell, 35, was fatally injured as he confronted thieves outside his home in Greater Manchester.
Shouting was heard at about 03:00 BST on Sunday before Mr Samwell was found in a parking area at the rear of the house, in Chorlton-cum-Hardy.
A man, 21, is being held on suspicion of murder and is due to be questioned, Greater Manchester Police said.
Det Supt Jon Chadwick said the force was continuing to appeal for witnesses following Mr Samwell's "senseless murder".
"My thoughts continue to be with Mike's family and friends at this devastating time," he said.
Mr Chadwick said the killing had "crossed the line" and appealed to anyone with information to "search their consciences".
He appealed to the criminal fraternity "to help us out", describing the murder as "more than criminal".
Mr Samwell was asleep with his wife Jessica in their Cranbourne Road home when the intruders struck.
The former submarine officer went downstairs to investigate noises and ended up in a parking area at the rear of the house.
Police believe he was run over at least once as he tried to prevent the theft of his black Audi S3 sports coupe, which was later found damaged about three miles from the house.
Mr Samwell was taken to hospital where he died from his injuries.
A spokesman for the Royal Navy said Lt Samwell served for 12 years as an engineer submariner, leaving the service in September 2014.
"Our thoughts and sympathies are with his family and friends at this difficult time," he added.
A neighbour spoke of his shock at the events in the "really quiet" and "friendly" street.
The man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC there had been a persistent problem with car thieves in the area.
"I know Chorlton is a bit of a crime hotspot; because it is a nice, affluent area people do come in from other areas of Manchester, unfortunately, and target us."
Another said: "Car theft is one thing, but leading to someone's loss of life, you can't put into words how shocking it is so close to home."
Mourners gathered for a vigil in Chorlton on Sunday night before laying flowers on Cranbourne Road.
