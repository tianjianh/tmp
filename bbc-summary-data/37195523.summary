Fly tipping fears as Machynlleth bulky waste service ends

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are fears fly tipping will increase in Powys as a bulky waste collection service ends on Saturday.

The service in Machynlleth was introduced as a compromise following the closure of the Potters Yard recycling centre in January 2015, but has now been withdrawn to save money.
Householders will now have to take their waste to Newtown, a 60-mile round trip, or pay Â£25 for collection.
Machynlleth councillor Michael Williams said it was "an outrage".
"It's a real big blow for the people of Machynlleth and Dyfi Valley, this bulky waste service has been really well received and well used," he said.
Mr Williams added Potters Yard had opened because of the high volume of fly tipping in the area.
"I find it hard to believe we will not go back to that volume of fly tipping again, I hope it won't happen but I wouldn't be at all surprised.
"I feel, and my constituents feel that it's a big, big mistake, there's outrage at this decision."
The decision to completely withdraw the service was taken by the council's cabinet on 10 May.
John Powell, cabinet member for environment and sustainability, said: "With the ever reducing budgets available to us, difficult decisions need to be made.
"Unfortunately we could no longer continue this service due to its high running costs."
