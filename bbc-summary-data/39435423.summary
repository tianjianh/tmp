Spurs are having a new stadium built next to their existing home and had been expected to play at Wembley next season while the project is completed.
But Levy is seeking "greater certainty" over the delivery of the stadium in time for the 2018-19 campaign.
Spurs have until Friday to activate an option on Wembley after an application to host 27 games was approved.
Tottenham have played Champions League and Europa League ties at Wembley this term but won one of just four games at the national stadium as they made early exits in both competitions.
"While everyone is eager to know if this is our last season at the Lane, we shall only make the decision to decommission our historic White Hart Lane when we have greater certainty on the delivery of the new stadium," Levy said in a statement alongside Tottenham's latest financial results.
Should Tottenham stay at their current ground next season, they would likely play home games at Wembley the following year before moving into the new 61,000-seater stadium in time for the 2019-20 campaign.
The club's statement added that the progress of the stadium's construction is "being closely monitored".
Spurs also revealed record revenue of £209.8m for the year ending 30 June 2016, and profit after interest and tax of £33m, up from £9.4m the previous year.
