Edmund, 21, Fleming, 31, and 30-year-old Inglot complete a seven-strong team for the Rio Games.
Brothers Andy and Jamie Murray, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson had already been selected.
Both Edmund and Inglot were part of Britain's 2015 Davis Cup-winning team, while Fleming returns for his second Games having competed at London 2012.
Team GB have won 42 Olympic tennis medals - more than any other nation.
Tennis team leader Iain Bates said the squad has "fantastic strength in depth".
"The three players we welcome today have all proven their ability at the highest level," he added.
"We are in a great position heading into these Olympic Games and I am fully confident in our ability to succeed."
