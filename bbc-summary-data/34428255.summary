[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police officers will be issued with video cameras to mount on their clothing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwent Police is rolling out the initiative following a pilot in Newport city centre in August.
The force said the cameras will help to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour, increase public confidence and provide transparency around officers' actions.
The approach has been used by other forces, including North Wales Police.
