League of Ireland Premier Division: Derry City 2-1 Bohemians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City guaranteed themselves a Europa League spot next summer as they came from behind to beat Bohemians in the League of Ireland Premier Division.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Candystripes cannot now be caught for fourth place as they cemented their grip on third spot with leaders Dundalk beating Shamrock Rovers 3-0.
Derry made a slow start as Kurtis Byrne put Bohs ahead on 17 minutes.
Aaron McEneff levelled from a 51st-minute penalty before Rory Patterson struck the winner on 64 minutes.
Derry were full value for their victory as they hit the woodwork twice before McEneff's equaliser.
McEneff hammered against the crossbar with a fierce drive on 30 minutes with Patterson seeing his shot rebound to safety a few minutes later with Bohs keeper Dean Delany again beaten after great work by Dean Jarvis and Josh Daniels.
However, Derry got on terms six minutes after the restart as McEneff netted his spot-kick following a mistimed challenge from Derek Pender on Jarvis.
Derry were in front 13 minutes later with Patterson getting the final touch following a goalmouth scramble, for his 18th goal of the season.
As Derry took total control, Delany made a great save to turn away a Ronan Curtis header although Bohs almost snatched an undeserved draw in injury-time as Derek Prendergast headed inches wide.
Derry's win moved them five points ahead of fourth-placed Shamrock Rovers with only their remaining games against Sligo Rovers and St Patrick's Athletic to come.
