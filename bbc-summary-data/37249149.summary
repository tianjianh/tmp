[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Man attorney general retires over ill health

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Isle of Man's attorney general has retired on the grounds of ill health, Government House has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Harding, 54, was suspended three years ago after allegations of perjury and committing acts against public justice were made against him.
He was acquitted of all charges in 2014 but later failed in a bid to stop disciplinary action taken against him.
In November 2015, a court hearing was told Mr Harding had become "severely depressed".
The doctor's report said it was due to prolonged stress over the past four years, the court heard.
During his suspension Mr Harding, from Glen Vine, received his annual salary of about Â£160,000 a year.
John Quinn has been acting attorney general for over two years.
The position is a Crown appointment and not a government post.
By virtue of the position the attorney general has a seat on the Isle of Man's Legislative Council but cannot vote.
The attorney general is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the UK's Secretary of State for Justice.
