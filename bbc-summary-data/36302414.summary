His condition was originally life-threatening but improved on Monday, police in Lower Saxony said.
Up to 50 people were involved in the fighting at the accommodation in Dauelsen on Saturday in which the boy and several others were injured.
It followed a brawl at the same centre on Friday evening involving around 30.
The initial fight broke out between Afghans and Iraqi Kurds over a dispute involving an allegedly stolen loudspeaker, according to regional broadcaster NDR (in German).
Police said that some of the asylum seekers in the Dauelsen, part of the district of Verden, were moved to other emergency accommodation overnight to avoid further skirmishes.
Fourteen people in total were injured in the fighting.
Relatives of the badly injured teenager were able to visit him in hospital on Sunday, but he had not yet been interviewed by officers, police said.
Seven people aged between 14 and 43 are being investigated in relation to Friday's brawl, officers said.
One man, aged 19, was briefly taken into custody on Saturday night.
More than 1.1 million people arrived in Germany in 2015, many of them fleeing violence in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
