The incident happened at about 17:40 on Sunday at a new play park in Livingston, West Lothian.
Police and firefighters were called to the site after reports that items in the council-funded play area had been set on fire.
Extensive damage was caused to the site and officers are appealing for witnesses to find those responsible.
Sgt Iain Wells said: "This wanton act of vandalism has caused several thousand pounds' worth of damage and has put the play park out of use.
"We are confident we will identify the suspects. However, I am appealing to anyone who has any information regarding this offence to come forward."
George Paul, executive councillor for services for the community at West Lothian Council, said: "It is absolutely sickening to hear that this brand-new playground which has yet to be fully completed has been vandalised.
"Once again a very small number of mindless people have ruined an excellent facility for local children.
"It is absolutely vital that the person or people responsible for this completely unacceptable action are caught. I would urge anyone who has information to report it to the police as a matter of urgency."
