West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Morrison's early goal was enough to ensure West Brom beat Stoke at The Hawthorns to consolidate their place in the top 10.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Baggies started brightly, with Salomon Rondon netting inside four minutes only to be flagged offside.
Just two minutes later, Morrison latched onto Nacer Chadli's pass and tapped it past Lee Grant.
Saido Berahino, who moved from the Baggies to Stoke in January, was booed when he came on in the 58th minute.
West Brom withstood a late attack from the visitors to keep their second clean sheet in 12 games and stay in eighth place.
The result means that Stoke slip from ninth to 11th in the table, seven points behind the Baggies.
Argentine Claudio Yacob was missing for West Brom after being taken to hospital with suspected appendicitis.
West Brom put the visitors under pressure almost instantly as Jake Livermore's fine pass sailed towards Matt Phillips. Phillips' shot deflected towards Rondon, who found the net but was ruled offside.
Morrison made the breakthrough a minute later, scoring his third goal in five games as he tapped Chadli's pass beyond Lee Grant.
Stoke struggled to keep up with the home side in the first half, with Morrison and Chadli combining well to outpace the Potters' defence.
However, after half-time, it was the visitors who started strongly only for their finishing to let them down - Erik Pieters fluffing a simple header from six yards out.
Stoke had conceded in the 90th minute on the last two occasions the two sides had met and came close again here, but Joe Allen's excellent late block denied Livermore, who was Albion's only permanent signing in the transfer window.
The boos for Berahino began before the match as he warmed up with his teammates and continued as he pulled on a Stoke shirt for the first time.
His £12m move in January after seven years with the Baggies left the fans unimpressed, but the striker hardly saw any of the ball after he was introduced midway through the second half.
His one significant touch in the area, under pressure from the West Brom defence, saw him slip over the ball and allow his former team to counter-attack, which drew wry cheers from the crowd.
Stoke's main attack came from Allen, who was sprightly, but the visitors were unable to make the breakthrough in a tense final 10 minutes.
There was no handshake between the managers as the game ended, with Tony Pulis walking straight down the tunnel while an unimpressed Mark Hughes stayed on the sidelines.
Berahino, however, received an arm around the shoulders from his former team-mate Rondon.
West Brom manager Tony Pulis: "We're pleased. If you look at Stoke, they have a smashing squad of players. They've got a strong squad so it's a good result for us today.
"The supporters have really stuck with us and got behind us and can see what we're trying to do. These things take time to get right and it really annoys me when people change managers quickly.
"You get labelled for things you've done at other clubs, but I have always tried to get the best out of my players at all the clubs I've been at.
On not shaking hands with Hughes: "I shook hands with Eddie [Niedzwiecki, Stoke coach] and Mark was walking away towards their supporters so that was that."

Stoke City manager Mark Hughes: "We've played a lot better than today. We've been on a decent run and have been playing well but for whatever reason it wasn't good enough
"I was disappointed in the referee to be perfectly honest. West Brom were winning so they weren't going to rush to get the ball back into play so he allowed himself to be messed around in that regard."
On not shaking hands with Pulis: "I was there. If he came over I would have shook it. He didn't shake my hand at the start of the game either. I was the guest of the club, surely."
