Plans for a £39m redevelopment of Headingley stadium have been approved by the local council.

The stadium hosts cricket, rugby league and rugby union.
The plans include a new south stand on the rugby ground and a new joint stand overlooking both the rugby pitch and cricket ground.
Leeds City Council approved the plans earlier but deferred a final decision to the authority's chief planning officer.
It said the redevelopment of the stadium would "bring significant economic benefits to the city".
However, it is yet to be confirmed how the work would be funded.
Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Leeds Rhinos had previously proposed funding the project by selling land for housing development.
The clubs have now dropped two residential housing planning applications after "complex planning matters" delayed the renovation scheme.
The plan had been to sell greenbelt land owned by Leeds Rhinos in Weetwood and Tingley in Leeds to housing developers to raise money for the stadium.
The two applications were for outline planning for up to 195 houses in total.
