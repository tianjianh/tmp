Park Geun-hye: North Korean media pounces on dismissal news

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Korea's state radio, which often takes days to report on foreign news, has been quick off the mark in reporting the South Korean constitutional court's ruling that upholds President Park Geun-hye's impeachment.

The Korean Central Broadcasting Station (KCBS) carried a short unscheduled report on the impeachment ruling at 0445 GMT, within two hours of the court announcing its verdict.
As a point of comparison, North Korean media's first direct mention of Donald Trump winning the US presidential election came after 11 days, in a report by the daily Rodong Sinmun.
So the radio station's quick turnaround of this report is unusual. Even when the South Korean National Assembly passed a bill to impeach Ms Park in December, the North Korean media reacted almost 24 hours later.
Similarly, it took the North Korean media two days to report on the court's dismissal in 2009 of a motion to impeach then-President Roh Moo-hyun.
In today's report, the station said the court had "finally" handed Park "a sentence of impeachment" and that she will now be investigated as "as an ordinary criminal".
It added that South Koreans had been "persistently waging a popular struggle" to demand Park's impeachment.
In the past, the North Korean media has used harsh language against Park, with the state-run news agency KCNA describing her as "the worst international whore in the world".
North Korean daily Minju Joson has called her "the old witch of Cheong Wa Dae". The South Korean president's official residence, the Blue House, is known as Cheong Wa Dae in Korean.
The paper also said that she will be "forced to go to jail for her thrice-cursed crimes".
