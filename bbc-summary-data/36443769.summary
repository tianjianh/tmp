What is dodgeball?
Amie started playing the sport at university in 2012, having been introduced to it by a friend. She now plays for Wales Dragons, taking part at this year's World Championships.
Wales' mixed team finished in fourth place and women's team sixth, with Amie turning out for both sides, and she now has her sights set on a place in the team for the 2018 World Championships in New York.
Amie also represents the Wales team at the Home Nations and European Championships which take place each year and trains once a week with the Cardiff Dragons.
Amie describes the dodgeball as "a really fun sport to play" and you can give it a try with Dive into Dodgeball, which is a UK Dodgeball Association scheme to give youngsters the opportunity to get into the sport.
Amie Jones is body positive, and this is her story.
