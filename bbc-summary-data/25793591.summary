The unrest at the category C Channings Wood prison involved about 10 prisoners on Friday night, the Prison Service said.
Nine inmates have been transferred to other jails and an investigation has been launched, said a spokesman.
"Staff intervened to successfully resolve it," he said and "appropriate disciplinary action will be taken".
He added that no members of staff were injured and that they "remained in control" of the wing where the violence happened.
He declined to go into further detail about the cause of the unrest at the prison which holds about 730 inmates.
"There has been superficial damage to some cells on one wing, but the wing is still operating," he said.
"Two prisoners received medical treatment for minor injuries."
