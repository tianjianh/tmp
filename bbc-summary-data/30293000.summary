Hollie Gazzard killer Asher Maslin loses sentence appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man convicted of stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death at the hair salon where she worked has lost an appeal against his life sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Asher Maslin, 22, was jailed in July and ordered to serve a minimum term of 24 years for the murder of 20-year-old hairdresser Hollie Gazzard.
The Court of Appeal rejected his challenge against his "manifestly excessive" minimum term.
Miss Gazzard was stabbed 14 times by Maslin, with a Â£3 carving knife.
The attack took place hours after Miss Gazzard ended her relationship with the former security guard.
The court heard there were two aggravating factors in Maslin's case.
Firstly that he went into Gloucester to buy a bread knife and spent a couple of hours walking around, before he went to Fringe Benefits & La Bella Beauty salon where Miss Gazzard worked and stabbed her.
Secondly, Miss Gazzard was murdered in a public place, in front of "terrified customers" at the salon, the court heard.
The defence team said Maslin's tariff should be cut from 24 to 22 years, on the basis he had shown remorse and the sentence was too excessive.
Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, said: "There is no basis on which it [the sentence] can be said to be manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.
"It properly reflected the serious culpability of the appellant and the brutal and premeditated nature of the killing in the manner we have set out."
"The appeal is accordingly dismissed."
Speaking outside court, Miss Gazzard's father Nick said: "This appeal only increases our determination to campaign in Hollie's name for statutory healthy relationship education in schools.
"This will help to teach young people about domestic abuse and other safeguarding issues so that they can can spot the signs of an abusive partner before it's too late."
