His body was found on Botanic Avenue, near the city centre, at around 05:00 GMT. It is believed the victim was originally from Pakistan.
Police have recovered two knives at the scene and a flat in India Street is also being investigated.
A man in his 30s, believed to be from Africa originally, has been arrested.
Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said: "The victim had been stabbed a number of times and he died at the scene as a result of his injuries."
He said the dead man's nationality was still being confirmed but added "initial enquiries suggest he is Pakistani".
The detective said: "It appears there has been some sort of altercation possibly in that flat which has then spilt out onto the street and ended up with the murder in Botanic.
However, he added that the investigation was at a very early stage and he had an "open mind" in regard to motive.
The police placed a forensic tent at the corner of Cameron Street where it meets with Botanic Avenue on Thursday morning.
Officers cordoned off the road from University Street to Shaftesbury Square and Botanic railway station was also closed for several hours, but both have since reopened.
Earlier, Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway appealed for information about the murder.
"We are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area of Botanic Avenue early this morning and witnessed the incident, or anyone with any information that could assist this investigation, to contact detectives at Musgrave police station on the non-emergency number 101."
