The 32-year-old was a member of England's World Cup squad that finished third in Canada earlier this year.
She had a spell on loan at Notts County last season and left Arsenal Ladies at the end of the campaign.
Her arrival follows Thursday's signing of Sophie Ingle and she told the club website: "This is a fantastic move for me and I cannot wait to get started."
Reds manager Scott Rogers said: "This is a really important signing for the club - Siobhan is an England international whose experience will be crucial next season."
