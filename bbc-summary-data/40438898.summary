Yorkshire v Surrey: Headingley fourth-day washout sees game drawn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire's County Championship match against Surrey at Headingley ended in a draw after no play was possible on days three and four following poor weather.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game was called off at 15:30 BST on Thursday because rain had affected the run-ups from the Kirkstall Lane End.
Surrey had taken control during the first two days, with Kumar Sangakkara's 180 contributing to their 516-7.
Yorkshire then slipped to 27-1 after losing Adam Lyth on the second evening, but there was to be no further action.
