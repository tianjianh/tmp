[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southampton acid attack was 'revenge for drug deal'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman was left scarred and blind in one eye after acid was thrown in her face out of revenge for a drug deal that went wrong, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carla Whitlock, 37, was attacked with a drain cleaner containing concentrated sulphuric acid on 18 September.
She suffered serious burns to her face, neck and arms in the attack in Southampton's Guildhall Square, Southampton Crown Court was told.
Billy Midmore, 22, denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
His brother Geoffrey Midmore, 26, has previously pleaded guilty to the same charge.
Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, told the court the brothers purchased the high-strength drain cleaner together for the attack on the mother of six, which happened outside the Turtle Bay restaurant.
She said: "[Miss Whitlock] is scarred, her eyelids were burnt, as were her face and other parts of her body.
"It landed on her face and shoulders, she got some on her hands because her immediate reaction when her face was burning was to put her hands up.
"They ran off, Geoffrey Midmore and Billy Midmore, they leave Carla Whitlock screaming in pain."
Miss Maylin said the One Shot drain cleaner had the highest concentration of sulphuric acid - 89% to 93% - that can be sold to the public.
She added that Geoffrey Midmore sent a photograph of the bottle on WhatsApp to an acquaintance together with the words: "This is one face melter."
Miss Maylin said Miss Whitlock had introduced a man called Levi to the Midmore brothers, who are from London, and a deal with him worth Â£2,000 had gone wrong.
She said: "Because that drug deal went wrong, these two brothers decided to enact their revenge by permanently scarring Miss Whitlock."
The trial continues.
