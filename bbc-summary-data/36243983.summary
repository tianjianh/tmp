Lawro's final day Premier League predictions v X-Men star Ben Hardy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson has been pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for the final round of Premier League fixtures is actor Ben Hardy, star of the new X-Men film.
Hardy, 25, used to play Peter Beale in BBC soap EastEnders but supports a north London team - Arsenal - and it is fair to say he has not enjoyed watching the Gunners fall away in the title race again this season.
"I am sick of it, it feels like Groundhog Day," he told BBC Sport.
"I have got a lot of respect for Arsene Wenger but, reluctantly, I am in the 'Wenger Out' campaign.
"I think it is a case of 'thanks for the memories, but let's move on'."

Ben needs to score more than 160 points to knock stand-up comedian Nathan Caton off the top of the guest leaderboard.
Lawro's final league table - based on his predictions - can be seen at the bottom of the page.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got three correct results, including two perfect scores from 10 Premier League matches, to give him a total of 90 points.
He lost out to two-time world darts champion Adrian 'Jackpot' Lewis, who got four results correct, with two perfect scores.
Lawro also picked up 60 points from his predictions for the four midweek Premier League games (see 19:30 BST entry of Tuesday's live text commentary).His opponent for those matches, world champion boxer Anthony Joshua, did not make any predictions for these games, which were postponed from FA Cup semi-final weekend, but has been awarded 20 points based on his existing points-per-match average, which was 30 points from six matches (five points per match).

All kick-offs 15:00 BST
Lawro's prediction: 3-0
Ben's prediction: I want to say 6-0 because Villa have been so poor but it is going to be more a case of us scoring and clinging on to it, rather than pushing forward to get a bag of goals. 1-0

Ben's prediction: I was terrified when it looked like Spurs might win the league because you would never hear the end of it but second or third for them and Arsenal? Who cares? It does not make much difference in my book and I don't think us finishing second would be anything to celebrate. 2-1
