[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 1-2 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jake Taylor earned Exeter their first points of the season after three goals in six second-half minutes brought the game to life in a 2-1 win over Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Harley's 25-yard thunderbolt after 66 minutes gave the Grecians the lead before former Exeter player Arron Davies levelled for Stanley four minutes later.
Taylor then volleyed home the winner to lift Exeter off the bottom of the fledgling table.
Stanley only had themselves to blame as they spurned the best first-half chances.
Sean McConville forced goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik into a two-handed save, Jordan Clark curled a shot narrowly wide while Seamus Conneely headed inches over the crossbar just before the half-hour mark.
Accrington came close again after 44 minutes when Davies had a shot cleared off the line by Craig Woodman, then Blackburn loanee John O'Sullivan saw his fierce strike held by Olejnik at the second attempt just before half-time.
Exeter came out stronger after the break and the game erupted in the 66th minute when Harley got the ball from Ollie Watkins 25 yards out and unleashed a fierce strike which goalkeeper Aaron Chapman could do nothing about.
It was all-square after 70 minutes when Janoi Donacien found Davies on the edge of the area and he fired the ball low and hard into the net against his former club.
But Stanley only held onto their lead for two minutes as Robbie Simpson laid the ball off for Taylor to volley home the winner.
