Guiseley 2-1 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Rankine scored a late winner to earn Guiseley a 2-1 victory over fellow National League strugglers Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Walton put the Lions ahead from the penalty spot in the 32nd minute after James Wesolowski was upended in the area.
The visitors, who remain just one place above the relegation zone, equalised with a spot-kick of their own when substitute Bobby-Joe Taylor converted in the 64th minute.
Adam Lockwood's men, unbeaten in seven league games at home, still had time to earn all three points and Rankine buried Will Hatfield's pass seven minutes from time to claim his first goal since October and move Guiseley to within one point of their opponents in the table.
