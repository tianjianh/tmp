[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A self-appointed lord convicted of two multimillion-pound frauds has been jailed for a further seven years after he failed to pay back more than £1m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hugh James Rodley, 69, from Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, was sentenced to eight years in jail in 2009 for trying to steal £229m from a Japanese bank.
In 2012, he was given an additional seven years after being convicted of conning 741 pensioners out of £6m.
He was sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
Rodley was ordered to handover £1,236,737 or face an additional seven years in jail in November 2014.
The money had been identified by National Crime Agency (NCA) and City of London Police financial investigators as profits he had made from both criminal enterprises.
Among the assets were luxury cars and his manor house in Gloucestershire.  He bought his title at an auction in 1986.
Acting Det Sgt Melonie Moody, from City of London Police, said his sentence was "one of the biggest" they had seen in recent times.
He said the force hoped to reunite the 741 victims with money they lost to Rodley.
Stephanie Jeavons, from the NCA, said the sentence showed the "seriousness of his failure to pay".
