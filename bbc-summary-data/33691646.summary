Mid-summer resolutions: Why life changes are so hard to achieve

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Around eight million of us are expected to jet off to sunnier climes over the next month. For many of us that break from the daily grind provides a chance to take stock of our daily lives and think about what we want to change - new job, better relationships, healthier lifestyle, self-improvement and so on...

Often we return home determined to change our life for the better, only to slip back into our old habits after only a few days. Here we examine why it is so hard to stick to a new regime and ask those who brought lasting change into their lives about the secrets of their success.
Research published this month by Kings College London suggests that once you are obese, you are likely to stay that way. The study shows that the odds of returning to a normal weight are just 1 in 210 for men and 1 in 124 for women over a year. Depressing reading maybe but is it really surprising?
Anyone who has ever been stuck in a rut - whether battling to lose weight, stop smoking or leave a miserable job or relationship - will know that making positive, lasting changes to your life can feel like pushing water uphill.
Claire Crowther, an NHS worker from Wrexham, struggled with her weight for years.
In her mid-20s, she tipped the scales at 14 stone.  At 5ft 4 ins, that meant she was clinically obese.
"My diet had always been pretty poor," she said, "And the stress of getting married, having a baby and then getting divorced within a few years made me turn to food for comfort. I ate and ate and ate when I got down and my weight began to creep up and up and up."
Mrs Crowther, 31, felt lethargic, unhealthy and in her words, 'greasy on the inside and outside". Her emotional well-being was also affected.
"I didn't have any confidence," she said. "I didn't bother with fashion because I thought I whatever I wore, I'd just look fat. I used to delete all photos of myself."
But, she explains, for a long time intense misery was not enough to instigate change.
"I tried every fad diet going but just ended up gaining more weight," she said. "I wanted to look good and wanted to feel confident but somehow it wasn't quite enough to make me go out and get it."
'Scared of change'
Chartered psychologist Dr Pauline Rennie-Peyton says people are often afraid of change.
"So often I hear people say, 'I should have moved house ten years ago' or 'I should have left this relationship 20 years ago'," she said.
"But people are afraid of what they don't know. Even if you're not happy in a situation, there's a security in knowing about it."
For some that fear can be about bringing about modest change while for others it can be a matter of life or death.
Scott Jenkinson, from Llandudno, who spent more than 15 years battling drug and alcohol addiction.
"I was absolutely scared of change," he said. "Even though I was homeless, I was in my comfort zone. I knew how to live on the streets, I knew how to duck and weave and I felt safe and secure. It was like home to me."
"I used to look at 'normal' people and wish I had their lives but then I'd remember what 'normal' life comes with - the bills, the crying baby, the responsibility. It was everything I'd been running away from."
Mr Jenkinson, 41, who's been clean for seven years and now works as a teacher, certainly proves that change is possible.
But, says Dr Rennie-Peyton, you have to be willing to leave your comfort zone and then be prepared for some hard work.
"You can't have the penny and the bun," she said. "You have to ask yourself 'which do I want the most - to make these changes or to stay where it's comfortable?' And if you really want to change, you have to do something about it."
'Enough is enough'
So what finally pushes people to take action?
"Some people have an epiphany after a traumatic event in their lives like a divorce or losing a job," says Dr Rennie-Peyton.
"Sometimes you really just get to the end of your tether with something and decide enough is enough. Or it can be just about taking the time to think, like on holiday for instance, and ask 'what do I want for me?' Often our lives are so busy that we simply don't have the time to ask ourselves if we are really happy. "
It was not an epiphany which galvanised Claire Crowther; that was down to the belligerence of a stranger.
"He found my work pass, which had an older photo from when I was much slimmer and said to me 'you might want to think about going on a diet because you really are quite fat now'," she said.
"I went home and cried my eyes out.  It wasn't anything that I didn't already know but that just really brought it home.
"I was about 25 at the time and I remember thinking 'I've got to get this sorted out now because if I carry on like this, I'm going to be 20 stone by the time I'm 30'."
Mrs Crowther joined a slimming club and started working out. She is now six stone lighter and still works out to the extent that she takes part in fitness competitions.
"I definitely feel more confident in myself," she said. "I used to be really shy about how I looked and really worried about what other people thought. I don't worry about that anymore."
Sadly, most people who embark on a process of change never get this far.
We all start off with the best intentions but end up indulging in the same old habits before very long. The trick to avoid this? Do not let negative thoughts throw you off course, according to Dr Rennie-Peyton.
"If you can change your thought patterns, then it's easier to change your behaviour," she explained.
"You have to constantly think 'what's the benefit for me of being thinner? What's the benefit for me of leaving this relationship? What's the benefit of leaving this job?'.
"You have to believe that you deserve to be treated well and once you really believe that, you're more likely to take care of yourself."
Scott Jenkinson had more than his fair share of ups and downs along the road to recovery from substance abuse.
In 2008, after years of rough sleeping in Tenerife and London, things were finally looking up for him.
He had his own flat and was studying for a degree at Bangor University.
"I had a student loan and access to drug dealers galore," he said. "By the second year, I'd gone completely backwards. I had the biggest heroin habit I'd had in years.
"True to form, I ran away. I took the train to London, went straight to my old begging spot on Charing Cross Road, sat down and started all over again. It's crazy, isn't it? Leaving a flat with all your stuff in it to live on the streets. But that's what I was used to."
Later that year Mr Jenkinson made it back to north Wales and, after a spell in rehab, finally kicked drugs and alcohol for good.
"Even when you put down the drink and drugs, there's still so much stuff that holds you back," he said. "Your old ways of thinking, your old ways of doing things can keep you stuck in a rut. You really have to change the way you think about yourself in order to move on."
But its not just our own negative thought patterns that can trip us up. Dr Rennie-Peyton warns that friends and family can also keep us stuck.
"If you've got a family member who is also overweight, they probably won't want you to get slim and look great in your clothes," she said. "They will want you to stay the same as them so they might try to sabotage you by offering you unhealthy foods."
"Feeling good about yourself also means you're more likely to start saying no to people who are used to you being at their beck and call, which may lead to them accusing you of being 'not as nice' as you used to be. You have to be quite strong."
"I have lost a couple of friends because of the changes I've made," said Mrs Crowther.
"I'd get accused of being miserable if I wasn't eating burger and chips when I wasn't being miserable at all. It was just my choice. It's sad to lose friends but I suppose people do have their own anxieties and might begin to feel a bit threatened when someone close to them starts to change."
Leaving your comfort zone, overcoming constant challenges, perhaps even losing friends along the way - no wonder making lasting changes in our lives seems too much like hard work for most of us.
But the good news is change is possible and anyone can do it.
'Self perception'
"People are frightened," said Dr Rennie-Peyton. "But if you can change your thought processes and embrace it instead of fighting it, then I think you can actually enjoy making changes."
And according to those who've managed it, it is definitely worth the effort.
"If you're not happy with something, staying the same is not going to make you happy," said Claire Crowther. "The only way to feel better is to make a change in some way. It is hard but you have to take a leap of faith and believe in yourself."
"My drug use took me to a very serious place," said Scott Jenkinson, who is now happily married with a two-year-old daughter. "But whether you're trying to lose weight, or trying to stop smoking, or trying to get off drugs, it's the same stuff we go through."
"In my old life, the good feeling that heroin would give me far outweighed the consequences of taking it," he said.
"If I had to make that decision today, there's not a thing on this planet that would make me risk what I have now. The key for me is the change in self-perception. I used to think, 'I'm Scott, I'm an addict, I'm homeless.' Now it's, 'I'm Scott, I'm a husband, a father, a teacher.'"
