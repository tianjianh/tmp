Sixteen out of the 17 statues currently in the city centre are of men - the exception being Queen Victoria.
Others on the shortlist to join them include writer Elizabeth Gaskell and anti-racism campaigner Louise Da-Cocodia.
The winner's statue is due to be unveiled in 2019.
Manchester councillor Margaret Ashton, businesswomen Elizabeth Raffald - who wrote The Experienced English Housekeeper in the 18th Century - and the late Labour MP Ellen Wilkinson are also on the shortlist.
People can vote online for their favourite until 31 December.
The campaign, known as the WoManchester Statue Project, was started last year by Didsbury councillor Andrew Simcock.
