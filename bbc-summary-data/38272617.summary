Ross County 2-1 Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County overcame the dismissal of Kenny van der Weg to beat Aberdeen and move sixth in the Scottish Premiership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Gardyne crossed low for Liam Boyce to fire County in front against the run of play.
Kenny McLean and Jonny Hayes went close for the Dons and Niall McGinn levelled in the second half.
Van der Weg was sent off for a lunge on Hayes but the hosts soon moved ahead again, Ryan Dow heading in on the bounce after Andrew Davies' knock-down.
Jim McIntyre's side are now four points off St Johnstone, while third-placed Aberdeen trail Rangers by seven points, albeit with a game in hand.
Ross County had been unbeaten in five matches, frustrated by being unable to turn draws into wins, but they delivered with a wonderful performance against their visitors from the Granite City.
Boyce netted the opener from a couple of yards but the real credit must go to the build-up. A dummy in midfield found Chris Routis, who released Gardyne down the left and his measured ball across was perfect for Boyce to knock home.
Earlier, Joe Lewis had saved well from Tony Dingwall, who seized on the rebound and looked certain to score only for Graeme Shinnie to produce a magnificent last-gasp tackle.
Davies almost doubled County's lead with an instinctive volley that Lewis tipped away before the goalkeeper denied Craig Curran from close range.
Substitute Alex Schalk also went close before Van der Weg made the home side's task all the more difficult with a fairly shocking challenge on Hayes that was rightly punished with a straight red card.
But County showed tremendous desire to keep Aberdeen out and snatch a winner, Davies nodding down a Schalk cross and substitute Dow guiding into the right corner.
With Rangers having beaten Hamilton on Friday, the onus was on the Dons to deliver a positive result.
Desire and determination were in place and they carried a threat but seemed unable to find the final pass or move to really open up County's backline until the latter stages of the match. Even then they fell short.
McLean had a number of long-range first-half efforts and Hayes' superb free-kick was saved brilliantly by Scott Fox.
When Shinnie escaped down the left it seemed inevitable a goal would result but his centre was marginally too strong for James Maddison to touch home.
Anthony O'Connor came very close from long range and the visitors thought the pivotal moment had arrived when Shay Logan's ball from the right was missed and fell perfectly for substitute McGinn. He found the corner, utilising the time and space he had.
Aberdeen surged forward and Maddison was very close to a winner with a wriggle to create space and shot that flashed narrowly wide.
The sucker punch arrived when Dow netted, leaving McInnes' men empty-handed.
The entertaining nature of the match will offer little comfort to Aberdeen, whose midweek meeting with Motherwell was abandoned because of floodlight failure after a 0-0 draw with St Johnstone last weekend.
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "We played particularly well in the first half. We worked Aberdeen's goalkeeper, I think he's had four great saves.
"You think to yourself it's going to be like recent weeks where we've created quite a few chances but not been ruthless enough in front of goal.
"Aberdeen were more dominant in the second half and we had to defend deeply at times. They're a quality side. We dug in and showed that desire.
"We've not had a big result this season in my eyes and beating Aberdeen is a big result. They're a big club, good players and well managed.
"That takes it to six [unbeaten] but it's more pleasing that it's with three points."
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: "We'd have been disappointed with just a point. We passed up good opportunities. We dominated the whole second half.
"We dragged ourselves back into it and it's just a matter of time we think before we go and try to get the second goal.
"County were defending deeper and deeper and we were a wee bit wasteful.
"When they go down to 10 men and we have one set play to defend we didn't deal with it.
"It's that killer instinct. We had two or three fizzing across their box similar to Boyce's goal but Boyce is on the end of it to score.
"The response deserves mention but really it feels quite galling we haven't got anything. We'll remember a lot of the good today. We've controlled the game.
"There's work to be done. We need to take more responsibility in both boxes."
