George Harrison Porsche sells for £37,500 at auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A car that once belonged to George Harrison has sold at auction for £37,500.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Porsche 928 was bought for £2,000 in 2003 by Leeds man Raj Sedha for spare parts.
Mr Sedha said he was unaware of the connection to the Beatles legend until his wife spotted the musician's name in the logbook.
The car was bought by Harrsion in 1980 and he used to drive it when he lived in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.
Mr Sedha said at first he did not know who Harrison was until his wife explained.
"It didn't click with me," he said.
"She said: 'He's the Beatle. You can't take the car apart for spares'."
Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said that as well as having a famous former owner, the car was notable because the black leather interior has black stitching, unlike the usual red or cream.
