US President Donald Trump leaves for Saudi Arabia shortly on his first foreign trip since becoming president.

His eight-day trip will also take in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Brussels, the Vatican and Sicily.
It comes as Mr Trump faces uproar at home following his sacking of FBI director James Comey.
He has strongly criticised the decision to appoint a special counsel to oversee an inquiry into alleged Russian influence on the US election.
The trip takes in the capitals of the three major monotheistic religions - Islam, Judaism and Christianity.
Mr Trump will attend the Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh and speak about his "hopes of a peaceful vision of Islam," the White House said.
US National Security Adviser HR McMaster said the president would deliver a speech expressing hope that such a vision would resonate worldwide.
"What President Trump is seeking is to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress and prosperity," he told reporters.
Mr Trump caused controversy during his campaign by calling for Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the US over security concerns. Legislation aimed at restricting travel from several Muslim-majority countries remains tied up in the US courts.
The summit agenda is expected to focus on combating Islamist militants and the growing regional influence of Iran.
Mr Trump has been a fierce critic of the Iran deal which eased sanctions in return for a curb on its nuclear activities.
One leader who will not be attending the summit will be Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir. President Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crimes charges and the US was reported to be unhappy about his planned attendance.
Unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, Mr Trump is not expected to highlight human rights during his trip.
Bruce Riedel, of the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, told Reuters news agency that the Saudis "don't want any more talk about human rights, democracy, political reform or gender equality".
"They had enough of that from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They're pretty confident they're not going to hear it from Donald Trump," he said.
Aside from the formal diplomacy, US country music star Toby Keith will perform a free concert in Riyadh on Saturday alongside Saudi singer Rabeh Sager.
Saudi Arabia, which enforces a strict interpretation of Islam including a total ban on alcohol, is perhaps an unusual venue for Keith - whose hits include I Love This Bar, Whiskey Girl, and Drunk Americans.
Saturday's concert is open only to men aged over 21 who are required to dress in traditional Saudi tunics.
On Monday, Mr Trump will fly to Tel Aviv and travel on to Jerusalem where he will meet President Reuven Rivlin.
He is due to visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as well as the Western Wall before holding talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Observers will be watching to see if Mr Trump refers to his announcement during the election campaign, that he would break with decades of US policy and move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive and complex issues within the Middle East conflict and no country in the world currently has its embassy there.
On Tuesday, Mr Trump will travel to Bethlehem in the West Bank for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.  Peace talks with Israel will top the agenda and Mr Trump is expected to express his support for Palestinian "self-determination".
President Trump will arrive early in Rome and have an audience with Pope Francis at the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican.
The two men have appeared at odds on many subjects including climate change and the plight of refugees, but the Pope has said he will give the president an open-minded hearing.
Later, Mr Trump flies to Brussels where he will be greeted by King Philippe and Prime Minister Charles Michel.
After talks with EU leaders and France's new President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Trump will attend a meeting of Nato leaders.
This will be closely watched after Mr Trump's conflicting pronouncements on the alliance. During his campaign, he called Nato "obsolete" although in April he reversed his stance.
The US leader is expected to repeat his demand that other Nato members increase their contributions.
The last stop on Mr Trump's tour will be the picturesque Sicilian town of Taormina where he will attend a G7 summit.
Correspondents say the other G7 leaders are eager to hear Mr Trump's thoughts on trade and other issues at first hand.
Mr McMaster has said that the president will "press America's economic agenda and call for greater security co-operation".
