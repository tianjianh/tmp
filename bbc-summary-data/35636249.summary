Underground Central Line reopens after hole drilled in tunnel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A section of a London Tube line had to be closed after contractors drilled a hole through the roof of an underground tunnel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Central Line services were suspended between Marble Arch and White City after masonry fell on the track outside Shepherd's Bush station.
The damage was repaired before the line reopened about 21:30 GMT.
Transport for London (TfL) said it was possible to see into the tunnel from a building site above.
It is understood contractors were working on an extension to the Westfield shopping centre when a small amount of loose concrete fell on to the westbound line below.
No damage was caused to trains or the track, but TfL said the risk that other debris might fall through the hole meant it had to be filled before trains could begin running again.
Operations director Peter McNaught apologised to passengers affected by the disruption.
