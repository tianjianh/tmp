The 30-year-old heptathlete gets the award for her services to athletics.
Dame Jessica, who won gold at London 2012 Olympics and silver four years later in Rio, announced her retirement from the sport in October.
Paralympic gold medallists Grace Clough and Will Bayley have both been honoured with MBEs. Mayor of Doncaster Roselyn Jones is to receive a CBE.
Dame Jessica will be awarded her third World Championship after Tatyana Chernova was stripped of the 2011 title for doping.
Clough is being honoured for rowing, and Bayley for table tennis. Both picked up a medal at the games in Rio.
Former Barnsley FC goalkeeper and coach Norman Rimmington, who died this month, is to be posthumously awarded the British Empire Medal for services to football and the community of Barnsley.
Mrs Jones, who became mayor in 2013, is to be given the accolade for services to local government.
