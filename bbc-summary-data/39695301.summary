Fu lost the first two frames of the final session to trail 10-8, but breaks of 78 and 115 pulled him level.
Robertson took an error-strewn 21st frame on the black, but Fu remained the calmer player and took the next three.
The world number eight from Hong Kong plays Mark Selby in the last eight, the defending champion having earlier beaten Xiao Guodong 13-6.
Barry Hawkins, runner-up in 2013, won by the same scoreline, securing his place in the quarter-finals with victory over Scotland's Graeme Dott.
Robertson screamed in delight and hit the table in celebration after clinching what seemed to be a pivotal frame to go 11-10 ahead.
But Fu dug in to get over the line and continue a consistent season, that has seen him secure the third ranking title of his career, reach two semi-finals, as well as make the last four at the Masters.
Two-time Crucible semi-finalist Fu told BBC Sport: "It was very tough. I had so many chances and missed so many chances.
"It was one of those matches that neither of us deserved to win. For fighting spirit I was a 10 out of 10, but for snooker it was four out of 10."
Robertson described his performance as "garbage".
"I played awful snooker," said the Australian. "It wasn't good to watch. I was awful in my first match too."

World number one Selby, who led 10-6 overnight, rattled off breaks of 101, 73 and 60 to see off his Chinese foe.
The 33-year-old from Leicester told BBC Sport: "To win the first frame and get settled - and to do it with a century - was great.
"I played a really solid game. I didn't make too many mistakes and put him under pressure. And when he made mistakes I capitalised.
"I won a couple of key frames from 40 or 50 points behind and made a couple of good clearances on Sunday afternoon. That was probably the turning point. To come out at 4-4 and keep that four-frame lead was vital."

Hawkins was also a 13-6 winner, beating former champion Dott to secure his place in the last eight.
Like Selby, world number seven Hawkins was in no mood to hang around, quickly taking the first frame, wrapping up the second with a superb break of 98, before getting over the line in a scrappy third frame.
The Kent-based left-hander, who will play Stephen Maguire in the quarter-finals, said: "I'm glad it's over. You want to finish off as quick as you can because it's a long tournament.
"Over the years I have had some unbelievably gruelling matches and it takes it out of you. I wasn't in top form but I played pretty solid. I kept him pretty cold and away from the table."
