The former Manchester United captain has yet to secure a league win since taking on his first managerial job.
His team have gone from the fringes of Champions League qualification to 14th, four points above the relegation zone.
"We have to win this match on Saturday," said Neville. "That's the pressure I'm putting on myself."
Valencia have lost four and drawn five league games under Neville, who was appointed at the start of December.
They were also crushed 7-0 by Barcelona in the Copa del Rey last week and must face Lionel Messi and co again in the second leg of their semi-final at the Mestalla on Wednesday.
But Neville, who was urged to quit by former Valencia captain Santiago Canizares after the loss to Barcelona, is already looking ahead.
When asked about the prospect of relegation, the former England international responded: "I'm not even considering that.
"I know the situation we're in. I'm desperate to turn these results around. I will turn these results around."
