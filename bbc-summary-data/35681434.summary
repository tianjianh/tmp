Emergency services were called to a property on City Road near the Penlline Street junction at about 04:30 GMT.
The fire service is investigating after the blaze started in the Moonlight shisha cafe and spread to the flat and roof above it.
Police were asking people to avoid the area.
South Wales Police evacuated the area - home to dozens of cafes, bars and restaurants - at the height of the fire and the fire service said several people now needed temporary accommodation.
Local resident Matthew Haines told BBC Wales he had heard a major explosion and had gone around the corner to see what had happened.
"I thought, 'I wonder what's happened. Is it one of the places round the corner?' We've just had a recent kebab shop go up.
"The fire literally took minutes, it was in full swing. I counted 13 fire engines, water tenders, air lift. The fire service were working non-stop."
In a statement, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the cause of the fire was still under investigation, adding it had begun in an outside tented area of the cafe.
