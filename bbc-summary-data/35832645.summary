[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Reeves, a chemistry teacher at Ysgol Penweddig in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, was sacked in January 2015. The school said he was already on a final written warning.
An employment tribunal has now ruled in his favour following a three-day hearing in January.
A spokesman for union NASUWT "welcomed the judgement of the tribunal".
A Ceredigion council spokesman said the authority was "very disappointed with the decision of the employment tribunal as we felt the behaviour of the teacher on both occasions, which led to the dismissal, was unacceptable".
