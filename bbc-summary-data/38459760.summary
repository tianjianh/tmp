[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new £31m school in Neath Port Talbot are set to be given the go-ahead on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council's cabinet will meet to discuss the new school for ages 3-16 which is set to replace Groes Primary School and Dyffryn Comprehensive.
Funding for Ysgol Newydd Margam, which will accommodate 1,455 pupils, was announced in November.
A report recommends approving the plans, with a 28-day public consultation set to begin on 5 January.
The new school is set to open on 1 September 2018 and the council said the move would save £7.5m in maintenance backlogs for the current sites.
