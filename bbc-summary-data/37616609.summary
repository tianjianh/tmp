The 29-year-old world number 21 took the first game 12-10 after an impressive trick-shot between his legs with the scores tied at 10-10.
But Egypt's 2014 US Open winner edged the second and third games 11-9 and 12-10 before winning the fourth 11-5.
Simpson had beaten Egypt's Karim Ali Fathi in the opening round.
"Played my first trick shot today. Wanna know how I did it? Me too....," Simpson wrote on Twitter after the match.
