Chris Robshaw and George Ford will co-captain an England squad featuring eight uncapped players against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will be the first time Robshaw, 30, will captain England since standing down after exiting the 2015 World Cup.
"Chris will look after the forwards and defence, George the backs and attack," said England coach Eddie Jones.
"With so many younger players there we need co-captains rather than just one guy responsible for everything."
Bath-bound flanker Sam Underhill will make his England bow, with Saracens' Nick Isiekwe and Charlie Ewels paired at lock. Leicester prop Ellis Genge will pack down with Worcester's Jack Singleton and Harlequins' Will Collier.
Saracens full-back Alex Goode will line-up against England after being added to the Barbarians squad on Tuesday.
The 29-year-old, who made the last of his 21 England Test appearances against Fiji in November, said: "It will be odd, I will probably be humming along to the anthem.
"I'm not giving up at all. It's a dream to play for England."
