Prospect union members working for Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial) have voted to accept an offer on their terms and conditions.

More than 120 security staff held a 48-hour strike in April which led to the closure of Dundee Airport.
Hial's other 10 sites continued to operate during the action.
The union members have voted 95% in favour of an offer to harmonise their terms and conditions over the next 20 months.
There was a turnout of 74% of the members to the ballot.
