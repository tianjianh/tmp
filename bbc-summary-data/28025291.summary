City Sentral shopping centre plan to be shrunk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a shopping centre development in Stoke-on-Trent are to be "downsized", developers have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Realis Estates said it would release details of a "reduced size scheme" for City Sentral in Hanley soon.
It was granted planning permission for a 650,000 sq ft (15 acre) site in 2011 but that contract expired in February.
The announcement follows a report commissioned by the city council which said the current retail market could not "support the proposed development".
The report, written by retail consultants WYG, said the scale needed to "better reflect current market conditions".
It said it also had concerns that Marks and Spencer would not be the main tenant at City Sentral because it was planning to build a new store three miles away at Wolstanton Retail Park.
Plans to include a cinema development should also be scrapped as a result of a new nine-screen multiplex being built at the nearby Intu Potteries shopping mall, it said.
Realis Estates Managing Director, Duncan Mathieson, said: "We are working with [Stoke-on-Trent city] council on a reduced size scheme which we will update you on and release as soon as we can. "
