[SN]TITLE[SN]
Suspected Manchester Mers cases prove negative

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A suspected outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) which temporarily shut a hospital's A&E unit in Manchester was a false alarm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two patients who were thought to have the Mers condition have tested negative.
They were isolated for treatment and the hospital said there was "no significant risk to public health".
Mers is passed to people in close contact and is similar to the Sars virus.
Patients who would usually travel to the Manchester Royal Infirmary were diverted to hospitals in South Manchester and Salford and the North Manchester General Hospital.
The Manchester Royal said its children's A&E department remained open throughout.
