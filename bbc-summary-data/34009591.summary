[SN]TITLE[SN]
South Yorkshire pit rescued by workforce forced to shut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was with a sense of disbelief that I turned up with a satellite television truck a few days ago to report on the closure of the last deep mine in the coal fields of South Yorkshire.

I have reported on the coal industry in one way or another for 35 years and even as big chunks of it were sold off, the idea that all of it would shut down in my lifetime is still hard to take in.
Yet as a convoy of vehicles from court-appointed administrators drove past me to take possession of Hatfield Main Colliery just outside Doncaster, it marked the final chapter of more than two decades of struggle to save the pit.
During that time commercial operators have come and gone, forcing the workforce to step in twice to invest their own money to keep it alive.
The end of Hatfield's precarious hold on survival became inevitable towards the end of 2014 as international coal prices dropped so low that it was cheaper for power stations on its own doorstep to burn fuel from Russia or Columbia.
"There's deep frustration here," I was told by John Grogan, the former Yorkshire MP who chairs the worker and management partnership that has been running the pit since 2013.
"Coal burning isn't going away any time soon in Yorkshire. In fact this winter 40 per cent of our electricity will come from coal, except that it's all going to be Columbian or Russian.
"Some people would say there's blood on that coal because the item on every agenda at Hatfield was health and safety. That's not true in Columbia."
Hatfield, which would have celebrated its centenary next year, had always been seen as the pit that refused to die despite the odds being heavily stacked against it.
Back in 1994 when the then publically-owned industry was put up for sale few would have bet that Hatfield would be the last survivor of the dozen pits then still working in the South Yorkshire coalfields.
The pit was seen as such a poor prospect at the time of that mass-privatisation that British Coal could not find a commercial operator willing to take it over.
It was left to the management and its 230-strong workforce to rescue their own pit with a buy-out. Seven years later as profits dipped coal production was suspended and Hatfield mothballed.
Then along came Richard Budge, the Nottinghamshire entrepreneur whose RJB Mining company had bought up virtually every other colliery in the original privatisation of the English coalfields.
By 2007 Richard Budge and RJB Mining had parted company and he came up with a scheme to get himself back into the industry by buying and re-opening Hatfield with a view to building a futuristic 'clean-coal' power station on the site which would provide a ready-made market.
The re-hired workforce backed the plan enthusiastically. A site was cleared and access roads, a roundabout and even signposts pointing to the power station were put in place.
That was as far as the plan got.
The roads and even the signs are still in place, but when promised foreign investment never materialised plans for the power station were abandoned.
The pit struggled on under a new commercial operator, but in 2013 the workforce had to step in again with their own money topped up by as loan from the National Union of Mineworkers.
Hatfield's final shutdown leaves Kellingley Colliery in North Yorkshire as the last working pit in the country.  It too is living on borrowed time with its closure scheduled for December this year.
