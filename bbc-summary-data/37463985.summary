Rickie Lambert's first goals for his new club helped Cardiff out of the Championship bottom three and eased the pressure on their new manager.
Trollope received backing from Cardiff's board this week despite only being appointed in the summer.
"Of course [we are relieved] we have been disappointed with the run that we have been on," Trollope told BBC Wales.
"We are disappointed with our league position, but we have got the quality to turn things around.
"When you've been on a run like this, then of course confidence and belief takes a dip and creates a difficult situation.
"But we showed the spirit of the group and the resilience."
Trollope hopes the victory over the Millers will silence critics of the club after Lambert's firm header and deflected winner gave the Bluebirds a first away victory since March.
"It is a big statement to our detractors, to roar back from a goal down, especially on the run we have been on, was a real big statement from the group and I am really proud of that," he said.
"We looked at a lot of things over the last few weeks to try and turn thing around.
"For the winning goal we had a bit of luck, but we were due some. We had a huge desire."
Trollope said the experience of England striker Lambert, a free transfer arrival from West Brom on transfer deadline day, would be crucial to the Bluebirds' prospects of climbing the table.
Rickie Lambert has got the respect of the dressing because of what he has done in his career," he said.
"We are delighted he has got off the mark. Rickie is a real leader of men.
"We have to get things correct around him to maximise his ability."
