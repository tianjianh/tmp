NHS Highland has confirmed that plans to add an extra 150 spaces at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness were in the early stages.
Parking has been a long-running issue at the hospital.
It has been claimed it is being used as an unofficial park and ride facility with people able to park there for free and then take a bus into the city.
NHS Highland said: "We have identified funding which we will use to create up to 150 extra spaces on the site and we will also be reintroducing entrance and exit barriers to the car park."
