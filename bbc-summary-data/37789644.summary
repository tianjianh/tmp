The 51-year-old will now stay with the Super League club until the end of the 2020 season.
Powell took over at Wheldon Road in May 2013 and guided the team to the 2014 Challenge Cup final.
"I think it's a massive boost for the club. He's probably been one of the best signings the club's made," chief executive Steve Gill told BBC Radio Leeds.
"Castleford is where he has always wanted to coach and hopefully he'll finish his career with us.
"He is a very hands-on and honest coach, and I think the players respect that side of it."
