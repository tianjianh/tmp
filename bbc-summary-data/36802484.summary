A spokesman confirmed that the singer's girlfriend, 29-year-old American ballerina Melanie Hamrick, is pregnant.
Sir Mick, 72, already has seven children whose ages range from 17 to 45 and he became a great-grandfather last year.
The news comes two months after fellow Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood became a father again aged 68, after his wife Sally Humphreys had twin girls.
Sir Mick began dating Hamrick after the suicide of L'Wren Scott in 2014, his partner of 13 years.
The music star had his other children with Marsha Hunt, Bianca Jagger, Jerry Hall and Luciana Gimenez Morad.
He has five grandchildren and became a great-grandfather in May 2014 when his granddaughter Assisi, daughter of Jade Jagger, gave birth to a baby girl.
The Rolling Stones have confirmed they are working on a new, blues-inspired album for release this year.
