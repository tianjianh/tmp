The accident happened shortly before 22:00 GMT on the New Lodge Road on Tuesday.
The man's condition was initially described as serious, but police have said he is now critical but stable in the Royal Victoria Hospital.
The New Lodge Road was closed for a time following the incident but has since re-opened.
Police have said they are following a number of lines of inquiry.
Det Insp Jenna Fitzpatrick said: "Information suggests that the car had been seen being driven dangerously in the area in the time leading up to the collision.
"The car was abandoned a short distance away from the scene at Donore Court."
Another car was struck by the green Ford Focus as it left the scene.
