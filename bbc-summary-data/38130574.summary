Super League side Huddersfield Giants have re-signed Bradford Bulls second-rower Dale Ferguson on a two-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland international Ferguson made 21 Championship appearances in 2016 for Bradford, who were placed in administration earlier in November.
The 28-year-old played 59 games for Giants between 2011 and 2013 before joining the Bulls.
"He has a good skill set, is tough and will compete hard," head coach Rick Stone told the club website.
"Dale was signed to the club a while back and so I was keen to see how he would do in the Four Nations and I was suitably impressed.
"He showed a lot of class and toughness against world-class teams in that tournament."
