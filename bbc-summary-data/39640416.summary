The billionaire passed away peacefully at his home surrounded by his family on 10 April at the age of 89.
The private funeral at Glasgow Cathedral was also attended by representatives from the motoring industry.
The tycoon opened his first showroom in 1954 in Glasgow, and he was recognised for services to the motor industry when he was knighted by the Queen in 2004.
He was confirmed as Britain's first billionaire car dealer in the Sunday Times Rich List in 2016.
Sir Arnold's family said after he died: "He was a beloved husband, father, grandfather and a great friend and employer to many.
"He was an inspiration and the family will continue to carry on his vision. He will be greatly missed."
Sir Arnold built up 200 dealerships across the UK.
A statement from the firm said: "A truly inspirational business leader, Sir Arnold's work ethic and strong family values will continue to inspire all those who work for the group."
