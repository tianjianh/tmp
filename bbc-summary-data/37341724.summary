"We are very confident in them and we are excited that we have our 11 players now and we can move on," said Love III.
"This was a tough decision and we have another tough decision in two weeks."
Love III, who skippered the US when they lost to Europe in 2012, names the final member of his 12-man team on 25 September.
This year's Ryder Cup will take place at Hazeltine National in Minnesota from 30 September to 2 October.
Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Jimmy Walker, Brooks Koepka, Brandt Snedeker and Zach Johnson had already qualified automatically for the US team, which has lost the last three contests.
Two-time Masters champion and world number seven Bubba Watson is among the players in contention for the final wildcard spot.
US wildcard picks:
European captain Darren Clarke has named Lee Westwood, Martin Kaymer and rookie Thomas Pieters as his three wildcards.
