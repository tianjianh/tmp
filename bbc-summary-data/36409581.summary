Injured Wales flanker Dan Lydiate ruled out of New Zealand tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales flanker Dan Lydiate has been ruled out of the tour of New Zealand after injuring his shoulder in Sunday's defeat against England.

He has been replaced in the Welsh squad by Cardiff Blues' uncapped 23-year-old open-side Ellis Jenkins.
Wales play the first of three Tests against the world champion All Blacks on 11 June.
"It's hard for Dan because his tour is already over," said Wales head coach Warren Gatland.
Lydiate, who was captaining Wales in the absence of Sam Warburton, was taken off the field during the first half of the 27-13 defeat at Twickenham.
The 28-year-old also filled in for Warburton at open-side flanker, with Ross Moriarty taking Lydiate's place at six.
Jenkins' call-up means there is now natural open-side cover for his regional team-mate Warburton in the Wales squad.
The two have played together for the Blues this season, with Jenkins often wearing seven and Warburton switching to the blind-side.
The other back-rowers in the Wales squad to face New Zealand are Taulupe Faletau, Ross Moriarty, James King and Josh Turnbull.
