Emerging Australian artist Christian Thompson forges new path

Australian artist Christian Thompson says education and a mixed heritage enable him to slide between cultures.

In his video, Silence is Golden, Aboriginal artist Christian Thompson dances in slow motion against a jet-black background.
Thompson isn't performing a traditional Australian dance; he is Morris dancing.
While he was studying in Oxford in 2010, Thompson - one of the first of two Aboriginal Australians to attend the University of Oxford - caught his first sight of the English folk dance at an annual May Day celebration.
"I was on the way to the President's Collections in a gown, suit, polished shoes and bow tie," recalls Thompson, referring to the university's tradition of meeting the head of a college at the end of term for a discussion.
"The sun was just coming over the horizon - and I saw the Morris dancers coming towards me.
"It was the most surreal, cryptic, strange collision, of these two very old English cultural traditions," he told the BBC.
Thompson spent six months learning the "Old Tom of Oxford" - a jig practised in the village of Bampton in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds where his mother's family originally came from.
For the child of a mixed marriage - Thompson's father is an Aboriginal Bidjara man from Barcaldine in Queensland while his mother is of British convict and free settler descent - Morris dancing provided a route into his mother's heritage.
In his work, which ranges from the mediums of sculpture, photography and video, Thompson examines changing mores and cultural identities, and rebuts stereotypes.
Galleries and art collectors have taken note.
This year Thompson finished his PhD, which looked at the repatriation to Australia of historic Indigenous photographs from Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum.
He has now moved to London and his work has been exhibited in London's Royal Academy, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
In January, Oxford's Trinity College took down the historic paintings in its ornate dining room for the first time in over four centuries to display a survey of Thompson's work.
Thompson, who is also collected by the likes of Australian actress Cate Blanchett, was one of 12 artists mentored this year in Sydney by celebrated performance artist Marina Abramovic.
Born in 1978, Thompson battled racism and prejudice growing up in small towns around Australia where the family moved thanks to his father's career in the military.
The artist still remembers the day Australian Aboriginal activist and public servant Charlie Perkins visited his school in rural Queensland.
"It was a very backwater town - there was no real sense that there was anywhere else outside of that racially divided place," Thompson remembers.
Perkins provided "a glimmer of hope" to the then 13-year-old.
As the first Aboriginal man in Australia to graduate from university, Perkins, who died in 2000, proved it was possible for Indigenous people to succeed in white society.
"He had a very strong powerful voice," says Thompson.
Life came full circle when in 2010 Thompson became one of two inaugural recipients of the Charlie Perkins Scholarship for postgraduates.
He says: "[Perkins] was opening doors for me psychologically back then by saying there's a world outside of this town.
"Again, he altered my life all these years after."
Education "emancipated" Thompson but the artist also learnt to be "thick-skinned" enough to ignore what he says is the "deeply entrenched racism that takes its toll on most Aboriginal people's sense of who they are".
He says his mixed heritage - and his on-the-go childhood - has allowed him to slip into different cultural contexts, including Oxford and the art world.
"That in-betweeness or grey area is where I feel comfortable artistically because that to me is where I find interesting things," Thompson says.
Every summer the family of four boys would return to the arid red desert of Barcaldine.
This landscape is expressed in Thompson's 2010 photographic series Australian Graffiti, in which the artist wears elaborate headdresses made of indigenous flora and fauna and juxtaposes them with camp modern clothes.
Thompson remembers his grandmother sending him into the outback to find the green, pink, and lavender desert flowers in bloom; they became "a powerful symbol" of his childhood.
For the artist, though, it is the impact of his 2012 series "We Bury Our Own" that is most rewarding.
Produced in response to the Pitt Rivers Museum's historic photographic collection from Australia, the eight self-portraits include "Down Under World".
In the piece, Thompson is dressed in traditional Oxford garb with a crown of gemstones adorning his long straight black hair.
Now Thompson says he is regularly contacted by academics and artists who want to use "We Bury Our Own" for research.
"It was very emotional for me," says the artist, who, like Perkins before him, wants to open up new conversations and forge new pathways.
"It is like the biggest exhale of breath you can have."
