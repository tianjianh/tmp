[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jhon Cordoba shot past Manuel Neuer to give the hosts a surprise early lead before Robert Lewandowski equalised after being set up by Robben.
Robben headed home from Thomas Muller's cross to give Bayern the lead before a Lewandowski free-kick made it 3-1.
Bayern move above RB Leipzig on goal difference.
Both teams are on 30 points, but Bayern have played one game more.
Leipzig will re-establish a three-point lead if they beat eighth-placed Schalke at home on Saturday (17:30 GMT).
Champions Bayern had 10 shots in the opening 45 minutes against Mainz, and scored with two of their four attempts on goal.
