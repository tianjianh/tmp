Prince death: Authorities release Paisley Park emergency call log

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emergency calls were made from Prince's Paisley Park complex 46 times in the past five years, it has been revealed.

A log released by Minnesota authorities showed the 911 calls related to everything from medical emergencies to false fire alarms.
It included one call in 2011 in which an unidentified woman said she was concerned about Prince's cocaine use, but no police action was taken.
Prince's representatives have not commented on the claims.
The unnamed woman, from Germany, claimed Prince told her a year earlier that he had an uncontrollable cocaine habit and that she should advise the authorities.
It is unclear whether the woman personally knew Prince.
Other calls included reports about a woman having an allergic reaction, a fire alarm triggered by a fog machine, a trespasser banging a drum and a suspicious vehicle, which the responding officer "checked and it was Prince", according to the log.
There were also claims that Prince has at least one living son, although Prince has no known surviving children.
On the day Prince died, one woman called saying she had a 17-year-old son with Prince, and wanted him to attend the funeral.
Prince was found unresponsive in a lift at his Paisley Park complex -  home to recording studios, a nightclub, rehearsal space, offices, and the singer's private residence - on 21 April.
A post-mortem examination last month discounted suicide, but a medical examiner said full results could take several weeks.
Investigators are looking into whether Prince died from an overdose and if a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before his death.
They are also trying to establish whether a doctor was on the singer's plane when it made an emergency landing less than a week before he died.
The musician was found unconscious on the plane after it stopped in Moline, Illinois, on 15 April, and detectives investigating his death have asked to see fire and ambulance records related to the emergency landing.
