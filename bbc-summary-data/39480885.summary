[SN]TITLE[SN]
Real Madrid 1-1 Atletico Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antoine Griezmann scored a late equaliser in the Madrid derby as Atletico held La Liga leaders Real.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Real took a deserved lead when Pepe, who later went off injured with broken ribs, headed home Toni Kroos' free-kick.
The European champions continued to dominate but without really testing keeper Jan Oblak on too many occasions.
And Griezmann levelled for third-placed Atletico when he slid home Angel Correa's through ball.
Real are three points clear at the top of La Liga, with a game in hand on Barcelona, after Barca's 2-0 defeat at Malaga later on Saturday.
On the balance of play, Real should have won the derby - with Karim Benzema forcing a good first-half save from Oblak and defender Stefan Savic brilliantly clearing Cristiano Ronaldo's shot off the line.
Defender Pepe injured himself after a collision with team-mate Kroos and is now likely to miss Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at Bayern Munich.
