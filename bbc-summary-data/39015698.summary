Skiing trip ends school's rugby cup challenge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belfast Royal Academy have been awarded a walkover to the semi-finals of the Schools' Cup after opponents Friends' were unable to field a team.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lisburn school wanted competition organisers to put back the last four clash with BRA because 17 of their squad were on a skiing trip in Austria.
But the plea was rejected and Friends were forced to admit they could not field a team for Saturday's match.
BRA play Methody in the last four while RBAI will face Ballymena Academy.
The RBAI v Ballymena game is on Monday 27 at the Kingspan Stadium with the second semi-final the following day.
