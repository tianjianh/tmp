[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Non-league Gloucester City have agreed a deal to remain at Cheltenham Town's Whaddon Road ground for next season.

The Conference North side's Meadow Park ground was destroyed by flood water in the summer of 2007.
They have been based in Cheltenham since 2010, having previously shared with Forest Green and Cirencester.
Gloucester City have not played a competitive game at their own home since 28 April 2007, when they beat Clevedon Town 3-1 at Meadow Park.
The Tigers are in the process of submitting a planning application to Gloucester City Council to rebuild their stadium on its original site.
"I am delighted to have agreed an extension for a further season," said Cheltenham chairman Paul Baker.
"It makes very good business sense for the club to maximise its assets in this way and despite the additional wear and tear the extra revenue generated is very welcome indeed.
"The relationship between the two clubs has never been better and I am pleased that we have been able to work together for our mutual benefit."
