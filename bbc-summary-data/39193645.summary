Ricardo Hunter was one of around 400 guests at the house party in Headley, near Epsom, Surrey, in July.
The 34-year-old was shot dead with a 9mm bullet and a woman was injured.
Surrey Police has released a video of Mr Hunter arriving at the party at around 01:40 BST on 25 July as part of a  renewed appeal, aired on Crimewatch on Monday.
A spokeswoman for the force said: "We are hoping the public can help us identify who the people are with him.
"There is a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information which leads directly to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for Ricardo's murder. "
Shot from an internal camera of a nearby address, police believe the first man to enter on screen is Mr Hunter, wearing shorts.
In August images of Mr Hunter were released of him in a food shop, a few days before his body was found at the mansion.
Three people have been arrested over his death.
A 28-year-old man held on suspicion of murder has been re-bailed, pending further enquiries, until 10 May .
A 31-year-old woman and a man, 38, who were also arrested have been advised that they no longer need to answer bail while the investigation continues.
