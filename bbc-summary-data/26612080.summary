Campaign over gender-specific books gains support

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new campaign asking publishers to stop labelling books for boys or girls has been backed by a number of leading authors, as well as bookseller Waterstones.

Let Books Be Books, launched earlier this month, is supported by former children's laureate Anne Fine and current laureate Malorie Blackman.
At the weekend, The Independent on Sunday announced it would no longer review books marketed to exclude either sex.
Other backing comes from poet laureate Carol-Ann Duffy, and His Dark Materials author Philip Pullman.
"These books exist, but we think there are better ways of choosing for children than basing it on whether they are a boy or a girl," said Jon Howells, a spokesman for Waterstones.
Howells said that Waterstones branches were asked to avoid displays which separated out books for boys or girls.
"When they do pop up we find out out about them very quickly because people tell us or will post a picture a Twitter. We give the shop a ring and gently remind them."
He added: "We're aware that people do feel very strongly about grouping these books together for one gender only."
Let Books Be Books, part of the Let Toys Be Toys campaign, asks children's publishers to take the "boys" and "girls" labels off books and "allow children to choose freely what kinds of stories and activity books interest them".
The parent-led campaign grew out of a thread on parenting site Mumsnet.
A Let Books Be Books online petition launched on 5 March had 3,560 signatures on Monday.
Its website says: "Just like labelling toys 'for girls' or 'for boys' these books send out very limiting messages to children about what kinds of things are appropriate for girls or for boys.
"Blue covers, with themes of action and adventure, robots, space, trucks and pirates contrast with a riot of pink sparkles, fairies, princesses, flowers and butterflies. But real children's interests are a lot more diverse, and more interesting, than that."
Last week Parragon Books, whose titles include 1000 Girly stickers and 365 Stories and Rhymes for Boys, said it had no plans for future gender-focused books.
It tweeted: "Feedback on gender-specific titles is important to us. We have no plans to create new titles referring to boy/girl in the UK."
Publisher Usborne also made a similar announcement, saying in The Guardian that a plan to "discontinue publication of titles such as these was decided some time ago".
However, children's publisher Buster Books has defended selling gender-specific titles such as The Beautiful Girls' Colouring Book and The Brilliant Boys' Colouring Book.
"It's a fact of life how a very large percentage of people shop when buying for kids, do it by sex. We know for a fact that when they are shopping on Amazon, they quite often type in 'books for boys' and 'books for girls," its owner Michael O'Mara told The Independent.
"All boys don't like one thing and all girls the other, but the fact is lots of boys like the same things and lots of girls like the same things. We can't ignore the fact that they are definitely different."
Katy Guest, literary editor of The Independent on Sunday, announced in the latest edition that the newspaper would not be reviewing any book explicitly aimed at just girls, or just boys.
"Any Girls' Book of Boring Princesses that crosses my desk will go straight into the recycling pile along with every Great Big Book of Snot for Boys," she wrote.
"If you are a publisher with enough faith in your new book that you think it will appeal to all children, we'll be very happy to hear from you. But the next Harry Potter or Katniss Everdeen will not come in glittery pink covers. So we'd thank you not to send us such books at all."
Mr Howells of Waterstones said: "The campaign is tapping into something that's been there for quite a long time."
