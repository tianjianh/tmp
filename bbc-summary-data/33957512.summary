Fascist anthem gaffe as Spain's Marin wins badminton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Badminton World Federation (BWF) has apologised after the old fascist-era Spanish national anthem was played for gold medallist Carolina Marin at the world championships in Indonesia.

Marin successfully defended her world title in Jakarta on Sunday against India's Saina Nehwal.
But the version of Spain's Royal March played at the medal ceremony was the one dating back to Gen Francisco Franco's far-right dictatorship.
Spain got rid of the words in 1978.
Since the death of Franco the Royal March has been played without words - and the mistake in Jakarta clearly amused Marin as she stood on the podium. A video clip on YouTube showed her reaction.
The words were written by poet Jose Maria Peman in 1928 and were adopted by Franco's nationalists in 1939 after their victory over left-wing forces in the Spanish Civil War.
"An older version of the anthem was played during the Women's Singles medal ceremony following Marin's retention of the title which she won a year ago," the BWF said in a statement.
"The Badminton World Federation and the hosts, the Indonesia Badminton Association, sincerely regret this unfortunate mistake."
The old anthem includes the words: "Glory to the Fatherland that knew how to follow, over the blue of the sea the path of the sun."
