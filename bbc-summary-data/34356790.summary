The sirens were sounded during a visit by police community support officers (PCSOs) to Haydonleigh Primary School in Swindon.
Becky Muckleston, from the school, said staff consensus was "it's a woo-woo" but pupils thought it was a "nee-nah".
PCSOs admitted they sounded the sirens "quite a bit" and apologised to anyone in the area for the disturbance.
The debate arose during a "People Who Help Us" session with three classes from the school's reception year.
According to PCSO Emma Harryman, it was during a tour of her police fleet car that the children began debating "nee-nah or woo-woo".
"That's why we ended up setting off the sirens quite a bit," she admitted.
According to the PCSO, the school's headmistress had "officially put it out there" that it was actually a wah-wah.
But following a vote at the school earlier, it was announced that "woo-woo" was the winner by 60 votes to 28.
Ms Muckleston, said the result was surprising as the children had been "leaning more towards the nee-nah".
"Nee-nah is a bit of a classic but when it came to it they decided woo-woo was the way to go," she said.
"I would say it's probably a surprise - although I think it's more of a wah-wah myself."
North Swindon Police has apologised to residents in the Haydonleigh area for any disturbance on Wednesday morning.
