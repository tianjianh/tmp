A taxi driver who was found to be twice the drink-drive limit after being seen weaving down a road has been banned from driving.

Raziq Hussain's Hackney cab was stopped after driving on the wrong side of Oldham Road in Manchester in December.
The 32-year-old, of Eastbourne Street, Oldham, registered double the legal limit when he was breathalysed.
Manchester magistrates heard he had been taking fares. He was fined Â£110 and banned from driving for 16 months.
Greater Manchester Police said Hussain was first seen cutting a corner on Whitley Road in Collyhurst in the early hours of 19 December.
After being stopped, he registered 71mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath when breathalysed at the roadside, double the legal limit of 35mg.
He told officers he had not drunk alcohol since he started work at 18:00 GMT and had taken several fares that night.
Speaking after sentencing, Sgt Matt Bailey-Smith said Hussain's profession was the "significant aggravating factor" in his case.
"His actions were reckless and risked the safety and welfare of every fare he took that evening as well as innocent motorists and pedestrians," he said.
Along with his ban and fine for driving with excess alcohol, Hussain was also ordered to pay costs of Â£85 and a victim surcharge of Â£20.
