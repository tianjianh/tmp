[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Long-serving midfielder James Morrison says the "vision" of chairman Jeremy Peace was the main reason he signed a new contract at West Brom.

Scotland international Morrison, 30, was due to be a free agent on 1 July but has agreed a new initial two-year deal at the Premier League club.
"I thought long and hard and spoke to the chairman many times," Morrison told BBC WM.
"It helped make my mind up and it was a big decision but I'm delighted."
Darlington-born Morrison's new contract - which has an option for a further twelve months - will take his time with Baggies to more than a decade, having joined from Middlesbrough in August 2007.
Having missed the last three months of last season though injury, Morrison admits he thought hard about which direction his future was going to take.
"I didn't like how it ended last season, just walking round the pitch and then out the door - I've worked too hard over the last nine years to give it away like that," he said.
"I've got an opportunity make it a bit more positive and I'm motivated to do that.
"The chairman's said he's planning to bring more players in and try to kick on up the league and I bought into his vision and his plans and I want to be part of that."
