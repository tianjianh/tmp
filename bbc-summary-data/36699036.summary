The warehouse is on the Wakefield 41 Industrial Estate, close to Junction 41 of the M1, West Yorkshire Police said.
Kenmore Road, Wakefield, is closed in both directions as fire crews tackle the flames.
A further 50 firefighters are also tackling a second West Yorkshire blaze at an industrial site near Halifax.
Footage of the Wakefield fire has been captured by eyewitness Graham Moore.
Around 80% of the  86,000 sq ft (8,000 Sq m) building is on fire, the fire service said.
Debris is falling around half-a-mile from the site, according to some reports on Twitter.
