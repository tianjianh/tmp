Will Burkina Faso election be peaceful?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burkina Faso holds crucial general elections on 29 November after a turbulent year under a transitional government that stepped in to restore order following a popular uprising in October 2014.

The election was due this year anyway. Former President Blaise Compaore's plans to serve another five-year term sparked a popular uprising.  He had been in power for 27 years.
It has been a bumpy road to the current elections, and Mr Compaore's supporters themselves staged a short-lived coup on 17 September. The elite Presidential Security Guard were behind the attempt to scuttle the transition. They were disbanded after the coup failed.
Crisis-weary citizens hope that democratic rule will be restored when they vote for members of parliament and a new president. But some of the practices surrounding the vote are already being called into question, because the transitional government has barred members of the former ruling party the Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP) from contesting the presidency.
Their exclusion has deepened political divisions, and could undermine the credibility of the elections and weaken confidence in any future government. CDP politicians have threatened to hold protest rallies, but most commentators say widespread violence is unlikely .
The electoral commission has promised "reliable and transparent elections, with results accepted by all".
There have been isolated reports of fake voter cards being mass-produced at a local internet cafe in the capital, Ouagadougou, but the polls are widely expected to be peaceful. There have been no major incidents during the campaign period.
Burkina Faso's Muslims coexist peacefully with Christians and other religious groups.  But it is vulnerable to the extremist violence from other West African Islamists groups in neighbouring countries. Malian militant group Ansar Dine has threatened to attack the country.
Suspected Islamists from Nigeria's Boko Haram militant group have also attacked Christians at a Burkinabe police camp near the border with Mali. In November, the authorities introduced security measures to address the jihadist threat.
The president is elected by popular vote and, if no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round, a second round is held.
The run-off, which must be held 15 days after the results of the first round have been declared, is won by a simple majority. A total of 127 seats are up for grabs in the parliamentary election.
Fourteen people - including two women and four independent candidates - are vying for the presidency.
Local media reports suggest that Zephirin Diabre and Roch Marc Christian Kabore are the front-runners. Mr Diabre was once a minister of finance before he fell out with Mr Compaore in 2010.
Mr Kabore served as prime minister and chairman of the CDP before leaving the party in 2014, after opposing plans to extend Mr Compaore's rule.
The veteran opposition politician and former presidential candidate Benewende Sankara comes a distant third, despite enjoying the support of the wife of slain military leader, Thomas Sankara.
He is not related to the late leader, who remains an iconic figure in the history of Burkina Faso.
Thomas Sankara renamed the country from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (land of honest men) in an attempt to set a new standard of governance.
He adapted radical left-wing polices, and was killed in a coup led by Mr Compaore, who went on to introduce multi-party politics.
