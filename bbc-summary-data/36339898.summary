Back in 2014, a team of Swedish adventurers were racing in the Amazon when they took pity on a stray and gave him a meatball to eat.
The dog was so grateful, he followed them - swimming through rivers and wading through mud.
He stuck with them right to the finish line. The team named him Arthur, and took him home to Sweden.
