The comic tweeted the vehicle was "nicked" from outside the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on Tuesday.
The Mercedes Sprinter van was stolen from the car park on Hope Street at about 15:00 GMT, Merseyside Police said.
Officers believe the keys were stolen from an office.
The comic's manager said two laptops were also taken.
The van contained crew suitcases and Bill Bailey tour merchandise.
A spokesperson for the performer said the show went on "regardless of the chaos this has caused to our tour", adding it had "sadly tainted our visit to the good city of Liverpool".
