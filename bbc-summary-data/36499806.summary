English Football League clubs approve 'Rooney Rule' proposals for academies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
English Football League clubs have approved proposals to introduce a 'Rooney Rule' for academy jobs in a bid to increase the number of black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches.

Clubs must now include at least one suitably qualified BME candidate on the interview shortlist if such an application is received.
In addition, 10 clubs have voluntarily extended these to first-team roles.
There are currently just three BME managers among the 72 EFL clubs.
They are Brighton's Chris Hughton, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink of QPR and Keith Curle, boss of League Two side Carlisle United.
Departing EFL chairman Greg Clarke cited the NFL's Rooney Rule as an inspiration behind the plans.
"It is absolutely essential that EFL clubs continue to reflect the communities in which they are based," he said.
"It is clear to us that we currently have an under-representation of BME managers and coaches at club level and it is therefore the right time to take proportionate action to ensure the best talent, from all backgrounds, is given a fair opportunity to enter and progress through the system.
"I believe this is an important moment for sport in this country and I'm very proud that it is our clubs that are leading the way. They have done the right thing and deserve considerable credit."
The Rooney Rule requires NFL teams to interview at least one black or ethnic minority candidate for head coaching and senior football operation opportunities that become available.
Ten of the 72 clubs have volunteered to pilot a similar scheme in their first-team recruitment process during 2016-17.
Those teams are: Birmingham City, Fulham, Huddersfield Town and Wolves, Chesterfield, Coventry City, Millwall, Peterborough United, Accrington Stanley and Carlisle United.
