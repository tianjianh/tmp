[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Fifa vice president Alfredo Hawit has pleaded guilty to four conspiracy counts linked to a bribery scandal in football's governing body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
New York prosecutors said Hawit took bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars linked to the sale of marketing rights to tournaments in Latin America.
Each count could lead to up to 20 years in jail. He is also due to forfeit $950,000 (Â£668,000).
Hawit's plea deal is part of a case involving more than 40 people.
The 64-year-old admitted in court that he conspired with others to arrange marketing rights for companies in Florida and Argentina, in exchange for cash paid into bank accounts administered by him and his family in Panama and Honduras.
Some Fifa officials have taken hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal payments over the last 25 years, prosecutors said.
The Honduran was interim president of the North and Central American and Caribbean soccer governing body, Concacaf, from last May until his 3 December arrest in Switzerland. He was extradited from that country earlier this year.
Hawit was released on $1m bail by the New York court. He and his lawyer refused to comment outside court.
