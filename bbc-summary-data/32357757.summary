Condor Ferries cancels sailings due to wind conditions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High winds have forced the cancellation of Condor Liberation's sailings between the UK and the Channel Islands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The high winds exceed berthing limits in Channel Island ports. Condor Rapide has rescheduled services for those attending the rugby Junior Siam Cup.
Condor Ferries said affected passengers were being contacted.
The Condor Liberation struck the quayside at St Peter Port in windy conditions last month.
Capt Fran Collins, from Condor Ferries, said: "Unfortunately, the weather has disrupted sailings to the Channel Islands but I'm pleased to say that we have rerouted Condor Rapide to maintain capacity for those competing and watching the Junior Siam Cup."
The new Â£50m ferry serving Poole from the Channel Islands was disrupted earlier this month due to a fault with one of its engines.
The cancelled services are:
03:00 BST Poole to Guernsey
06:30 BST Guernsey to Jersey
08:30 BST Jersey to Guernsey
10:00 BST Guernsey to Poole
14:00 BST Poole to Guernsey
17:30 BST Guernsey to Jersey
19:30 BST Jersey to Guernsey
21:00 BST Guernsey to Poole
