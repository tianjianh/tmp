Ilkeston FC have banned striker Gary Ricketts for two weeks and fined him two weeks' wages after the abandoned pre-season game with Mansfield Town.

The Stags called the game off when John Thompson had his nose broken and become the third player to require hospital treatment after challenges by Ricketts.
Ricketts has been given a final written warning about his conduct.
"We're satisfied Gary is genuine in his remorse and we will stand by him," said chairman Dave Mantle.
"However, that certainly does not mean that we condone any action that causes another player to be injured.
"This is not a decision that we have taken lightly. I have taken advice from numerous people - those involved within football as well as our professional advisors - and we believe we have taken the right course of action."
The ban came into effect on 4 August, resulting in Ricketts missing the Northern Premier Division One South club's first two league games of the season.
Mansfield recently stated their intention to sue Ilkeston for loss of earnings following the friendly match on 3 August.
