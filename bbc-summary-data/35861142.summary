Huddersfield Giants have signed half-back Ryan Brierley from Championship side Leigh Centurions on a four-and-a-half-year contract.

The 24-year-old won back-to-back Championship titles with Leigh after joining them from Castleford in 2012 and scored 133 tries in 125 games.
The Giants had two bids for Brierley turned down in February.
"It is great to finally have my future sorted after a difficult few weeks," he told the club website.
"To be honest the last few weeks have probably been the toughest time of my career, it has not been a nice time, just not knowing where you are going to be for the rest of the season is daunting, especially because I have a young family now.
"I know there is no guarantee I am going to play, I have just got to work hard and earn a spot in the right way and that is by training hard and getting the respect of my peers and the management team."
