NI Assembly election: Negotiations over programme for government due to begin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Negotiations over a programme for government for the new Northern Ireland Executive are expected to begin at Stormont on Monday.

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin remain the two biggest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly after Thursday's election.
Smaller parties say they will base decisions on whether or not to go into opposition on the outcome of the talks.
Parties have been given two weeks to agree a programme for government.
Once that has been agreed, an executive will then be formed.
The DUP maintained its total of 38 seats that it held in the last assembly, while Sinn Féin lost one and now holds 28.
The Ulster Unionists have 16 seats, the SDLP lost two and now has 12 and the Alliance Party has eight.
Twenty-nine of the 108 MLAs are new to the assembly, including two from the People Before Profit Alliance, while the Green Party added a second seat to the one it previously held.
Some parties have said they are concerned that the DUP and Sinn Féin have already created a draft document setting out what they hope to achieve.
The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) have said they will wait to see what is included within the programme for government before making a decision to either enter government or opposition.
Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness said the UUP and the SDLP had spent the last assembly term "chipping away almost at every decision the executive took".
"I want all of the parties to work together to be included, but you can't do that if parties are not prepared to do it," he said.
"What we have tried to do is put together a programme for government that everybody can agree with.
"It is going to be incumbent upon everybody to try to conclude that as soon as possible, appoint the ministers and get down to work as quickly as possible."
DUP leader Arlene Foster said that she was "looking forward" to the negotiations.
"What I need to do now is bring forward my plan for the negotiations and to start getting things done for the country," she said.
"That's what I'm very focused on now in the next week."
Mike Nesbitt, the UUP leader, said it was "partly the case" that any involvement in the executive from his party would depend on a briefing from the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland on the status or paramilitary groups.
He added that he wanted to see if the programme for government would "offer that joined-up approach to the big issues that are blighting our society" before deciding on the UUP's position.
"Equally importantly, we [will need to] sense around the table a will among the parties who are going to be in government can work together to deliver it.
"If it is going to be a Sinn Féin-DUP carve-up as it was at the end of the last mandate, then that is not attractive to me."
SDLP MLA Alex Attwood said the negotiations would determine whether his party would go into government or opposition.
"We'll go in showing our good authority, we'll go in making proposals that work in the interests of people across Northern Ireland," he said.
"And if the process has been good and there are stronger outcomes than what the DUP and Sinn Féin have done in the past, then we will make a call," he added.
The Alliance Party leader David Ford said the previous executive had not worked together "in the sort of way you would expect of a coherent cabinet".
He added that his party would have to decide on any involvement in the new executive whether there was a "worthwhile" programme for government.
"What's absolutely clear for us is we did not see the progress even towards the stated aim of the last programme for government - growing the economy - that we should have seen," he said.
