"I felt that we had some really good periods in the game. I can't remember a game for a while where we've had so much good possession breaking into their final third.
"We had ample opportunities and got into some great areas, but of course if you're not able to get that second goal, it's always going to put pressure on.
"Until we learn to kill off games, we're always going to make life difficult for ourselves."
