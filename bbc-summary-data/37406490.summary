[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 1-2 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jermaine Easter forced a late own goal as Bristol Rovers came from behind to beat Swindon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers scored two goals in two minutes to end their run of four consecutive draws, lifting themselves out of the bottom four in League One.
Swindon's Lloyd Jones, who missed the defeat to Bury due to suspension, bundled in a Yaser Kasim corner to give his side the early lead.
Rovers went in search of an equaliser and Chris Lines' free-kick was tipped on to the bar by goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux.
Midfielder Ollie Clarke thought he had levelled the scores for his team in the second half, but he was denied by the post after his shot had the Swindon goalkeeper beaten.
Rovers were awarded a penalty in the closing 10 minutes after Raphael Rossi Branco fouled Easter and Matty Taylor made no mistake from the spot to score his sixth goal of the season.
Clumsy defending from Swindon saw Branco turn Easter's cross into the back of the net for the winner moments later.
