The Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) has told Newsbeat they hope to work with universities to spread the message: "Don't drink and drown."
It comes after a number of students died after falling from river banks on their way home from a night out.
RLSS UK says their national statistics suggest that in a quarter of all drowning incidents the victim has alcohol in their system.
The charity, which gives education and training to help people stay safe around water, says 55 young people aged 15-to-24 drowned in 2014.
Lee Heard, one of the charity's managers, advises people to think ahead.
"Make sure you plan your route so it's away from the water. People are stumbling and slipping because they're under the influence of alcohol and they're not able to stop themselves falling in.
"Don't go near the water, plan ahead and make sure you have people with you so if you do fall in, there's someone to raise the alarm."
The charity supports the idea of building fences in known danger spots to limit access to the water - and also has spent time training bouncers working at waterside bars so that they know what to do in an emergency.
This week plans were announced in Durham to start breathalysing drinkers at pubs and bars to make the riverside safer. Critics said it was a "naÃ¯ve attempt to change student drinking culture".
But RLSS UK says it's vital to get this important safety message out there.
"We want to make people aware of the dangers of alcohol. When they're under the influence they have slow reactions. It affects their swimming ability and even their ability to make decisions," says Lee Heard.
The body of law student Euan Coulthard was discovered in the River Wear in Durham in January.
The 19-year-old from Leicestershire had gone missing after a night out. His family described him as a "friendly, out-going and fun-loving young man who had a very bright future ahead of him".
Luke Pearce, 19, was reported missing in May 2014 after a night out in Durham.
The student, originally from London, was last seen walking along the river bank. His body was found in the River Wear just over a week later.
In March last year the body of 22-year-old Ben Clarkson was found in the River Foss in York.
He'd last been seen outside a nightclub three weeks earlier. His partner, Rachel Peatfield, said: "I am truly heartbroken that I have lost the love of my life."
Twenty-year-old Megan Roberts disappeared during a night out drinking with friends in York in January 2014.
Her body was found in the River Ouse in March. It's feared she'd been separated from friends on a night out and fallen into the river while under the influence of alcohol.
Durham University student Sopefoluwa 'Sope' Peters went missing in October 2013. His body was found two months later in the River Wear.
The second-year economics student was last seen outside Klute bar near Elvet Bridge at about midnight.
Three people drowned along a stretch of the River Avon in Bath in 2014, including students Sam Amin and James Bubear. Both had been on their way home from a night out.  Signs had already been put up on the towpath warning drinkers to extra take care.
In 2010, 20-year-old student Richard Straight drowned in the sea after being asked to leave a nightclub in Portsmouth for being drunk.
