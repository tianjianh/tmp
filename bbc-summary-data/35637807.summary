[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Championship: Livingston 0-0 Greenock Morton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morton's bid to claim a Championship play-off place was dented after they were held to a 0-0 draw at Livingston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Declan McManus' powerful shot was saved low to his right by Livi keeper Marc McCallum after 17 minutes.
Livingston carved out an opening only for Jordan White to fire over from eight yards, while Daniel Mullen shot wide from the edge of the box.
Morton were denied a second-half penalty when Denny Johnstone appeared to be pulled back in the box.
The visitors then had a flurry of shots on the Livingston goal, McCallum finally tipping Bobby Barr's shot over as Morton - who remain fifth, four points off the play-off places - were forced to settle for a draw.
