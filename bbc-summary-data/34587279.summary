Mr Odom will continue his recovery in Los Angeles and is making "miraculous" progress, even taking a few steps, according to a family statement.
His estranged wife Khloe Kardashian, his father and two of his children are with the former Lakers star.
Police are conducting tests to establish what happened.
Odom, who married reality television star Kardashian in 2009, has long struggled with addiction.
He told brothel employees he had taken cocaine before arriving, police said.
Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said that a worker at the brothel reported Odom was found unresponsive with blood coming from his nose and mouth.
US media had reported that although Ms Kardashian filed for divorce from Mr Odom in 2013, it had yet to be processed and she was making decisions about his medical care.
Odom won the NBA championship with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010 and was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011.
He last played in the NBA in 2013 with the Clippers.
