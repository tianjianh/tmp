Southern train drivers' strike High Court ruling due

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The High Court is due to rule later on whether the parent company of Southern rail can stop a planned train drivers' strike.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Aslef union has announced a three-day strike next week in a dispute over driver-only operated trains.
Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which has claimed all Southern services could be halted, argues the strike would breach customers' rights.
Meanwhile, the latest strike by RMT conductors has entered its third day.
Southern has said the High Court hearing, which started on Wednesday, is expected to reach a judgement at 14:30 GMT.
Aslef members have also launched an indefinite ban on overtime which, coupled with the RMT action over changes to the role of conductors, has led to about half of Southern's services being cancelled during the current three-day strike.
The long-running RMT dispute, which has seen several strikes throughout 2016, is set to continue in the run-up to Christmas.
