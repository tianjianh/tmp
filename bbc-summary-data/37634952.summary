[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A violent boyfriend whose abuse caused the death of his girlfriend has had his "unduly lenient" prison sentence extended by a third to 15 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Maling, 47, from Sigglesthorne, near Hull, was jailed for 10 years for the manslaughter of Amy Gough in June.
Miss Gough, 34, from Sandiacre, Derbyshire, died several days after suffering stomach injuries inflicted by Maling in March 2015.
The Appeal Court said his history of domestic violence should be reflected.

Maling, who watched the court hearing via video-link from prison, had inflicted serious injuries to Miss Gough "over a period of several years".
Last year, Miss Gough suffered serious abdominal injuries, which had been caused by "blunt force trauma".
Her heart failed and she died in hospital on 29 March 2015, several days after the attack.
At trial at Nottingham Crown Court, Maling had denied guilt, insisting Miss Gough's injuries resulted from an "accidental drunken fall".
Lawyers for the Attorney General argued there was "no mitigation whatever" for his crime.
Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Mr Justice King and Mr Justice Dove, said she had no doubt the original 10-year sentence was "too short".
"If a killing results from a campaign of domestic violence, that is a serious aggravating factor which must be properly reflected in the sentence imposed," Justice Hallett said.
The impact of Miss Gough's death had been devastating for her family, the court heard.
Her mother, Christine, had spoken of the void left by her daughter's loss - describing her as a "caring, beautiful and warm person".
Speaking after the hearing, the Attorney General said: "This was a one of many violent attacks the offender inflicted on the deceased over a number of years, and this attack lasted several days.
"I hope this increased sentence gives some comfort to the Ms Gough's family at this difficult time."
