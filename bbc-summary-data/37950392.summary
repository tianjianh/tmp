The Baltic Artists' Award will see a panel of four established artists pick four rising stars who are "deserving of an international platform".
The first four winners will each receive £25,000 to create new work and a £5,000 artist fee.
Their work will go on show at the Baltic from 30 June 2017.
Baltic director Sarah Munro said the prize would offer "a significant new biennial platform for nurturing emerging global talent".
She added: "The award does not impose any restrictions on age, media or nationality.
"Instead, Baltic's ambition is to offer all four nominated artists an unparalleled, step-change opportunity to make a significant new presentation with mentoring from some of the most exciting and experienced contemporary artists today."
The money for the prize is coming from the Baltic's commissioning and exhibition budget.
