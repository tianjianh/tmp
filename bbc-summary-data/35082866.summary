A burst pipe left about 3,000 properties in East Sussex with little or no water for several hours.

South East Water said engineers worked overnight to carry out repairs after the burst main was discovered in the early hours of Saturday.
Properties affected were in Wadhurst, Flimwell, Stonegate and Ticehurst.
Head of engineering Desmond Brown said engineers isolated the burst and moved water around the network to limit the impact on customers.
The pipe has since been repaired.
The company later said that while there were 3,000 properties in the affected area, it had received 150 phone calls from people without water.
Exact numbers would be confirmed after an investigation had been carried out, a spokeswoman added.
