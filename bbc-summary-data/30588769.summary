Developers are to press ahead with plans for a new £10m retail park in Fort William after getting the green light from planning authorities to include food outlets.

Morbaine has already signed up Aldi and Home Bargains as tenants for the North Road development.
It said it was also in talks with other retailers, including Marks and Spencer, to fill the other two available units.
Highland Council officials had recommended against a mixed-use park.
Cheshire-based Morbaine previously secured outline planning consent for some 55,000 sq ft of non-food retail use before seeking to expand the type of retailing allowed at the site.
The new proposals include plans to build a roundabout next to the site, along the A82.
Morbaine has said the development could lead to 150 new retail jobs after construction.
Morbaine director Alex Brodie said: "I would like to thank the local community in Fort William and the surrounding area who have been nothing but supportive and constructive over the years and we look forward to providing them with the additional retail options that they have been asking for."
He added: "We will keep the community updated on our progress and let them know more about when the retail park might be open and how local businesses can participate in the construction process."
