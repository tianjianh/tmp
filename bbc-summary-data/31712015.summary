'We've made it' Alt-J's response to Noel G's criticism

Alt-J have responded to being the latest victims of Noel Gallagher's sharp tongue.

Gus Unger-Hamilton told Newsbeat it's "a right of passage to get a pasting from him".
In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Gallagher said he was "no way a fan of Alt-J", despite buying their track Left Hand Free.
When he was asked why, he replied: "I don't know. One of them's got a moustache, and that's unacceptable."
Alt-J have taken it on the chin and rather than getting upset, are adding it to their list of achievements as a band.
"Well, I think I said that we'd know we had made it when we were slagged off by Noel Gallagher, so there you go," Gus laughed.
Gus is the one who has the facial hair that Noel finds so "unacceptable."
"I'm glad he likes the song, I'm sorry he doesn't like my moustache, but it is here to stay I'm afraid."
It might not be the end of the story though, as both acts have been announced as headliners for this year's Latitude Festival.
According to Gus, sharing the bill with Noel Gallagher hasn't taken the shine off their first UK headline slot.
"It's really amazing, headlining has such a weight to it, so to be on our second album and be doing that, it just feels incredible."
Latitude Festival has given Foals and Two Door Cinema Club their first headline slot in the past, which some might argue is risky but has so far paid off.
"It is all about getting your first headline slot, once you have done one you are sort of established as a headliner," Gus explained.
"It can be really difficult to cross that line into getting your first headline slot, Latitude are brilliant at giving bands a chance."
