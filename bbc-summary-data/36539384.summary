[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bateman, 22, was involved in an incident at a gym on 27 May, with his suspension set to run from that date.
The England second-row has not featured for Shaun Wane's side while an investigation took place.
"Disciplinary action needed to be taken and to be seen to have been taken," said chairman Ian Lenegan.
"John Bateman has expressed his full regret at the incident, as have other parties, and the club will be working hard with John to ensure that he learns properly from the experience and comes back stronger than ever.
"He will remain a Wigan player and return to training during the period."
Bateman signed a new deal with the Super League side last October but has been linked with a move to the NRL recently.
