[SN]TITLE[SN]
More than £300,000 for Leverburgh lifeboat station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lifeboat station on the Western Isles has been given £335,377 from the estate of a woman who lost relations in an accident at sea in 1900.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The late Mary MacAskill, from Edinburgh, requested that part of her estate be used to benefit the RNLI's work on the west coast of Scotland.
The legacy has gone to Leverburgh lifeboat station on Harris.
Ms MacAskill's grandfather Iain Bàn and grand-uncle Iain Òg died in a boat accident off the isles.
It is believed two of the men's nephews also died in the incident between Lochmaddy and Berneray.
Leverburgh lifeboat station was opened in 2012 following a growth of offshore fish farming and also leisure boating in the area.
Its crew has been raising money for a new fixed pontoon facility to provide safer access to the lifeboat.
Ms MacAskill died in September 2015.
