Donegal scored 12 points without reply in the first half against Cavan at Brewster Park and netted three goals after the break to win 3-17 to 0-13.
The game  at Celtic Park went to extra-time after a late levelling point by Armagh's Oisin O'Neill against Derry.
Danny Tallon landed eight points in the Oak Leaf county's 0-21 to 1-15 victory.
The semi-finals had been rearranged after being postponed a week earlier because of waterlogged pitches.
Derry built up a 0-7 to 0-4 lead at home to Armagh but the visitors produced the only goal at Celtic Park through Oisin O'Neill and were 1-6 to 0-8 up at the interval.
O'Neill had earlier scored two points with others from Shea Loye (2), Caolan McConville and Rian O'Neill.
Shane McGuigan got three of Derry first-half points with two each for Patrick Kearney and Danny Tallon.
Armagh moved 1-10 to 0-10 up in the second half with Shea Hoey, Oisin O'Neill, Rian O'Neill and Callum O'Neill on target.
But Derry responded with Tallon adding four points and McGuigan two to give the hosts a slender lead in stoppage-time.
It was a last-minute score from Oisin O'Neil which took the contest into extra-time.
In the match in Enniskillen, Cavan held an early 0-3 to 0-2 lead but Donegal, strengthened by their seniors' failure to qualify for the Division One final, reeled off 10 points without reply to establish a commanding lead.
Lorcan Connor landed six points, five from frees, as Declan Bonner's team took a 0-13 to 0-6 advantage into the half-time break.
Caomhin O'Reilly got two of the Cavan points but they didn't manage a single point in a 20-minute spell in the first half.
Things got worse for Cavan as Donegal netted goals in the second half through Cian Mulligan, Michael Carroll and Caolan McGonigle.
Declan Bonner's team ran out easy winners by a 13-point margin and will be confident of securing Under-21 success for the first time since 2010.
