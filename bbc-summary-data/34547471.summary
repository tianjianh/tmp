The detective, who works in a firearms unit dealing with gang crime, was shot in the shoulder on Thursday afternoon in Hackney.
Sir Bernard said he had shown "great bravery" and that colleagues had described him as "exceptional".
He remains in a stable condition in hospital.
A 31-year-old man was arrested at the scene and a non-police firearm has been recovered.
Sir Bernard commented: "This officer has shown great bravery. His colleagues have described him as 'exceptional' and 'professional'. He has been that and more.
"Our officers confront danger every day. I am proud of all of them and the courage that they show."
A specialist firearms unit and officers from Trident Area Crime Command, which is responsible for tackling gang crime, were conducting an operation in Scriven Street at the time of the shooting.
No-one else was injured.
Witnesses reported seeing police dogs and helicopters and hearing gunfire as police entered Stonebridge Park estate.
Commander Duncan Ball said for operational reasons he could not reveal whether police had fired any shots, but said: "This incident reveals the very real risks our police officers face on a day-to-day basis while protecting the safety of Londoners."
Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "So soon after the tragic death of an officer on Merseyside, this incident once again reminds us of the dangers faced by officers policing in 2015."
Witness David Silvester, 28, who owns an import business, said "The whole road was filled with undercover police. They all burst out of their cars (when the shots went off)."
