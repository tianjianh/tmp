William Fox-Pitt: Defending champion out of Badminton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defending champion and Britain's former world number one William Fox-Pitt has withdrawn from next month's Badminton Horse Trials.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fox-Pitt, 47, made the decision after his intended Badminton ride, Parklane Hawk, fell at a cross-country event at Weston Park earlier this month.
In a message posted on his website he said: "I have decided that we have run out of time for Badminton."
He won Badminton last year aboard the stallion Chilli Morning.
Fox-Pitt, Britain's most successful rider with 20 major championship medals, was placed in an induced coma after a serious fall in France last October.
The 2016 Badminton Horse Trials take place between 4-8 May.
