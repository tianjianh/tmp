Ice hockey: Edinburgh Capitals blow play-off chance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh Capitals' assistant coach Jock Hay praised his team's fight but was left frustrated by more errors that cost them a play-off place.

The Murrayfield men were eliminated from the top eight and suffered two narrow losses to Nottingham Panthers in their two games at the weekend.
It left Hay to bemoan another error-strewn couple of days for his team and conceded they are where they should be.
"We have nothing to play for and the guys could easily go through the motions, but they came out and played really well for the two games," Hay said.
"It's been a reflection of our whole season, playing hard enough, playing well enough, but giving away bad goals which, at the end of the day, costs you games.
"Errors have been costly for us all year and I'm a great believer the league table never lies. We're where we are for a reason and we've just not been consistent enough."
The Caps may be out of the reckoning, but ran Nottingham Panthers close in their two meetings at Murrayfield this weekend, being edged out in both games.
The visitors won 3-2 on Saturday, but had to hold off a spirited comeback in the third by the home team as Ollie Betteridge, Davids Sarkanis and Stephen Schultz put them 3-0 up.
Karel Hromas and Pavel Vorobyev got two back for Edinburgh to set up a nervy finale, but Nottingham held on.
On Sunday, it was more of a backwards and forwards affair as Panthers took a 4-3 win, starting with Jeff Dimmen's opener cancelled out by Mason Wilgosh.
Schultz and Vorobyev then traded goals, followed by Alex Nikiforuk and Eric Lindhagen doing enough to win it for the visitors, despite Mike D'Orazio adding a late Caps third.
The weekend already started well for Nottingham, who went to Dundee Stars for the first leg of their triple header on Friday night and took the points in a 4-1 win.
Dan Spang and Brad Moran got the opening goals for the visitors with Felix Poulin clawing one back, only for David Clarke and Spang with his second completing Panthers' win.
As for the Stars, they're hopes of reaching the play-offs could be realised this weekend after Saturday's hugely significant 6-3 home win over top eight rivals, Manchester Storm.
For the second week in a row, it was a come-from-behind victory that leaves Storm's hopes on the brink, while Dundee need a point to confirm their invitation to the party.
Storm went two up through Cody Cartier, but Marc LeFevbre's men turned it around in the second period through Poulin and a Kevin Bruijsten double.
Cartier completed a hat-trick to level for Manchester, but Stars completed the job through Poulin and empty net goals from Justin Fayna and Bruijsten, who got his treble.
Fife Flyers broke their duck in finally picking up a league win against Braehead Clan on Saturday, sealing a 3-1 triumph in Kirkcaldy on Saturday.
Flyers hadn't won in any of the previous seven league meetings against the Glasgow team and eight in all competitions so this one was particularly significant.
Chase Schaber's opener was cancelled out by Clan's Stefan Della Rovere, but Matt Sisca and Russ Moyer struck in the third to confirm the result.
Flyers headed to Cardiff Devils on Sunday and were unwitting participants in the party night in South Wales, after the Devils sealed the Elite League title the night before.
With the trophy presentation taking place post game, Fife were merely the support act as they went down 6-1 to the newly-crowned champions.
Patrick Asselin, Joey Hadded and Chris Culligan were already on the scoreboard before Schaber picked up the Flyers' consolation.
Further goals from Andrew Hotham, Scott Hotham and Layne Ulmer got the celebrations going as Devils celebrated a memorable weekend.
As for Braehead, they ended the weekend with victory after coming from 4-2 down to take a 5-4 overtime win at Coventry Blaze.
The game was tied at 2-2 after the first, with Matt Marquardt and Alex Leavitt trading goals, as did Jay Rosehill and Barry Almeida.
A Ross Venus double looked to put the Blaze in a comfortable position, but Leavitt and Scott Pitt pulled the Clan level late on, taking the game to overtime.
Matt Beca applied the finish to confirm victory for the visitors, while Blaze have to take their play-off fight into next week's final regular season weekend.
