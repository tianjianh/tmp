A staff briefing took place on Wednesday.
The company said: "HP's global print business is working to drive continuous efficiencies that enable investment in growth initiatives, such as 3D printing.
"We have made the decision to close our global print business at the Leixlip site in Ireland.
"It is likely that close to 500 HP employees will be impacted and leave the business over the next 12 months."
Hewlett-Packard opened the printer cartridge manufacturing plant in County Kildare in 1995 and it quickly grew to employ thousands of staff.
In 2015, the company split into HP Inc and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to allow both to compete more effectively in the market.
HP Inc continued with the traditional PC and printing business, while Hewlett-Packard Enterprise has focused on cloud computing hardware, software and services.
Since then the printing business of HP Inc has come under growing pressure from competitors and a changing market.
Last year HP Inc announced that it would cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs globally over the next three years.
