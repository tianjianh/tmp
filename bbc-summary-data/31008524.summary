So is there a diversity problem in UK film and TV?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Benedict Cumberbatch is sorry. He's been sorry for days after using an offensive word during an interview. But his profuse apology may have obscured the main point he was trying to make.

He said: "The most shaming aspect of this for me is that I was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the UK and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when I used the term."
But the lack of diversity in mainstream entertainment was already a talking point before Benedict got tongue-tied.
So is there a problem?
David Oyelowo spoke to Newsbeat at the UK premiere of Selma, in which he stars as 1960s civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr.
"I reached out to [Benedict] in support and said I think it's ridiculous," he said.
Asked if he felt the film industry had an issue with diversity, Oyelowo replied with a resounding "absolutely".
"You can see that in the fact every time a film of this size and stature comes up. We're talking about diversity again and that's because there isn't enough of it."
Comedian Lenny Henry, in a lecture to Bafta, said the representation of black, Asian and ethnic minorities in front of and behind the camera was "appalling".
He said: "Our most talented actors are getting increasingly frustrated and having to go to America to succeed."
The 55-year-old called for more funding to boost the presence of black, Asian and ethnic minority people in the broadcasting industry.
His comments were backed up by Britain's Got Talent host Alesha Dixon who, when asked whether there was a problem, said "welcome to Britain".
"Do you know what all you can keep doing is your best, keep fighting and keep working hard.
"I think things are changing slowly. But obviously, with everything there is still a long way to go."
At the National Television Awards, Rochelle Humes said she thought "as far as TV is concerned, it's definitely getting more diverse".
She and her husband Marvin have both presented BBC programmes and ITV's This Morning,
"I think the fact that us two, we're hosting This Morning together is a big deal and I think for such a show, that's such a national treasure, I think that's massive that we got asked to do that.
"I think it's definitely getting better. I think that there is definitely changes and I think that's good."
In 2014 the British Film Institute announced that, as the UK's largest public film fund, anyone applying for money would need to demonstrate diversity at all levels.
Bosses wanted to make the point that it shouldn't just focus on on-screen talent.
That also means ensuring more women, disabled people and members of the lesbian, gay and transgender community are involved in making future films.
Richard Blackwood, who recently joined the cast of EastEnders, says these are "changing times now".
"Your colour, your creed doesn't matter no more, if you're good at what you do, they'll use you, it's that simple."
But it's not all about TV and film. Back in 2012 the Royal Shakespeare Company put on an all-black production of Julius Caesar.
And currently there's a West End production of a critically acclaimed show called the Scottsboro Boys, again, featuring an all black cast.
