An award-winning cake maker has outlined her regal plans for her next baking bonanza.

"I want to make Prince William a flying helicopter cake," said Dawn Butler, from West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire.
She recently won best in show at an international cake competition for her Albert Einstein creation.
This latest accolade follows the former police officer's gold award for depicting Game of Thrones character Ned Stark's head on a spike.
However, she is not getting complacent and is aiming to "push the boundaries" of cake sculpture.
Ms Butler's award-winning cake of the famous physicist had a number of layers with the features made from modelling chocolate.
Einstein's "mad scientist" hair was made from steamed rice noodles.
Her intricate works and novel ideas draw on her degree in art.
She said: "I loved sculpting with clay and now [with baking] I've managed to merge the two together.
"I love it when people say my cakes are like works of art."
After university, Ms Butler spent 10 years as a police officer in Brighton before moving back to Nottinghamshire.
As a stay-at-home mum, she started making cakes for her children before it turned into a passion, one that now pays her a living.
As well as the "gory" Ned Stark cake, which she created in November, she has made a full-size baby elephant that required a forklift truck to move it.
However, she said the biggest challenge was making her cakes move with the use of animatronics.
She has already used the technique in a cake of Star Wars droid BB-8 and is hoping to make a royal helicopter cake take to the skies.
"That's my ultimate dream," she said. "I think I've figured out how to make it happen."
