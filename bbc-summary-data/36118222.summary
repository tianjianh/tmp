[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley 2-2 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester equalised eight minutes into added time to prevent play-off-chasing Barnsley going into the season's final day two points above rivals Scunthorpe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barnsley - who could have secured a top-six spot with a win had Scunthorpe also not beaten Port Vale - are now only above the Iron on goal difference.
Relegated Colchester led at half-time through George Moncur before Ashley Fletcher's second-half brace.
But Tom Lapslie's late header denied the Tykes a third win in five games.
Barnsley go to promoted Wigan on 8 May and will need to at least match seventh-placed Scunthorpe's result at Sheffield United if they are to reach the play-offs.
