Open Bionics says its device can be made faster and more cheaply than current alternatives.
It intends to launch a service next year that will 3D-scan amputees and then build and fit them with a custom-fitted socket and hand for about Â£2,000.
Olly McBride showed the BBC's North America technology reporter Dave Lee how its current prototype works.
