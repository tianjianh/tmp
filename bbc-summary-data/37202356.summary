[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 2-3 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury cast aside their early-season troubles by grabbing a victory at Oldham, who ended the game with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oldham went in front after 24 minutes when Billy McKay was fouled on the edge of the box and full-back Josh Law superbly curled in the resulting free-kick.
The Latics were denied a penalty after claiming Peter Clarke was hauled down, but Shrewsbury levelled two minutes before half-time as Joe Riley crossed from the right and Junior Brown's eight-yard glancing header bounced in off the crossbar.
The visitors struck again in the 50th minute when referee Andy Haines controversially pointed to the spot after seeing Oldham defender Charles Dunne holding Ivan Toney at a set-piece.
The penalty was converted by Toney, who sent Connor Ripley the wrong way.
Shrewsbury made it 3-1 after 62 minutes, with Riley running on to a Louis Dodds pass and drilling home emphatically from 12 yards.
Oldham's plight deepened when midfielder Ousmane Fane was shown a 70th-minute red card for a second bookable offence.
They pulled a goal back on 82 minutes with Lee Erwin's 10-yard shot from a half-cleared corner, but Oldham's last chance was slammed against the bar by Freddie Ladapo.
