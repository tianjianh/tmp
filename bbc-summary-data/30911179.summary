It's a no brainer, right? Copy a hugely successful TV series from the UK and air it in America.

Then simply sit back and watch the audiences marvel in the delights.
It's happened before and now US network Fox is pushing ahead with a pilot for Emmy-nominated Luther, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Neil Cross's cop drama received eight Emmy nominations, while lead actor Idris Elba won a Golden Globe for his part as DCI John Luther in 2011.
It's not thought Idris will appear on-screen in the US, but both he and Neil Cross are said to be working on the project.
One report suggests the pilot is "cast contingent", which means Fox will only commit to making it if they can find someone suitable enough to take on Idris Elba's role.
Luther ran for three series in the UK between 2010 and 2013.
In the past Idris Elba has told Newsbeat of his hopes to turn the series into a film.
While it's a waiting game in the US, we know Luther is already being adapted for Russian audiences, which will air next year.
