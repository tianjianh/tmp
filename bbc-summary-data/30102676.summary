The 29-year-old pulled up with the injury midway through the first half of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Italy.
Real said the former Tottenham player had torn a tendon in his thigh but did not say how long he would be out for.
However, the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) revealed he is likely to be out of action until well after the New Year.
"The Croatian national team and Real Madrid midfielder will be away from the football pitch for about three months after the injury sustained in the encounter between Italy and Croatia," said a statement on the HNS website.
Modric has been a regular starter this season for Real, who top La Liga and have already qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League with a 100% record from their four games.
