The 29-year-old joins the Sky Blues on a loan agreement before the American side begin their inaugural MLS season.
"When I spoke to the gaffer he was full of confidence about what he wants to achieve here this season," McCann said.
"The way he speaks and his ideas about the way he wants his team to play, it breeds confidence into players."
McCann agreed a move to Atlanta earlier this summer after he left Wigan, where he made 82 league appearances during a three-year stay.
