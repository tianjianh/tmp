[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newcastle admit to FA charge but plead mitigating circumstances

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United have accepted a Football Association charge of failing to control their players in Sunday's Wear-Tyne derby defeat at Sunderland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It relates to the players' reaction to Sunderland being awarded a penalty and captain Fabricio Coloccini issued with a red card in the 3-0 loss.
The Magpies won their appeal against Fabricio Coloccini's red card.
They have asked for the club's sanction to be reassessed due to mitigating circumstances.
Coloccini's dismissal was a key moment in Sunday's derby - the sixth in succession that Sunderland have won against their local rivals.
The foul awarded for his challenge on striker Steven Fletcher allowed Adam Johnson to open the scoring from the spot before further goals from Billy Jones and Fletcher sealed the win.
