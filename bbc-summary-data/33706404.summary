Lib Dems leave Ceredigion MP Mark Williams out of team

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Liberal Democrat Mark Williams is the only one of the party's eight MPs to be left out of a 'cabinet' named by new leader Tim Farron.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kirsty Williams, Lib Dem leader in the assembly, will be spokeswoman for Wales, succeeding Roger Williams, who lost his seat at the general election.
Ex-Wales Office minister Baroness Randerson will speak on transport.
Mr Farron's office said Mark Williams, MP for Ceredigion, would be given "a key campaign job" in August.
The new leader said his "excellent" team would lead the "Lib Dem fight back".
Six of its 22 members are not MPs or peers.
Mark Williams, who is now the Lib Dems' only MP in Wales, had backed Mr Farron over rival Norman Lamb in the battle to succeed Nick Clegg.
