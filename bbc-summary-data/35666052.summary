[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough v Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough midfielder Grant Leadbitter (hamstring) is a doubt for the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Daniel Ayala (ankle) is still out, while Adam Clayton or Gaston Ramirez could start in midfield.
Wolves midfielder James Henry (hamstring) could come back into contention, while manager Kenny Jackett may recall winger Rajiv van La Parra.
Mike Williamson (hamstring) and forward Michal Zyro (broken foot) are close to returns but are not likely to feature.
