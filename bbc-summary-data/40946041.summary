The issues at Caia Park, Wrexham, reached their height in 2015, with 55 recorded deliberate fires.
The then North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, Winston Roddick, called the incidents a menace and pledged Â£10,000 to tackle the issue.
Police will be joined by firefighters and other groups on Prince Charles Road to discuss the problem.
"It's been historically quite a demanding challenge," said Ch Insp Dave Jolly.
"At the moment we are still getting significant amounts of arsons, primarily around the Caia Park area.
"The risk presented by fire is very challenging for my officers and obviously for the fire service."
Last year, a youth centre was targeted, with other incidents affecting homes and cars in the area.
Tim Owen, from North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said: "Engaging with the public and the local residents, we are able to find out what is going on, and give them a bit of education on fire safety.
"Unfortunately there are people out there who still want to light fires."
Caia Park resident and community development worker Tracey Byrne said arson on the estate was posing a real risk to people.
"It's become a big issue, to be honest. I don't think people realise the dangers of it," she said.
"I think it is good to have days like this to prevent the dangers on the estate - not just arson - but a lot of things that are going on in the estate."
