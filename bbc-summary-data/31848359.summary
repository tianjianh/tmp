[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Temidayo Joseph, 16, died at Basildon Hospital after he was found hanging at his home in South Ockendon on 21 August, 2014.
An inquest in Chelmsford heard he had been speaking about the death of Mr Williams just days before his death.
A verdict of accidental death was recorded.
Area Coroner for Essex Eleanor McGann said it seemed he was trying to work out how Mr Williams had died 10 days beforehand and it went "horribly wrong".
He was a "happy boy" and his death was a "tragic accident", she said.
After the hearing, Temidayo's father Vincent said: "He was a very good boy, with a very good character. We don't know what happened.
"I loved him so much, I have lost a good friend."
