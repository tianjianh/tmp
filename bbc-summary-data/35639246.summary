[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Knox County district attorney's office in Maine added five charges against McLean last week, bringing the total to six.
McLean did not appear in court during a proceeding related to the case on Monday.
Police arrested the American Pie singer in Camden, Maine on 18 January.
The singer entered not guilty pleas to all six charges - including domestic violence assault - on Monday, via his attorney. He was not required to attend in person.
His wife filed a handwritten request for protection after his arrest in January.
She said she feared for her life when she called police, writing: "Don terrorised me for four hours, until the 911 call that I think might have saved my life."
The couple later announced through legal representatives that they had "agreed to move forward" and the protection order was dismissed.
The 70-year-old was released from Knox County Jail after posting $10,000 (Â£7,100) bail.
Mr McLean's wife claims the singer engaged in a pattern of abuse going back three decades.
The singer has "vigorously denied" his wife's allegations, and, following his arrest, asked his fans not to judge him.
"What is occurring is the very painful breakdown of an almost 30-year relationship... There are no winners or losers but I am not a villain," he wrote in a statement posted on his official website.
Don McLean shot to fame in 1971 after releasing American Pie, which became a hit around the world.
