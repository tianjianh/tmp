Resuming the final day on 113-0, Ed Joyce and Matt Machan fell early on before Nash and Ross Taylor shared a 93-run third-wicket stand.
Ben Raine had Nash, who hit 21 fours in his innings, caught behind for 144 leaving Sussex 342-5 - a lead of 32.
But bowlers Ollie Robinson (25 no) and Ajmal Shahzad batted for 14.5 overs as Sussex closed on 377-6.
Sussex opener Chris Nash told BBC Sussex:
"I worked hard during the winter with Gary Kirsten (former India and South Africa head coach) and it has paid off.
"Gary stays in touch and he texted me at tea and I know he's delighted with how I have started the season, but the coaching staff here have made sure I keep doing the things that we worked on.
"My job here was just to bat as long as I could but because I'm more relaxed I get less tired, it was disappointing to get out when I did because I still felt good.
"Our performance on the first two days was unacceptable but I thought we fought back well. There's no doubt it's going to be a graft this summer to get promoted because every team in the second division is showing a lot of fight."
Leicestershire bowler Clint McKay told BBC Radio Leicester:
"It was a tough day for us on what was still an excellent wicket and fair play to Chris Nash, he batted brilliantly to save the game for them.
"You couldn't ask for more in terms of how we played. The bowling unit kept running in hard and at no stage did we let the game drift.
"We can come away with what I guess is a winning draw and lots of positives to take into our next game against Northamptonshire.
"We have had a good start to the season and it's important that we keep the momentum we have going."
