[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The shooting happened just before 17:00 local time on Great William O'Brien Street in the Blackpool area of the city.
Two men got out of a car, approached the victim and shot him once. They then fired at least two more shots as the man lay on the ground.
Two partially-burned out cars were found by police following the shooting.
One was found in Blackpool and one at Killeens in County Cork.
The injured man was treated at the scene before he was taken to Cork University Hospital, where he died just before 19:00.
The victim worked close to the area where he was shot and lived on the northside of the city.
RTE has reported that in 2005 he was convicted of being a member of the Real IRA, but this conviction was later overturned in the Court of Criminal Appeal.
They said that dissident republican activity will be one of the areas examined in the police investigation.
