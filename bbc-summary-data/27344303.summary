Capt Eric "Winkle" Brown, 95, the last surviving pilot to have flown the first British jet, the Gloster E28/39, unveiled a plaque to mark the occasion.
The museum's collection of aircraft has been in storage since 2000 when the main hangar was demolished.
Volunteers campaigned and raised money to get the collection back on permanent display at Staverton.
Museum chairman John Lewer said: "We're privileged to have Capt Brown at our museum to renew his acquaintance with some of the more than 480 different aircraft types he has flown during his distinguished career."
Ian Whittle, the son of the jet engine pioneer Sir Frank Whittle, and 94-year old Sidney Dix of Longlevens, Gloucester, who worked on the top secret jet project at the Gloster Aircraft Company and witnessed the first flight in April 1941, also attended the opening ceremony.
The museum will house delicate aircraft, such as a 1925 Gloucester Gamecock, and contain archive photos and documents.
