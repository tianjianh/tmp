Gloria Joseph, 80, from Leicester, fractured her hip after a fall and could not move from the floor.
Her son, Conrad Dore, said he was "angry and scared" while the family waited because he believed she "didn't have much time left".
East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said the healthcare system was "under extreme pressure" on Monday.

Mr Dore, who is first aid trained, said he called the ambulance service several times as his mother "was in too much agony".
"She was shaking, one side of her body was really hurting and the pain started to go up into her shoulder - she started to get pins and needles," he said.
He added the experience was "very distressing" for his mother, who is a diabetic, and the family.
Dr Bob Winter, medical director of EMAS, said: "Over the day we took about 2,400 emergency calls, that's one every 37 seconds.
"The wider healthcare system was extremely busy and that had a knock-on effect on our service.
"We had 10 ambulances waiting at Leicester Royal Infirmary to hand over patients."
Richard Mitchell, chief operating officer at Leicester's Hospitals NHS Trust, said delays in providing patients' care was "unacceptable" and the hospital had recently had its "highest number of emergency admissions in one week".
"To dramatically reduce the number of ambulance handover delays, we must reduce the numbers of people needing emergency care.
"I would like to say sorry to anyone who has experienced a delay."
EMAS, which responds to 616,000 emergency and urgent calls each year, failed to hit targets to reach the highest priority calls for a fifth year running in 2014/15.
