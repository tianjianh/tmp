Whiley and Japan's Kamiji went a set down as the Dutch second seeds started confidently on court three.
But 25-year-old Whiley and Kamiji, 23, recovered to take the second and did not lose a game in a decisive third to extend their winning run at Wimbledon.
They receive Â£12,000 in prize money.
Whiley, who spent eight months out with injury since her last Wimbledon title, told BBC Sport: "This is by far the most special for me. I really did try my hardest. I'm so happy.
"Yui's my best friend, I would do anything for Yui, I would try my hardest for Yui and I know she would do the same.
"That's what makes it such a special doubles team."
