[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher Timothy Bleach 'abused school pupils' in 70s

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher sexually assaulted young girls at the school where he worked in the 1970s, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Timothy Bleach, now aged 76 and retired, is alleged to have carried out the assaults while teaching at Weyford Junior School in Bordon, Hampshire.
Twelve women - who were pupils at the school and aged between eight and 11 at the time of the alleged assaults - have made complaints against Mr Bleach.
He denies 62 counts, covering more than 100 incidents, including rape.
The charges also include gross indecency, indecent assault and possession of indecent images.
Portsmouth Crown Court heard the attacks took place between 1972 and 1980 and happened in the classroom, in a store cupboard Mr Bleach had converted into a darkroom and during piano lessons, as well as at Mr Bleach's home.
The jury was told the girls were repeatedly assaulted by Mr Bleach, of Hazel Walks, Petersfield, in a variety of ways.
After police received an initial complaint officers made contact with other former pupils - 11 of whom reported indecent assaults, the trial heard.
Some said it was the first time they had spoken about the alleged attacks.
The trial is expected to last six weeks.
