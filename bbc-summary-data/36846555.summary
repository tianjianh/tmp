Two men have been jailed and two women have been given suspended sentences after rashers of bacon were tied to door handles at a Bristol mosque.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
During the incident on 17 January, the group shouted racial abuse at a member of the mosque and tied a St George's flag to the fence of the Jamia Mosque.
Kevin Crehan, 34, of Knowle, was jailed for 12 months and Mark Bennett, 48, of Patchway, for nine months.
Both had admitted religiously aggravated public order offences.
At the Bristol Crown Court hearing, 46-year-old Alison Bennett - the wife of Mark Bennett - was given a six-month sentence, suspended for two years, while Angelina Swales, 31, from Brislington, was handed a four-month sentence, suspended for two years.
The two women also admitted religiously aggravated public order offences in relation to the targeting of the Totterdown mosque.
All four were given a restraining order preventing them from going within 100m of a mosque anywhere in England or Wales for the next 10 years.
Insp Nigel Colston of Avon and Somerset Police paid tribute to the way the community responded to what happened.
He said: "The way local people came together with overwhelming support for the mosque made me proud to be associated with Bristol.
"There can never be any excuse for hate crime in any shape or form and this criminality will not be tolerated.
"All of our communities have the right to live and worship peacefully without fear of being targeted for their race or religion."
