Lee Clark: New Bury boss says he has 'mojo back' after Kilmarnock spell

New Bury boss Lee Clark says he has his "mojo back" after his spell at Scottish Premiership side Kilmarnock.

The former Newcastle and Fulham midfielder, 44, joined the League One strugglers on Wednesday, replacing temporary manager Chris Brass.
Clark kept Kilmarnock in the top tier via the play-offs last season, and leaves them in sixth place.
"The year I had at Kilmarnock has shown everyone I can manage, I'm a good manager," Clark told BBC Manchester.
The ex-Huddersfield and Birmingham City manager took over Blackpool in 2014, but three wins in 33 matches saw them relegated from the Championship.
"It was a tough six months at Blackpool. For a few months after that there was a time I considered not continuing in football, it took a lot out of me. It wasn't the real Lee Clark," he added.
"I've got my mojo back - I have thoroughly enjoyed the year I've had with Kilmarnock, they've done a lot for me and now Bury can reap rewards of that."
Clark joins Bury with the club two points from safety, having played two games more than their nearest rivals Port Vale.
"I've been in a relegation battle at Birmingham which we got through, and the same at Kilmarnock."
"There'll be no knee-jerk reactions, we will deal with this in a cool, calm and calculated way, to understand the situation, survive and build for the future."
"I know this league from my time with Huddersfield, where I had a lot of success."
The ex-Sunderland player believes he can be successful again in the third tier.
"How do I become successful at Bury? The players. I have to get them to buy into what I'm about. The players at Kilmarnock got me this move, they produced the results to get from bottom of the table to the top six."
"The short-term goal is to win as many games as possible to stay in the league, and then the next objective is to challenge at the other end at the end of the table. If you don't have ambition, don't come into the game."
Clark will take charge of his first match on Saturday, with the Shakers travelling to fellow relegation candidates Chesterfield.
"I want the lads to be extremely fit. Everyday we will train as hard as we can so we can replicate it on match day. If the players give me that, and we don't get the results, then there is nothing we can do. The club deserves this, and if they do, they have my total support."
