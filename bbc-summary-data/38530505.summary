The Sentinel reported Sanctuary Supported Living enforced the ban in communal areas at Baskeyfield House, Stoke-on-Trent, following a dispute over a "59p decoration".
Residents said they are being "treated like children".
The Sanctuary Group cited "unacceptable behaviour" for the "short-term" ban.

Resident Geoff Lawton told BBC Radio Stoke: "The management has decided we can't have any form of entertainment after 5pm."
He added: "We can't drink alcohol in the communal area, which is a public area.
"Somebody who's middle aged comes along and starts treating older people like children".
Julie Swinnerton, who lives in the flats and owns karaoke equipment used by fellow residents, said there is a split between those who enjoy entertainment and those who don't.
She said one lady started an argument over a "59p decoration" at a Christmas party and it "escalated".
"They took my karaoke equipment away and said I could only have it back if I kept it in my room", she added.
Tracey Spencer, service manager at Sanctuary Supported Living, said: "We have a responsibility and a duty of care to all residents at Baskeyfield House and continue to work with them to ensure a welcoming environment for all.
"The decision to temporarily suspend all activities within the communal areas was taken after unacceptable behaviour at a recent social occasion."
Baskeyfield House is an extra care scheme, made up of a number of individual apartments where residents live independently.
