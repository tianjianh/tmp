Pure Wafer held a consultation period to help about 130 workers after making the decision not to rebuild the Llansamlet factory in May.
The company switched its production of silicon wafers for computer chips to a sister site in the United States.
Pure Wafer said the decision not to rebuild after the fire in December came after carefully considering the costs.
