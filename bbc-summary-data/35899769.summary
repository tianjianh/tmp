Leigh Halfpenny: Wales back named by Toulon for European Cup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny is a step closer to returning from a serious knee injury after Toulon named him in their European Champions Cup squad.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The holders have registered the British and Irish Lion ahead of their quarter-final at Racing 92 on Sunday, 10 April.
The former Cardiff Blues back suffered his injury in Wales' win over Italy in September and missed the World Cup.
Halfpenny has not played since, but may now be in contention to be part of Wales' June tour to New Zealand.
