Concern after 70,000 litre Nant Pibwr river oil spill

Between 70,000 and 100,000 litres of oil has leaked from a pipeline into a Carmarthenshire river.

Kerosene leaked from a pipeline under the A48 near Carmarthen - which was already shut for repairs on a defect stretch of pipeline - into Nant Pibwr.
It is understood the leak was caused by the maintenance work.
Natural Resources Wales said at least half of the oil has been recovered from local streams, and it was doing all it could.
The pipeline carries aviation fuel and diesel from Pembroke's Valero refinery.
Pipeline owners Valero said two sites were continuing to capture leaked oil while two were clear, and the pipeline remains shut.
It estimated it would not gain access to the affected area until Friday, and advised people to keep windows shut.
"We would again like to apologise to all local residents for the inconvenience this incident may have caused and to reassure them that we are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible," a spokesman said.
Plaid Cymru's Adam Price and the Conservatives' Andrew RT Davies have submitted written questions to Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths about the incident.
Residents have said they are concerned it will affect their livelihoods.
Landowner Gareth Rees told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme: "We don't know how much pollution has got into the river and how long term the effects are going to be.
"Cattle are not going to be able to drink from the river for maybe months and months to come, let alone all the fish that have been killed and the damage to the environment.
"I think the precautions being taken now are as much as can be done."
Aneurin Cox, south Wales operational resources manager at NRW, said on Thursday they were working to minimise the risk to public health and the environment.
"Our rivers provide a home to rich, diverse and valuable species of plants and animals so it's important to deal with pollution as quickly as possible," he said.
"We are doing all we can to stop the pollution and reduce its impact on fish and other wildlife that depend on the river."

The Welsh Government said it had been informed of the spill and that the cabinet secretary for environment and rural affairs was being kept updated "as a matter of urgency".
Public Health Wales said it was "unlikely" that anyone exposed to fuel oil for a short period of time would have any long-term health effects.
