[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US Envoy to Northern Ireland, former Senator Gary Hart, is set to return next month to help with the current political crisis at Stormont.

It was triggered when police said they believed IRA members had been involved in the murder of a former IRA man in Belfast in August.
Mr Hart last visited in March.
The Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan, who is on a visit to Washington DC, spoke to Mr Hart earlier on Wednesday.
Mr Flanagan said there was concern in the United States about the direction in which talks were going.
He will take part in a "full programme of meetings with key Democratic and Republican contacts on Capitol Hill, senior figures in the US administration and other influential Irish-American contacts".
He will talk with key representatives of the US National Security Council and Vice President Joe Biden's staff.
Mr Flanagan will also address an event later to highlight the work of the International Fund for Ireland.
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said his visit would focus on the current situation in Northern Ireland and "the ongoing political talks process".
Discussions began last week at Stormont in a bid to resolve the current political row at Stormont.
Following the murder of Kevin McGuigan, Chief Constable George Hamilton said the IRA was still in existence, but added that the organisation was not engaged in terrorism.
Sinn FÃ©in said the IRA no longer exists after it ordered an end to its armed campaign in 2005.
The claims by Mr Hamilton led to a breakdown in trust between Sinn FÃ©in and unionist parties.
The Ulster Unionists withdrew from Northern Ireland's ruling executive, with three Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ministers also later resigning, and DUP leader Peter Robinson stepping aside as first minister.
Unionists agreed to join the talks when the government ordered an independent review of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland earlier this month.
Mr Flanagan will also address an event to highlight the work of the International Fund for Ireland.
It is understood the prospects for US immigration reform will also be discussed during his trip.
Later this week, Mr Flanagan is expected to speak about Northern Ireland issues with US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, in New York.
