Police Scotland said it was "keeping an open mind" as to whether the gun was linked to the crime groups involved in September's Gilmerton shootings.
The gun was found in Juniper Green on Monday.
Det Ch Insp Kenny Gray said: "The recovery of this handgun is a great result and demonstrates Police Scotland's commitment to tackling organised crime in the city."
He added: "Inquiries are ongoing to identify the owners of the handgun and the gun has examined for any forensic opportunities.
"The owning of illegal firearms will not be tolerated and we will act on every piece of information we receive in order to crack down on this illegal activity."
