New Hartlepool manager Dave Jones says the vision of chairman Gary Coxall persuaded him to agree to take charge of the League Two side.

The 60-year-old replaced Craig Hignett at Victoria Park on Wednesday.
The former Cardiff, Wolves, Southampton and Stockport boss was last in management at Sheffield Wednesday, but left Hillsborough in December 2013.
"The chairman sold me it, Gary sold me a dream. He showed an ambition and why not?" Jones told BBC Tees.
He will take over officially on Monday, and his first game in charge will be a trip to Wales to face Newport County on 28 January.
"I've had people phoning me and saying it is fantastic and I've had other people saying are you mad?" he said.
"I just felt it was right for me after talking to Gary. He's very ambitious, young, he's a bit naive on certain things but that's why he's employed me as a football manager.
"He's employed me to build this football club. That's hopefully how he sees it."
Pools have also announced that Alex Armstrong will be another assistant manager along with Kevin Cooper.
