(Close) The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at another record for the ninth session - the index's longest record streak in 30 years.

However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ended lower, bringing their winning streaks to an end.
The Dow rose 32 points, or 0.16%, to 20,775 points, while the S&P shed 0.1% to 2,362 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.1% to 5,860 points.
The falls followed the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes.
Many Fed policymakers said it may be appropriate to raise interest rates again "fairly soon".
But the minutes also showed uncertainty because of a lack of clarity on the new Trump administration's economic agenda.
Chevron and Exxon Mobil both fell 1.2%, as did Intel.
The big winner of the day was Dow Chemical, which jumped 4%.
Tesla fell 1.4% before the release of its results that showed a better than expected rise in revenue, but still lost $121.3m in the quarter. Shares rose in after-hours trading.
