[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign to raise £1m to create a giant nature reserve in the Suffolk Broads has been backed by television naturalist Sir David Attenborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Suffolk Wildlife Trust wants to buy land flanking the existing nature reserve at Carlton and Oulton Marshes to form 1,000 acres of the Broads.
It is hoped the site will ultimately become the Suffolk Broads National Nature Reserve.
The land purchase would be the biggest in the Trust's 55-year history.
Sir David, who is President Emeritus of The Wildlife Trusts, said: "England's wildlife is under great and ever growing pressure.
"By giving generously you will be investing not just in wildlife but in the happiness and fulfilment of thousands of people now and in the future."

The new reedbed reserve will be the largest in the Broads, supporting breeding marsh harrier and bittern, as well as reed bunting, grasshopper warbler and lesser known species like white mantled wainscot moth, which has only been found in Suffolk.
The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has approved the trust's initial plans for the land purchase, together with proposals to improve the reserve for visitors and develop wide-ranging education activities.
HLF has awarded the trust a development grant of £246,300 to work on the detailed plans necessary to secure a full grant of £4m for the project.
Julian Roughton, chief executive of Suffolk Wildlife Trust, said: "This is an opportunity to create wildness as far as the eye can see and restore a magnificent landscape in the UK's most nature-rich National Park."
