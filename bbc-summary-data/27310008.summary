[SN]TITLE[SN]
Everything you wanted to know about Europe but were afraid to ask

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ahead of the elections for the European Parliament later this month, BBC Newsnight wants to know what questions you have about the European Union and the UK's relationship with it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We will use all the weapons in Newsnight's arsenal to try to unpick the answer, however knotty the question.
So, if you have always wondered how MEPs are elected, how much influence the EU has in the laws adopted by the UK government, or what on earth the D'Hondt system is, then send Newsnight an email to euroquestions@bbc.co.uk or tweet us @BBCNewsnight and we will take a look.
We will be answering a selection of your questions on a special edition of Newsnight: "Everything you wanted to know about Europe but were afraid to ask", dedicated to the European elections on Monday 19 May at 22:30 BST on BBC Two.
