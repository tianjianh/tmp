A patient and two crew were hurt when the ambulance they were travelling in overturned during a crash with a van on the Coleraine Road, Portrush.
One person had to be cut free from the ambulance after the collision which happened at about 08:50 BST.

Three fire appliances attended the scene.
A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said it was repeating its calls for drivers "to exercise extreme caution on the roads at all times".
