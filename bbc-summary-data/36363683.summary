Sutton Coldfield man admits pregnant woman murder bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted attempting to murder a pregnant woman who was stabbed repeatedly in the street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Babur Karamat Raja, 41, of Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, attacked the woman in the town centre on 4 March.
He also pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted child destruction, possession of a knife in public and the wounding and assault of two passers-by.
He appeared at court by videolink and will be sentenced in June.
Police arrested the company director in the Trinity Hill area after the woman, who cannot be identified because of a court order, was stabbed in the chest and suffered multiple wounds to her abdomen.
Prosecutor Benjamin Aina QC said the Crown did not wish to proceed on a further count of attempted murder against Raja relating to an attack on bystander John Mitchell.
He was "one of the brave members of the public" who went to the woman's aid, Mr Aina said.
Although Raja had attacked Mr Mitchell with a knife, he did not accept he had intended to kill him, the court heard.
A 40-minute hearing at Birmingham Crown Court was told the sentencing judge will be required to consider whether Raja's level of dangerousness should merit a life sentence.
Defence counsel Jane Humphryes QC, said Raja "would like to say... his sincere apologies".
