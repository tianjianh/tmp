Despite being born on a beach, this was the first time that they'd swam in the sea.
The pair were rescued after being abandoned by their mother, and have been looked after by RSPCA ever since.
The boy (who's been named C-3PO) jumped straight in, while his sister (called R2-D2) took a little longer to get used to the water.
It was thought that grey seals couldn't have twin babies, but the brother and sister proved that wrong when tests confirmed they were twins.
Experts say that, since their mother has already had twins once, it's possible that she could have more again in the future.
