Earlier, figures showed that US consumer prices fell by the sharpest amount for six years last month.

US parcel service FedEx was one rare spot of red in an otherwise upbeat day for firms.
Shares in the firm declined 3.72% after it reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, which did not benefit as much as expected from falling oil prices.
