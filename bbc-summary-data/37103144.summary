Accrington Stanley 1-0 Burnley (AET)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matty Pearson scored a winner late in extra time for League Two's Accrington as they knocked out Premier League Burnley in the EFL Cup second round.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a first competitive meeting between the two since 1893, fourth-tier Stanley beat a Premier League club for the first time in their history.
Pearson drilled home when the Clarets failed to clear a long cross.
Clarets substitutes Andre Gray and Scott Arfield both saw efforts well saved in extra time.
Stanley will now travel to West Ham's new Olympic Stadium home in round three.
Four top-flight sides have been knocked out in the second round, with Burnley joining Middlesbrough, West Brom and Watford in exiting the competition.
Accrington beat Bradford 11-10 on penalties in the last round but had won just one league game so far this season - now they will face West Ham at the London Stadium in round three.
Sam Vokes was the only player who survived 10 changes from Clarets boss Sean Dyche, who handed four full debuts including on-loan Liverpool full-back John Flanagan, winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson, goalkeeper Nick Pope and midfielder Aiden O'Neill.
Andre Gray replaced Vokes in the second half in his first appearance since being charged by the Football Association for misconduct over homophobic posts he made on Twitter in 2012.
Accrington boss John Coleman:
"It will be nice to go there [West Ham], it will be difficult. I'd have preferred Northampton at home.
"It's good for my family because my son-in-law is a West Ham fan and is trying to bring my two grandsons up as Hammers. There will be divided loyalties in our house. The acid test will be what top the two grandsons are having.
"It will generate some finance and it will help towards the playing side of it.
"If we want to compete with everyone else in our league we need more finance into the playing budget.
"We're not going to live beyond our means and I wouldn't encourage them to live beyond their means. This will be a massive boost for us."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"I was really pleased with the performance in general.
"We created enough chances to certainly win. In cup games you always get a team who find a chance and they found probably two.
"The main thing I'm really pleased about is that one of my young players Aiden O'Neill didn't come away with a broken leg.
"I've seen a ridiculous challenge which is a red card immediately. There's a two-footed tackle in the second half let go. I'm amazed by the referee but that's part and parcel of the game."
