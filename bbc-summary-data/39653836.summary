It was reported on Wednesday that the Anfield club were close to a Â£20m deal for the Manchester City keeper, who is currently on loan at Torino.
Hart, 30, is expected to leave City but Klopp is content with current keepers Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius.
"He's a fantastic keeper, the highest quality, but it's not for us at the moment, nor in the future," he said.
Hart told BBC Sport in March that he is "surplus to requirements" at City and does not see himself playing for the Premier League club again.
He moved to Italian side Torino on a season-long loan in August after being told he was free to leave City by manager Pep Guardiola.
"If you're not going to win there is no point in fighting, especially someone as powerful as that," Hart said.
Guardiola has maintained that no decision will be taken until the end of the season.

Klopp also confirmed that midfielder Adam Lallana should return to full training in the latter part of next week after his thigh injury, and that forward Danny Ings is running again after a serious knee problem.
However, midfielder Jordan Henderson remains sidelined with a knee injury.
"At this moment he cannot really train. We must wait. We are in intense talks with different medical departments," Klopp said.
"He looks really healthy but he can't play football."
