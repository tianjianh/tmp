London Underground has reported its highest number of journeys in a day, breaking the record set in November.

Friday 4 December saw 4.821 million journeys on the network.
The daily record has been broken several times this year and Transport for London (TfL) expects it to be broken again before the end of 2015.
LU's director said current improvement works were aimed at "providing a Tube network fit for the world city it serves".
The previous peak on 27 November saw 4.795 million journeys.
Overall, the number of customer journeys on the Tube has risen by a third since 2001, with the rate of growth increasing in the last five years.
Labour's London Assembly Transport Spokesperson, Val Shawcross, criticised the government's decision to stop grants to TfL from 2018, announced in the spending review.
She said: "When record-breaking passenger numbers are met with some of the biggest cuts in TfL's history it's clear there is a real problem."
LU's managing director, Nick Brown, said: "The current work to improve London Underground is one of the largest programmes of infrastructure investment in the world.
"We will continue to invest all our income in modernising the service, improving reliability, train capacity and frequency, and upgrading major stations to provide a Tube network fit for the world city it serves."
Earlier this month, figures obtained by BBC London showed Oxford Circus Tube station was temporarily closed 113 times in the space of a year because of overcrowding.
