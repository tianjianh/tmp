Key forward Jon Walters is the latest injury concern for the Republic of Ireland ahead of Euro 2016 after taking a bang to his calf.

Stoke City's Walters, 32, was unable to train with his Republic team-mates on Thursday morning as he instead worked with the medical staff.
The initial indications were that the knock was not serious.
However, it's a further issue for boss Martin O'Neill given the injuries to James McCarthy and Robbie Keane.
On the plus side, Everton midfielder McCarthy was able to take part in training for the first time since the squad got together 10 days ago.
McCarthy, who has been bothered by a thigh injury, worked alone after completing the warm-up ahead of Wednesday morning's session, but stayed with the rest of the squad on Thursday as he stepped up his recovery.
Squad skipper Keane was out on the pitch, although only as an observer with the 35-year-old striker unlikely to resume training until the middle of next week at the earliest because of a calf problem which required an injection.
Keane accepts that he faces a battle to be available for the Group E opener against Sweden in Paris on 13 June but is certain he will be fit for the second game against Belgium five days later.
"Luckily for me, it's not as bad as I first thought," Keane told FAI TV YouTube.
"They are saying a couple of weeks which would maybe get me (fit) for the Sweden game or maybe missing that one.
"But I'll definitely be ready for the second game."
Keane did show off his hurling skills on Thursday as he and staff member Dick Redmond tested out each other's ability at the Gaelic Athletic Association sport.
The players were due some down-time later in the day, with golf on the agenda ahead of the final day of their pre-tournament training camp in Cork before a weekend off.
After the Belgium game in Bordeaux on 18 June, the Republic face Italy in their final Group E match on 22 June in Lille.
