Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested last month after a rally against the execution of a Kashmiri separatist convicted over the 2001 Indian parliament attack.
He was released from jail on Thursday after being granted bail.
Mr Kumar's views have been divisive in India with some calling him "anti-nationalist".
The authorities allege Mr Kumar and others shouted anti-India slogans at the 9 February rally that took place at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Two other students remain in custody.
On Thursday, Mr Kumar returned to JNU and said in his speech that he wanted freedom "in" and not "from" India.
Media reports said that close to 3,000 students turned up to hear him speak.
Mr Kumar took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government, saying that the backlash against him was to distract the people from its failings in other areas.
He vowed to continue the "fight" against the "oppressive" policies of the government, saying that the more students were suppressed, the more they would stand up.
The government has not yet commented on the speech, which has sparked a huge reaction online.
#KanhaiyaKumar was trending on Facebook India, Twitter India and Twitter global trends on Thursday night, as television channels beamed his speech live.
On Friday morning, the hashtag #Azaadi (freedom) was also trending in the country, though sentiments remained sharply divided.
YouTube links to his speech are also being widely circulated on social media.
