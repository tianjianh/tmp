Erol Incedal: Jailed for 42 months over bomb-making manual

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British law student, who was cleared of plotting an attack in the UK's first secret terror trial, has been jailed for 42 months for possessing a bomb-making manual.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Erol Incedal, 27, from London, was acquitted of planning a terror attack at the Old Bailey last week.
His friend, Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, who admitted having a manual identical to Incedal's, was given three years.
Most of the trial was behind closed doors and details cannot be reported.
While sentencing, the judge said the bomb-making guide included information for viable explosive devices, although it lacked detail.
Mr Justice Nicol said: "The potential for such bombs to cause death, injury and destruction are obvious."
"The fear, panic and terror which explosions also bring are often a deliberate part of the terrorist's ambition."
He said both men had been to the Syrian-Turkish border and mixed with jihadists. While at a safe house there they had learned about weaponry and explosives.
Incedal has been in custody since he was stopped by police by Tower Bridge, London, in October 2013. Rarmoul-Bouhadjar has also been on remand for about 18 months.
The case involving the two men became a legal first after an attempt by the Crown Prosecution Service to hold the entire trial in secret was scuppered by a media challenge at the High Court.
It led to the defendants, previously referred to as AB and CD, being named for the first time and the decision to split the trials into three parts - public, private with 10 accredited journalists present but barred from reporting, and completely secret.
Before the sentencing process began Mr Justice Nicol refused to lift further reporting restrictions, and said he could not give further details.
Lawyers representing several media outlets, including the BBC, had asked the judge to allow some of the secret evidence to be reported.

Erol Incedal has been sentenced for possessing a bomb-making plans - but he's been cleared of a far more serious charge of plotting some kind of terrorist attack in the UK. All clear?
Here's the problem: We don't really know what's been going on in this trial.
Incedal insisted he had a legitimate reason for carrying those  plans - but we were never allowed to hear it in open court.
The  judge has now blocked our media requests to report the main allegations - and the reasons why the jury dismissed them.
If I  knew the truth, I'd go to prison if I told you what it was.
The journalists who were accredited to sit in some of the secret parts of the case can't tell you either. Their notebooks have been taken away and remain under lock and key.
Last week Turkish-born Incedal was acquitted in a retrial of plotting with a terrorist in Syria to either  murder an individual of significance, such as former prime minister Tony Blair, or launch an attack such as that in Mumbai.
The jury deliberated for a total of 27 hours.
The prosecution said Incedal's plans were thwarted by police who bugged his car after he was stopped for speeding in September 2013 and taken into custody.
During a search of Incedal's car while he was in custody, officers found a slip of paper inside a glasses case which had the address of a property belonging to Mr Blair and his wife, Cherie.
Incedal was released and the listening device recorded him talking about buying a gun and his time in war-torn Syria.
After two weeks, armed police stopped him and Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, also 27, as they were driving in central London.
Inside Incedal's phone case was a memory card and on it were instructions on how to assemble a bomb.
