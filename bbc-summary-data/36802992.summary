Plymouth Albion have signed hooker Jamie Salter for the third time after he left Cornish side Launceston.

The 31-year-old missed much of last season after having an operation on a detached bicep, and could not prevent Launceston from being relegated.
His two previous spells with the National One club came in the 2008-09 and 2012-13 campaigns.
"I really enjoyed my time at Polson Bridge but I want to play at the highest level possible," Salter said.
"I live in Plymouth and am looking forward to challenging for a place in Albion's front row."
