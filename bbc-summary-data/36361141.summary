Rangers: Ashley, Green, Ahmad, Stockbridge, Llambias cited by club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers have launched court proceedings against four of the club's former executives and Mike Ashley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The civil case against former chief executives Charles Green and Derek Llambias, former director Imran Ahmad, former financial director Brian Stockbridge and Ashley has been brought at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
With Ahmad currently believed to be out of the UK, notice of his citation was published in Monday's Times newspaper.
Rangers had no comment to make.
Last week Rangers withdrew the rights for Rangers Retail Limited, a commercial joint venture with Ashley's Sports Direct, to use the club's trademarks.
The company can no longer produce or distribute merchandise that bears the club's badge.
Rangers Retail was set-up in August 2012 while Green was chief executive of Rangers. At the same time, Ahmad was a director and Stockbridge was the financial director.
Rangers Retail, which is 51% owned by Rangers and 49% by Sports Direct, was established to run the club's retail operation. Fans have protested against the agreement, believing the club does not earn enough from the joint venture, and some have stopped buying merchandise.
Llambias, the former managing director of Newcastle United, the club Ashley owns, was appointed chief executive between December 2014 and March 2015, when the current directors ousted the previous board at an extraordinary general meeting.
