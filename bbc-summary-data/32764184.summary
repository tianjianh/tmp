A school crossing patrol could be permanently scrapped after a four-year search for someone to staff it failed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No-one has applied for the job of lollipop man or woman at Broughton Moor Primary School in Allerdale, Cumbria, despite repeated advertisements since January 2011.
Cumbria County Council has proposed scrapping the post and reallocating the money to the town's general budget.
Traffic calming measures had been installed on the road, it said.
