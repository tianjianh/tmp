[SN]TITLE[SN]
Primary school teacher smelling of alcohol suspended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A primary school teacher has been suspended from the teaching register for a year for turning up to classes smelling of alcohol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karon Thomas-Larkin, 47, taught five and six year olds at Cwmffrwdoer Primary School, Pontypool.
She was later dismissed by the school after turning up smelling of alcohol seven times in a six-week period.
She admitted unacceptable conduct at a General Teaching Council for Wales hearing in Cardiff.
The disciplinary panel was told the incidents followed a period of sick leave, after a serious illness where she was treated in intensive care.
Her union representative, David Browne, told the hearing: "This is a particularly sad case of health issues which had an impact on the set of circumstances."
The panel said her behaviour fell short of that expected of a registered teacher and "undermines public trust and confidence in the profession".
