The Northampton Town Football Club-led development was approved by Northampton Borough Council on Tuesday evening.
Cobblers chairman David Cardoza said the plans would "ensure a bright and successful future" for the club.
There has been no news regarding a contractual dispute which has temporarily halted work to redevelop the East Stand at Sixfields Stadium.
The new development will also include a small number of retail units.
Mr Cardoza said: "We are putting foundations in place to ensure a bright and successful future for Northampton Town and we have a borough council who recognise the value the club brings to the town."
He added that the hotel and conference centre would bring in extra money "that is vital to the progression of the club".
Councillor David Mackintosh, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said the redevelopment was "essential" to Northampton Town.
He said: "This additional funding can only help provide a sound financial base for the club to work from."
