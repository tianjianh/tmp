Ice cream van 'set alight' at Blaenavon picnic spot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ice cream van was set alight as children were being served at a picnic spot, its owner said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iain O'Hara was at Keepers Pond, Blaenavon, at 12:30 BST on 5 June, when fire lighters were pushed into the back wheel and set alight.
He filmed the blaze and put footage on Facebook in order to try and catch the culprit.
Gwent Police has appealed for information about the incident.
Mr O'Hara from Nantyglo, Blaenau Gwent, said he was warned by customers that the van was on fire and managed to escape unharmed.
While he is still able to use it, Mr O'Hara said paintwork has been damaged and he must buy new parts for machinery.
"If a compressor had gone up, myself and whoever I was serving could have been seriously injured or killed," he said.
