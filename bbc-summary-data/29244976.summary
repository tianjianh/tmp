Ceri Ann Sullivan was not wearing seatbelt in crash - inquest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A young mother killed when she lost control of her car in Cardiff was not wearing a seatbelt, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceri Ann Sullivan, 21, from Cyncoed, lost control of her Renault Clio on the A48 near St Mellons on 24 May, 2014.
Cardiff Coroner's Court was told how the mother-of-one collided with Rodney Jones, who was driving his Ford Mondeo in the opposite direction.
Miss Sullivan suffered massive head injuries and was pronounced dead at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.
Mr Jones told the inquest: "As it [the Clio] came round the bend its rear came outwards towards the other lane - it seemed to twitch.
"It righted itself for a split second and I thought she'd gained control and then it violently went into a slide.
"The car skidded sideways and came at me - I was unable to avoid a collision."
Mr Jones smashed "head-on" into the passenger side of Miss Sullivan's car in the accident in May.
South Wales Police investigators said they did not know what caused her to lose control during the early morning collision on her way into work.
Collision investigator Wayne Evans said the road had been "damp" but this was not a factor in the accident.
Miss Sullivan also had defective front tyres which were below the legal tread depth although he did not believe this had caused the accident either.
The mother-of-one was not found to have been speeding or using her mobile phone at the time.
A post-mortem examination showed no alcohol in her system although pathologists did find traces of cannabis use "at some point before her death".
Coroner Andrew Barkley reached a conclusion of accidental death and said: "Why she lost control will never be known."
