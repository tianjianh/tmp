Doncaster hosts male domestic violence conference

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One in five domestic violence victims in Yorkshire are men, according to a charity holding a conference in Doncaster.

The conference, organised by Mankind Initiative and held at the Keepmoat Stadium, was chaired by former abuse victim Ian McNicholl.
His ex-girlfriend is serving a seven year prison sentence for GBH and assault.
Mankind Initiative said men too often are "too ashamed" to report abuse.
Mr McNicholl, 52, from East Yorkshire, said: "Far too many men feel they're to blame, they're weak and they're alone often because they do not think there is support for them.
"We aim to change that so no man suffers in silence and realise they can escape and rebuild their lives."
Mankind Initiative said male domestic abuse figures are particularly high in South Yorkshire.
In the last three years, police received 19,459 calls from men but the charity said the real figures are likely to be higher because of under-reporting by men.
Mr McNicholl, who was in an abusive relationship for 18 months, said:
"By the time I was rescued by police I had a fractured skull, multiple fractures to my cheekbone, I've had the septum on my nose replaced, I have a scar from an assault with a steam iron.
"It almost took my life. She told me in her last assault she was going to kill me. I was also on the point of suicide."
He said he did not report it earlier because he feared for his life and was "emotionally and physically ground-down".
130 delegates from around the country attended the conference.
Mankind Initiative said men often do not report abuse because they feel "embarrassed", feel it "undermines their identity as a man" and "fear they won't be believed."
