The 19-year-old, who joined Everton from Cheltenham in 2011, helped the Toffees win the Premier League Under-18 title last season and is now a regular in their under-21 side.
Shakers boss David Flitcroft told the club website: "Courtney is a player we have watched for a while now.
"He has pace, power and wants to run in from behind and hurt other sides."
