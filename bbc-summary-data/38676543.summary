Music festival organisers have said they are firmly committed to their south of Scotland venue after announcing a "sister" event in Croatia.

The Eden Festival has raised concerns in the past about the policing costs at the Raehills Estate near Beattock.
It has now unveiled plans to stage The Lost Disco event in Tisno in August.
However, co-founder Adam Curtis insisted that the two festivals would complement one another and the Scottish event remained their top priority.
"The Eden Festival is very much a community festival - it has been built by more than me," he said.
"It is 300 to 400 of us that do it from the community and that is very hard to transport anywhere.
"The Eden Festival will always remain as our number one key objective."
He said the idea behind the Croatian event was to export one section of the south of Scotland festival.
"For the Lost Disco Festival what we have done is take our most popular stage at the Eden Festival which is the Lost Disco and take it abroad," he said.
"It is almost like taking part of the Eden Festival over the seas."
