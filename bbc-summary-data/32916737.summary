[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Salah, of Walmersley Road in Bury, Greater Manchester, sexually assaulted the woman as she walked home before one of his friends tried to drag him off.
The 19-year-old attacked her again when police saw him lying on top of her and used a Taser to restrain him.
Salah earlier admitted attempted sexual assault at Manchester Crown Court.
His 33-year-old victim was walking home along Great Cheetham Street, Salford, from a friend's house in the early hours of 1 April 2014 when Salah and his friend started calling to her, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.
She ignored them but Salah walked over before grabbing her and pushing her up against a wall.
He then sexually assaulted her over her clothing.
After his friend tried to drag him away, the woman rang police and screamed at Salah: "You're not getting away with this."
Det Con Richard Hudd said she "decided to try and bring him to justice by following him until officers showed up".
In a "harrowing" call, police said the woman screamed that a man had tried to rape her and was following her again.
She told them her location before she was heard screaming as the line went dead.
Salah put her in a choke hold while sexually assaulting her.
The victim tried to break free by scratching and biting him.
Two police officers arrived at Albert Park, Salford, where they heard a scream and saw Salah lying on top of the woman.
They tried to pull him away but he resisted to the extent that they were forced to deploy a Taser, police said.
Det Con Hudd said: "Salah was out of control, he could not be restrained by his friend in the first instance and even our trained officers struggled to restrain him when they found him attacking her in the park.
"We must praise the bravery of the victim, who refused to allow Salah to get away with the original assault... Unfortunately in this instance that put her in danger of another attack.
"But thanks to her courage and her determination, Salah is no longer free to subject any other women to the terrible assault he inflicted upon her."
Salah has been ordered to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
