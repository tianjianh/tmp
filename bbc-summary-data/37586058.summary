Spinner Batty, who turns 39 next week, took 41 wickets at an average of 31.21 in the County Championship this year.
His form led to a recall to the England Test squad for the two-match series in Bangladesh later this month.
Left-hander Harinath, 29, scored 707 runs at an average of 35.35 in 11 Championship appearances in 2016.
Batty has also been granted a testimonial year by Surrey in 2017.
