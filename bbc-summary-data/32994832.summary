[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chetham's teacher accused of rape 'says sex was consensual'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A music teacher accused of raping one of his students has admitted in court they had sex but said it was always consensual.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malcolm Layfield, 63, raped the 18-year-old pupil at Manchester's Chetham's School of Music in the early 1980s, Manchester Crown Court heard.
Mr Layfield, of Castle Quay, Castlefield, denies a charge of rape.
He told the court he had affairs with a number of students in the 1980s but saw nothing wrong with it at the time.
But, he told the jury that looking back he now feels "terrible about it".
"I am remorseful and regretful about what happened with these relationships," he said.
It is alleged Mr Layfield raped his pupil in his car after getting her drunk during a music summer school, in the weeks after she left Chetham's.
The defendant agreed they had had sex but insisted it was with her full consent, the court heard.
They had gone on to have a sexual relationship, which lasted for several weeks after she started studying at the Royal Northern College of Music, where he was her tutor.
The jury heard she bought him a set of antique cufflinks as a thankyou present when she graduated from the college.
The trial continues.
