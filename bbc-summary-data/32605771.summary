Thirteen others were wounded in the attack by suspected Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces Islamist rebels.
It was second attack on UN forces in the eastern North Kivu region in 48 hours after a helicopter carrying for the force's commander came under fire.
The UN has promised a "robust" military offensive in response.
Earlier, the Congolese army said it had killed 16 Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels during fierce fighting over the weekend.
The ADF was formed in late 1990s by a puritanical Muslim sect in the Ruwenzori mountains of western Uganda.
The army launched an offensive against the group - one of many based in the mineral-rich east of DR Congo - after they were accused of hacking more than 200 villagers to death near Beni in a series of massacres late last year.
The UN peacekeeping convoy came under attack on Tuesday near the village of Kikiki, about 50km (30 miles) north of Beni.
Four peacekeepers have also been reported missing following the ambush.
"I won't tolerate any more of these repeated attacks against blue helmets in Beni territory," Martin Kobler, head of the UN mission Monusco, said in a tweet in French.
"Monusco will carry out robust offensive operations," he said.
In a statement, the spokesman for UN chief Ban Ki-moon condemned the killings and the "continuing atrocities perpetrated by the ADF against defenceless civilians in the Beni area".
