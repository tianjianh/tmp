[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man broke into the property in General Roy Way in Carluke, South Lanarkshire, at about 03:45 on Tuesday.
He demanded the couple's car keys, but they refused. He then ran off and managed to steal one of the cars which was a grey Volkswagen Golf.
He also took a number of other items, which have since been found in different locations in the town.
PC Craig Jeffrey said: "A woman returned the householder's wallet after finding it and we would like to speak to this woman to establish more information about where it was found.
"I would also appeal to anyone who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously in General Roy Way, or the surrounding area, in the early hours on Tuesday morning to come forward."
