Jealous man guilty of double murder in Norwich

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "angry and jealous man" has been found guilty of murdering his ex-partner and her new boyfriend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Moody, 45, of Kerrison Avenue, Norwich, repeatedly stabbed 39-year-old Karen Brown and Kenneth Snell, aged 65.
The couple's bodies were found at Mr Snell's home in Cringleford, Norfolk, on 31 October 2009.
Moody denied murder at Norwich Crown Court but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He will be sentenced on Friday.
Moody and Ms Brown, who had been in a violent 12-year relationship which ended in 2008, used to run the sandwich shop Baguette Express near Norwich Market.
Moody murdered Ms Brown and Mr Snell after being told of their relationship earlier that day, the court heard.
The prosecution said their deaths were caused by "an angry and jealous man".
But the defence urged jurors to accept Moody was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.
The court heard that Moody "lost his self-control" and drove to Mr Snell's home armed with a hammer and knife.
He smashed through the front door and attacked Ms Brown in the back garden with the weapons, while repeatedly shouting: "Why did you lie?"
The jury was played recordings of the 999 calls made by Ms Brown and Mr Snell.
In the call made by Ms Brown, at 2100 GMT, she is heard to say: "I have got an intruder who is violent, who is aggressive. I don't know who it is."
She then shouts the name "John Moody" twice and is heard to say: "You don't want to do this, do you? Not really."
As the call continues, Moody is heard to ask: "Tell me why you lied?" more than 50 times as groaning sounds and yelps of pain are heard in the background.
Post-mortem examinations showed Ms Brown sustained 13 stab wounds and 31 other injuries.
Several wounds on her forearm suggested she had put her arms up to protect herself, the court heard.
Mr Snell, who sustained seven stab wounds and 38 other injuries, died after being stabbed in the heart.
