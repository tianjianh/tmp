Jersey States spends £5m on future hospital project

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than £5m has been spent on costs attached to Jersey's new hospital project despite a site yet being identified.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Freedom of Information request has revealed almost half the expenditure has been on outside advisors.
The People's Park in St Helier was removed as a potential site following protests and a petition.
Proposed sites are now the current site in the Parade, Overdale Hospital and the St Helier Waterfront.
It could also be built across two sites - Overdale and the current site.
£5.05m
Spent on the 'Future Hospital' project since 2012
£2.5m spent on independent technical and financial advisors
£768,373 spent on the salary of the project team
£375,874 spent relocating social services from Overdale to Eagle House
£116,132 spent on a design champion for the proposed sites
The hospital project has been dogged with controversy since its launch, especially over where it will eventually be built.
The People's Park was removed following the intervention of health minister, Senator Andrew Green.
A consultation into the future location will run for the next 12 weeks before a preferred site is taken to the States for approval.
Senator Green said he would look again at some of the borderline sites to see if they could be included again.
