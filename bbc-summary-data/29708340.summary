England flanker Matt Kvesic has signed a new contract at Gloucester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Germany-born 22-year-old made 63 appearances for Worcester Warriors, before agreeing a move to Kingsholm in February 2013.
Kvesic featured twice in England's Test series against Argentina last year and was also part of their tour of New Zealand this summer.
He has now played 17 games for the Cherry and Whites, including five so far this season.
"It's nice to get it sorted this early in the season," Kvesic told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"It allows me to focus on the rest of the year and it's really exciting times for me.
"I came here hoping I could learn and I feel like I have in the last year.
"This year has been about taking more on myself and going out every week to give the best performances I can."
