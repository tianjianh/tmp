[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lewis Alessandra's debut goal was not enough to stop League Two strugglers York being held to a draw by Barnet.

York took the lead when Jake Hyde's shot cannoned off the right-hand post and Alessandra, on loan from Rochdale, pounced to net from 10 yards.
The visitors levelled just before half-time as John Akinde swept the ball home from James Pearson's right-wing cross.
Danny Galbraith and Luke Summerfield both tested Bees keeper Jamie Stephens but York were unable to find a winner.
The Minstermen are now seven points adrift of safety, following Hartlepool's victory over relegation-threatened rivals Dagenham & Redbridge.

York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York: "We deserved to win on chances created. I felt we could have got that second goal.
They got a lift and there's was very preventable. But, in saying that, we had a number of chances.
"The difference with fight and passion compared to last week was a lot better."

Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC Radio London: "It was always going to be a difficult game.
"I thought we looked a bit lacklustre first half, not quite up to the speed that we've been at, but in the second half I thought we played much, much better.
"I thought we had more opportunities where we perhaps could have won the game."
