Amazon to join railway station parcel pick-up service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Amazon customers will be able to pick-up their parcels from railways stations under a deal struck with a new click-and-collect firm, Doddle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Doddle is a joint venture between Network Rail and Lloyd Dorfman, who made his fortune from the Travelex currency exchange business.
According to Mr Dorfman, Amazon will begin using Doddle in September.
Last year Amazon was in talks with Transport for London about using tube stations as collection points.
It is not clear how the deal with Doddle will affect Amazon's plan to link up with London Underground.
Network Rail and Mr Dorfman are investing Â£24m in Doddle and hope to expand the business to 300 stations.
A pilot operation has been running at Milton Keynes station and Doddle's website said shops in London Cannon Street, Woking, Bromley South, Brighton and Chelmsford stations would "open soon".
But reaching an agreement with Amazon would be a huge boost for the business.
In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Dorfman said: "They're sorting out the systems issues and have agreed to begin using Doddle in September."
