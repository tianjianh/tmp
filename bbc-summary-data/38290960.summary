VisitScotland has teamed up with online travel and lifestyle publisher Matador Network to produce a two-minute video.
It hopes to boost visitor numbers across the Scottish Borders and Midlothian.
It is part of a three-year Â£367,000 marketing campaign to put the railway "on the map" and promote it to national and international markets.
The film features a range of attractions throughout the area including:
VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead said: "The Borders Railway has had a massive impact on the local economy and has encouraged people to come and visit this part of the country from all over the world.
"The momentous re-opening of the historic route last year by the Queen captured the attention of the world's media.
"We want to build on this momentum and continue to shine a spotlight on the regions surrounding the Borders Railway which are now easier than ever before for visitors from the US to explore."
The Borders Railway - between Tweedbank and Edinburgh - was officially opened in September last year.
