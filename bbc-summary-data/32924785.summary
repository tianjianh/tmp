Don Hull: NI doctor calls for specialist cancer drugs fund

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A leading cancer specialist has urged the health minister to introduce a cancer drugs fund in Northern Ireland.

Dr Don Hull, a consultant haematologist at Craigavon Area Hospital, said people living with cancer in Northern Ireland should be given the same treatment as patients in England.
There are 38 cancer drugs available to patients elsewhere in the UK that are not readily available to terminally-ill people in Northern Ireland.
Dr Hull has called for "equal access".
He said: "I think local patients deserve equal access to the funding that is being made available to cancer patients in England.
"I would urge the new minister to take counsel and discuss widely with me colleagues in my profession."
In February, the then-Health Minister Jim Wells proposed the reintroduction of prescription charges to pay for a new specialist drugs fund.
A consultation by the Department of Health (DoH) on how to implement the fund including the possibility of introducing prescription charges to pay for it closed earlier this month.
Cancer charities have said they are awaiting the outcome.
Dr Hull also said that while the number of cancer patients are increasing, so too are advancements in the drugs that can help cure or sustain patients' lives.
He added that while the drugs are not a magic bullet, in some cases they can target the tumour so effectively that all cancer cells are killed.
"I know patients who could avail of these drugs and these drugs are known to be effective," he said.
"They are expensive, but some cancer patients in England and Scotland are accessing them.
"There are many advancements in cancer drugs and there is also a better understanding than ever before of the illness, so we are actually refining our cancer treatments to target particular mutations and abnormalities of the cancer cells that isn't present in normal cells.
"It is good that we can be more specific in our treatment."
Dr Hull was speaking to the BBC against a backdrop of new entertainment stations that have recently been installed in the Macmillan cancer unit at Craigavon Area Hospital.
The Southern Health Trust has spent Â£200,000 on the bedside entertainment scheme, which provides touch screen systems providing access to TV, radio and internet for patients to use during treatments like chemotherapy or blood transfusions.
Staff can also log onto these terminals to access patient records.
For patients like Audrey Fenton, the new screens help pass the time as she receives her chemotherapy three times a week, with each session lasting six hours.
It is gruelling for the former nurse, who refers to chemotherapy as her friend.
"Oh it's definitely a friend because it is part and parcel of getting me well again. I lean on it to help get me through this time," she said.
Audrey is 57 and was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma eight months ago.
She said: "The first thing that goes through your mind on receiving the diagnosis is how long have I got.  No matter what your faith is, your lifestyle - no-one wants to leave their loved ones."
Audrey has no issue with her cancer drugs, but recognises that it is the expertise of her doctors and the advancement of medicine that is keeping her alive.
"There has been a moderate response to the treatment. At the moment the prognosis might be five to seven years, but if the treatment keeps working maybe longer," she said.
"I feel the best I have felt in a long time. I'm staying positive."
Audrey is indeed an extremely positive woman. Her hair perfectly set and her nails painted, Audrey said thinking positive is her mantra.
She added: "I feel I am living with cancer, I am not dying from cancer. I am living with it and the chemotherapy is all part of it.  I will take what they give me to get me well."
With a hearty laugh, Audrey told me that of course she is very scared.
"You couldn't possibly be told you've got a cancer that can't be cured and not be scared," she said.
"I try to look on this time as me time. I have had a busy life and now it's time for me to take time out to get well.
"The chemotherapy is the starting point really of the recovery and I feel you just have to embrace it. The scarier time will be when maybe they tell me it is finished because then you are left on your own, but they will only do that when the results are good enough. "
