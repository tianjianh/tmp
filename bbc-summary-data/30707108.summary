Patrick Lamb, 28, disappeared after a night out in Bar Chocolate on Friday 12 December. He had booked into a hotel in St Michael's Road but did not return.
CCTV captured a number of images of Mr Lamb, who was last sighted on Fairmeadow at about 00:20 GMT on 13 December.
His family said he sometimes "wandered" after having a few drinks.
Mr Lamb's father, Tony Lamb, said: "Patrick was a fun sort of chap, he always had a smile on his face.
"We know he has a history of wandering. We've played every scenario in our heads of what happened, but we're just puzzled about what happened that night.
"We are all aware that he could be dead - it's something which we've all taken on board, but we're still hopeful," he said.
A Facebook campaign has been set up to help find Mr Lamb.
He is described as white, 5ft 7in tall, slim to medium build, with hazel coloured eyes and short dark hair.
His sister Zoe has been distributing flyers and posters to help find her brother
"We've had a few unconfirmed sightings and a few sightings which turned out to be false leads, but nothing that can prove where he is," she said.
Mr Lamb was spotted on CCTV at 00:20 after he had used an alleyway to go onto Earl Street, from where he took a flight of stairs to the side of the River Medway.
At 01:34 his phone went offline from the mobile network.
Searches of the river by specialist police divers have revealed nothing, police said.
Mr Lamb's mother, Sharon, said: "Life has been horrible, we just want him home."
In a tearful appeal to her son, she said: "Pat, if you're out there. Please come home. I miss you."
