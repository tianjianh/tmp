[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 39-year-old has been in charge of the U's since replacing Richard Money in November 2015 but will miss the next 10 days of pre-season training.
Joe Dunne, Derry's assistant, and first-team coach Mick Halsall will take charge in his absence for the club's next four pre-season friendlies.
Derry's Cambridge side just missed out on the League Two play-offs last term.
