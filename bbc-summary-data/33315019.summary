[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tries from Mason Caton-Brown and Ben Jones-Bishop gave Salford a 10-8 half-time lead with Ben Cockayne and Kieran Dixon touching down for the hosts.
After the break, Dane Tilse, Kris Welham and Maurice Blair crossed as the Robins took control and led 26-10.
Jordan Walne, Scott Taylor and Jones-Bishop's second drew Salford level at 28-28, before Kelly's late try won it.
The result moves Hull KR above city rivals Hull FC into the top eight of Super League.
Kelly set up the first try when the Australian broke the line and weighted a grubber perfectly for Cockayne to touch down.
Red Devils forward Cory Paterson ripped the ball from Dixon and played in Caton-Brown, before former Rovers scrum-half Michael Dobson fizzed a beautiful pass out wide for Jones-Bishop to cross.
After struggling to take a number of high kicks, Hull KR full-back Dixon made up for his mistakes by jinking his way through following a flowing passing move.
The hosts took the lead when Tilse and Welham scored from close range, and then Blair barged over as the home side took a 16-point lead.
Jordan Walne and Taylor both hit excellent lines for Salford to touch down, and then Jones-Bishop's second drew them level.
However, from Josh Mantellato's restart the Red Devils let the ball bounce twice and Kelly grabbed it to race through for the winner.
Hull KR assistant coach Willie Poching:
"When you take into consideration the heat, the short turn-around and players who are still short of a gallop after just coming back into it, it was a great win.
"It was a very brave performance to claw it back and a special moment from Albert Kelly."
Salford head coach Iestyn Harris:
"It's very tough to take, we worked desperately hard and showed some real desire to get back into it.
"We were looking strong and I thought we would kick on and sneak it so to concede from the kick off, the players are devastated, as I am."
