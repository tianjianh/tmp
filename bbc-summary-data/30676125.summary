He's no stranger to banter but this time Jimmy Bullard has been on the receiving end.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His name's been trending on Twitter as people mocked his outfit on Match of the Day.
The former Fulham midfielder appeared alongside Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer for Arsenal v Hull in the FA Cup.
Hair tied back and wearing a black shirt, which was half unbuttoned, he was likened to Peter Stringfellow and Harry Styles in 20 years.
"Just turned on Match of the Day, so late to this, but Jimmy Bullard seems to have come as a Flamenco dancer..." wrote â€
