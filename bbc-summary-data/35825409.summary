Steve Becker, 56, who had worked for the station since 1988, was driving to Blackpool on the M6 in the morning.
Mr Becker, from Chorley, was Radio Lancashire's Fylde Coast reporter.
John Clayton, Radio Lancashire Managing Editor said staff were "utterly shocked and deeply saddened".
He added: "Our thoughts are with his wife Kath and his kids."
Mr Clayton said: "He was a dedicated and compassionate journalist who commanded the respect of his colleagues, our listeners and the whole Lancashire community.
"In the last few years, he had immersed himself in the issue of fracking and was committed to bringing our listeners the very best coverage of a story that directly affects so many of their lives and also attracts national headlines.
"We are all heartbroken at the sudden death of such a valued colleague and friend, who has worked here for so long."
Aziz Rashid, the head of regional and local programming for the BBC in the North West, said: "He will be much missed by so many people but especially the team at Radio Lancashire, where he was such a vital part of the newsroom.
"He emailed me only yesterday to discuss his plans to cover the latest developments in the story of fracking in Lancashire. He had become a real authority on the issue."
James Harding, the BBC's Head of News said: "His death will leave a void for many listeners.
"I know that everyone who has been lucky enough to work with him over his 30 plus years at the BBC will be shocked and saddened."
Mr Becker, a Senior Broadcast Journalist, joined the BBC in August 1983 and had worked at Radio Merseyside before moving in 1988 to Radio Lancashire, where he had also presented programmes.
