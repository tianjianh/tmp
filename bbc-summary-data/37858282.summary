Noon, who has been assistant for more than a decade, is to pursue ambitions in elite coaching.
The announcement came two days after academy director Chris Tolley's 20-year career at Notts, who were relegated to Division Two in 2016, ended.
"This has been a big decision and not one that I have taken lightly," Noon told the club website.
Noon helped engineer two County Championship titles alongside director of cricket Mick Newell and has worked with England's one-day set-up in the last 12 months.
"It's sad to see Wayne go because he's achieved a lot with Notts, over a long period of time and he's very well liked and respected here," said Newell.
