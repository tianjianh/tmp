Matthew Williams killed Cerys Yemm, 22, at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Argoed, two weeks after his release from jail.
Williams, 34, also died after being Tasered by police.
PC Alison Perry, who visited him in prison, said he did not want to engage with any help available to him.
The officer told the inquest in Newport Williams told her he intended to serve his entire sentence so he could not be made subject to any controls by the probation service.
She said he told her: "I've done my time, I'm a free man. I don't want any involvement with police or probation again."
PC Perry said before Williams was released from prison, she made contact with his ex-partner, mother and other family members.
She said she drew up a safety plan for them which she described as standard procedure.
PC Perry said she hoped Williams' mother would have been able to encourage him to engage with the support services available.
She said she spoke to Williams' mother when he was released and was told he had been picked up from the prison by his father and they had tried to get housing in Newport.
PC Perry said Mrs Williams told her Newport council had said Williams was the responsibility of Caerphilly council, which subsequently housed him in the Sirhowy Arms in Argoed.
She said she had no concerns about that accommodation as "it was one of the better places".
PC Perry also told the inquest intelligence had been received that led to a search warrant being used in Williams' room to search it for drugs, but none were found.
The inquest was told there was nothing else that required a police response until the fatal attack on 6 November 2014.
The inquest continues.
