The 20-year-old from Seaforde clocked 2:03.70 at the British Para-swimming trials for Rio in Glasgow.
Firth, a 2012 London Paralympics gold medallist, had already achieved the 100m breaststroke and 100m backstroke qualifying times at the trials.
She will compete in the 200m Individual Medley on Wednesday.
Firth won the 200m freestyle by two seconds from Jessica-Jane Applegate with Chloe Davies back in third.
The Co Down woman represented Ireland at the 2012 Games before her decision to switch allegiance to Great Britain in 2013.
Last year Firth had to pull out of the British team for the IPC World Championships because of a broken wrist.
After this week's British trials, Firth will head to Madeira for the European Championships which take place in Madeira from 30 April to 7 May.
