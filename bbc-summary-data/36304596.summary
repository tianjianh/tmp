'Cannibal' who saved ear to eat later jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A self-proclaimed cannibal has been jailed for biting off part of a stranger's ear and putting it in his pocket to eat later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Garth Anderton, 24, has an obsession with cannibalism, vampires and serial killers and had previously drunk his own blood, Exeter Crown Court was told.
Anderton, from Manchester, admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and three assaults.
He was jailed for six years with a five-year extended licence.
Anderton claimed Euan Turner had been laughing at him on New Year's morning in Paignton, Devon, when he attacked him and bit off the bottom third of his ear.
When police arrived he told them: "I bit his ear off and I ate it. I am a cannibal."
After officers found the ear in the zip pocket of his tracksuit bottoms, he said: "It was chewy. I was saving it for later."
Recorder Andrew Maitland said: "One thing which causes me great concern is that when you were arrested you gave the name Richard Trenton [an American serial killer]. That was no coincidence. The psychiatrist established you have a pre-occupation with serial killers.
"You told the probation [service] that you enjoyed every second of it. You said you taught Mr Turner a lesson and felt pretty proud.
"You admitted you had said the ear was chewy and had said 'yum yum'.
"I have no hesitation in concluding you pose a serious risk to the public."
Mr Turner suffered facial injuries and the loss of a third of his ear.
Martin Salloway, mitigating, said Anderton had a history of mental illness and this lay behind his actions.
Anderton had failed to take prescribed medication and used alcohol and illegal drugs on the night of the attack.
