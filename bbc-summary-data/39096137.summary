Rob Howley's team face Ireland at home and France away after  losing to the Scots for the first time since 2007.
"We felt we silenced the crowd in the first half first 40 minutes I thought we were outstanding," he said.
"But they have just fed off our mistakes, forcing that offload it was a very disappointing day in the office."
Wales led 13-9 at half time after full-back Leigh Halfpenny had missed a penalty to put them 16-6 ahead after 37 minutes.
But the Scots scored 20 unanswered points after the break with Webb saying Wales' mistakes handed the momentum to the home team who now face England for the Calcutta Cup and Triple Crown on 11 March.

"It was a game of two halves, and maybe we could have been one more score ahead coming into the break," added Webb who along with Sam Warburton was Wales' outstanding player on the day.
"We talked about coming out strong at the start of the second half but we just didn't have that momentum.
"Our discipline let us down basics, sloppy errors slipped into our game and allowed Scotland into the match..
"But we have to pick ourselves up now when we get back analyse that and be honest with ourselves. Look, we've got two tough games left and I'm sure we'll finish strong.
"Ireland at home and France away, we've beaten them before and we look forward to it now."
Webb believes Scotland will be a strong challenge for England at Twickenham, and would like them to win a Triple Crown.
"Scotland have some on leaps and bounds," he said.
"They've got some dangerous players in that back three, they're a tough team to play against and hopefully they can do a job on England.
"I've got nothing against England, they're both two good teams and obviously Scotland have beaten Ireland, beaten us and are on for the Triple Crown so obviously it would be good for Scotland to go and win that."
