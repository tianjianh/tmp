Grimsby Town 2-0 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grimsby eased to a derby win over 10-man Lincoln City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Mariners took the lead when Omar Bogle's deep cross was headed home by striker partner Padraig Amond.
Luke Waterfall was sent off before the break for bringing down Amond when he was running in on goal.
The hosts dominated after the restart and Bogle hammered a 20-yard effort just over before Nathan Arnold made the points safe with a powerful shot that gave Imps keeper Paul Farman no chance.
Lincoln are now without a win in their last six league matches while Grimsby have won all of their last six league games.
Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside:

"It's only three points but it's a nice three points. It's great to send that crowd home happy. Fantastic atmosphere, big build-up and we got the result I think we all wanted.
"I thought the first half was scrappy overall. I thought we looked the more likely (to score).
"The message at half-time was to start passing the ball to each other. I think when we did that, every time we passed the ball we created chances."
Match ends, Grimsby Town 2, Lincoln City 0.
