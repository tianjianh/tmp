Calais crisis: Government 'has got a grip' says Hammond

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK has "got a grip" on the migrant crisis in Calais, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said, as he confirmed 100 more guards would be deployed in its Eurotunnel terminal.

Mr Hammond was speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee.
And he said the measures employed so far were "already having an effect".
A French police union said there were 1,700 migrant "intrusions" at a Channel Tunnel freight terminal overnight.
The updated strategy for Calais announced by the foreign secretary includes:
Mr Hammond also said the previously arranged fencing work at Calais is "proceeding on schedule"
He said: "I think we have got a grip on the crisis. We saw a peak last week, since when the number of illegal migrants has tailed off.
"We have taken a number of measures in collaboration with the French authorities and Eurotunnel which are already having an effect, and over the next day or two I would expect to have an even greater effect."
He also said the UK government was working with the French authorities on a joint plan to support returns to country of origin by illegal migrants seeking to enter the UK and those who are in the Calais area.
The Road Haulage Association has urged David Cameron, who is on holiday, to visit Calais, but Mr Hammond would not be drawn on whether the prime minister's trip should be cut short.
On Monday, it was also announced that landlords in England would be expected to evict tenants who lost the right to remain in the UK, under new measures to clamp down on illegal immigration.
The new measures come as French police figures suggested 70% of migrants processed in Calais leave within four months.
"They cannot ascertain whether these migrants leave to go elsewhere in France, or whether they enter the UK," Kent Police Chief Constable Alan Pughsley told the UK Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee.
The prime minister's official spokeswoman stressed there was "no evidence" all of those leaving Calais were reaching the UK, adding that there is "anecdotal evidence" suggesting some seek opportunities elsewhere in France or in Europe.
It is estimated there are 3,000 migrants in the Calais area, and many are continuing their attempts to reach the UK by crossing the Channel.
There have been thousands of attempts to access the Eurotunnel terminal in recent weeks. Nine people have died trying to access the tunnel since the start of June.
Some attempt to stow away on lorries headed for the Eurotunnel, or climb or cut security fences to try to hide on Eurotunnel shuttles.
