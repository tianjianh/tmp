The attack at the Regency Hotel killed David Byrne from Crumlin. Two other men were injured during the shooting on 5 February.
The armed gang were disguised as police officers and armed with AK47 rifles.
The man in his 20s was arrested in north Dublin on Friday.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) have said they believed at least six men were involved in the attack.
The shooting took place during the weigh-in for a World Boxing Organisation (WBO) title fight in Dublin.
The attack is considered to be part of a violent feud between two rival gangs in Dublin that has so far claimed the lives of at least five men.
