Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson threw for 224 and two touchdowns in a 26-6 victory over the Detroit Lions.
It was the Seahawks's 10th consecutive post-season victory at home.
Earlier in Houston, the Texans overpowered rookie third-choice quarterback Connor Cook to beat the Oakland Raiders 27-14.
The Raiders were without starting quarterback Derek Carr, who broke his leg in the penultimate game of the regular season, and his back-up Matt McGloin.
It took Oakland, making their first post-season appearance since the 2002 term, until the fourth quarter to pass 100 total yards by which time the game was out of sight.
In Seattle, Thomas Rawls set a record when he became the first Seahawks running back to post 100 or more rushing yards in the first half of a post-season game.
The victory set up an NFC divisional round trip to the second-seed Atlanta Falcons on Saturday.
The remaining two wildcard games take place on Sunday when the Miami Dolphins visit the Pittsburgh Steelers (18:05 GMT) before the Green Bay Packers host the New York Giants (21:40).
The Texans will face either the New England Patriots or the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC divisional round next weekend, depending on the result in Pittsburgh.
