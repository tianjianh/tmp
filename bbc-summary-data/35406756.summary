West Bromwich Albion 1-1 Swansea City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salomon Rondon's injury-time goal rescued a point for West Brom and denied Francesco Guidolin a second Premier League win as Swansea boss.

Gylfi Sigurdsson's second-half strike from 12 yards looked to have secured victory for the visitors.
But Albion, with Saido Berahino on the bench a day after Newcastle had a £21m offer rejected for the striker, scrambled in a 92nd-minute leveller.
It moved the Baggies up to 13th, while Swansea drop to 16th.
It had looked an unlikely win for the hosts, as Tony Pulis's side failed to apply late pressure after Sigurdsson's tidy finish past goalkeeper Ben Foster.
But a penalty-area scramble was kept alive by a brave header from substitute Victor Anichebe, and even though Sigurdsson cleared Darren Fletcher's shot off the line, Venezuelan Rondon was on hand to bundle in his fifth goal of the season.
Scotland international Darren Fletcher had been West Brom's biggest goal threat up until that point, squandering three headed chances, and Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski made a string of impressive saves, including a sharp stop from Anichebe.
But it was the introduction of Berahino just after the hour mark which brought the home support to life, with a noticeable chorus of boos accompanying the 22-year-old's arrival, although their disapproval was aimed at Pulis for removing Stephane Sessegnon, who had been one of the Baggies' most forward-thinking players on the night.
In fact, fans had been chanting for the introduction of Berahino, who damaged his relationship with The Hawthorns contingent by saying he would never play for them again when he was denied a move in the summer.
And even though Monday's big-money offer from Newcastle was rejected, and despite coming into the game with a dead leg, he looked lively and committed for the Albion cause.
"I'm pleased the window is over," said Pulis, who received boos again at the final whistle by fans who perceive his style of play as too negative. "It's been speculation after speculation and he's a young boy who watches the TV and sees all the internet stuff. Hopefully he gets back to full fitness."
Guidolin has changed little in the way Swansea play during his two games in charge, as his side persisted with the possession football they have become known for.
But it was a forced change before half-time that put the Welsh club into the ascendancy, when a head injury to Ki Sung-yueng saw new signing Alberto Paloschi come on and make an instant impression.
The January arrival from Italian side Chievo, who made a name for himself as a 17-year-old by scoring 20 seconds into his AC Milan debut, added the power and hold-up play Swansea have often been lacking.

He forced the Swans' goal by hassling Baggies defender Gareth McAuley, who could only divert Leon Britton's pass into the path of Sigurdsson for the opener, and hit the post with his own effort minutes later.
But the late equaliser and the relinquishing of two points means Guidolin's side are placed precariously, just five points above the relegation zone.
West Brom boss Tony Pulis:

"I think their keeper made some great saves and we had wonderful opportunities. Fletcher could have had four by himself.
"We're relieved we got something out of it but we really should have won the game.
"We're not on a bad run, the problem is we're not winning games, we're drawing games. We're a point closer to 40 points."
Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin:
"At the beginning of the night 1-1 could be a good result but at the end I'm disappointed.
"My team played very well for all the match. I can look at the positives. We had a victory sensation but this is football.
"Paloschi is a good player and he played very well. I know his ambition and that he has quality. I hope he can score many goals for us."
Both sides are in action again on Saturday, with West Brom travelling to relegation-threatened Newcastle and Swansea hosting Crystal Palace.
