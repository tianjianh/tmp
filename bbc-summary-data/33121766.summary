Curry Mallet unveils new Magna Carta signs marking anniversary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the smallest communities involved in Magna Carta celebrations has unveiled new signs to mark its 800th anniversary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Curry Mallet is one of 25 locations celebrating the signing of charter by King John in Runnymede on 15 June 1215.
Magna Carta established that the king was subject to the law rather than being above it.
William Malet, the feudal baron of Curry Mallet, born around 1175, was one of Magna Carta's guarantors.
The former Lord of the Manor of the village was one of the 25 rebel barons present at the signing.
A district council grant helped the village commission the signs by Somerset-based designer Belinda Magee.
Ms Magee worked with the Curry Mallet community to create a theme that reflected the "heritage" of the village.
With a population of 306, Curry Mallet is one of the smallest communities involved in the celebrations, and the furthest south west, the council added.
Village events over the anniversary weekend include taking part in a national peal of bells, choral performances, a pageant and a re-enactment of the sealing of Magna Carta.
