Wales face England in the second game of the group stage on 16 June in Lens.
They play Slovakia in the opening game on 11 June and Russia the final match of Group B on 20 June.
'I've got a strong feeling that we won't lose to England, even though they've had a good result against Germany," Rush told BBC Wales Sport.
Rush feels Chris Coleman's side will be full of confidence when they come up against Roy Hodgson's men.
"The first game is vital - you don't lose the first game," Rush said.
"After that, we'll go into the England game full of confidence."
Rush, who scored 28 goals in 73 games for his country, feels Wales are a side most teams would rather avoid in France, but believes this is just the start of the nation's football ascent.
"When you've got Bale and Ramsay in the side, as well as the defence we've got, teams won't want to play us," said Rush.

"I'm looking at it as the start of something big. The easiest thing is getting there; the hardest thing is doing it over and over again.
'We're going to have incredible support out there. We've had a good Euros, so let's take it to the World Cup."
Rush, who won five First Division titles and two European Cups with Liverpool, feels the tournament could be won by a number of nations.
Speaking ahead of weakened weakened Wales' 1-0 friendly defeat by Ukraine, Rush added: "I think this is a wide open Euros. I think five or six teams could win it.
"England beating Germany tells you something about it.
"But France will be favourites because it's in France and they've got a good side."
