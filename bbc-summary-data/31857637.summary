[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rocks shut A82 between Invermoriston and Drumnadrochit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two large rocks have fallen on to the A82 about two miles (3km) north of Invermoriston in the Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The road was partially open for a time following the rock fall at midday.
But police, in consultation with Bear Scotland and Forestry Commission Scotland, have now shut the A82 from Invermoriston to Drumnadrochit.
Forestry staff have been searching the area to find the location of the fallen boulders so they can check for other loose rocks.
