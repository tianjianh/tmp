The police watchdog is investigating the death of a man who collapsed in custody.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 44-year-old was arrested in Reading on Saturday afternoon on suspicion of assault and a drugs offence and was taken to nearby Loddon Valley Police Station.
Officers became concerned for his welfare and took him to hospital.
He was discharged the same day but was then found unresponsive in his cell on Sunday and died later, police said.
Formal identification has not taken place yet but the man's next of kin have been informed.
He was found unresponsive in his cell at about 04:00 BST on Sunday and was declared dead in hospital an hour later, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said.
It is mandatory for cases involving the death of detainees to be referred to the IPCC.
Det Ch Supt Tim De Meyer said Thames Valley Police was "co-operating fully" with the investigation.
"Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time," he added.
