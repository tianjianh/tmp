School lessons you remember today

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pi = 3.142, the Lord's Prayer & E=MC2 - all lessons we remember from school, according to a survey by Ripley's Believe It or Not! You have been sharing the little nuggets of info that you just can't forget.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Below is a selection of your tweets. More can be found here.
Poetry in particular seems to be something you can't forget, especially for Laura Sewell who memorised Robert Browning's Home Thoughts, from Abroad.
Others have retained more scientific-based information, useful little titbits like @VikashPatel94's memory: "Wasps sting is alkaline, Bees sting is acidic. Year 7 Chemistry."
@samagona remembers: "when an object is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid,  it displaces an equivalent of its mass"
While @LisaLeeM advises: "osmosis is the passage of water through a semi-permeable membrane. 7th grade" and @tsimeriani says: "Definitely Bhaskara's formula".
Moving away from maths and science, and over to the linguists - where would we be without knowing how to ask the way to the post office, or discovering the price of a coffee?
Remember one Roman chap who was often found in various rooms of the house? @mrnerdzesq does: "Caecilius est in horto!" (For those of us without Latin on our CV it means Caecilius is in the garden).
Sticking with Latin and ‚Äè@PeterDenston is feeling the love: "Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis, amant. The Latin verb amo, conjugated in the indicative."
And a sugary memory for @inwest:
But sometimes the information is just taking up brain space:
And then there are those of you who are still learning!
