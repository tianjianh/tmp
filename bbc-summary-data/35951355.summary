The Tunisia Football Federation (TFF) lifted a suspension on Belgium-based Hamdi Harbaoui after the striker apologised for his misconduct at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations.

The 31-year-old was axed from the Carthage Eagles after he criticised the attitude of his teammates and the choice of coach Sami Trabelsi following their group stage exit in South Africa.
The TFF said the player could return to the national squad again "after apologising to the federal government and the country's football authority."
The statement added that the decision to recall the Lokeren striker into the international fold will be at the discretion of the current coach Henri Kasperczak.
Harbaoui, who burst on to the international scene with Tunisia in 2012, scored a brace on his international debut in a 5-1 friendly win at home to Rwanda in May that year.
Five days later he grabbed his third international goal in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against Equatorial Guinea as the Carthage Eagles earned a comfortable 3-1 home win.
He made seven more appearances for his country, started the first two games at the 2013 Nations Cup, but coach Trabelsi's decision to leave him out of the final group game against Togo led to a public outburst.
Harbaoui started his career at Esperance before moving to Belgian side Mouscron on loan in 2008.
He went on to play for Vis√©, OH Leuven and spent a season at Qatari club Qatar SC.
His biggest success comes across two spells with Lokeren, where he won the 2011/12 Belgian Cup by scoring the only goal in the final against Kortrijk.
Harbaoui won the Belgian Cup again in the 2013/14 season and also finished as the Belgian Pro League's top scorer with 22 goals in 33 games.
