Head coach Alan Solomons wants Edinburgh to develop a more ruthless streak in order to keep climbing the Pro12 table.

A 28-13 win over Treviso leaves them three points behind leaders Leinster.
"I thought we left the bonus point out there," Solomons told BBC Scotland. "There were three cold opportunities for more tries.
"But, baring in mind we were coming in after two massive derby games, it was a creditable performance."
Following back-to-back wins over local rivals and defending champions Glasgow, Edinburgh eased to a hat-trick of victories at Murrayfield.
Winger Damien Hoyland touched down twice and bottom of the table Treviso conceded a penalty try but there were good chances to add to the score.
"The big thing for us is to make sure we are clinical when it comes to finishing," added Solomons.
"We are creating opportunities, we need to finish them off."
Solomons, 65, is in his third season with Edinburgh, finishing eighth in the past two Pro12 campaigns.
"I'm pleased with where we are," he said. "The league is a marathon, it's not a sprint, and there's a long way to go.
"But when I think back to 2013, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made."
Much of this term's success has been down to a solid defensive platform, aided by the performances of stand-out back-row John Hardie.
"The task was to rebuild the club and you need to make sure your conditioning is right and your defence and set-piece are right," explained Solomons.
"We've worked hard this year on evolving out attack but we don't want to take anything away from our set-piece and defence."
Solomons hailed man-of-the-match Hoyland as "an outstanding young talent", adding: "He's definitely got a bit of x-factor about him.
"If he continues to work hard and progress, he has every prospect of playing international rugby."
Even with 10 players missing through injury, Solomons wants to give some of his squad a break after a punishing recent schedule.
Agen visit Murrayfield next weekend in the Challenge Cup and the South African said: "We are certainly going to rest some players and do some sort of rotation.
"The emphasis during the week has to be on rest and recovery."
