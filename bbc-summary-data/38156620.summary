The accolade was awarded by cycling's international governing body, the UCI.
The Scottish event was held in June and drew a crowd of almost 20,000 people.
The competition forms the third stage of the UCI World Cup Downhill championships and was first held 14 years ago.
The competitions are held on a course at Nevis Range, near Fort William.
This year, British downhill rider Rachel Atherton won the women's final for the ninth consecutive time.
Salisbury-born Atherton finished 12 seconds ahead of second-placed Tracey Hannah, from Australia.
Manon Carpenter, from Caerphilly, South Wales, recovered from a crash to finish third.
South African Greg Minaar won the men's final. The USA's Aaron Gwin was second and Danny Hart, from Redcar, third.
