Sir Terry Wogan: BBC Radio 2 to broadcast memorial service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial service for Sir Terry Wogan at Westminster Abbey is to be broadcast live on BBC Radio 2.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The service will be held on 27 September - the 50th anniversary of the presenter's first BBC radio broadcast.
It will be accompanied by a series of tribute shows on the station and a BBC One programme looking back at his life.
Sir Terry, who died in January, hosted the Radio 2 breakfast show from 1972-1984 and 1993-2009, and fronted TV shows like Wogan and Blankety Blank.
BBC director general Tony Hall said: "He had a unique and welcoming style combined with a mischievous sense of humour and his personality will shine through in these programmes."
Two hundred and fifty tickets for the Westminster Abbey service will be available in a ballot via the BBC Radio 2 website. The ballot is open now and will close at 19:00 BST on Thursday.
The lunchtime service will be part of a special edition of Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, during which Vine will also speak to listeners about their memories of Sir Terry.
A two-part special, titled Thank You For Being My Friend - A Tribute to Terry Wogan, will feature interviews with his friends and colleagues and will be aired on Radio 2 from 22:00 BST on 26 and 27 September.
The BBC One tribute has the working title Sir Terry Wogan Remembered: Fifty Years at the BBC.
In January, Sir Terry's family said the 77-year-old had died "after a short but brave battle with cancer".
