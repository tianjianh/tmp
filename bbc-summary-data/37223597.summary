Doctors from Wythenshawe Hospital described a rare case of what they called "bagpipe lung" in a 61-year-old patient, in the journal Thorax.
Bruce Campbell's daughter, Erin Tabinor said his family was not told his hobby had been connected to his death.
The trust which runs the hospital apologised for "any distress".
University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust (UHSM) has launched an internal investigation.
The report said Mr Campbell developed a bad reaction to mould and fungi lurking inside the moist interior of his bagpipes.
Ms Tabinor said while Mr Campbell was not named in the report, people soon made the connection.
"[Piping] was his passion, it was one of the loves of his life. There was my mother, me, my sister and piping," she said.
"I think it is a complete breach of his privacy. I think it is a breach of his confidentiality."
Doctors at Wythenshawe Hospital sent Mr Campbell's bagpipes to the laboratory, the report said, and the instrument was riddled with the types of mould and fungi that can cause lung problems.
However, Ms Tabinor said her family was not told this in 2014 when Mr Campbell died and was shocked his case was used in the journal without any consultation.
Her father had cleaned his bagpipes regularly, she said, adding: "He knew exactly what he had to do. He was an expert in this."
She added: "I want to find out exactly what has happened. I want to know how it was missed... why they didn't tell us, why they didn't bother to let us know about this, and I want a full investigation into his death."
Medical Director at UHSM Dr John Crampton, said: "We would like to apologise for any distress experienced by the family following the publication of the case study.
"In light of the serious concerns raised, the trust has launched an internal investigation, which is ongoing. We have also offered to meet with the family to listen to and discuss their concerns further."
