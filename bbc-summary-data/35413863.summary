The reported shots were heard in the basement of Building 26 of Naval Medical Center in San Diego, California.
First responders and Navy units are on the scene clearing the building, which houses injured soldiers, the Navy confirmed in a statement.
The hospital's Facebook page warned of a possible active shooter situation.
The message advised people in the area to "run, hide or fight".
There have been no reports of injuries, and an initial sweep of the building shows no evidence of a shooting. Naval dogs are doing a second search.
The hospital complex is on lockdown and those inside have been ordered to "shelter in place", the Navy said.
With over 6,500 personnel, the hospital serves wounded soldiers and serves as a training facility for nursing schools in the area.
All personnel have been asked to stay away from the building.
Local and military law enforcement and highway patrol are on the scene.
