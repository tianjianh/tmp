Matthew Grimstone
Parents Sue and Phil and brothers David and Paul paid an emotional tribute to the footballer, who played for Worthing United.
They said: "The family are in total shock at losing our dearest son Matthew so tragically at 23 years old.
"He was the kindest person you could ever meet, with a great wit.
"In his 23 years, we can honestly say he never lost his temper."
The family went on to say that football was his passion in life and he loved working at Brighton & Hove Albion as well as playing for Worthing United. He had also been a referee.
"Matt has been taken from us at just 23 and we still think he is going to walk through the front door any minute now."
Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club say he was on his way to play for Worthing United against Loxwood in the Southern Combination Premier Division at Lyons Way at the time of the air crash, along with his Mavericks teammate Jacob Schilt.
Mr Grimstone, 23, worked at the club for the past seven years - starting with the Albion as part of the match day event team at Withdean.
Chief executive Paul Barber said: "Matt's been a very popular member of our ground staff team and has proved to be an absolute credit to the club and his boss Steve Winterburn."
Worthing United FC released a statement, saying:  "Grimbles was our first team goalkeeper, 23 years of age and a huge talent, quiet and reserved but a brilliant player with a huge potential to go further in the game."
Jacob Schilt
Seagulls supporter Mr Schilt was travelling with his Mavericks teammate Matthew Grimstone when their vehicle was hit by the aircraft.
Alongside Mr Grimstone, Mr Schilt was part of Worthing United's Sussex County League Division Two championship-winning side last season, and also played for an Albion supporters' team in this year's Robert Eaton Memorial Fund (REMF) match against Crystal Palace at Lewes in April.
Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club paid tribute to him, with chairman Tony Bloom saying: "The thoughts and prayers of everybody at the club are with Matt and Jacob's family and friends at this shocking time. Our thoughts are also with all the people who have lost loved ones in this horrendous accident."
Chief executive Paul Barber added: "I got to know Jacob as one of the REMF squad, during the coaching sessions we held leading up to this year's charity match against Crystal Palace. As well as being a very good footballer, Jacob is a popular and impressive young man."
Worthing United FC released a statement, saying: "Jacob, who was 23 years of age, small in stature and a tenacious midfielder, was very skilful with an eye for goal."
"At this point we don't know how or if we will cope with this. Worthing Utd is a family, part of the football family, we have been moved by the number of tributes to them that we have received form our fellow clubs and from the public."
Mr Schilt and Mr Grimstone attended the same secondary school, Varndean, leaving in 2008.
The school said in a statement: "It is with great sadness that we remember former students Matt Grimstone and Jacob Schilt who died tragically at the weekend in the Shoreham Airshow crash.
"Jacob's father, Bob Schilt, was a teacher at the school from 1989 to 2009 and is remembered affectionately by staff who knew him."
Matt Jones
Matt Jones, 24, a personal trainer, was named on Facebook by his sister Becky Jones as one of the dead.
She wrote: "Thank you to everyone who has messaged me. We are devastated to say Matt Jones was one of the fatalities."
Maurice Abrahams
Chauffeur Maurice Abrahams, 76, from Brighton, was driving his "beloved Daimler" when the plane crashed.
It has been widely reported that he was on his way to pick up a bride for her wedding.
His family issued a statement through Sussex Police: "Maurice is a well-respected and loved father and husband. He enjoyed his work chauffeuring his beloved Daimler car and he enjoyed gardening.
"He was proud to have served in the Grenadier Guards and the Parachute Regiment. He served in Cyprus and Bahrain with the UN. In his 30s he served as a police officer with Hampshire Police."
Mark Reeves
The family of Mark Reeves, 53, said he died while combining two of his favourite hobbies, riding his cherished Honda motorbike to photograph planes at an air show.
He was a computer-aided design technician in west London who fundraised for cancer charities by parachuting and abseiling.
His family said in a statement: "Mark Reeves - motorbiker, golfer, photographer, fund-raiser - but above all else, son, brother, husband, father and grandfather.
"As many times before, he had travelled to an air show and parked up on the outskirts to grab the best photos, but he had never been to the Shoreham air show before.
"We will remember him as a gentle, loving, incredibly giving family man, husband to Wendy, father to Luke, granddad to three beautiful grand-daughters, brother to Denise and loving son of Ann and Kenneth.
"With his family he moved to Seaford nine years ago, drawn by our love of the sea and for Mark in particular, love of the sun.
"He was a sun worshipper and an enthusiastic holidaymaker, travelling to Fuerteventura and Madeira in recent years and would often be seen relaxing with a cocktail in hand.
"We thank everyone who has sent their love, condolences and prayers and while we appreciate that many others will be experiencing similar unspeakable grief in such tragic and public circumstances, that we now be allowed to grieve ourselves in private and in peace."
Tony Brightwell
The family of Tony Brightwell, 53, from Hove, said he was enjoying his passion of watching planes and cycling before he died.
Outside of being a health care manager for Sussex Partnership NHS and Brighton and Hove City Council, he was an aircraft enthusiast and had learnt to fly at Shoreham airfield.
With his pilot's licence, he had attended the airfield many times and was hoping to fly again one day.
His fiancee Lara said she is heartbroken that their "plans to spend their lives in the sun will now never happen".
"I watched him cycle off into the sun on his treasured ridgeback bike to watch the air show at Shoreham for a couple of hours, but he never came home," she said.
Daniele Polito
Daniele Polito was in the same car as Matt Jones, when the Hawker Hunter plane crashed and exploded on the A27 in West Sussex.
Posting on Facebook, his sister Marina said: "I miss you loads already little (big) bro! Keep making people smile."
Ms Polito said that many people loved her brother and would "miss him loads".
"I would just like to say a massive thank you to every one who has supported my family over the last few painful days.
"I am overwhelmed by the kindness you have all shown. I know many people loved him and will miss him loads,
"As long as we keep him in our hearts and memories, he will never really leave us."
Mark Trussler
Window cleaner and builder Mark Trussler is thought to have been riding his motorbike on the A27 when the plane crashed on Saturday.
His fiancee Giovanna Chirico posted a message on Facebook saying that her worst fears had been confirmed.
She wrote: "Yesterday my worst fears were confirmed and I lost not just my fiance but my best friend, soul mate and sidekick.
"No words can describe how much all ur family and friends r going to miss u.
"So glad I got to spend the last 12 years of my life with u an love u always and eternally."
Dylan Archer
Dylan Archer was on a cycle ride with his friend Richard Smith when he died in the crash.
Mr Archer, an IT company director, was raised in the Midlands and came to live in Brighton in 1991. He leaves a partner, Alice, and their two sons aged 15 and 12.
The family said in a statement: "Dylan was a kind and loving father, partner, brother, grandson and friend. His dry humour and generous nature will be greatly missed by all who knew him.
"The family are very touched by all the tributes, and thank everyone for their kindness and generosity."
Richard Smith
Richard Smith, 26, from Hove, was brought up in Buckinghamshire before going to university in Birmingham. His family moved to Hampshire in 2008 and he worked in a cycle shop in Cosham. He moved to Hove two years ago where he worked in marketing and web development.
His family said: "Richard's passions in life were for his family, friends and his beloved bikes. His boundless enthusiasm was infectious. He was a truly wonderful, caring and loving person. He will be so sorely missed by all who knew him."
He leaves a partner Victoria, parents Julie and Jonathan, and brothers William and Edward.
Retired engineer, Graham Mallinson, 72, had been hoping to capture shots of the Vulcan bomber which was making one of its last appearances at Shoreham Airshow when he was killed.
The keen photographer from Newick, East Sussex, was described as being "at the right place at the wrong time, doing what he loved best on a beautiful summer's day," when the jet crashed.
In a statement, his family said: "He was the kindest and most generous man, who regularly gave his time to help others. Always loyal and reliable, he was a private and loving family man with a great sense of humour.
"A very caring husband and father who was dearly loved, he will be very sorely missed by all his family and the wide circle of friends who had the good fortune to know him."
