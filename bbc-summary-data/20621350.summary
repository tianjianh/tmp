The EuroMillions ticket for the 8 June draw was bought in the Stevenage or Hitchin area of Hertfordshire.
The missing ticket-holder matched all five numbers - 5, 11, 22, 34 and 40 - and the Lucky Star numbers - 9 and 11.
The deadline to claim the money was 23:00 GMT on Wednesday. It is the biggest unclaimed lottery win in history.
A National Lottery spokeswoman said: "Unfortunately, I can confirm that the ticket-holder did not come forward within the deadline to claim their prize and has now sadly missed out on this staggering amount of money.
"The vast majority of prizes are claimed within the 180 days but to avoid this unfortunate situation happening again, we would urge all National Lottery players to check their tickets on a regular basis."
The money, and the interest it has generated, will go to the National Lottery Good Causes.
