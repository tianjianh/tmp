Calais migrant crisis: France sends extra police to Channel Tunnel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
France is to send 120 extra police officers to Calais as the migrant crisis there escalates.

Migrants attempting to reach Britain told the BBC they would keep trying to enter the Channel Tunnel, despite one man dying there on Tuesday night.
Operation Stack is due to continue into the weekend with some 3,600 lorries queuing on the M20. Severe delays are also affecting travellers.
The home secretary said new fencing was urgently being installed in Calais.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the extra security officers would be temporarily based in Calais and would help to secure the border and the Eurotunnel site.
The UK has said it will contribute an additional Â£7m (10m euros) to secure the Channel Tunnel, on top of Â£10m (15m euros) it pledged in September.
The BBC's Gavin Lee said migrants in Calais had told him they were aiming to get though a number of holes in security fences.
By going in groups of up to 400 they thought they had a better chance of getting into the tunnel, he said.
They also intended to keep using the same tactics, he added.
The man who died on Tuesday has been described as Sudanese and aged between 25 and 30.
He is the ninth person to die trying to access the tunnel since June.
French police said he was probably crushed by a lorry which was exiting one of the shuttles that transport vehicles through the tunnel.
Home Secretary Theresa May said some migrants had reached Britain through the Channel Tunnel, but did not say how many had arrived.
Speaking after a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee, she said: "Crucially what we are looking at now is improving security at the railhead at Coquelles, so we can ensure people are not trying to come through the tunnel.
"That means some urgent work in government but also with Eurotunnel, and Eurotunnel has a role to play here in the measures they themselves put in place to protect their trains."

Calais crisis: Advice for travellers
Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said he believed sending extra police would not solve the problem in Calais and called on France and Britain to work together to return migrants to their countries of origin where appropriate.
Mr Vaz said: "I went to Kent yesterday and I saw 148 of them who had made the journey and who were delighted because they had been successful in coming here, having evaded all this security, they actually managed to come here."
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees' representative in France, Philippe Leclerc, said most of the migrants in Calais were fleeing violence in countries like Syria, Eritrea, Somalia and Afghanistan.
He said they were among an estimated 200,000 who have crossed the Mediterranean to Italy and Greece in recent months.
