Wales has hit its first annual statutory waste target by recycling more than 50% of rubbish collected by councils, the Welsh government has confirmed.

Local authorities recycled or composted 52% of waste they gathered between April 2012 and March this year.
By March 2013 Denbighshire had the highest recycling rate with 58%, while Bridgend and Caerphilly had hit 57%.
A second statutory recycling target of 58% is set for 2015-16.
Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies said black bin waste had been cut by more than half over the last decade.
"As a government we will continue to support local authorities as they work with us towards zero waste by 2050," he said.
"In particular, we will be working proactively with those councils that need more support to increase their recycling rates."
He added Wales was leading the way on recycling.
"Our aim of zero waste to landfill by 2050 is a bold one, and there is more work to be done, but I'm very encouraged and proud of the progress we are making," Mr Davies said.
