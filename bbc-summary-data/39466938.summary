It is the second litter born to adults Mimi and Musa at Washington Wetland Centre.
The otter family are on a global register, known as a studbook, aimed at conserving healthy populations of the animals in captivity.
Studbook keeper Jason Palmer said maintaining "genetically healthy populations" was "vitally important".
"With organisations such as WWT and other zoos breeding and transferring responsibly, it will start to make a big difference to the captive well-being of all Asian short-clawed otters," he said.
Washington Wetland Centre manager Gill Pipes said the family of otters were "especially good genetically, which is great news for the species".
"It means they can play a key role in maintaining a healthy population," she said.
Short-clawed otters are the smallest otter species and are threatened by hunting and the deforestation of their natural habitat.
