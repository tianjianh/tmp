Stonehenge protesters climbed on stones and set grass alight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three people have been cautioned and a further three released without charge, after climbing on the stones and setting the grass alight at Stonehenge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four men and two women were arrested on suspicion of destroying or damaging the monument early on Wednesday.
It is believed they were protesting over an alcohol ban and parking charges introduced for the Summer Solstice.
English Heritage said a group of 14 entered the stone circle and doused the grass with paraffin and set it alight.
Kate Davies, general manager at Stonehenge, said: "How can people who claim to honour the stones deliberately disrespect and damage them like this?"
