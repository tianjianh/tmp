[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff man has been jailed for life for murdering his neighbour in a "sexually motivated" attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kris Wade, 37, admitted killing Christine James, 65, who was found dead just days after she failed to catch a flight to Florida in March.
Mrs James, the mother-in-law of ex-Wales rugby captain Jonathan Humphreys, was found dead in her Cardiff Bay flat.
At Cardiff Crown Court on Thursday, Wade was jailed for a minimum of 21 years.
Wade, who lived in neighbouring Hansen Court, appeared via video link from Long Lartin prison.
Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC acknowledged there were no signs of any sexual injuries on Mrs James or that any sex between her and Wade had taken place.
However, he added: "The ball gag used together with the bloodstained handcuffs gives rise to the overwhelming belief that the killing of Mrs James was sexually motivated."
After Mrs James was reported missing, police conducted house-to-house inquiries, with Wade "appearing agitated" when they knocked on his door.
Her body was found on 2 March and Wade was arrested at his parents' home in Church Village, Rhondda Cynon Taff, five days later.
Mr Justice Wyn Williams said Mrs James was attacked after Wade went to her flat with a suitcase containing sex toys and she rejected his advances.
He said Wade subjected his victim to "brutal and savage violence".
The court was told police found Mrs James's body in the hallway of her flat and a gag used in sadomasochistic sex was underneath her.
When police searched Wade's flat, Mrs James's blood was found on a small black suitcase which contained a bloodstained handcuff and earring.
Elsewhere in the flat there was sadomasochistic equipment.
At a previous hearing, John Charles Rees QC said his client admitted murdering Mrs James, but contested it had a sexual motivation.
He told the court on Thursday Wade felt sorrow and remorse.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating contact between Mrs James and South Wales Police before her death.
Mrs James's son told the court his mother's death was a "senseless brutal murder in her own home".
"She was a gentle loving mother and grandmother. We can only speculate about what took place, a sustained and barbaric attack that may have taken place over several hours or two days," he added.
Janine Davies, district Crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, described Mrs James as the "innocent victim of a brutal and devastating attack carried out by Kris Wade".
She added: "Wade has shown no remorse for this callous and fatal assault."
