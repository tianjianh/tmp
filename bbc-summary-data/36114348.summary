PJ Harvey's latest album The Hope Six Demolition Project has given the singer her first UK number one album.

Harvey's ninth studio album toppled The Lumineers just a week after they too scored their first UK number one.
Adele's 25 holds steadfast at number two, ahead of Aled Jones at number three, a new album from Santana at four, and Justin Bieber.
There was no change in the singles chart with Drake, Sia and Mike Posner dominating the top three spots.
The only new entry to the top five in the singles countdown was Girls Like, from Tinie Tempah ft Zara Larsson, a new entry at number five.
Following his sudden death on Thursday, Prince had two new entries in the album charts, less than 24 hours after news that he had been found dead at his home in Minneapolis. His 2006 greatest hits album Ultimate Prince landed at number 10, and 2001's The Very Best Of, joined the charts at number 18.
Sales counted from the moment the news of his untimely death broke on Thursday evening until midnight. The chart position was all the more remarkable given that much of his music is not available on streaming sites.
In the singles' chart, the Prince classic Purple Rain peaked at 65. The late singer looks likely to dominate both charts by Monday.
"The great shock of last night is already translating into a clear outpouring of respect and love for Prince," said  Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot.
He added: "The rapid impact on the Official Albums Chart - and no doubt the Official Singles Chart next week - underlines just what this extraordinary, iconic artist meant to the Great British public."
David Bowie, whose death in January marked another major loss to the music industry this year, also had a new entry in the charts, with The Man Who Sold the World at number 21.
New entries from Andre Rieu and Hawkwind joined the album chart, with Magic of the Waltz and The Machine Stops respectively, while another '80s stalwart, Phil Collins, returned to the charts with the deluxe reissue No Jacket Required, at number 35.
