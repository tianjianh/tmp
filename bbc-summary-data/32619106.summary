The Belfast Policing and Community Safety Partnership's 'Drug Dealers Don't Care, Do You?' campaign ran from February to April.
In that time, the PSNI also arrested 357 people and seized £44,000 in cash.
Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said the principal drug seized was herbal cannabis.
"Along with our partners, we've invested a considerable amount of time and effort into this campaign and it has delivered worthwhile outcomes," he said.
"We arrested 357 suspects, charged 78 of them, reported 163 and released 55 on police bail."
A spokesperson for Belfast PCSP said: "It's encouraging that the 'Drug Dealers Don't Care' campaign would appear to be having some impact in helping to tackle the scourge of drugs on our streets and in our communities.
"These latest figures demonstrate that by working in partnership and coordinating our resources we can be more effective."
