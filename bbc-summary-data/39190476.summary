The parents of a stillborn baby boy said they were "completely let down" by a hospital after bosses admitted it failed to save him.

Leigh Mutch and Marc Allen's son, Oliver, was stillborn 13 weeks early at Wakefield's Pinderfields General Hospital on 22 September 2015.
The couple said he would have been born alive if staff had performed a caesarean section sooner.
Managers said they "recognised there were significant failings on our part".
Ms Mutch, from Normanton, west Yorkshire, said: "Marc and I were left completely traumatised by Oliver's death. We are still struggling to come to terms with losing him. It is so heart-breaking."
The mother-of-five, 31, said she visited her GP and hospital "on four previous occasions" with concerns about the baby's reduced movements.
Ms Mutch was admitted to the antenatal day unit shortly before 16:00 GMT on 22 September.
She said medics overlooked the severity of her situation and her medical notes and details of Oliver's heart rate were not passed on to the labour ward.
Later that day, a consultant decided Ms Mutch needed the operation but did not categorise it as urgent and it was not performed until 19:30.
"I knew something was not right. I feel completely let down by the maternity services and the treatment I received at Pinderfields Hospital," Ms Mutch said.
"It is so upsetting to know that if Oliver had been delivered earlier, he would be here now."
David Melia, director of nursing and quality at The Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: "We offer our deepest condolences and sympathy to the family and we understand that this has been a very traumatic situation for all involved.
"We have since implemented a number of changes to improve the quality of care provided."
The couple received an undisclosed out-of-court settlement and now want to raise awareness of their experience and "of the poor treatment we received".
