Northampton Town have signed Aston Villa left-back Enda Stevens on a month's loan.

The 24-year-old former Doncaster and Notts County loanee comes in while Evan Horwood remains sidelined with tendonitis.
Cobblers manager Chris Wilder told BBC Radio Northampton: "We've been light in that area and he'll go straight into the team (against Burton).
"You don't sign for a club like Villa unless you've got something about you."
Stevens made four appearances on loan for League One side Notts County before breaking his toe in September 2013. He then moved on to Doncaster two months later, clocking up a further 13 appearances in the Championship.
Prior to those spells, the Irishman made his full debut for Villa against Manchester United and has since gone on to feature nine times for the Premier League club.
Despite the injury to Northampton's top scorer Marc Richards, Wilder says he was not tempted to bring in another striker.
"We have Emile Sinclair coming back on Monday and he really feels he has a point to prove," said Wilder.
"He got himself going when he scored against Shrewsbury and he was showing signs at Bournemouth. That was disappointing we lost him.
"He knows it's a big period for him. He's got to hit the ground running."
