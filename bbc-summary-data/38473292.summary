Crowds have begun to gather at New Year's Eve events around the UK amid tightened security following the lorry attacks in Berlin and Nice.

Around 110,000 tickets have been sold for the annual fireworks display along the River Thames in London which will mark the start of 2017.
Celebrations will also take place at popular city locations across the UK under a more visible police presence.
Security has been stepped up following terror attacks in Europe.
In London, around 12,000 fireworks producing 50,000 projectiles will light up the city as part of a 12-minute display.
Mayor Sadiq Khan said it will be the "best fireworks London's ever seen" and will pay tribute to artists who have died in the past year.
He added: "We are going to make sure that we have fireworks where the theme is hope and optimism going forward, but they're going to be brilliant."
Mr Khan said the capital would be sending a message to the world that "London is open", particularly post-Brexit, as part of its New Year's Eve celebrations.
He added: "We've always been a city open to talent, to people, to ideas and that is not going to change.
"One of the great things about the New Year's Eve fireworks is that it showcases our great, great city."
Security has been stepped up across the capital, which will see more armed officers being deployed and concrete barriers in use.
There are also more places around the city where vehicles are banned.
Greater Manchester Police has also increased crowd protection in the wake of the Berlin attack.
British Transport Police has "extended" its regular armed patrols across the nation's rail network and there are armed officers on the London Underground.
Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Phil Langworthy said 3,000 officers would patrol the streets in London.
He added: "We will also have some covert tactics.
"Overtly there'll be a search regime in place at the fireworks, we will also have concrete barriers and a range of other tactics to reassure the public that they can come and have a safe and enjoyable event."
Around 75,000 people are expected to attend Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party for its sold-out New Year's Eve celebration.
Police Scotland said there would be a "very visible police presence" at the event.
Divisional commander Chief Superintendent Kenny MacDonald said: "I'm confident we have an appropriate and proportionate policing plan in place to make sure we deliver a safe and secure event."
The Police Federation confirmed that there would be more areas in London where vehicles will be banned as a result of the recent attacks in Nice and Berlin.
On 20 December a lorry, driven by Anis Amri, ploughed into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring 48.
In Nice in July, 86 people died during Bastille Day celebrations when a lorry drove into crowds on the Promenade des Anglais.
