The hosts led when Godden fired in from Steve Schumacher's cross and he scored a second just before half-time with a close-range finish.
After the break, Ben Kennedy fouled Sid Nelson and Godden fired from the spot.
Dan Butler scored a consolation for the Exiles late on but it was too late to overturn Stevenage's lead.
The result means Newport County remain bottom of the League Two table and five points from safety, while Stevenage move up two places to 13th.
Newport manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales: "I thought it was a very positive afternoon.
"It was always going to be difficult to start the game, as in five new lads in the side, 2-0 with the error and 3-0 with the soft penalty.
"The boys could have been forgiven, but sides would have dropped their heads and would have gone under.
"But we didn't. We showed a character. We showed a strength. We showed resilience.
"We showed a willingness to go and get something out of the half and we did. We fought back."
