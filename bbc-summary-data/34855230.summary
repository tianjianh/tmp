The Royal College of GPs Wales also warned politicians not to use the NHS for political gain in the run up to next May's vote.
It has highlighted six areas it wants to see addressed "if general practice is to continue to survive... and provide a high level of service".
The college is unveiling its manifesto at the Senedd.
Its key points include:
Chairwoman Dr Rebecca Payne said: "Every day GPs and practice teams work hard to make a difference to patients' lives.
"It's vital that their contribution is recognised and appreciated by politicians from all parties.
"We need robust commitments from all political parties to secure a sustainable, effective, patient-centred health service and to protect the NHS for the future."
She said the general practice "family" needed to be expanded so other medical staff, including practice nurses and pharmacists, could help "alleviate the intense pressure we are under".
