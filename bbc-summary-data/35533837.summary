[SN]TITLE[SN]
Killer Malcolm Webster fails to have case referred to the High Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who murdered his wife and tried to kill his second wife has lost a bid to have his case referred back to the High Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malcolm Webster was given a life sentence for killing Claire Morris in a planned crash in Aberdeenshire in 1994.
He was also convicted of staging a similar attempt to kill Felicity Drumm in New Zealand in 1999.
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission has refused his application to have his conviction looked at again.
The former nurse was convicted of the crimes in May 2011 following a five-month trial in Glasgow.
He later lost an appeal in 2013 when judges at the Court of Appeal in Edinburgh rejected a claim he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.
In 2014, Webster of Guildford, Surrey,  launched the new bid to clear his name when he asked the SCCRC, which reviews alleged miscarriages of justice in criminal cases, to refer his case back to the High Court.
But the SCCRC confirmed Webster's application had been refused.
A spokesman said: "The commission's review has concluded and this case has not been referred to the High Court."
Webster claimed the death of Ms Morris was an accident which happened when he swerved to avoid a motorcyclist.
The jury heard the killer drugged her before driving the car they were in off an Aberdeenshire road and starting a fire while she lay unconscious inside.
He fraudulently claimed more than Â£200,000 from insurance policies following her death, later spending it on a Range Rover car, a yacht and on seducing a string of women.
In 1999 he tried to murder Ms Drumm in a copycat car crash in New Zealand in an attempt to claim more than Â£750,000 of insurance money.
