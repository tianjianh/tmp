Tiny Rebel Brewery: Grenade logo ends Sweden export bid

A brewery's bid to export one its brands to Sweden has faltered because the beer's label features a hand grenade and bullet holes.

Tiny Rebel brewery in Newport wanted Swedes to taste bottles of its "unique schizophrenic" Fubar pale ale.
But the export drive was blocked after a consumer protection agency said the label was contrary to guidelines.
Co-founder Bradley Cummings, 26, said: "Looks like Fubar won't be heading over to Sweden any time soon."
The firm, launched 18 months ago, has already seen exports of bottles and kegs to Denmark, Norway, Italy and Australia.
But hopes of adding Sweden to the list stopped with an email asking the firm to review the label on the bottles of beer.
It said: "In reviewing this label, we believe this may be contrary to the Consumer Agency's guidelines for advertising of alcoholic beverages to consumers.
"The overall impression including weapons and bullet holes are not expected to exercise special moderation."
Mr Cummings said he had not long returned from a business trip to Sweden to discuss exporting Fubar so the email rejection was a surprise.
He said: "It might have been our fault for not looking at the advertising laws. Every country is different and we do appreciate that.
"It would be boring if everything country was the same. They have a very different drinking culture over there."
Fubar was runner-up in the Welsh champion beer awards in Cardiff in June, which saw the brewery sweep the board.
Mr Cummings said the firm, started with partner Gareth Williams, 31, now employs six people and produces the equivalent of 640 casks of beer, in casks for the UK market and bottles and kegs for overseas, a month.
