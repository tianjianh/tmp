The "large scale public order incident" occurred at Stapleford Abbotts Golf Club, Essex, on Tuesday night.
Police were called to a "disagreement" at the party, attended by about 100 people, and "dispersed" those involved.
Afterwards, officers posted photos of themselves removing the cakes, which they said were "donated", and took them to homeless shelters.
Essex Police and a police helicopter were called after trouble broke out at the event at the golf club, near Epping, at about 22:00 GMT.

Rory O'Keeffe, assistant manager at the club, said "about 100 Irish Gypsies" turned up to the party, which he understood was to celebrate a confirmation.
Insp Rob Brettell, from Essex Police, tweeted to say "lots of damage" had been caused at the club, and some thefts had also been reported.
He later wrote on Twitter to say "a number of cakes were donated to our team tonight".
He included photographs of a fairytale castle cake and a number of smaller cakes decorated to look like Disney-style princesses.
These, he said, were being taken to homeless shelters and mother and baby units.
Mr O'Keeffe said "no real damage" was caused to the club, but staff were still "cleaning up the mess and dirt" on Wednesday morning.
"And I think a few partygoers are still sleeping off their hangovers in a trailer in the car park," he added.
Essex Police said no-one had been arrested in connection with the incident, but they were "continuing to monitor the situation".
The golf club said it was open for business as usual.
