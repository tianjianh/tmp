[SN]TITLE[SN]
Castle Rock Brewery in apples-for-cider plea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brewery is calling on cider drinkers to supply their own apples in return for a bottle of booze.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Castle Rock Brewery, in Nottingham, has started a small scale experiment to make the drink but needs the raw ingredient.
The first batch was made with apples from allotments and is expected to be between 4.5% and 7% alcohol.
For the second round, the brewer is offering a bottle of the fruity beverage for every sack of apples.
Colin Wilde, managing director of Castle Rock, said: "Our hope is we will be able to thank anyone who gave us apples, not only with a bottle but we would hope to be able to invite them to a party in the Spring."
The firm said it would accept any variety but the fruit had to be fresh and unbruised.
The brewery has been making real ales and running pubs in Nottingham since 1998 but this is the first time it has made a cider.
