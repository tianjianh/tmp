One of Northern Ireland's largest construction firms, Graham, made a pre-tax profit of £7.4m in 2015, up from £5.7m in 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turnover at the Dromore-based group was up from £419m to £491m.
The company employs around 1,600 people and does the bulk of its work outside Northern Ireland, particularly in Scotland.
The directors said the performance was "robust" in what continued to be "a difficult market".
The firm said it had a "healthy" forward order book.
The shareholders shared a £1.45m dividend, up from £1.2m in 2014.
Most of the firm's turnover comes from its construction division, but the directors said they were "encouraged" by growth in the asset management division.
Projects completed by the firm in 2014 included a new campus building for Sheffield Hallam University and an aquatics centre in Aberdeen.
Graham has also recently completed a replacement bridge across the River Lagan in Belfast, linking Donegall Quay with Queen's Quay.
