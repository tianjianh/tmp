[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Commonwealth Games bronze medallist has been sentenced for a "road rage" offence where he threw a car driver's keys across a road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Gibb, 39, of Ruislip, was driving his car in Hertfordshire when he got into an argument after pulling out in front of  another driver.
He was found guilty of dangerous driving at St Albans Crown Court.
Gibb, who won bronze in Manchester in 2002, was given a three-month suspended sentence and a year-long driving ban.
Gibb, who won the bronze in the Commonwealth Games 20km scratch race final and followed it up with a silver at the 15km event at the World Track Championships that year, had been on his way to a cycling event when the offence took place on Sunday, 21 June last year.
The prosecution said Gibb was in his Volvo XC90 on Cow Lane near Tring when he pulled out of a junction onto the A4251 in front of Kyle Gilroy's Astra SRI, causing him to perform an emergency stop.
After swearing and gesticulating by both men, Gibb got out of his car and took the other driver's keys from his ignition before throwing them and driving away.
Judge Andrew Bright said blocking the other man's car with his own constituted dangerous driving.
He said: "You decided to take his keys to somehow punish him.
"The Court Of Appeal has made it clear that road rage is something the courts must take very seriously and punish severely."
He told Gibb the offence "crossed the custody threshold", but he was just able to suspend the sentence for two years.
Gibb, who was described as a cycling commentator on Eurosport and businessman, will also have to pay prosecution costs of Â£3,500 and carry out 100 hours of community work.
