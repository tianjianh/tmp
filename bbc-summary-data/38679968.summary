Scottish Cup: Hibs boss Neil Lennon warns over giant-killing threat

Scottish Cup holders Hibernian should dispel any notions of romanticism when they play junior side Bonnyrigg Rose on Saturday, according to Neil Lennon.

"We have to make sure there's no giant-killing," head coach Lennon said ahead of the fourth-round tie at Tynecastle.
"We know it'll be a tricky tie. We have to be right at it. We have to apply ourselves the right way.
"I think I'm the first Hibs manager in a long time to defend the Scottish Cup so it's a nice feeling."
David Gray's late winner against Rangers at Hampden in May secured a 3-2 victory and ended Hibernian's 114-year wait for a Scottish Cup triumph.
"It was a great occasion last year, a momentous moment for the club and the supporters in particular," said Lennon, who replaced Alan Stubbs in June.
"We are defending the trophy. We've got a difficult tie, a no-win situation really, but it's important that we defend the trophy as strongly as we can.
"Once you get a taste of success you always want more. That day arguably gave them the best day of their professional lives up until now and who wouldn't want more of that?"
Turning his attention to Saturday's opponents, the Hibs boss is aware of the threat posed by the junior club.
"They knocked out Dumbarton in the last round, a team which gave us a tough match in the Championship last weekend," Lennon added.
"They have an excellent record at junior level and the game's local. We have to take the tie as we would any other game, really.
"It will mean a lot to so many people associated with Bonnyrigg, particularly the players, and it will be a huge game for them in their careers.
"I have seen some giant-killings this week in the English [FA] Cup and I don't want to be on the end of one myself, so we will pay them a lot of respect. They have plenty of experience, physically they are a big side and they have no fear, so that's a dangerous opponent to play against."
