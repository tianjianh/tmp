A senior Norfolk police officer said her "values no longer fit" as she announced her retirement from the force on Twitter.

Assistant Chief Constable Sarah Hamlin said she was no longer able to "make a difference" and support the frontline.
Ms Hamlin, who was paid about Â£100,000 a year, said she hoped that "officer and staff welfare" were prioritised.
Chief Constable Simon Bailey said Ms Hamlin had made "some significant contributions" across the force.

But Ms Hamlin tweeted she was "resigned to the fact that my values no longer fit" the organisation.
In 2001, Ms Hamlin started the SOS Bus Project, an initiative to meet the needs of young people in Norwich's clubland at night.
She went on to become a detective inspector, followed by promotion to chief inspector based at Bethel Street in Norwich.
Mr Bailey said Ms Hamlin had "played a key role in helping us all to think differently about how we deliver policing in today's online world".
Chief Constable of Suffolk Police Gareth Wilson, where Ms Hamlin was also an assistant chief constable, said her "knowledge and experience" had "made a real difference".

One of the Assistant Chief Constables of Norfolk and Suffolk constabularies, Sarah Hamlin, isn't someone who has tried to court controversy online during her successful career.
So like others in the newsroom, I was surprised to read today's tweet that her "values no longer fit the organisation". Perhaps she did not mean the comment to sound like a bitter parting shot against Norfolk Police.
ACC Hamlin would perhaps prefer to be remembered for the quiet work she's done behind the scenes to change the organisation and help the rank and file.
But if values aren't being met, and she wants to talk, then explaining all would be a greater legacy still.
