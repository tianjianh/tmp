Carl Griffiths, 22, was forced to stop playing for Trimsaran RFC in Carmarthenshire after his last pair of boots wore out and he could not find a replacement.
But he is now the proud owner of new size 21 boots.
He said: "It is amazing to be able to play the game I love again."
The 6ft 8in player contacted every major sports company he could think of and asked if they made size 21 boots, but they all said they could not help him.
But after he hit the headlines in January, the team of boot designers at Adidas created two pairs of Kakari boots for Mr Griffiths.
After he was surprised by Warburton with the boots on Friday, he was able to run out for his local side once again
"I had no idea they were planning this and I had almost given up hope of ever finding boots that would fit me again," Mr Griffiths added.
