County Championship: Riki Wessels and Jackson Bird hand Notts control

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Riki Wessels' first century of the first-class season followed by Jackson Bird's four-wicket haul gave Nottinghamshire control against Durham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wessels and Brett Hutton shared a 197-run seventh-wicket stand before the latter fell to Scott Borthwick for 74.
Borthwick's first five-wicket haul since 2013 saw Notts all out for 534, with Wessels finishing unbeaten on 159.
Bird then ripped through Durham's top order as the away side closed on 193-4, trailing by 341 runs at Trent Bridge.
After the hosts resumed the second day on 353-6, in a chanceless first session, Wessels and youngster Hutton ensured maximum batting points for their side.
Borthwick then wrapped up the tail before Durham openers Mark Stoneman (39) and Keaton Jennings batted with ease.
But Jennings was caught at midwicket by Samit Patel off Bird, Stoneman fell in identical fashion and Jack Burham was then trapped lbw next ball for a golden duck as the away side crumbled.
Bird was denied a hat-trick but soon sent Michael Richardson's off stump tumbling to put the home side in the driving seat.
However, Borthwick made 59 and captain Paul Collingwood 38 in an unbroken 72-run fifth-wicket stand which kept Notts at bay for the remainder of the day.
