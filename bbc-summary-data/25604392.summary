The East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH) has unveiled plans for a new £10m centre in south Norfolk.

The five-acre site on the corner of Pigot Lane and Long Road in Framingham Earl hopes to meet "increasing demands" for the charity's support services.
Graham Butland, EACH chief executive, said: "We're looking at options for a new purpose-built hospice to provide even better care and support."
The charity said its site at Quiddenham is becoming "less fit for purpose".
Mr Butland added: "Before we apply for planning permission we felt it was important to meet with local residents.

"Not only to show exactly what we're proposing and to explain the plans, but also to give people the opportunity to ask questions."
EACH supports families and care for children and young people with life-threatening conditions across Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Essex and Suffolk. Its patron is the Duchess of Cambridge.
"Our Quidenham hospice is one of the oldest children's hospices in the UK and has been a wonderful home-from-home to many families for more than 20 years," said Mr Butland,
"But, as time goes on, the building will become less and less fit for purpose. We need to plan now to be ready for the future.
"A new hospice would bring Norfolk in line with services we offer in Cambridgeshire, Essex and Suffolk."
A planning application for the Framlingham Earl site is to be submitted later this month.
EACH will be at Poringland Community Centre to meet with residents between 11:00 and 18:00 GMT on 6 December.
