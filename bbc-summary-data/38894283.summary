[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton Town manager Justin Edinburgh says his side need to change their mentality and stop being a team "unlucky in defeat".

The Cobblers lost 2-1 to Walsall on Saturday, despite a first-half lead.
Edinburgh said: "We need to get them [the players] in the mindset. We have done that against Coventry. We took the lead, we won the game, so we're capable.
"It's not that we haven't done it, but we haven't done it regularly enough."
Northampton, 16th in League One, now have two home games in four days, with the visit of Chesterfield on Saturday followed by Swindon on Tuesday.
The Cobblers led through John-Joe O'Toole's goal against Walsall at the weekend but two second-half goals turned the game around, and Edinburgh wants his side to learn how to see games out.
"Rather than being a team unlucky in defeat, we need to be a team which is lucky to win and we need to change our mentality," he added.
"We need to flip that on its head, but it has to come from within and we have to start seeing games out."
