A West Yorkshire church's new set of bells have gone on display after the old ones were taken down and restored.

The 10 bells at the Grade II-listed St Mary's church, in Mirfield, fell silent for the first time in 144 years when they were taken down last April.
Six of the bells were melted down and recast while four have been re-tuned.
After five months of work, the bells have arrived back and are on show before installation starts on Monday.
It will take three weeks for all 10 to be fully installed before they can be heard ringing again just after Easter, the church said.
Church warden Ruth Edwards said: "I'm very excited and emotional to see them back.
"It's taken three years from the idea of having them recast to raising the money and now having them installed."
A blessing of the bells is due to take place during the church's morning service on Sunday.
Tower Captain Ian Ackroyd, who manages the bell tower, said he was looking forward to hearing the new set of bells ringing with "an improved sound".
The bells were originally cast in 1869 at a foundry in Loughborough, where they were taken back for restoration. The whole project cost Â£87,000 and was funded through donations.
Designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, the church opened in 1871.
Scott also designed the Albert Memorial in London and Edinburgh Cathedral among many well-known buildings.
