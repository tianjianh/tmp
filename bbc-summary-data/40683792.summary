The Spain Under-21 right-back has signed a three-year contract with the Magpies, who were promoted back to the Premier League last season.
"He has a lot of motivation because he has a point to prove," said Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez.
Manquillo, 23, is Newcastle's fourth signing of the summer.
He follows the arrival of winger Jacob Murphy from Norwich, midfielder Christian Atsu from Chelsea and defender Florian Lejeune from Spanish side Eibar.
"I'm very happy to be here," said Manquillo, who made 20 Premier League appearances last season during a loan spell at Newcastle's rivals Sunderland.
"From the first moment that Rafa Benitez called me I just knew that I had to come here, to such a big club."
Manquillo started his career at Atletico Madrid, making his first-team debut in the 2011-12 season.
He went on to make only a handful of appearances for the Spanish side before joining Liverpool in 2014 on a two-year loan deal.
That was terminated the following year after playing just 10 games for the Reds and Manquillo then spent a season on loan at French side Marseille.
