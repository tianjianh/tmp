Pianist Lang Lang cancels debut Edinburgh International Festival concert

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The acclaimed pianist Lang Lang has had to cancel his first appearance at the Edinburgh International Festival.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Chinese musician has an ear infection and has been advised by doctors not to travel.
He is hopeful he will be able to perform in Edinburgh on Friday in a solo recital.
Wednesday's concert with the Philharmonia Orchestra will be performed by Pierre-Laurent Aimard.
Born in Lyon in 1957, Aimard studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Yvonne Loriod and in London with Maria Curcio.
Early career landmarks included winning first prize in the 1973 Messiaen Competition at the age of 16 and being appointed, three years later, by Pierre Boulez to become the Ensemble intercontemporain's first solo pianist.
