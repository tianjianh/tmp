Father-of-two Sean Kelly, 37, from Cardiff, died in hospital on Sunday following a serious assault in Theodora Street, Adamsdown on Thursday.
An 18-year-old and 45-year-old have been charged with murder.
Both men, from the Cardiff area, are due to appear at the city's magistrates' court on Wednesday, South Wales Police said.
Following his death at the University Hospital of Wales, Mr Kelly's family paid tribute to "a fun loving guy".
In a statement, they added: "He was a great son, father, brother and uncle. He was a doting dad to his two children and he's going to be extremely missed by all."
