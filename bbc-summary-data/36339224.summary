[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Locke has been appointed the new manager at Raith Rovers on a two-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 40-year-old, who resigned as Kilmarnock boss in January, takes over from Ray McKinnon, who left for Dundee United this month.
Rovers finished fourth in the Championship, losing their play-off quarter-final against Hibernian.
Locke is expected to announce a new backroom team at Stark's Park over the next few weeks.
He was made caretaker manager of Hearts in February 2013 following the dismissal of John McGlynn and was appointed permanently at the end of the season.
However, he was replaced in May 2014 with the club relegated to the Championship following a 15-point penalty for going into administration.
Locke was promoted from Kilmarnock assistant manager to caretaker in February 2015 and appointed permanently in June but resigned with the club second bottom of the Premiership.
