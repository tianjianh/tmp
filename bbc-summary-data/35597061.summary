The Baggies' 1-0 victory was their first since 2 January and moved them eight points clear of the bottom three.
"It was nice to get three points and create a bit of a gap to the bottom," the Swede, 32, told BBC WM 95.6.
"The title race is wide open and so is the relegation battle."
Albion had gone five league games without a win since beating Stoke 2-1 at The Hawthorns and now prepare to face title contenders Leicester City, Manchester City and top-four-chasing Manchester United at the start of March.
"They're all hard games - everyone's fighting," he said. "From experience you know they're going to be tough for everybody.
"But we've been doing well at home and hopefully we can get over the line sooner or later."
