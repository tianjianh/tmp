Team Sky rider Nicolas Roche led over the final metres of the 209.6km stage out of Estepona, but Valverde came through to win from Peter Sagan.
Orica-Greenedge's Esteban Chaves retained overall race lead by five seconds from Tom Domoulin.
Team Sky's Chris Froome finished in the pack to stay 40 seconds behind Chaves.
Briton Froome is bidding to become only the third man to win the Tour de France and the Vuelta in the same year.
Sagan won his first Grand Tour stage for two years on Monday, having finishing second five times at the Tour de France last month.
But the Slovakian could not match 2009 Vuelta winner Valverde on a steep hill finish 24 hours later.
Roche held on for fourth place, just edged out by Spain's Dani Moreno.
The Irishman is third in the overall standings, 12 seconds down on Colombian Chaves.
Spaniard Valverde, 35, is considered one of the favourites for the Vuelta title.
His victory in five hours, seven minutes and 30 seconds sees him move into fourth place overall, 15 seconds ahead of Froome.
