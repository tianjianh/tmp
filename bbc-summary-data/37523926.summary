The 66-year-old, who was born in Ilkeston, Derbyshire is also renowned for his Shakespearean theatre roles.
Hundreds of people lined the street in the rain and later packed the council chamber for the public ceremony.
Mr Lindsay rose to fame as Wolfie Smith in the 1970s sitcom wearing a beret as leader of the Tooting Popular Front.
He also starred in sitcom 'My Family' and is also the recipient of a BAFTA, a Tony Award, and three Olivier Awards.
Mr Lindsay becomes the second person to receive the honour after cycling boss Dave Brailsford in 2012.
He was presented with a Badge of Office medal and an ornate framed scroll at the public ceremony in Ilkeston.
He said he felt "emotional" when he was given the award, adding he now feels "quite nostalgic" about his hometown.
The award was "the icing on the cake" of his career, he added.
"I live down in London but my heart is still here - I can still speak the accent. And  I've not really lost my roots."
