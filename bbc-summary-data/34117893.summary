County Championship: Sam Northeast ton holds up Lancashire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent's Sam Northeast made his first Championship century of the summer as promotion-chasing Lancashire failed to pick up a single point on day two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Red Rose county could not add to the one point gained on the opening day at Canterbury as the home side piled up 570-8 before declaring.
Skipper Northeast hit two sixes and 14 fours in his 139 and shared a stand of 183 with Darren Stevens (92).
Jordan Clark took 3-87 for Lancashire, who were 25-0 when rain ended play.
The visitors only need to draw to be certain of Division One cricket next season, but they could still do so even if they lose the game, providing they score at least 350 in a maximum of 110 overs, to earn four batting bonus points.
Northeast, who was dropped twice early in his innings, passed 1,000 runs for the season when he reached 77, and went to his hundred by striking three fours and a six off successive deliveries from spinner Simon Kerrigan.
The slow left-armer (2-95) later gained a measure of revenge by having him stumped, having previously had Stevens caught at deep square leg by Haseeb Hameed after the all-rounder had hit a six off the previous ball.
