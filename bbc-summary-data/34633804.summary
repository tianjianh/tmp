Celtic 5-0 Dundee United: Praise for Tierney and Commons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Ronny Deila singled out teenager Kieran Tierney and veteran Kris Commons for praise following Celtic's 5-0 win over Dundee United.

Left-back Tierney was man-of-the-match as the champions moved four points clear at the top of the Premiership.
And Commons scored twice in a one-sided contest at Celtic Park.
On Tierney, Deila told BBC Scotland: "I have high hopes for him. He likes to get forward and we are going to work hard to make sure he gets even better."
The 18-year-old was upended for the penalty Commons converted to make it 3-0 just before half-time and revelled in an attacking role as United offered timid resistance.
"He's a credit to the Academy, producing players like that and more are coming. I know it," enthused Deila.
"It's great to get players like that into the team.
"He can go all the way. He has a great attitude and he has the physical, technical and tactical attributes that you need.
"You need to be mentally strong to play for Celtic and he hates getting beaten."
Leigh Griffiths opened the scoring, with Dedryk Boyata adding a header before Commons struck either side of half-time and Scott Brown ended the rout late on.
It was a good response after the disappointing midweek Europa League loss away to Molde, albeit against disorganised and dispirited opponents.
"I'm so proud of the boys, they really answered after Thursday," added Deila.
"It was a great performance and a good team spirit as well."
Commons, who issued an public apology for his reaction to being substituted in Norway, scored a penalty just before the interval and found the top corner with a wonderful shot on 53 minutes.
"He creates things all the time and he worked hard defensively," said Deila of the 32-year-old midfielder.
"He put in a good performance and I'm happy that we have him for one-and-a-half years more.
"He has always been an important player for Celtic. He has done so well in so many matches."
