Ada Hegerberg's well-taken second-half brace proved decisive.
Hegerberg's back post header broke the deadlock before her stunning strike from distance secured victory for the visitors.
Kayleigh Green went closest for Wales when her long-range shot was tipped on to the bar by keeper Ingrid Hjelmset.
Seattle Reign midfielder Jess Fishlock started for Wales despite fracturing a fibula in April while Liverpool's Natasha Harding won her 50th cap.
Jayne Ludlow's side remain third in Group 8, nine points behind leaders Austria and Norway, but are now unable to qualify.
Only the eight group winners and six best runners-up are guaranteed automatic places in next year's finals.
Ludlow's side are home to Israel on 15 September before Austria visit five days later in the final group game.
Norway, the 1987 and 1993 European champions, will qualify as group winners should they beat Kazakhstan and Israel at home.
Wales manager Jayne Ludlow told BBC Wales Sport: "I'm so proud of the group because for 60 minutes that game was ours for the taking.
"But against top opposition you can't switch off for 90 minutes and unfortunately we let ourselves down at key times which is a little bit disappointing.
"For the majority of the game, we're happy with what the girls gave us, happy but not complete, we have more to come.
"They're doing all the things we're asking of them and it's working, we're creating chances, not finishing them but it's stepping stones for us."
