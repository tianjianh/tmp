In pictures: The faces of Brexit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On 23 June 2016 the UK voted to leave the European Union.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Photographer Steve Franck has set out to photograph 100 people, 52 who voted leave and 48 who wanted to remain in the EU.
The project continues, but here we present 10 of those photographed, five from each side of the argument.
"I listened to both sides of the argument just to make sure I knew what I was doing was the right thing for me. I wanted independence for our country, not to stop immigration or anything like that, but something so we could have our set of rules because I felt we'd been gathered up into Europe when our country's quite different to the Europeans."
"I voted to remain because I felt that it was the best way forward for the economy and politics. If you think back over the last 100 years and the number of wars we've had in Europe, I think that the EU is a means to prevent that ever happening again. I think if you resurrected any of the people killed in World War One and asked them is this a good idea, they'd all say yes."
"The referendum for Brexit seemed very binary and the reason to stay or leave was based on two decisions. The benefits of staying or leaving were clouded over by the headline campaigns - immigration and bleak outlook for the economy versus regaining our sovereignty.
"Looking at the wider debate and the many reasons to leave or stay, the decision for me to vote leave was based on my opinion that the eurozone is not a level playing field. Having relations in the farming industry, they have struggled with competition from the eurozone.
"Although they receive subsidies, they are not equal to those afforded to their counterparts across Europe. Bringing prices down is not always bad, except here it is at the cost of the British farming industry, similarly with the UK fishing industry."
"I voted to remain because despite the EU's faults it achieved a lot in terms of protecting workers' rights and our environment. It was also very effective at redistributing wealth across EU nations - something I'd seen first hand in Malta where my family originate from.
"I also voted to remain because of migration. As someone under 30 and a second generation immigrant, I understand how important freedom of movement is - from a human rights perspective, for work and education and for economic benefit. And I am a direct beneficiary of migration."
"Born and bred in Liverpool and growing up with a fairly 'left wing' view of life  I was too young to vote on joining the EEC, but I do remember it being a very exciting time.  I have a great number of friends, family and work friends who are from European countries (EU and non-EU) and have always felt 'part' of Europe.
"However I have also always been unhappy with the bureaucracy and wastage that appears to come with the EU. My largest concern is probably the process where the EU remit evolved from a single trade agreement/market into an organisation that has grown its remit to even include making laws that member countries have to uphold - and all this change made with very little public visibility.
"I voted leave and strongly believe it was the right choice - and I still do. There has been much pain on both sides since the vote and my biggest personal regret is that I have lost some friends over the vote, simply because they believed a vote to leave the EU was a vote 'against them'."
"I voted remain. I voted from the heart, I didn't delve too much in the political statements made by either side to be honest. Instinctively I felt that we should not leave the EU. We gain a lot from being part of it, freedom and mobility for instance.
"The ability to explore countries and cultures that are on our doorstep with such ease can only help our understanding of the world and the intricacies of its people. Every one of us could do with a bit more understanding."
"The ruling classes always needed a large pool of cheap labour, in the past they've had it from the Irish, then they had it from the West Indians, now they've got it from the EU and that's what they want to keep.
"There are now three million EU citizens in the UK. As far as I'm concerned they should stay, at least temporarily until they can do something about their circumstance. You can't just boot them out. There are too many people working for the working class in this country instead of with them and I think that is a major point."
"Well for me it's quite simple. First of all I don't have enough information about what exactly they're talking about and the devil you know is better than the angel you don't.
"I don't know what's going to happen if we're out, what's the best thing for me, so I voted in. I think we've managed to live like this for so long, why change the way it is and what are the benefits, what are the pros and cons? No-one's able to tell you. "
"For a long time I was remain and then as it got closer to the event, I thought I should actually ditch all the press and do my own research so I spent days looking for information, finding out how the EU works. I was absolutely horrified.
"There are more than 10,000 members of staff employed by the EU who earn more than our PM. And the fact that the MEPs have absolutely no power whatsoever, they're just there as a token gesture, everything is decided behind closed doors, the minutes of all the meetings never have to be published, so we are told essentially how to live our lives by someone who we have no power to unelect. I do not like to be dictated to."
"My instincts throughout my life have been what I would call just left of centre. The EU has been one of the greatest redistributors of wealth downwards, but a lot of the people who benefit from that don't understand that there are many projects and improvements in their areas with money from the European Regional Development Fund.
"I was open to listening to the Leave campaign, but I think to change the status quo they've got to make a strong case for change and I don't believe they did. Their main plank was reducing immigration but they didn't explain how they would do it, when they would do it and I'm not convinced they will do it to any great degree."
