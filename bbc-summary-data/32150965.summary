An abandoned, "dying" foal, found on a roadside is finally able to run around his vet's field, after weeks of physiotherapy.

Gizmo was found in an "emaciated state" near a caravan park, in Yeldham Road, Halstead, Essex, on 17 February.
More than 1,000 people donated to an RSPCA appeal to raise Â£11,000 for his care. The total now stands at Â£22,600.
Last week the foal was able to stand for the first time and vet Carolyn Wyse said he was "miraculously 80% fit".
Five-month-old piebald cob Gizmo was "in a very poorly state" when Catley Cross equine specialist vet, Carolyn Wyse, was called in by the RSPCA.
He had been "left to die", Mrs Wyse said, and his condition was described as "touch and go". Gizmo was "hypothermic, dehydrated and collapsed - and essentially dying".
Horse lovers from around the world rallied to the RSPCA's appeal to help pay for his care at the Wickham St Paul surgery.
For weeks Gizmo was too weak to use his legs and a winch was used to move him regularly.
"He was able to walk two weeks after he arrived but it was only recently he managed to stand by himself," Mrs Wyse said.
She said she was amazed Gizmo's fans were still following his progress on Facebook.
More than 130,000 people watched a video of him kicking up his hooves in a field, posted on 28 March.
The surgery is considering keeping him for the next two years as Mrs Wyse said he would then be more suitable for rehoming.
They plan to hold a "meet Gizmo" day next month to thank people who have helped.
The surgery has so far been able to help seven other horses with the extra funds from Gizmo's appeal.
