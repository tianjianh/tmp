[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of a Victorian terraced house in London worth more than £650,000 has collapsed after it began to sag.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It caved in on itself 24 hours after police closed the road it was on due to concerns about the property.
The house was empty and being renovated having been sold six months ago after the previous owner died.
Merle Fraser, whose mother lived in the house for more than 60 years before it collapsed, said: "It is sad. I know she would be heart broken."
People living in the house next door were evacuated before the property came crashing down. No-one was hurt.
Surveyors from Lewisham Council have visited the site to see what immediate work needs to be done to make the road safe.
