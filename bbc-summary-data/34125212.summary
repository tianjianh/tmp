Exeter Chiefs freeman leads world cup sheep through city

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A freeman has used his ancient right to herd a flock of sheep through a city centre to publicise the upcoming Rugby World Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exeter Chiefs chairman Tony Rowe was given the Freedom of Exeter for his outstanding services to rugby.
Mr Rowe immediately exercised his right to lead sheep through the city, draping four animals in the flags of the teams who will be appearing in Exeter.
The Chiefs are hosting three world cup games at their Sandy Park ground.
During his 20-year involvement with the Exeter Chiefs, Mr Rowe presided over the club's promotion to rugby's top flight in 2010 and the construction of the Sandy Park stadium.
Exeter City Council said it can bestow the honour on anyone who has "undertaken something which is outstanding or has helped enhance the reputation of the city".
The former Royal Marine bandsman is being recognised for his services to rugby union, which the council said has "helped promote the city around the globe".
The businessman follows in the footsteps of Exeter-based Olympic athlete Jo Pavey and Great Britain swimmer Liam Tancock, who were both given the Freedom of the City in 2015.
Sandy Park will host it's first world cup group game when Tonga face Namibia on 29 September. It will then host Namibia versus Georgia on 7 October and Italy versus Romania on 11 October.
