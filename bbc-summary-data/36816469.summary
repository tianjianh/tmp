Canaries boss Alex Neil revealed, following his side's pre-season friendly win against Peterborough on Saturday, that Jarvis faces "two to three months out" after having surgery.
The 30-year-old joined the Canaries from West Ham for Â£2.5m in December 2015 after a loan spell at Carrow Road.
He played a total of 21 games for the club last season, scoring two goals.
City, who were relegated from the Premier League last season, are away against Blackburn Rovers in their opening game in the Championship on Saturday, 6 August.
