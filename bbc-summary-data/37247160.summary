[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A GP has been found guilty of having a stash of pornography, including a video of a man having sex with a snake.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cyprian Okoro, 55, from south-west London was found guilty of five counts of possessing extreme pornography and one indecent image of a child.
The Old Bailey heard the videos were of a "grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise obscene character".
Okoro was bailed for sentencing on 30 September.
Some of the five videos featured women having sex with dogs and one woman having sex with a horse.
The defendant, of Cameron Place, Streatham, had denied the charges.
But, after deliberating for less than a day, the jury found him guilty of all but two charges of possessing extreme pornography relating to bestiality with dogs.
The court heard Okoro stored the images on his mobile phone having received them via WhatsApp.
He had also moved an indecent video of a two-year-old boy into a password-protected "vault" on his phone.
Following the verdict, the jury was told it was Okoro's second conviction.
In 2014 he was handed a nine-month jail term suspended for 18 months at Norwich Crown Court after a woman made an allegation of sexual assault against him.
Judge Richard Hone QC said: "He is very lucky not to be immediately imprisoned and this was quite a bad case.
"It would be unfair to put him immediately in prison when the first trial gave him a suspended sentence - even if it was frankly, pretty lenient."
Okoro qualified as a doctor in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1986, and received an interim suspension by the General Medical Council in September 2013.
