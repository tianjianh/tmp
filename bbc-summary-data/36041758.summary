Four other male officers suffered less serious injuries during the attack in Plowright Close in Sheffield at about 19:50 BST on Wednesday.
A man was later arrested nearby on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody.
The female officer sustained "multiple serious injuries" in the attack.

Witnesses said the female officer was injured inside a maisonette, before a man fled to the Co-op and started throwing stock at staff and customers.
Neighbour Simon Ellis, 46, who went to help the officer, said she told him she feared the attacker would kill her.
Mr Ellis said he had noticed two officers running up the stairwell in his block of flats and then a woman resident emerged.
"She said [her boyfriend had] lost his mind, the aliens were chasing him and he was trying to kill the police officers that I'd just seen running up the stairs," he said.
"As she did so, the lady police officer, who's been injured the most, came half-staggering, half-falling out of the stairwell pursued by this big bloke, this bodybuilder, with an axe.
"It was a frenzied attack, chopping at her with the axe."
A force spokesman said the officers were responding to a "domestic incident" in Plowright Close where they found the man with the axe.
"The PC and a second male officer were injured as they made attempts to arrest the man," he said.
"Then three other officers, all men, were also injured as they arrested the man, in his 30s, inside the Co-op store, in Blackstock Road."
Deputy Chief Constable Dawn Copley said: "The officers who attended in Gleadless last night were faced with an extremely dangerous situation and showed immense bravery dealing with a violent individual."
Dr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, added: "This is the second incident in this area within a few days.
"Fortunately, in both cases arrests have been speedily made and the public at large is not in danger. The community has also rallied round."
On Tuesday, a woman was stabbed to death at her home in Gleadless Valley.
A man has been charged with her murder.
