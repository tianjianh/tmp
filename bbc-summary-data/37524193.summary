[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of an 80-year-old man who died following a violent robbery at his home have appealed for information on the anniversary of the attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tommy Ward was found badly beaten at his house in Salisbury Road, Maltby, South Yorkshire on 1 October 2015. Around Â£30,000 was thought to have been stolen from his home in the attack.
The former miner died from his injuries in hospital on 23 February.
His daughter Jackie Perry said the family "can't move on".
"I don't go in to Maltby," she said.
"I used to go down the High Street with my daughters on a Saturday morning, take the grandkids into the pet shop.
"But I can't do that because I know somebody knows something and they're not coming forward, and that's what we need."
She added: "It's been a terrible, long year. We want justice for my dad."
Three South Yorkshire men were arrested on suspicion of murder in August, but were later released on bail without charge.
