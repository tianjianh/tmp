England could play their first day-night Test in the Ashes series against Australia during the winter of 2017-18.

Cricket Australia (CA) say it would be a "natural progression" after hosting the inaugural day-night Test against New Zealand at Adelaide in November.
"It's on the radar, but we haven't had any formal conversations with the England and Wales Cricket Board," CA chief James Sutherland told ABC Radio.
"We're going to see more Test cricket played in the evening."
Cricket Australia were pleased by the attendances and the television viewing figures for the Test against the Black Caps, a low-scoring encounter won by the home side.
More than 123,000 supporters attended the three days of the match at the Adelaide Oval, while 1.67 million people watched the final session on the Nine Network.
Sutherland is keen for another day-night Test when Australia host Pakistan at the end of this year.
He added: "It seems like it would be a natural progression for there to be an Ashes day-night Test match in 2017-18."
Some players have expressed reservations about day-night Tests, with former England batsman Kevin Pietersen accusing administrators of "messing with the greatness" of the game, while Australia bowler Mitchell Starc claims the pink ball does not swing as much as the red ball and is difficult to see under lights.
