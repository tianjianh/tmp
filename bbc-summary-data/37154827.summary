The accident happened near Grantshouse at about 15:40 on Sunday.
A Mercedes Vito van was travelling south when it was in collision with a red Scania lorry heading in the opposite direction.
The woman, who was a passenger in the van, was pronounced dead at the scene. The road was closed for 12 hours for accident investigations.
Sgt Gary Taylor said: "Unfortunately a young woman has lost her life and we are currently working to establish the full set of circumstances that led up to this collision.
"I urge anyone who was travelling on the A1 on Sunday afternoon and who remembers seeing either the Mercedes Vito van or the Scania lorry to please contact police if they have not already done so."
