Fire took hold in the Grade II house in Node Court, Codicote, Hertfordshire, the early hours of 12 July 2015.
Police said the blaze, which "ravaged" the roof, had been "the largest of its kind in the UK".
Joshua Bozier, 24, of Dalton Way, Whitwell, admitted arson and was jailed for three years and four months at Cambridge Crown Court.
Bozier had smashed the window of a car parked next to the building and set it alight, Hertfordshire Police said.

It spread to the thatched roof, totally destroying it and causing extensive damage to the building itself.
Investigators described Bozier's actions as "mindless, fruitless and reckless".
The blaze in the building, which housed a number of businesses, was "thought to be one of the most costly arsons the country has known", Det Con David Quinn said.
