Scotland's Kim Little has called for a Great Britain team to compete at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.

Representatives of the English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish football associations have held discussions without coming to a resolution.
"I think it was extremely disappointing that there wasn't one at the Rio Games last year," the 26-year-old Arsenal midfielder told BBC Sport.
"Especially considering the England girls did so well to qualify for it."
Little, the current BBC Women's Footballer of the Year, did play for GB when men's and women's teams were fielded at the home Olympics in 2012.
The Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh associations refused to take part in a united team but said they would not object to England competing alone.
But there were no legal grounds to prevent the British Olympic Association choosing non-English players and several accepted the invitation.
"I've always supported Team GB and I was so grateful to be a part of the squad at the London 2012 Olympics," said Little, who was selected along with Scotland defender Ifeoma Dieke.
"I am a big supporter of being Scottish obviously but being British as well.
"I think it is another step to enhance the game and to develop women's football here in Britain."
The Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh associations fear that competing under a united GB banner could undermine their right to compete individually in European Championship and World Cup competitions.
No change to that stance emerged after their meeting with their English counterparts at the Uefa Congress in Helsinki earlier this month.
However, Little hopes another compromise can be reached and a combined team can play in Tokyo.
"Japan have been one of the leading nations for women's football and play such a unique style of football as well," added Little, who has returned to Arsenal after a spell with Seattle Reign.
"It would definitely be special if there was a team there and I was be able to participate again after being in the London 2012 Olympics."
