While thousands updated their social media accounts to say they'd been successful, many more cried into their Sunday porridge after missing out. Again.
But there is still a (OK, pretty small) chance you'll be going.
So if you haven't got a ticket yet, here's Newsbeat's guide to trying to blag your way into Worthy Farm in Somerset.
A lot can change in nine months and there will be always be people who can no longer make it.
Fingers crossed, a fair number of these people will give their tickets back to organisers - these will then go back into a bank of available tickets.
So your best chance is being poised to pounce on the resale pot in early 2015.
Some organisations, such as Oxfam, offer tickets - in return for your time.
Volunteers are always needed at the festival to act as stewards, doing things like watching entrances and exits.
In return for your ticket you're usually required to work several shifts over the course of the weekend.
You have to pay a deposit upfront for the ticket but that's reimbursed at the end providing you've done your job and not ended up partying day and night in Shangri La.
Some tickets are kept specifically for people who live in and around Pilton, the village where Glastonbury closest to Worthy Farm.
This keeps the local community happy as tens of of thousands of people descend on them and their local services for a week in June.
Day tickets for the Sunday are available exclusively for residents in Somerset whose day-to-day lives are most likely to be affected by the festival.
In addition, a limited amount of full tickets are available for people who live in parishes in central Somerset.
Those tickets are available from next year and the usual registration system applies.
If you make the best beetroot smoothies in the country, can knock up an artisan wood-fired pizza or simply make a great burger, you can apply to trade at Glastonbury.
It'll cost you money and you'd be tied up with serving huge lines of hungry festival-goers.
However, through the haze of noodle steam food you might be able to grab a bit of music.
Traders can apply to work at Glastonbury from 13 October.
You could always get some mates together and create an incredible debut album.
A place on the Radio 1 or 1Xtra playlist would beckon.
Alex Turner from Arctic Monkeys or Tom Meighan from Kasabian could become your biggest fan.
You may even nab a Brit Award.
By that point, Glastonbury organisers would have no choice but to put you on the bill. As emergency headliner. Good luck.
