[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has described being shot by a gunman seconds after collecting his daughter from primary school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Sherlock, 35, from Glasgow, said he was walking towards his car when a man wearing fluorescent workmen's clothing pulled out a gun and fired.
Mr Sherlock said he threw the umbrella he was carrying at the gunman and ran.
He was giving evidence at the High Court in Glasgow at the trial of William Burns and Alexander Porter, who deny attempting to murder Mr Sherlock.
They also deny assaulting crime journalist Russell Findlay to the danger of his life at his home in the city's west end on 23 December in 2015 by throwing sulphuric acid in his face.
The prosecution also alleges that the offences were aggravated by a connection to serious organised crime.
Mr Sherlock, who described himself as a kitchen fitter at the time of the shooting on 24 September 2015, told the court he was walking down a lane from St Helen's Primary School in Bishopbriggs and was chatting to another parent as their daughters walked hand-in-hand in front.
The jury heard that the area was busy with parents collecting their children from the school at the time.
He was asked by prosecutor Richard Goddard: "What happened then?"
The witness replied: "I noticed a gentleman with working clothes. They were fluorescent, I think yellow. He was coming from behind me and walked towards me. He pulled a gun out, hit me and I ran."
Mr Sherlock added: "He was less than 10 feet away. I just saw him coming towards me."
Mr Goddard asked Mr Sherlock: "You threw the golf umbrella you had in the direction of the gunman?"
He replied: "Yes, as he was about to fire the first shot. The gun was in his pocket and I saw him pull it out. That's when I threw my brolly."
Mr Sherlock told the prosecutor that the weapon was a handgun that looked "pretty big".
The jurors were told that Mr Sherlock was hit on the right arm and that the bullet had broken his arm as it passed through the limb.
He also suffered a graze on his chest and said it was caused by the spent bullet hitting his side.
He said he ran through gardens, ending up in Ronaldsay Drive, where he phoned his partner, who went to get his daughter.
Mr Sherlock said: "I just asked her if our daughter was okay and I told her to come and get me."
The pair then drove to the Royal Infirmary in Glasgow to have Mr Sherlock's injury treated.
Mr Goddard asked: "Did it cross your mind to phone the police?"
Mr Sherlock replied: "No, my object was to get to hospital to get treatment."
Mr Sherlock was asked if he could identify the gunman, to which he responded: "No. When I saw him approaching me, I watched his hands more than anything."
William Burns, 56, has lodged a special defence of alibi in relation to the attempted murder of Mr Sherlock, saying he was working at Guinea Enviro in Maryhill, Glasgow, at the time.
He has also lodged a special defence incriminating James Boyce for the shooting and whose whereabouts is unknown.
The trial before judge Lord Matthews continues.
