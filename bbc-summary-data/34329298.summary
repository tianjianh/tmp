Princes Harry and William have visited the BBC's DIY SOS team as it works to turn a derelict Manchester street into housing for veterans.

The project will see several empty properties on Canada Street, Newton Heath, transformed into liveable homes for ex-service personnel.
Both Royal brothers joined the show's builders and hundreds of volunteers to help with the scheme's final stages.
Eight buildings are to be renovated and 62 house facades will be updated.
A support centre will be created, run by the Walking with the Wounded charity and the Royal British Legion.
The centre aims to help ex-servicemen and women with retraining and on-site support for those with mental or physical injuries.
DIY SOS's builders have described it as their "most ambitious" project to date.
Prince William showed off his artistic flair as he painted a kitchen, whilst Prince Harry was tasked with laying garden paving stones.
Resident John Wilkinson, 58, said the Royal visit was "brilliant" but fears he may be left single after his wife's meeting with Prince Harry.
He said: "They were gentlemen. They were flirting with Margaret more than anyone else. She was well chuffed with Harry. I think she is going to leave me."
The DIY project prevented his home in Canada Street, where he has lived for 28 years, from being demolished, he added.
He said: "Hopefully this is the catalyst across the country to do something for all our soldiers and families. There is no reason for our soldiers to be living on the streets, they can come and form a nice community here."
Paul Murphy, 47, who served with the Second Battalion Royal Irish Rangers and in the Falklands, said he would not be washing his hands after shaking Prince William's hand twice, adding the visit was "well played".
