South Africa v Ireland: Henshaw to miss final Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland centre Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the third and decisive Test against South Africa on Saturday because of a knee cartilage injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Leinster-bound Connacht player, who came off late in the 32-16 weekend defeat in Johannesburg, has returned home and will see a specialist.
Ulster centre Luke Marshall is in line to be recalled as Henshaw's replacement in Port Elizabeth.
Ireland won the opening Test before the Springboks levelled the series.
Henshaw was forced off with three minutes remaining in Johannesburg as Ireland succumbed to a late onslaught from South Africa .
The tourists were on course to become the first home nation to secure a series victory in South Africa, leading 19-3 at the break and holding a 26-10 advantage in the second half.
However, South Africa stormed back to clinch a memorable comeback success and set up a decider on Saturday.
