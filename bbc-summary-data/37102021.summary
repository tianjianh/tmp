Rio Olympics 2016: Nile Wilson wins Great Britain's first high bar medal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nile Wilson became the first Briton to win an Olympic medal in the horizontal bar by claiming bronze at Rio 2016.

The 20-year-old from Leeds, appearing in his first Games, won Britain's seventh gymnastics medal in Brazil.
Germany's Fabian Hambuechen, silver medallist at London 2012, took gold with a score of 15.766, ahead of Danell Leyva of the United States (15.500).
Leyva pipped European champion Wilson's mark of 15.466 with the last routine of the final.
Wilson was the first British man to even qualify for an Olympic high bar final, having created history in May by winning the nation's first gold at the European Championships.
And securing bronze capped a remarkable week for British gymnastics in the Rio Olympic Arena.
Before Rio, Team GB had only ever claimed eight Olympic medals - two silver and six bronze - with four of those coming at London 2012.

Starting third, Wilson moved second behind 28-year-old Hambuechen, but ahead of defending champion Epke Zonderland, who fell off the apparatus as he finished seventh.
Wilson remained in the silver-medal position until Leyva, going last in the eight-man field, overtook him.
Wilson's success came just 50 minutes after 16-year-old team-mate Amy Tinkler won bronze in the women's floor - becoming only the second British woman to win an individual gymnastics medal.
Dan Keatings, British gymnast and BBC Sport analyst:
"Team GB have seven medals now and we never thought we would ever get anywhere near that. It shows how strong our team is across the board."
