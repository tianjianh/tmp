The Welshman along with Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy beat world champions Australia to claim gold in Rio.
Doull, 23, will join up with Team Sky for the rest of the 2016 before turning professional full-time on the road in 2017.
"It's always been a bit of a boyhood dream to try and join Sky," Doull said.
"So to finally be at a stage where I'm about to start racing for the team, and then joining the team properly in 2017, is a bit surreal."
Doull joined Team Wiggins in January 2015, but will now link up with fellow Welsh riders Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe at Team Sky.
Team Sky Team Principal Sir Dave Brailsford said: "Owain has consistently put in excellent performances on the track and the road and we think he has the potential to be an important part of the team."
