[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Floyd persuaded the women to grant him power of attorney after their husbands died and siphoned the cash from their accounts over 10 years.
He denied two counts of fraud by abuse of position, but was convicted after a trial at Southampton Crown Court.
Police described as "utterly contemptible" his actions, which included selling one victim's house.
Floyd, of Oakfield Gardens in Southampton, who was jailed for six years, met his victims - from Aldershot and Park Gate, Hampshire -  when he was delivering food.
Hampshire Police said it led to him becoming increasingly involved in the care of the women, both now aged in their 80s.
He persuaded them to change their wills to make him the main beneficiary and, with power of attorney, used their money for other purposes than their own care.
In the case of the victim from Aldershot, he eventually placed her into nursing care, sold her house and spent £230,000 of her money.
He lost over £50,000 of the money through gambling at bookmakers.
Floyd also groomed his victim from Park Gate into trusting him and went on to take out £32,000 of loans and a £20,000 mortgage in her name.
A police investigation was eventually launched when concerns were raised by the Office of Public Guardian about Floyd's role as the women's attorney.
PC Vicky Cobley said: "Floyd's actions been particularly distressing for both his victims and their families, due to their age and vulnerability.
"In both cases Floyd took advantage of women who had recently been bereaved which is utterly contemptible."
Hampshire police said it was working to whatever money it could for Floyd's victims through the Proceeds of Crime Act.
