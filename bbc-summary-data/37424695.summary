The buyer has said the acquisition would secure the jobs of the 2,000 workers employed by the company in Norfolk and Suffolk.
A spokesman for Ranjit Singh Boparan's firm said it intends to "respect" and "build" on the firm's 66-year heritage.
The union Unite, which represents 800 of the company's workforce, "cautiously" welcomed the news.
A spokesman for Boparan Private Office, a private investment company which owns the 2 Sisters Food Group, said: "We have a proven track record in turning around businesses and we aim to make Bernard Matthews great again."
Bernard Matthews had a difficult time with an outbreak of bird flu at its factory at Holton in Suffolk in 2007.
It also faced problems with the the soaring cost of turkey feed in 2011.
Unite is due to meet the management team at Bernard Matthews' headquarters at 10:00 BST on Wednesday.
The union's regional officer Steve Harley said: "Searching questions will be asked on future employment, pay, and terms and conditions.
"We will also be asking about the status of the pension scheme under the new owners, although it is expected that our members won't be affected in this respect by the takeover."
Unite represents about 800 of the 2,000-strong workforce at the producing sites at Great Witchingham in Norfolk and Holton in Suffolk, as well as the animal food mill at Bawsey, near King's Lynn.
There was speculation over the future of Bernard Matthews over the summer after Rutland Partners appointed PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to look for possible buyers.
