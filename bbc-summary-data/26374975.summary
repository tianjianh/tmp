Eugene Ellis, Chris Morshead and Josh Band will travel to Japan, where Jersey expect to compete in Division Four.
"We've got a good team who have trained very hard with the Commonwealths and the Island Games not far away," Jersey Table Tennis Association president Chris Band told BBC Radio Jersey.
The event gets under way on 28 April, with 123 countries competing.
