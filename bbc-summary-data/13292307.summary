[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tests on the satellite-tagged bird - found at the Glenbuchat Estate in Strathdon - tested positive for the banned pesticide carbofuran.
Grampian Police and officers from the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate (SGRPID) are among those investigating.
The force said no-one had been charged and inquiries were continuing.
Pc Dave MacKinnon, Grampian's wildlife crime officer, said: "We are always very concerned when illegal pesticides are used in our countryside for the poisoning of birds of prey.
"I am particularly disappointed that this incident has resulted in the death of a young golden eagle.
"Articles have been removed from the estate and are being sent for analysis."
