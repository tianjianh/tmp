A Grade I-listed Georgian mansion is set to open its doors for the first time since a £1.4m three-year roof restoration project.

The National Trust, owners of Attingham Park, outside Shrewsbury, said the roof of the picture gallery had leaked ever since it was built in 1807.
The "highly experimental" design came from architect John Nash, who was responsible for Buckingham Palace.
A new glass and steel roof has been built over Nash's original.
Saturday marks the first time the public will be able to see the completed work.

The Through the Roof project has seen Attingham reach new heights with the installation of the "cutting-edge glass roof", the National Trust said.
Nash's original curved, cast iron and glass roof has been conserved, while plasterwork and gilding has been repaired inside the picture gallery.
A smaller, secondary roof has been constructed over the staircase.
Nash's use of cast iron in the roof was one of the first of its kind in a non-industrial building, the National Trust said.
Helen Royall, who managed the project, said the team were "thrilled" to be able to show off their work.
"There have been some unique moments, from the crane lifting the steel beams and glass panels, to visitors being able to climb up high and go on scaffolding tours," she said.
