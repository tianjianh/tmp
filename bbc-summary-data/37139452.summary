[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 0-2 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Second-half goals from Chris Porter and Sammie Szmodics gave Colchester a win away at Wycombe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Porter converted Szmodics' cross from close-range before the winger was in on the action himself, arrowing home a 20-yard volley late on.
The first chance of a cagey first half fell to Aaron Pierre but the Wycombe centre-half was unable to steer Danny Rowe's cross into the far corner, despite heading unchallenged from 12 yards out.
Jamal Blackman was the only goalkeeper called into any real action before the break as he saved low to his left after Brennan Dickenson had wriggled into the area from the Colchester left flank.
But the deadlock was broken with just over an hour gone as Porter bundled home Szmodics' cross from inside the six-yard box for his first of the season.
And the Colchester number 10 sealed the points in style, volleying home from outside the area as the visitors registered their third league win in five games.
