Highland Council pass replacement £7.5m Torvean golf course plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A replacement golf course for Torvean Golf Club is to be built in Inverness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Highland Council have approved the plans for the facility, which will cost £7.5m.
The golf club has to be moved as part of plans to build the controversial new West Link road.
Inverness councillor Jimmy Grey said the move would make a big improvement to the course and bring major benefits to future generations.
The development will include a new clubhouse and the reshaping of a significant area of ground.
The existing course is on the route of the proposed £34m West Link road.
Using the land at Charleston would mean golfers no longer having to cross the A82 and General Booth Road when moving between holes.
