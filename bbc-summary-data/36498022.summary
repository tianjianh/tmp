[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No action will be taken following an investigation into an "indecent" novel sent to last year's National Eisteddfod, police have confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The novel was submitted to the Eisteddfod's office in Mold as an entry for the Daniel Owen Memorial Prize.
It was handed to North Wales Police in March 2015, and investigated under the Obscene Communications Act.
At the time, Eisteddfod chief executive Elfed Roberts described the novel's content as "bluntly criminal."
In July 2015, officials told the BBC the novel referred to "criminal" acts and caused "concern".
Speaking at the time, Det Ch Insp Iestyn Davies said: "The work concerned has been assessed as being offensive and indecent in its nature and is being investigated as an offence under the Obscene Communications Act."
Back in July 2015, Mr Roberts told BBC Radio Cymru: "When you know that the work is against the law - then there was no other option but to take action."
He said a false name and address was supplied by the entrant.
The Daniel Owen Memorial Prize is given annually to a novel of no fewer than 50,000 words for a Â£5,000 prize.
