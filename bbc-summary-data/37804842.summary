[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A race record of 2,200 runners took part in Saturday's Snowdonia Marathon.

Russell Bentley from Kent, who now lives in Beddgelert, Gwynedd, won the race in a time of 02:35:05. The women's race was won by Joanne Nelson of Darwen Dashers in a record time of 03:03:53.
The race, now in its 34th year, got under way at 10:30 BST near Llanberis, Gwynedd, and circled the foothills of Snowdon.
Mr Bentley said it was the "hardest thing I've ever done".
Among those pitting themselves against the tough course was the Bishop of Bangor, the Right Reverend Andy John.
Before the race, Bishop John said it would be "slightly more tolerable" when he thinks "something greater" may come from it.
He tackled the course for the third time to raise money for Caroline Gregory, who has volunteered at the now-cleared "Jungle" migrant camp in Calais.
