Vandals urinate in Sunderland church holy water

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vandals have broken into a Sunderland church and urinated in holy water.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The would-be thieves smashed through a window at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Bridge Street, and used fire extinguishers to break down doors.
Father Marc Lyden-Smith said a police officer had smelled urine from a stoup and said he found it "incredible" anyone could do such a thing.
He said nothing was taken during the break-in on Thursday.
"Our cleaning volunteers came in on Thursday morning and saw the damage," Father Lyden-Smith said.
"A police officer noticed there seemed to be urine in the holy water stoup. It is incredible.
"It has been cleaned out, of course."
He added: "It is disappointing but it is the year of mercy and we have to keep that in our thoughts."
Holy water is used by Catholics to make the sign of the cross when they come into church and the stoup is usually by the entrance.
