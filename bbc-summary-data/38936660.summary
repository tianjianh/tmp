Former Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Falkirk manager John Hughes has been appointed Raith Rovers boss until the end of the season.

The 52-year-old takes over after this week's sacking of Gary Locke.
Hughes told Rovers' website: "I feel this is a good fit for me at this stage of my career.
"And though the task ahead will be a challenging one in a very competitive league, I'm confident I can make a telling, positive impact."
Hughes, who left Caley Thistle last summer, takes over with Rovers sitting third bottom of the Scottish Championship after a run of 14 matches without a win.
"This role appealed to me straight away not just because of my knowledge of the club itself but also because of a very enthusiastic approach from Rovers to my agent, Raymond Sparkes," he said.
Rovers chief executive Eric Drysdale explained how the Kirkcaldy club were able to make such a swift appointment.
"It's only 48 hours since I first contacted John's agent, Raymond Sparkes, and it's been a whirlwind day or two pulling this deal together," he said.
"It's fair to say we are excited to have been able to attract someone of John's experience and calibre - a man who was voted PFA Scotland and SFWA Manager of the Year in 2015 following significant successes as boss of Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
"Although this agreement extends only until the end of this season, we're confident John's particular brand of management will bring a freshness to Stark's Park and excite our fans.
"Most importantly, the team has been a bit lacking in confidence of late and if there is any manager in Scottish football better equipped than Yogi to do something about that then I've no idea who that person is."
Hughes, a player with Berwick Rangers, Swansea City, Falkirk, Celtic, Hibernian and Ayr United, won promotion to the top flight during his six-year spell as Falkirk boss.
He went on to manage Hibs, Livingston, Hartlepool United and Caley Thistle, leading the Highland side to their first Scottish Cup triumph in 2015.
His first game in charge of Rovers will be at home to former club Hibs on 18 February.
