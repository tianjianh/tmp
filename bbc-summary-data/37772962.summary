[SN]TITLE[SN]
RMT to ballot Southern drivers over the role of conductors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers on Southern rail are to be balloted on industrial action in the ongoing row over driver-only trains.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The RMT union said its members would be asked to vote on both strike action and action short of a strike.
It has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with Southern over changes to the role of conductors.
The main drivers' union, Aslef, is also balloting its members in the same dispute, raising the possibility of joint strikes in December.

Southern - which said the ballot move was "unnecessary" - wants drivers, rather than conductors, to operate carriage doors at certain times.
Passengers have already endured months of delays and cancellations in a campaign of industrial action involving conductors, but this is the first time drivers have been balloted.
A further three blocks of strikes are planned before Christmas.
The RMT wants to retain the role of conductor, in addition to the driver, on trains at all times, citing safety.
Its ballot of drivers opens on 4 November and closes two weeks later, on 18 November, mirroring the ballot timetable of sister rail union Aslef.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: "Drivers on Southern rail will find themselves dangerously exposed if the company decide to plough ahead with their ill-conceived and dangerous plans for a wholesale extension of driver-only operation on their routes.
"Drivers will be placed in an impossible position trying to monitor despatch from overcrowded platforms while they should be concentrating on the job of driving the train.
"The consequences for safety at the critical platform/train interface are horrendous."
A Southern spokesman said: "This ballot is unnecessary. Our proposals to transfer the full operation of the train to the driver to allow the on board supervisor to concentrate on customer service are totally safe, and a proven method of operation."
