County Championships: Cornwall seal place in final after 32-14 Surrey win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cornwall reached their fourth County Championship final in a row after a 32-14 win over Surrey at Camborne.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cornwall ran into a 20-5 lead after 30 minutes thanks to two tries from Billy Searle either side of a Neilson Webber score, as Matt Noble replied.
Surrey kicked three penalties either side of the break to narrow the gap before Searle got his third try with 17 minutes to go.
Herbie Stupple rounded off the win with a fifth score to send Cornwall through.
They are the reigning county champions after winning the Bill Beaumont Cup last year when they beat Lancashire in the final.
But, after three matches with the Red Rose county, they will face Cheshire in the final after they beat Lancashire 27-11 in their decisive clash at Fylde.
