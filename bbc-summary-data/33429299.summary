[SN]TITLE[SN]
Three on trial over Edinburgh 'garden fork' murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men have gone on trial accused of murdering another man in an Edinburgh street after allegedly attacking him with a weapon, possibly a garden fork.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Sim, 21, James Watson, 27, and Paul Watson, 29, deny killing Thomas Lamb at Edinburgh's Restalrig Circus on 20 September last year.
Lawyers entered not guilty pleas on their behalf at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Between them, the men are accused of four charges.
Prosecutors allege that Gary Sim assaulted Mr Lamb at the Tor public house in Restalrig Road on 19 or 20 September.
It is claimed that Mr Sim approached Mr Lamb from behind before putting his arm around his neck, pulling him from his chair, and pushing him on the body, causing him to fall to the ground. Mr Sim then allegedly caused Mr Lamb's head to strike against a table and chair.
The second charge alleges that on 20 September at Restalrig Circus, Mr Sim and the two Mr Watsons repeatedly struck Mr Lamb on the head and body.
Prosecutors claim that the three men then repeatedly kicked and jumped on Mr Lamb's head and body before repeatedly striking him "with a garden fork, knife or other similar sharply pointed or bladed instrument."
It is claimed that Mr Lamb sustained multiple stab wounds and that the three men murdered him.
The third charge alleges that having committed murder, Mr Sim attempted to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of his clothing and washing his hands.
It is claimed that he performed these actions at an address in Loganlea Drive, Edinburgh, and elsewhere in the city between 20 and 22 September in an "attempt to avoid prosecution".
The fourth charge alleges that between 20 and 22 September, at Taylor Place and elsewhere in Edinburgh, James Watson cleaned his clothing and shoes in an attempt to defeat the ends of justice.
The trial continues.
