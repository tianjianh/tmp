[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-police officer John Edward Bates convicted of abusing boys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former police officer and scout leader has been convicted of a series of sex attacks on boys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Edward Bates, 68, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, was found guilty by the jury at Lincoln Crown Court of 16 charges of indecent assault on a male person.
He was also found guilty of two charges of indecency with a child.
Judge Simon Hirst described Bates as a predatory man who abused the enormous trust placed in him.
Bates, now of Camden, north London, was remanded and will be sentenced on Friday. He was warned to expect a "very substantial" jail sentence.
Bates, who served with Lincolnshire Police between 1976 and 1983, was cleared of two further charges of indecent assault and two serious sexual offences.
He denied all 22 charges, claiming the victims fabricated the evidence against him.
Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury during the trial that Bates abused two of the boys while he was a scout leader in Wittering where he served in the Royal Air Force. Bates later became a scout leader in Spalding and went on to abuse two more boys.
Bates had previously served a four-year jail sentence for offences against young boys, imposed at Nottingham Crown Court, after an earlier investigation into him in 1982.
