Set in India in 1947, the film stars Hugh Bonneville as Lord Mountbatten.
The 67th Berlin Film Festival runs from 9 to 17 February. The event will open with Django, a biopic of jazz legend Django Reinhardt.
The long-awaited sequel to Trainspotting has also been added to Berlin's 2017 line-up.
Directed by Danny Boyle, T2: Trainspotting has its world premiere in Edinburgh on 22 January.
