Mrs Leonard, 51, was found dead in her home in Maguiresbridge on Monday, believed to have been stabbed by former partner Peadar Phair.
Phair's body was also found at the scene in Abbey Road.
Her son Conor, who is in his 30s and has Down's syndrome, was found with stab wounds to his stomach.
The family's priest said Conor is due to be discharged from hospital and he wants to carry his mother's coffin.
"He's said he wants to carry the coffin, so with the help of the family and the community I'm sure he'll be able to cope," Father Lawrence Dawson said.
The Courts Service said there was to have been a full hearing to confirm the non-molestation order, preventing contact with Mrs Leonard, in Enniskillen courthouse on Tuesday.
Police are treating the attack on Conor Leonard as attempted murder.
They are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
Mrs Leonard was well-known from her involvement with the Irish music organisation Comhaltas.
Sonny McDermott, from the organisation, said its members had been left shocked by her death.
"You couldn't believe it could happen, but I suppose these things happen - you can do nothing about it, the loss of a talented person like that," he said.
"It's a big loss to Comhaltas because she was very much involved and she was treasurer of the Lisnaskea branch and has been involved at different levels over the years."
Fr Dawson, the priest in Ms Leonard's parish of Aghavea, said a "wave of shock and grief" had spread through the area.
"I knew Connie very well, she was an active member of the parish, a great musician, an all-Ireland champion and she shared her talents in church services," he said.
"It affects everyone when they see how fragile life is and how easily it can be snuffed out.
"But it's a tight-knit community here and they're rallying around the family, and they'll help them pull through it and help them to face the future with faith and courage.
Mrs Leonard ran a catering business in Lisnaskea in County Fermanagh.
