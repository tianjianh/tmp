Basildon and Brentwood Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is looking to cut the service as part of plans to tackle a Â£14m deficit.
Fertility Fairness said: "Infertility is a disease of the reproductive system and as such is worthy of treatment."
John Leslie, of the CCG, said: "We have a legal duty to live within our means."

Sarah Norcross, co-chair of Fertility Fairness, said: "The announcement today is appalling. For people not to realise it is a health need is, I think, insulting to all those facing fertility problems."
Mr Leslie said: "We believe these proposed measures represent a way to help us make important savings while having the lowest possible impact on patient care.
"We do recognise however that some people will be more affected than others and we are keen to listen to the impact these proposals may have before we make any decisions on how to proceed."
