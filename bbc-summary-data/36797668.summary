The 31-year-old signed a one-year deal with the Tannadice outfit, becoming manager Ray McKinnon's sixth summer signing as they seek a return to the Scottish Premiership.
"I would not have dropped down the divisions for any other club," Flood told the Dundee United website.
"I hope that shows how much I want to be back at United."
Flood made 152 appearances in his three previous spells at United, making two separate loan moves while at Cardiff City from 2007-2009, before returning in 2011 following spells at Celtic and Middlesbrough.
"The reason I have come back to United is primarily the manager," he said.
"Everything he told me of his plans for the club I liked. His ambition, drive and desire convinced me this move would be good for me.
"I'm the same player, I want my team mates to do well and I will demand that of them and I will be a good teammate back."
Flood makes the move to Tannadice with fellow midfielder Cammy Smith, who joined United on loan from the Dons on Wednesday.
Tope Obadeyi, Cammy Bell, Stewart Murdoch and Lewis Toshney have all signed for United during pre-season.
Manager McKinnon, who replaced Mixu Paatelainen in May, said: "Willo is a fantastic footballer who can dictate games from the middle of the park. I have been chasing him since I came in. He is quality.
"He is the ideal player for us with his experience and ability. Willo is a winner who sets standards and on the training field which will be great for the young players within the squad.
"We need to ensure consistency in our performances and Willo will demand that of his teammates. I have had to be patient in bringing in new players but I have got six who I wanted now and that delights me."
Earlier in the day Aberdeen announced the departure of Flood, who had been at Pittodrie since 2013, despite still having one year left on his current deal.
Flood made his final appearance for the Dons in the 1-0 Europa League loss to Fola Esch last week.
"He was as significant a signing that I've made since I came here and has played a pivotal role both on and off the park," said Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes.
