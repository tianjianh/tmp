On Sunday morning, the ship rescued 310 people on a barge and a further 89 were lifted off two inflatable crafts, 75km north of Libya, that afternoon.
In the past two days, LÉ Eithne has saved more than 500 people attempting to cross the Mediterranean from Africa to Europe.
LÉ Eithne will be deployed in the Mediterranean for up to six months.
Italy's coastguard said nearly 3,500 migrants were rescued in total on Sunday from 15 boats off the coast of Libya.
The International Organisation for Migration has praised the Irish Naval Service for its efforts.
To date, it has brought more than 1,100 people to safety in the Mediterranean.
It is estimated that more than 1,600 people have drowned so far this year trying to make the crossing.
Many are fleeing war in Libya, where so-called Islamic State fighters are terrorising the population, fuelling instability in the war-torn country.
