[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 1-1 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aiden O'Brien's second-half tap-in denied Coventry their first win of the season as Millwall rescued a point.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side had early chances, David Worrall heading over from Joe Martin's cross, while Byron Webster wasted an opportunity from a Worrall corner inside the first 15 minutes.
But Coventry led after 22 minutes through Marvin Sordell's first goal for the club.
The forward showed strength under pressure to swivel and fire home from 25 yards for only the Sky Blues' third league goal this term.
Coventry keeper Reice Charles-Cook's attempted clearance played in O'Brien before half-time, but he dragged his shot wide.
The visitors repeatedly went close after the break, Sordell's header trickling inches wide before Tony Craig deflected his shot behind minutes later.
Superb play from Steve Morison on 71 minutes, skinning Jordan Turnbull before setting up O'Brien from close range, set up a grandstand finish.
Substitute Jodi Jones' free-kick forced a quality save from Jordan Archer, while Morison headed narrowly wide.
