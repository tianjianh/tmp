It's been rigged up on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, and those taking the plunge start off 115 metres above the ground.
It's all because the French Open tennis competition is currently going on in the country.
So the idea is that anyone trying out the zip wire will get an idea of just how fast a tennis ball can move through the air.
It travels at 90 kilometres per hour (about 55 miles per hour), which is the speed of a tennis ball being smashed.
But it's still not as quick of the world's fastest zip line in north Wales, which reaches speeds of around 191 kilometres per hour (119 miles per hour)!
