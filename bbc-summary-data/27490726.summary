Shetland seabed turbine power hailed a community 'world first'

A community-owned tidal power turbine in Shetland has started exporting electricity to the local grid in what is being hailed a world first.

It is expected the turbine will power up to 30 homes, an ice plant and an industrial estate.
The Nova Innovation turbine is more than 100ft down on the seabed and electricity is transmitted onshore via a subsea cable.
The Scottish government welcomed the start of power generation.
Energy Minister Fergus Ewing, attending the All-Energy Conference in Aberdeen, said: "For the first time, anywhere in the world, a community-owned tidal turbine is generating electricity.
"It will have a positive impact on the North Yell community and economy.
"Scotland is recognised as world leader in wave and tidal energy, with a quarter of Europe's tidal stream and a tenth of its wave-energy potential.
"We must tackle climate change and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels through better and more efficient uses of energy. That is why Scotland generated a record amount of electricity from green energy sources last year."
Robert Henderson, of Shetland Islands Council and North Yell Development Council, said: "This is a tremendous moment for North Yell.
"For the first time anywhere in the world, electricity is being generated from a community-owned tidal turbine.
"Having used as much local expertise as possible we're keen to see Shetland taking a leading role in marine renewables."
Simon Forrest, managing director of Leith-based Nova Innovation, said: "We are delighted to announce that the Nova 30 tidal turbine has been successfully deployed and is generating electricity to the grid."
WWF Scotland's climate and energy policy officer Gina Hanrahan said: "It's great to see yet another first for Scottish tidal power."
