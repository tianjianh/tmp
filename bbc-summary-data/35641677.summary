But it could be a while before she makes her debut for the Scottish Women's Premier League club as she is pregnant with the couple's first child.
"I'm due to give birth to our son in about seven weeks," she said.
"So I might be able to play in the summer. I played until I was 15 weeks. I'm keeping fit by going to the gym every day."
The couple, who have known one another since they were at school, have both represented Denmark.
They moved to Scotland when 24-year-old defender Sviatchenko was transferred to Celtic from Midtjylland in his homeland for Â£1.5m in January.
The central defender - the author of a fashion blog along with his brother, Philip - is the son of Ukrainian-born multi-platform artist, Sergei Sviatchenko.
Rudmose, who previously played for Swedish club Viborg and featured at the Women's Under-17 World Cup in 2008, was keen to continue her own football career despite her pending motherhood.
Sviatchenko said: "We met through my twin sister when we were 14.
"Our careers have developed at the same time too.
"When I knew I was coming to Celtic, we started looking for a club that Anne could play for."
Celtic finished third last season in the SWPL and Sviatchenko says they have signed a fast left winger with an eye for goal.
He also describes her as "a real team player" on the pitch - and in family life.
For her part, Rudmose describes her partner as "a good leader".
Sviatchenko already has a strategy to avoid sleepless nights in the early stages of fatherhood.
"We've agreed that I will be able to sleep on the couch," he added.
Celtic start their season on Sunday when they host Hibernian in the first round of the SWPL Cup.
