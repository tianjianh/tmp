[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 2-2 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry City came back to snatch a late draw at home to fellow strugglers AFC Wimbledon thanks to on-loan substitute Andre Wright's injury-time strike.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sky Blues' sixth draw in 10 games maintains their winless start to the League One season, while the Dons' point lifts them out of the bottom four.
In front of their lowest home crowd in 17 months Tony Mowbray's City made a great start, scoring only their fifth league goal of the season inside the second minute.
James Shea could only parry Kyel Reid's cross, allowing Marvin Sordell to blast in right-footed from eight yards.
Jon Meades levelled when he out-jumped home keeper Reice Charles-Cook to head home Darius Charles' nod down.
Marcus Tudgay should then immediately have put City back in front, only to volley over from close range, while Reid had a shot deflected over early in the second half.
Just when the Sky Blues had run out of steam and looked to be settling for a point, the Dons stunned them by taking the lead as Meades' header was parried by Charles-Cook but Lyle Taylor was left unmarked at the far post to nod in.
City were given nine minutes of injury time to rescue something from the game and they got a point when Daniel Agyei had his shot saved by Shea, only for fellow sub Wright to scramble in the rebound.
