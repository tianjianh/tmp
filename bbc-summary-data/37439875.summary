Jeska, of Powys, will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on 15 November.

Police said Mr Knibbs suffered life-threatening injuries after being stabbed in the head and neck, and is still recovering from the attack.
The former Bristol RFC centre and head of human resources and welfare at UK Athletics, was in court to hear Jeska enter her pleas via video link from HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire.
The court heard the injuries of Jeska's other victims - accountant Mr Begley and finance director Mr Taylor - were "not of the most serious order".
Prosecutor Timothy Atkins QC said not guilty pleas to charges of wounding were acceptable to the Crown.
"I have had the opportunity of consulting those who instruct me and they have spoken with the complainants in this matter," he said.
"During the course of the attack (on Mr Knibbs), Mr Taylor and Mr Begley went to his assistance and both were injured.
"Thankfully their injuries were not of the most serious order and so the pleas to wounding are acceptable to the Crown given the pleas that have been entered."
Although Jeska admitted possessing two kitchen knives, she denied possessing a bread knife which had been left in a bag before the attack on 51-year-old Mr Knibbs.
Judge Philip Parker QC was told Jeska, of Wesley Terrace in Machynlleth, had been the subject of psychiatric assessment but further reports would be necessary before she is sentenced.
Defending, Julie Warburton said a diagnosis of autism may be raised at the next hearing, which would be invited to consider whether a "medical disposal" would be available to the sentencing judge.
She was remanded in custody.
