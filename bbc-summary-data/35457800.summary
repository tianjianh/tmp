[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who had sulphuric acid thrown over him by a stranger who knocked on his front door said the attack left him in "very dark pain".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andreas Christopheros, 29, was left blind in one eye after the attack in December 2014.
David Phillips, 49, from Hastings, Sussex, was jailed for life last October for assaulting Mr Christopheros at his home in Truro.
Mr Christopheros was at home with his wife and son when he was attacked.
He told BBC Five Live: "I knew instantly and I screamed to my wife upstairs. I ran through the house (to the kitchen) and started dousing myself with water.
"The pain was inexplicable, out of this world pain. It's like nothing I've ever felt before, it's a very dark pain."
His attacker said it had been a case of mistaken identity.
Mr Christopheros has been left partially sighted, with severe burns to his face and body.
He kept his 18-month-old son away from his bedside for two months to protect the little boy.
"For him his world should have been full of happiness, joy and toys, which he had," he said.
Acknowledging it was "insanely tough" to be away from his child, he recalled the moment he saw his young son for the first time after the attack.
"The moment he saw me... he put his arms out and held on to me for three quarters of an hour," he said.
It was an experience which he described as "the best feeling I think I've ever had... truly amazing".
