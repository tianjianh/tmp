An ex-rugby player from Gloucestershire who was paralysed from the neck down in a car accident is to compete in a gruelling 12-mile obstacle race.

The Tough Mudder race will see Rob Camm, from Breadstone, use a specially-adapted wheelchair to cross the woody and grassy terrain.
Mr Camm, 21, said: "I've been driving round the fields and the woods near my house to get used to driving off road."
His support team will cross obstacles like walls and tunnels.
Mr Camm, was paralysed in the car crash in September 2013 and was treated at Salisbury District Hospital.
Before his accident, he was a promising rugby player as well as being academically gifted.
Prior to the crash, he played for Dursley RFC and was about to start his degree at York University.
He said: "Whilst I was in hospital I got help from a number of different charities, one of which is Special Effect and that's why I'm doing this Tough Mudder Challenge.
"It was something I wanted to do before my accident, so I don't see a good reason why not to do it now and raise money for a charity that helped me so much."
It is thought Mr Camm is the first tetraplegic to take part in the course.
His wheelchair is similar to sitting on a quad bike, which he controls with his chin.
"I've always liked having a challenge to do - I'm no different now to how I was before, so just the challenge of it is going to be good fun."
The race is taking place on Sunday at Gatcombe, Gloucestershire.
