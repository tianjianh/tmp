Police said the 30-year-old been walking on the northbound carriageway of the road after his own car had been involved in a crash.
He was pronounced dead at the scene of the incident, which took place near the Newhouse Interchange at about 18:20 on Monday.
Police said they wanted to hear from witnesses to the incident, or the earlier crash involving the man's car.
The 30-year-old had been driving a black Suzuki Liana north on the A78 when his car was involved in what police described as a minor single-vehicle crash.
It came to rest on the nearside verge of the northbound carriageway.
He was walking on the carriageway when he was struck by a Volkswagen Golf. Police said the driver of the other car was uninjured.
Sgt Iain Pittams said: "The road would have been relatively busy around the time of the incident and inquiries are continuing to establish the exact circumstances of what happened."
He urged any witnesses who saw the man being struck by the Volkswagen Golf to get in touch.
"I would like to speak to anyone who saw a black Suzuki Liana car driving northbound on the A78 around the time of the incident," he added.
"I would also like to speak to anyone who may have seen the initial crash or the man walking on the carriageway prior to being struck."
