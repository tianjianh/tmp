Some Arsenal fans may turn up "wanting us to win", says Lincoln defender Luke Waterfall before their FA Cup quarter-final at Emirates Stadium on Saturday.

National League leaders Lincoln are the first non-league team since 1914 to make the last eight of the competition.
They come up against a Gunners side in disarray - they have lost five of their past seven games, including two 5-1 defeats by Bayern Munich, and seen protests against manager Arsene Wenger.
"He is under pressure," said Waterfall.
The Gunners suffered a humiliating 10-2 aggregate loss against Bayern in the Champions League and since the end of January, have also been defeated by Liverpool, Chelsea and Watford.
Against the Bundesliga side, home supporters held banners before and during the game calling for Wenger - who has been in charge since October 1996 - to leave the club.
On Thursday, the Frenchman said the opinion of fans will influence his decision over whether to remain in charge next season.
Waterfall added: "Some Arsenal fans might be going there wanting us to win. If we start well, we might have 60,000 people behind us, not just 9,000.
"We will go there believing in ourselves. We won't park the bus, we will play our usual game.
"We want their big players to play. Their manager is under pressure so I would expect their big names to play."
