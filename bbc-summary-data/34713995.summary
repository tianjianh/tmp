Gloucester wing David Halaifonua was shown red for a high and late tackle before Wasps prop Lorenzo Cittadini punched Billy Twelvetrees off the ball.
Wasps winger Christian Wade burst through the visiting defence at pace for the only try of the first half.
A penalty try followed after the break as Elliot Daly also kicked nine points.
Gloucester had to wait until the 49th minute for their only score of the game as Scotland scrum-half Greig Laidlaw kicked a penalty on his first appearance of the season.
By then, the Cherry and Whites were already 16 points behind after Wade's early try and two long-range penalties from Daly before Halaifonua's dismissal had them a man down.
Referee Ian Tempest and the television match official ruled foul play against his challenge on second-row Bradley Davies and things were soon to get worse for the visitors.
George Smith marshalled a driving maul to the line for Wasps, which Gloucester collapsed illegally and a penalty try was awarded.
Fly-half Ruaridh Jackson kicked the extras, but Wasps also had to see out the remaining minutes with 14 men.
Tight-head Cittadini was sent off after replays showed his fist had caught Gloucester captain Twelvetrees around the throat as the pair wrestled for possession.
Wasps closed the game out for their second win in the opening four rounds while Gloucester's first away defeat of the season saw them drop to ninth, a place below the victors.
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said:
"We made seven line-breaks but didn't take enough of them. We're creating opportunities but our conversion rate isn't good enough.
"We would have taken this result before the game. We had the game won after 60 minutes but we didn't kick on.
"From the side we looked to have switched off in the last 20 minutes as we lacked accuracy and our discipline faded."
On Lorenzo Cittadini's dismissal:
"I haven't had a good look at it. The referee had a good game and it's not my view that counts."
Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys said:
"We just couldn't score. We were on the other end of a penalty try award and should have definitely had one from a scrum in the second half but that wouldn't have changed the result.
"Large parts of our game were good. Our set piece was excellent and it's ironic that the parts we were good at last year fell away today whereas some of the weaker areas were strong.
"We stuck at it and kept working but we didn't kick well enough in the first half. They got into our half on only four occasions with Elliot Daly kicking three super goals and they scored a fantastic try."
