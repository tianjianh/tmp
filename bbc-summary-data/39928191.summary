Scunthorpe midfielder Neal Bishop has signed a one-year contract extension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old joined the Iron from Blackpool in 2013 and has made 119 league appearances for the League One side.
He helped them to a third-placed finish this season, before they were beaten by Millwall in the play-off semi-finals.
Bishop told the club website: "With the way the season finished, it's a sense of unfinished business and it was disappointing for all of us."
