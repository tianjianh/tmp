Durham flytipping CCTV camera 'catches the birdie'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neighbourhood wardens in County Durham were "pheasantly" surprised to find a criminal caught on CCTV at a flytipping site turned out to be a bird.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The camera was hidden by Durham County Council officers at a well-known site used for illegal waste dumping.
When the camera was triggered, neighbourhood protection manager Ian Hoult found it was not a criminal but a curious pheasant.
He said the team were thankful that no-one had fallen "fowl" of the law.
Launched in November 2014, the Operation Stop It campaign has resulted in a 29% decrease in flytipping in the county.
