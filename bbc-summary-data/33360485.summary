Chris Martin, the lead singer of popular British band Coldplay, played an impromptu gig at a pub in India's capital Delhi. The performance thrilled patrons, but Indian social media was full of the cries of disappointed fans who had missed out on the performance.

The singers walked into the pub on Wednesday night with Bollywood musician Vishal Dadlani and played to a "stunned" crowd.
The band's fans found out about the gig after Dadlani and some members of comedy group All India Bakchod (AIB) posted pictures on their Twitter accounts.
Actress Frieda Pinto was also present with Martin during the evening at the Summerhouse Cafe in the Hauz Khas area of the capital.
Coldplay has a huge fan base in India and songs such as Yellow, Fix You and many others are routinely performed in karaoke bars and pubs.
And that explains why so many people were heartbroken after missing the "free performance".
