Scott's perfect score of 30 against Kneale's 28 secured Britain their second Rio shooting medal, after Ed Ling's trap bronze on day three.
"I can't describe what this means, but I've worked my butt off," Scott said.
Kuwaiti Fehaid Aldeehani beat Italy's Marco Innocenti 26-24 in the gold medal final at the Olympic Shooting Centre.
Australian world number one James Willett was eliminated following a shoot-off against Scott and Kneale.
Aldeehani is the first competitor from Kuwait to win Olympic gold, but he is competing in Rio under the International Olympic Committee flag, as his country has been suspended by the Games' governing body because of government interference in sport.
He had previously won bronze at Sydney 2000 and London 2012.
Bronze medallist Scott was self-taught until late 2012, when he began training under 2004 Olympic gold medallist Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum.
The 31-year-old, based in Battle, East Sussex, became Commonwealth double trap champion in 2014 and won a silver medal at the Gabala World Cup meet in Azerbaijan in 2015.
"It's a very emotional time for me," said Scott after his victory over Kneale. "There is a little part of me that wanted him to win as well because we worked so hard together.
"I think the expectation coming into the event was to medal, but personally I just wanted to make the final and give myself a good chance. It made me a little bit more relaxed knowing that I'm shooting off with my team-mate."

And the all-British bronze medal match between Scott and Kneale left a "bittersweet" feeling for the shooting club at which both men train.
"It's a very odd emotion," said Ed Barker, who runs the Nuthampstead Shooting Range in North Hertfordshire.
"Unfortunately, one of them is coming back empty-handed," he said, adding Kneale would be "over the moon" for Scott but also "distraught".
"I think the whole shooting community does feel a little bit sorry for Tim, but at the end of the day that's what it's all about."
