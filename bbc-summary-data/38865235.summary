Marcos Rojo is also fit again after a knock but Phil Jones remains sidelined with a bruised foot.
Watford's Christian Kabasele has recovered from a muscle problem and could feature.
However, the game is likely to come too early for Nordin Amrabat, who has returned to training after an ankle injury.
Steve Bower: "I was at Vicarage Road back in September to see Watford's first-ever Premier League points against Manchester United, but Jose Mourinho's team have a much more solid and settled look about them now.
"United are currently on their longest unbeaten league run since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, but they know it is all about winning in the chase for a top-four finish.
"The Old Trafford draws against Stoke, Burnley, West Ham and Hull are still frustrating memories. Had those been victories, United would have been second, six points off Chelsea.
"Those results will be a source of belief for Watford, as will their recent victory at the Emirates; they've enjoyed upsetting the odds at times this season, although will have to be at their very best to do so again,"

United have had problems breaking defences down at home before but I don't think that is a particular strength of Watford's.
Jose Mourinho's side lost 3-1 at Vicarage Road in September, which was one of the low points of their season, but I can see them getting their own back here.
