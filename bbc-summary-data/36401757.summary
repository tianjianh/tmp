World champion boxer Lee Selby has called for "life bans" for fighters found guilty of doping.

Lucien Bute failed a doping test after last month's majority draw with WBC super-middleweight title-holder Badou Jack, while heavyweight Alexander Povetkin also failed a test this month.
"Someone can get hurt. It's not like it's weightlifting, you're punching each other in the head," said Selby.
Athletes who fail drugs tests currently face a minimum four-year ban.
The International Olympic Committee revealed that 23 athletes who competed at London 2012 - where Lee's younger brother Andrew Selby competed - have failed drugs tests.
"It's coming out more at the moment. Maybe the testing's getting better. A lot more people are getting caught," the IBF world featherweight champion said.
"Some fighters are getting caught taking drugs and they're fighting again. You shouldn't have a loss on your record if an opponent's been found taking drugs."
Selby revealed that he is regularly tested for banned substances.
"I'm on a scheme where I have to give an hour time slot every day (to be tested)," he said.
"If I sleep elsewhere I've got to update my profile, let them know where I'm staying.
"If I didn't give them the information, that comes up as a strike, and if you get three strikes you can get a two-year ban.
"I've got to give them at least three days a week when I'm going to be at the gym.
"It's been two months, but I think there's roughly 200 or 300 athletes. (UK Anti-Doping) said it's the higher-level athletes, and that I'll be doing it for as long as I'm competing.
"I like the system, but they should be doing it to more people."
Selby, who became a world champion by beating Evgeny Gradovich has enjoyed two successful defences against Fernando Montiel and Eric Hunter.
