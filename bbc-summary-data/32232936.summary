An investigation has been launched into the attempted murder of two men who had travelled to Edinburgh to buy a car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened on Wednesday at about 18:00 in Wardieburn Place West.
The men, aged 43 and 45, had travelled from Aberdeen. They were attacked in a stairwell by two men who are then thought to have left by the back of the block.
Both victims suffered serious injuries and the 43-year-old man is in a critical condition.
Police are appealing for witnesses.
The first attacker is white and aged 17-19.  He has a Central Scotland accent and light-coloured short hair, which is shaved at the sides.
He was wearing a light-coloured sky blue hooded sweatshirt and grey jogging bottoms.
The second attacker is a white man in his mid-20s. He has a stocky build and was wearing a striped top.
Det Ch Insp Stuart Houston, of Police Scotland, said: "This was an appalling attack on two men who came to the address in good faith.
"This attack happened in daylight and we believe there may be a number of witnesses who may have seen the suspects in the area.
"Anyone with information that can help with our inquiries is urged to contact police immediately."
