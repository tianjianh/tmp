Premier League and Football League: Ups & downs and European qualification

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport outlines the battles for promotion and relegation - and the race for European qualification - in England and Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The top three teams will qualify for the group stage of next season's Champions League, with the fourth-placed team entering in the play-off round.
If Manchester United win the Europa League but finish outside the top four, they will enter next season's Champions League.
The fifth-placed team will enter the Europa League at the group stage, as will the FA Cup winners.
Manchester United are already assured of at least a Europa League place after winning the EFL Cup. If they finish in the top four, their place in the Europa League will pass to the sixth-placed team.
The four FA Cup semi-finalists - Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham - are all in contention for Champions League places. If the FA Cup winners and runners-up, and Manchester United, all qualify for Europe by virtue of their league position, the sixth and seventh-placed Premier League sides will also enter the Europa League.
There are no longer any Fair Play places allocated to the Europa League.
The bottom three teams will be relegated to the Championship - with Sunderland's prospects looking increasingly bleak.
The top two teams will be promoted to the Premier League, with the next four teams entering the play-offs. Brighton and Hove Albion were promoted to the Premier League after they beat Wigan 2-1 on 17 April, and will clinch the title if they win at Norwich on Friday, or if they match Newcastle's weekend result.
Newcastle have guaranteed at least a play-off place, and could be promoted as early as Monday if other results go their way on Saturday. Reading and Huddersfield are also close to cementing their play-off places.
The bottom three teams will be relegated to League One. Relegation was confirmed for Rotherham United when they lost 1-0 to Fulham on 1 April, while Wigan will join them this weekend if they fail to win and other results go against them.
The top two teams will be promoted to the Championship, with the next four teams entering the play-offs. Sheffield United were promoted on 8 April as they won 2-1 at Northampton and clinched the title a week later when second-placed Bolton lost 1-0 to Oldham.
Bolton - who are guaranteed at least a play-off place - will be promoted on Saturday if they win and Fleetwood fail to win. Fleetwood and Scunthorpe have made sure of their play-off spots, while Bradford are close to securing theirs.
The bottom four teams will be relegated to League Two. Bottom club Coventry City were relegated to the fourth tier of English football for the first time in 58 years after drawing with Charlton on 14 April, while Chesterfield's relegation was confirmed on 17 April after they lost 3-1 to Scunthorpe. Swindon could join them on Saturday if they fail to win and other results go against them.
The top three teams will be promoted to League One. Leaders Doncaster Rovers clinched promotion on 8 April as they beat Mansfield 1-0. Plymouth Argyle and Portsmouth secured promotion on 17 April as Argyle beat Newport County 6-1 while Pompey won 3-1 at Notts County.
The next four teams will contest the play-offs.
The bottom two teams will be relegated to the National League. Bottom club Leyton Orient will be relegated on Saturday if they lose at Crewe or if other results go against them.
The National League champions will be promoted to League Two - and this will be Lincoln or Tranmere. Lincoln will wrap up the title on Saturday if they beat Macclesfield, or if Tranmere fail to beat Southport.
Whoever does not win the title will contest the play-offs with Forest Green and two other teams. Dagenham & Redbridge can make sure of their place on Saturday.
The bottom four teams will be relegated, and replaced by the champions and play-off winners of the National League North and South divisions. Southport were relegated on 14 April after losing 3-0 at Dover, while North Ferriby United were relegated on 17 April after a 3-1 defeat at Barrow. Torquay can join them on Saturday if they lose and other results go against them.

Celtic clinched their sixth successive Scottish title on 2 April when they beat Hearts 5-0. They will enter next season's Champions League at the second qualifying round.
The second and third-placed sides will qualify for the Europa League along with the Scottish Cup winners, but there are no longer any Fair Play places allocated to the Europa League. Aberdeen clinched their Europa League place by beating St Johnstone 2-1 on 15 April.
The Premiership has split in half after the 33rd round of games, with the top six and the bottom six now playing the other teams in their 'half' for a fourth and final time.
The bottom side will be relegated to the Scottish Championship, while the 11th-placed side will face the winners of the Championship play-offs over two legs, with the losers condemned to a place in the second tier next season.
Hibernian were promoted to the Premiership as champions by beating Queen of the South 3-0 on 15 April.
The third and fourth-placed teams will meet in the first round of the play-offs, with the winners playing the division's second-placed team. Whoever emerges victorious from that two-legged encounter will face the second bottom side in the Premiership - again on a home and away basis - with a spot in the top flight the prize.
Falkirk and Dundee United are sure of their play-off spots, with Morton close to clinching the final berth.
The bottom club will be relegated to League One. The ninth-placed team will enter a play-off with three League One sides.
Livingston were promoted to the Championship as League One champions on 8 April after beating Alloa 2-1.
Teams finishing second, third and fourth will enter a play-off with the ninth-placed Championship team. Alloa have guaranteed a play-off place.
The bottom club will be relegated to League Two. This will be Stenhousemuir if they lose at relegation rivals Peterhead on Saturday. The ninth-placed team will enter a play-off with three League Two sides.
The champions will be promoted to League One, while teams finishing second, third and fourth will enter a play-off with the ninth-placed League One team. The title is likely to be between Forfar and Arbroath, who are both sure of at least a play-off place, with Annan close to booking their play-off spot.
The team finishing bottom will enter a play-off against a candidate club (the winner of a play-off between the Highland and Lowland League champions, or another eligible club nominated by the Scottish Football Association) for the final place in next season's League Two. East Kilbride have been crowned as Lowland League champions.
