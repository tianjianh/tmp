Data released for the first time, shared with BBC News, reveals the most popular locations outside London that people share with their followers.
Stonehenge, the Reading Festival and Manchester United's ground Old Trafford all appear high on the list.
Manchester was England's most Instagrammed city after central London.
The capital has previously claimed all 10 of the most photographed locations in the UK, including Tower Bridge, the Tower of London, Harrods and the Houses of Parliament.
The latest data concentrates on sites outside the capital's main tourism spots.
Instagram does not release figures for the number of times each location was photographed. However, a spokeswoman revealed its users were "twice as likely to Instagram Brighton Pier compared to the University of Oxford", which is the seventh most popular site.
Stonehenge was the second most popular location, with visitors taking selfies by the Neolithic monument in Wiltshire.
Marc Thorley, spokesman for Brighton Pier, said: "We get some really clear skies, which help create the perfect backdrop for amateur and professional photographers.
"It's an iconic place in British history, even if it hasn't been around as long as Stonehenge."

Dismaland, the dystopian theme park in Weston-super-Mare created by Banksy, ranked highly at number five, despite being only a temporary art project.
After London, Manchester was the place where the most photographs were taken in England, according to Instagram.
Birmingham, England's second biggest city for population, came fifth after Brighton, Bristol and Liverpool.
