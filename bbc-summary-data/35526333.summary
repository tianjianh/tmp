Shares on Wall Street were 2% lower in early trading following a volatile session for Europe's stock markets.

Analysts said investors remained nervous about slowing global growth, uncertainty over US interest rates and further falls in oil prices.
Greece's financial stocks were down more than 20% as the wider Athens Stock Exchange hit its lowest level since 1991.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 296.91 at 15,908.06.
While the Nasdaq Index fell 80.91 to 4282.23.
That followed sharp losses in Europe, as the FTSE 100 fell 2% to 5715.26 and Athens hit a 25-year low.
Brent crude oil futures, a closely watched benchmark, was down 2.3% to $33.28 a barrel at 15:15 (GMT).
On Wall Street, financial stocks were among the worst hit amid concerns that low interest rates in the US, Europe and Japan are hurting bank margins.
Goldman Sachs was the biggest loser in early trading on the Dow, falling almost 4%, while Visa was down 3% and JP Morgan 2.9%.
That followed similar falls for bank stocks in Europe, with HSBC down 3%, Commerzbank slumping more than 7% and BNP Paribas falling 4%.
Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at traders CMC Markets UK, said investors in bank stocks were nervous about poor recent results "alongside the ugly spectre of negative interest rates".
US tech stocks also continued their falls from Friday, with Amazon and Facebook both down 3%.
Investors see tech stocks as particularly exposed to slowing consumer spend, according to Adam Laird, of Hargreaves Lansdown.
He said: "We are still seeing a concern that the world is slowing and perhaps the good times of the last couple of years might not be persisting."
