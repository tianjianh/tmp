[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said they were treating the "serious assault" on the 28-year-old as attempted murder.
He was found in Glentyan Drive in the Pollok area following a report to police at about 17:15 on Wednesday.
The man was taken by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where his condition is described as stable but critical.
Officers are carrying out door-to-door inquiries in the area and gathering CCTV footage as part of their investigation.
Det Sgt Dougie Stevenson said: "From the man's injuries, it's clear the man has been seriously assaulted, however at this stage we don't know why the man was targeted.
"We are in the process of piecing together the circumstances of the attack and I am appealing to people living in the area for their assistance. Can you think back to the time of the incident and consider if you saw or heard anything.
"Perhaps, you heard a disturbance, some shouting, anything which seemed a little odd. If you have any information, then please do contact us and pass it on."
