The 18-year-old from Barry died four days after the serious assault at Trecco Bay caravan park in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, on Sunday, 8 March.
Appearing at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday, David James Braddon, 26, from Caerphilly, admitted carrying out the attack.
He will be sentenced on 3 June.
Speaking after the court hearing, Det Ch Insp Kath Pritchard of South Wales Police said: "This was a brutal attack on a teenage boy which has left his family and friends devastated by the incident, and brought shock and sadness to both the visitors of Trecco Bay and also the community of Barry.
"We know incidents like this can cause a great deal of concern and anxiety. The community support has undoubtedly helped us to bring the person responsible for Conner's murder to justice."
Following the fatal attack in March, his family paid tribute to the former Ysgol Bro Morgannwg pupil as "a unique, caring and compassionate young man with a warm, infectious smile complete with a cheeky wink".
