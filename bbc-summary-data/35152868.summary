New paving and street furniture is being installed as part of a £25m scheme ahead of the year-long arts festival in 2017.
One cafe owner claimed the building work has had "a massive impact on his business".
Hull City Council said the work was to "create a thriving city centre".
Paul Hunt who owns Simples Café in Trinity Square said the work should "have been done in phases".
"Our takings have gone down from £250 a day we were taking, now we're lucky to make £50 to £60 a day," said Mr Hunt.
"We must have lost half the people we've built up just because of what's going on."
"This shouldn't have been done the way they've done it."
In a statement, the city council said it appreciated "the patience of everyone throughout this time".
The council added: "We are working hard to support businesses through these periods, with Hull BID and with dedicated Public Liaison Officers employed by Eurovia, acting as a point of contact for all retailers and businesses affected by the work.
"We are also installing additional signage in areas to signal that businesses are open as usual."
