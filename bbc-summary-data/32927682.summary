The plane's door and fuselage were damaged during the crash at Coventry Airport, at 01:50 BST on 15 January.
An Air Accidents Investigation Branch report said the airport had been due to close 10 minutes later.
It said the plane's parking brake was not set and it started rolling after the wheel wedges were removed.
The plane had already been delayed.
"Although neither crew member felt that they were rushed, they were nevertheless subject to a degree of time pressure as the flight had been delayed and the airport was due to close at 02:00," the report said.
No-one was injured.
