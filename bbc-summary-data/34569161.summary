The rapes of two young children in Delhi have sparked anger and concerns over the authorities' continuing failure to protect women and children in India's national capital, Delhi.

Two 17-year-old boys were arrested on Sunday  in connection with the rape of a two-and-a-half year old girl in west Delhi, police said.
Separately, three men were arrested over the gang rape of a five-year-old in the east of the capital city.
The "gruesome" acts have once again brought the issue of women and children's safety in the spotlight.
"Abduction and sexual victimisation are the urban realities of the capital, which constantly haunt every parent. Frightened, cautious parents are pulling in all help they can garner to ensure that children stay safe in the city," says an article in the Hindu newspaper.
Some commentators are also asking if the anger that India had witnessed after the gang rape and murder of a student in 2012 have "fizzled out".
"Where is that outrage after the [2012] Nirbhaya rape? Maybe we are all jaded or just looking out for our own. Even if there are degrees of crime, what would be rarer than raping two tiny girls, except that on our streets it is no longer rare?" asks blogger Jyotsna Mohan Bhargava on the NDTV website.
The incidents have also left many social media users "frustrated" and angry.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has criticised the Delhi police, which is run by the federal government, for failing to provide security to women and children in the city.
But some users have urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr Kejriwal to forget their political differences and work together to make Delhi safe.
