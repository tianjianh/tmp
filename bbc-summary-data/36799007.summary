Chasing 237, the hosts eased home with 15 deliveries to spare as Ed Joyce hit an unbeaten 105 off 135 balls.
Kevin O'Brien contributed an 85-ball 75 in a fourth-wicket stand of 144 with Joyce inside 29 overs.
O'Brien and Barry McCarthy earlier took 3-28 and 3-57 respectively to bowl Afghanistan out for 236, featuring Mohammad Shahzad's 81.
Sussex left-hander Joyce helped Ireland recover from 29-3 following Hamid Hassan's early double strike.
O'Brien departed with 64 still required but Joyce and Paul Stirling, with 39 not out, guided Ireland home.
Having won the second ODI by 36 runs on Tuesday after Sunday's opener was abandoned, Afghanistan let a promising position slip.
They appeared comfortable at 139-3 in the 32nd over until they lost four wickets for 31 runs, including Shahzad.
Mohammad Nabi made 40 as Afghanistan were bowled out in the final over.
Stormont also hosts the fourth and fifth ODIs on Sunday and Tuesday respectively.
