Scotland's Taylor, 26, moved Davies' sunglasses as the pair faced off at Tuesday's media conference to promote their super lightweight title bout.
"I wanted him to look into my eyes so I could tell him, 'I'm the man'," said Commonwealth title holder Taylor.
Both super lightweights are unbeaten, with England's Davies, 25, the WBC Silver belt holder.
"It's definitely my biggest fight to date but it's one I'm fully confident of winning and coming through," Taylor told BBC Scotland.
"He's going to be getting a boxing lesson on 8 July."
"It's really important for my career and it'll elevate me to that next level if I pull through.
"I don't care much for being famous or anything like that. I want to be known for being a world champion and a great boxer and the rest comes, I suppose. First and foremost, I'm just interested in the belts and the titles and being the best I can be.
Davies, part of the Matchroom stable trained by Tony Sims, did not react much to Taylor at the Marriott Hotel in Glasgow but has previously been very vocal towards opponents.
"I'm a cool guy," he said. "That's me. I believe that you live and you learn. I've been wild, I've said what I needed to say in my past fights."
