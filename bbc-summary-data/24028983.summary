More than 10,000 young oysters will soon be placed on the seabed off the Mumbles village of Oystermouth.
It is hoped that they will form a breeding bed and, in a few years time, a new commercial fishery.
In the mid-1800s the oyster industry in south Wales employed hundreds of people and used 200 vessels. The oyster beds stretched from Porthcawl to Milford Haven.
But it was an industry killed off by over-fishing and improvements in methods of transport.
Gilbert John reports.
