Rocco Forte Open: Alvaro Quiros beats Zander Lombard at second play-off hole

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spaniard Alvaro Quiros defeated Zander Lombard at the second play-off hole to win the Rocco Forte Open in Sicily and regain his European Tour card.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Quiros led by seven shots after six holes of his final round but a poor finish saw him end in a tie with the South African on 14 under par.
Quiros, 34, had lost his Tour card and dropped to 703 in the world rankings after a dramatic slump in form.
Michael Hoey carded a closing 72 to finish in joint 11th on eight under.
An albatross two at the par-five 12th helped China's Li Haotong to third place on 13 under.
The last of Quiros' six previous European Tour successes came in 2011 when he secured the DP World Tour Championship.
The former world number 23 lay 20 under after six holes but four bogeys and a double bogey, including four dropped shots between the 15th and the 17th, saw him drop back into the pack at Verdura Golf Club.
The 16th proved particularly problematic as Quiros fired his tee shot into a bush and had to take a penalty drop before signing for a six.
A par on the second extra hole, the 18th, proved enough after Lombard three-putted from 40 feet.
The Spanish player's victory earns him a place in the line-up for next week's PGA Championship at Wentworth.
