Spiked doctor Eireann Kerr drops appeal against sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor who assaulted police after a Christmas party in Londonderry has dropped an appeal against her sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Eireann Kerr, 32, had argued that she had been "the victim of a crime" because her drink was spiked with a date rape drug.
The judge who found her guilty said he had no doubt that her drink was spiked but added it was not a defence in law.
Dr Kerr's barrister told Londonderry Magistrates Court that the sentence would be "affirmed."
In April, she was found guilty of two charges of assaulting police officers, disorderly behaviour and resisting a police officer after her arrest in December 2013.
She was given a two-month conditional discharge.
Dr Kerr, of Malborough Park South in Belfast, was working as an anaesthetist at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry at the time of the incident and had been to several pubs in the city while on a staff night out.
She was arrested during the early hours of the morning and assaulted officers in Strand Road police station.
The hospital anaesthetist said she woke up in a police cell the next day with none of her belongings and no idea how she had ended up there.
She claims the convictions have put her medical career at risk.
Dr. Kerr was not present in court when her appeal was withdrawn.
