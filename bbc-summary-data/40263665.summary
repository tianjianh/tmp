Tickets for the inaugural multi-sport event have gone on sale.
Glasgow is co-hosting next year's championships along with the German capital Berlin.
More than 3,000 athletes will compete in six sports - aquatics, cycling, gymnastics, rowing, triathlon and golf - with the action taking place across 12 venues.
It will be the biggest sporting event hosted in Scotland since the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.
The new multi-sport event will see Glasgow host the European Championships for the six major sports from 2-12 August 2018, while Berlin hosts the European athletics from 7-12 August.
Commonwealth and European champion swimmer Ross Murdoch said he had great memories of competing in Glasgow.
"It is an unbelievable place to perform in," he said.
"That is what will make the Glasgow 2018 European Championships so special.
"The fans really get behind you and take you to the next level."
A cultural festival, in Glasgow's George Square, will also run alongside the sporting action.
It has support from both the Scottish government and Glasgow City Council.
Fans can buy tickets for 84 sessions of sport with prices starting at Â£10 for adults and Â£5 for under-16s and over-60s.
The venues include the SSE Hydro (gymnastics), Edinburgh's Royal Commonwealth Pool (diving), Strathclyde Country Park (rowing and triathlon) in North Lanarkshire and the Gleneagles PGA Centenary Course (golf) in Perth & Kinross.
A number of free events - including the cycling road race through the streets of Glasgow and beyond, open water swimming at Loch Lomond and mountain biking at Cathkin Braes - will also take place.
Organisers said the event would also have a potential television audience of more than one billion as it is being covered by free-to-air broadcasters across the continent, including the BBC.
Sport Minister Aileen Campbell said 250,000 people were expected to turn out and cheer on some of the world's top sporting talent.
She said: "It's all about getting involved, seeing what other sports are out there and being part of an event which will showcase Scotland to the world."
Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said the event would see Glasgow once again take centre stage with "our passionate fans and warm welcome".
