[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took the lead with Jake Taylor's stunning long-range strike but Diomande equalised for the Premier League side within two minutes.
Joel Grant fired wide for the Grecians before Diomande turned and finished in the area for his second.
Substitute Robert Snodgrass' late 25-yard free-kick secured the Tigers' place in round three.
Hull had only 13 fit senior players for their opening two Premier League games and made seven changes for this match, with debuts handed to goalkeeper Dusan Kuciak and academy products Jarrod Bowen and Greg Olley.
Caretaker boss Mike Phelan has now won all three games this season after being put in charge following Steve Bruce's exit in July.
