Lee Selby: IBF champion to return to Las Vegas for bout with Barros

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welshman Lee Selby will return to Las Vegas in June to defend his IBF featherweight title against Argentinean Jonathan Victor Barros.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The confirmation of the bout means there will be no immediate fight with Northern Ireland's Carl Frampton.
Selby and Barros were set to fight in January, but it was called off.
Selby was given dispensation to beat Andoni Gago in a non-title fight in March, but the IBF has given now-healthy Barros another chance.
There had been confusion over Barros' health but the IBF has cleared him to enter the ring again.
Selby's third defence of his IBF world title in January against Barros was meant to take place on the undercard of Frampton's WBA featherweight title bout with Mexico's Leo Santa Cruz at the MGM Grand.
The Nevada Athletic Commission did not give an explanation for calling off the Selby v Barros contest less than 24 hours before they were set to fight, other than saying the Argentinean had not "met fight requirements".
Selby's last title defence was against Eric Hunter in April 2016.
The IBF ruling came after Northern Ireland's Frampton learned that Santa Cruz will defend his WBA title against Abner Mares in the summer.
Frampton beat Santa Cruz to claim the WBA belt in New York last summer, but lost the January rematch in Las Vegas.
The WBA ended speculation of a third fight between the pair in Belfast by ordering Santa Cruz to defend his belt against his fellow Mexican.
Selby is now without a promoter in the UK, but has a management agreement with American promoter Al Haymon.
Having won the purse bid, Haymon, who also manages Mares and Santa Cruz, might favour the undercard of that contest for the Selby defence against Barros.
Barros' camp have stated they wanted to stage the fight in Mendoza, Argentina.
