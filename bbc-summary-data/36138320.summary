A section of Dunsdale Haugh in Selkirk is to shut with a diversion route put in place via Level Crossing Road.
The closure, starting 3 May, will see a new flood protection wall built and a culvert installed.
Scottish Borders Council said a "considerable amount of work" had gone into the diversion route in order to avoid disruption.
The flood protection scheme - which will protect almost 600 properties in the town against a major flood event - is due to be completed by the end of this year.
Councillor Gordon Edgar said: "Selkirk Flood Protection Scheme is now less than a year from completion and will offer long-term protection to large areas of the town.
"The effectiveness of the scheme has already been proven during the recent winter storms."
He stressed that businesses in the area would remain open during the road closure.
The council added that work on the Selkirk community recycling centre - which was closed to allow the diversion route to pass through its old site - was "progressing well" with the facility due to be opened in late June.
