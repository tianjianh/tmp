Wales international Ward joined Liverpool from Wrexham for around Â£100,000 in 2012.
A clause in that transfer means Wrexham will be due a cash bonus now Ward has featured for Liverpool in the Premier League.
"Danny Ward was brilliant," Klopp said following Sunday's victory.
Ward first featured as an unused substitute for Liverpool in October 2012 and has impressed in loan spells at Morecambe and Aberdeen.
He kept 13 clean sheets for the Dons, prompting Liverpool to recall him.
Ward has represented Wales at Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 level and made his senior debut against Northern Ireland on 24 March.
"It's a special day for myself and my family, but it was all about the three points," said Ward.
"It gives you a real boost. The manager knows what we're about. He trusts us.
"I'm disappointed not to get a clean sheet but that's football - it can change in an instant."
Klopp fielded an experimental side following Liverpool's stunning Europa League win against Borussia Dortmund and was full of praise for his young team.
"They've never played together. They could have defended better, played a bit more football in the first half, but it was really, really good," he said.
However, the German felt Ward needed more protection from the officials for Bournemouth's late goal which denied him a clean sheet.
"It was a clear foul, open for all to see," Klopp added.
"Let the self-confidence grow of goalkeepers, they're normal human beings."
