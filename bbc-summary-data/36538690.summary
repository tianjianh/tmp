Barnsley have appointed Paul Heckingbottom as their head coach on a 12-month rolling contract.

He led the Tykes to victory in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final and League One play-off final after being appointed as caretaker in January.
"At the end of an unforgettable few months I am absolutely delighted to have signed as head coach," the 38-year-old told the club website.
"We have a clear vision of how we want to continue to improve the club."
The former Oakwell youth coach took over on a short-term basis after previous boss Lee Johnson left for Bristol City.
Heckingbottom won 13 of his 21 games in charge, culminating in a 3-1 win over Millwall at Wembley as Barnsley returned to the Championship after a two-season absence.
"We've enjoyed one of the most unforgettable and remarkable seasons ever here at Barnsley Football Club and it goes without saying that Paul has been instrumental in the success we have achieved," chief executive Ben Mansford said of the Barnsley-born coach.
"He's one of the brightest and hard-working young coaches in the country and we're absolutely delighted that he's agreed to become our permanent head coach."
Meanwhile, full-backs George Williams and George Smith are to leave Oakwell after the club withdrew contract offers to the pair.
Williams, 23, made 27 appearances last season, including both Wembley finals, while Smith, 19, played 29 games and had a spell on loan at Crawley.
