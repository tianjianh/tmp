The "old English white" Jaguar E-Type Series III was driven by comedy characters Del Boy and Rodney in an episode of the BBC series.
In the 1981 episode, the pair borrowed the car from John Challis's character Boycie for a "night on the tiles".
It had been expected to fetch £85,000 in an auction at Blenheim Palace but sold for £115,800.
Finished with a blue leather interior, the 1973 Series III Roadster, owned by a Swansea businessman, includes a die-cast model signed by both David Jason and John Challis.
A 1961 Jaguar car once owned by the company's founder was also due to be auctioned. The Mk X, built in Coventry, belonged to Sir William Lyons and was made to his personal specifications - with a leather interior and rear picnic tables in walnut.
