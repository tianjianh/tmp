Dusky thrush creates Christmas bonus for Derbyshire charity

Thousands of pounds have been raised for a children's charity thanks to the visit of a rare Asian bird.

The dusky thrush was seen at Dukes Barn activity centre in Beeley, Derbyshire, in early December, prompting the arrival of about 1,000 twitchers.
A small donation was suggested for using its car park and food and drink was also sold to the birdwatchers.
The centre, which organises outside activities for disabled children, said it could now buy new equipment.
The thrush, which has only been seen about a dozen times in the UK, was believed to have been blown to Britain by "strong easterly winds".
It unexpectedly stayed for about a week feeding in the charity's orchard unfazed by all the attention.
Birdwatchers travelled from all over the country to see the bird after they were alerted to its presence by Beeley resident Rachel Jones.
David Johnstone, from Scotland, said he drove for about five hours to get a glimpse of the bird.
The small village felt the impact of its star attraction and at one point a bus was laid on from Chatsworth House's car parks to relieve the pressure.
Ann Poppal, who lives in Beeley, said what happened to the village was "astounding" but the attention also made life difficult for residents - some even got fed up with the birdwatchers.
However, Heather Cope, a manager at Dukes Barn, said the bird had left a lasting legacy.
She said: "I've seen it twice and I've seen lots of wonderful photographs, we're going to ask some of the people to send them so we can make paintings and big displays."
Wildlife experts believe the bird, which is about the size of a blackbird, has headed south to warmer climes.
