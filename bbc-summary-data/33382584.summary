Scottish Tories chasing the youth vote

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Think of a town like Motherwell and it may well bring to mind images of the great Ravenscraig steelworks, now long gone, and a Labour heartland, now dominated by the SNP.

It's not the kind of place you'd expect to be a centre of Conservative activism.
But Nathan Wilson - born and bred in the North Lanarkshire town - is part of a new generation of Scots Tories trying to sell the party to other young people.
The 21-year-old student says: "A lot of people are quite baffled by it - specifically a lot of friends and people I went to school with.
"They say, 'how can you be a Tory, we've got Ravenscraig down there'.
"It's something you just need to laugh off, I suppose. You're going to get it being a Conservative in Scotland - particularly in an area like Motherwell."
Despite the constant ribbing, Nathan reckons young, pro-Union voters are crying out for a party which supports aspirational working people, following a collapse in Scottish Labour's vote in the election.
"Last September, me and a group of others were able to establish the first ever Conservative Association at Strathclyde University," he says.
"If we can establish a branch at Strathclyde - an institution which is not exactly friendly to the core beliefs of Conservatism - we can certainly attract young people from all over Scotland."
Much of this so-called attraction has been put down to Ruth Davidson. Her image as a young, female, openly-gay politician has certainly broken the traditional Conservative leader stereotype.
And May's UK election established the Conservatives as Scotland's third-biggest party in terms of votes (434,097).
But that's still a world away from the near 1.5m votes won by the SNP.
And of course, the SNP have 56 Westminster seats in Scotland. The Tories have one.
When it comes to capturing the youth vote, the Scottish Nationalists have shown everyone else how it's done, from their positive campaign which won the hearts and minds of the next generation, to achieving, in government, a lowering of the voting age to 16.
The election in May of 20-year-old Mhairi Black as the country's youngest MP - while still a student - is testament to that.
So might the Scottish Conservatives ever be able to replicate this kind of success?
It's a very tall order, but the decision by several long-serving Tory MSPs to step down at the Scottish election next year has served as a reminder that all political parties need new blood.
Among those calling it a day include several who were elected to the first parliament in 1999, such as Highland veteran Mary Scanlon, former Holyrood presiding officer Alex Fergusson and one-time party leader Annabel Goldie.
Ms Goldie - aka Baroness Goldie of Bishopton since entering the Lords in 2013 - argues the Scottish Conservatives have become better at reaching an age group to which the party has not appealed for the last 20 or 30 years.
She said: "Politics is like any other activity in life - it has phases, it has spans, and I think particularly when the Conservative Party lost all its MPs in 1997 - I think a lot of younger people thought, 'they're from a former generation , they're from a former age , we more readily connect with this emerging SNP'.
"To be fair to the SNP, I think it made a very significant success in engaging with young people - but I think the Conservatives are catching up.
"Largely thanks to Ruth Davidson's appeal to a younger generation, a lot of younger people in Scotland are saying, 'this isn't an old hat, boring fuddy-duddy party, this is actually a really vibrant, interesting party, with policies that could work for us.'"
The Scottish Tories do have an official youth wing - Conservative Future - although a look at its website lists no upcoming events in the diary. Clearly, it may have a thing or two to learn from the SNP approach.
Nevertheless, back in Motherwell, Nathan Wilson is looking forward to the battle of the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections where the PR voting system works to the Tories' advantage - and maybe even standing as a candidate himself at some point in the future.
"I think we've got a few very bright decades ahead of us," he says optimistically, but the party knows it still has a mammoth task.
