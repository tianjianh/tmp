[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 2-1 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford's superb away run was brought to an end as they went down at struggling Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The play-off chasing U's had achieved five straight away wins in League One, but Lee Erwin struck twice to give Oldham's survival hopes a major boost.
Oldham should have scored within the first two minutes when Aaron Amadi-Holloway fired too close to goalkeeper Simon Eastwood after bursting into the Oxford box.
Peter Clarke also missed an early opening for the hosts, while Eastwood made further saves from Amadi-Holloway and Ryan McLaughlin.
Oxford responded with a chance for Conor McAleny, whose shot was parried by Oldham keeper Connor Ripley, before Kane Hemmings somehow missed the target from point-blank range.
Oldham took the lead on 36 minutes when Amadi-Holloway's powerful shot hit the underside of the bar and Erwin nodded in the rebound from four yards.
Oxford were level on the hour mark as Chris Maguire coolly scored from the penalty spot after he had been brought down by Ripley.
However, Erwin settled it in the 70th minute, netting his seventh goal of the campaign with a far-post header from McLaughlin's excellent cross.
