Martin meets Nimbus the clouded leopard

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A baby leopard called Nimbus has been raised by a family in their bathroom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nimbus's Mum couldn't look after her when she was born, so zookeeper Jamie and his family stepped in to help.
She had to be bottle-fed by hand and lived in their bathroom until she was big enough to move into her new enclosure.
Martin has been to visit Nimbus in her new home and meet the family.
