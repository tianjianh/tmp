The striker opened the scoring in the fifth minute as he tapped in a Liam Nolan knock-down from a corner.
Nolan then got on the score-sheet himself to double the hosts' advantage in first-half stoppage time before Southport made it 3-0 shortly after the break when Allen got his second of the game.
Maidstone pulled a goal back as Yemi Odubade's close range finish reduced the deficit for the visitors.
The Stones made it 3-2 in stoppage time when Bobby-Joe Taylor dispatched a penalty but it proved to be too late for Maidstone.
