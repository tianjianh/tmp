[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rangers 5-0 Peterhead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Niko Kranjcar scored and set up two goals for Clint Hill as Rangers eased past Peterhead to reach the Scottish League Cup quarter-finals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kranjcar's impressive strike put Rangers in front and the midfielder's corner led to Hill netting the hosts' second from close range.
A Fiacre Kelleher own goal extended the home side's advantage after the break.
Peterhead then had Nathan Blockley sent off before Hill headed in a Kranjcar corner and Joe Dodoo fired the fifth.
Though Rangers started their Premiership campaign with a 1-1 draw with Hamilton Academical on Saturday, they had won all four of their League Cup first-round group games without losing a goal.
And they set about continuing that record in the competition, with former Tottenham Hotspur man Kranjcar particularly influential.
The Croatian collected Dodoo's pass and swept a shot into the near top corner from the right edge of the penalty area.
James Tavernier had a shot turned on to the crossbar by goalkeeper Graeme Smith before Hill scrambled in his first Rangers goal - a tap-in from Kranjcar's pin-point delivery.
Kelleher diverted Michael O'Halloran's cross into his own net early in the second period.
A reckless tackle by Blockley on Joey Barton was punished with a red card not long before Hill's powerful header converted another Kranjcar corner.
And Dodoo completed the scoring with a clinical finish from Tavernier's cut-back.
