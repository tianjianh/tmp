The Hendrix jacket, made by Andrews Tailors of Cardiff, was owned by the star in 1967 and 1968 and was worn on the Package Tour in Cardiff.
Auctioneer Angus Ashworth said while you can never prove an item's origin 100%, there had been enough information to confirm items had been owned or worn by the stars.
"In terms of the Hendrix jacket we have letters from band mates and photographs of him wearing it," he said.
He added the Lennon jacket had been given by the Beatle to an American artist, Bleu Oceans, and they had letters of provenance from him confirming he received it in 1973.
