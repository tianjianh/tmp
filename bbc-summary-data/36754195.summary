[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town to appeal after losing policing charge case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town plans to appeal against a High Court ruling over policing costs outside its Portman Road stadium on match days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club claimed Suffolk Police "unlawfully" charged it Â£200,000 for policing between 2008 and 2013.
It said the force should not have charged it for keeping order on the streets around the ground.
But the High Court said Suffolk Police was entitled to recover the costs of policing the ground outside the club.
