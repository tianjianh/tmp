[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fresh talks are expected to take place in an effort to resolve industrial action by Caledonian MacBrayne ferry staff.

RMT members in CalMac's workforce will refuse to work overtime on the ferry operator's Clyde and Hebrides services on Wednesday and Thursday.
On Friday, the workers plan to hold a 24-hour strike in the dispute over job security, conditions and pensions.
CalMac has said the strike would likely cause severe disruption.
The company operates almost every ferry route on the west coast of Scotland.
They include services to and from the Western Isles and the Inner Hebrides.
CalMac's contract to run the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services comes to an end next year.
The Scottish government has put the contract out to tender. It says this has to happen in line with European rules.
The RMT union has concerns that, regardless of who wins, the new contract will see changes in employees' current terms and conditions.
A reduction in staff numbers and pensions are a key areas of concern.
The RMT has asked that the government guarantee in the new contract that compulsory redundancies do not happen and existing terms and conditions are continued.
Industrial action marks a ramping up in the union's call for this to happen.
Gordon Martin, regional organiser for the RMT, said the workers' "reasonable demands" had not been met.
He told BBC Radio Scotland: "Unfortunately if the strike action goes ahead it will be disruptive, and nobody wants to see that.
"The last resort which the trade union has is for the members to withdraw their labour if their reasonable demands are not being met. That is the situation we are in."
CalMac has posted information on its website about refunds to its customers if the strike goes ahead.
