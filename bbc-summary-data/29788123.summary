Cathedrals in England to get almost £8m for repairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost £8m has been awarded for urgent work to 31 cathedrals across England from the First World War Centenary Cathedral Repair Fund.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the second round of grants from the fund with the first, in July, providing £5m for 21 buildings.
Clifton Cathedral in Bristol will get the most at £600,000 followed by £594,783 for Portsmouth and £500,000 for Truro.
Culture secretary Sajid Javid said the country's heritage was "precious".
The awards will go towards fixing leaking roofs, repairing stained glass windows and spires.
Other cathedrals to benefit include Canterbury, Bradford, Chester and Lincoln.
Visiting Portsmouth Cathedral, Mr Javid said: "Our heritage in this country is precious and unique.
"We need to do all we can to protect it for future generations.
"This second round of grants will ensure that even more of our magnificent and awe-inspiring cathedrals can complete urgent and much-needed repairs, so they can continue to play a huge role in the communities they serve."
Si Paul Ruddock, chair of the fund, said: "The appeal of cathedrals is vast and enduring."
The £20m Cathedral Repairs Fund was announced by the chancellor in this year's Budget and set up in April.
It is to recognise the importance of cathedrals and the significant role they will play throughout the centenary commemorations.
Grants will also pay for work such as keeping the buildings wind-proof, weather tight, safe and open to the public and preventing further deterioration.
There is one more round of funding allocations, which will close in January 2015.
The amount awarded for repairs to Clifton Cathedral in Bristol is equivalent the amount it was to build.
Commissioned in 1965, the building cost £600,000 to construct in 1973.
