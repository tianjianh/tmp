Grand Witley Court fountain back on after repairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A grand Victorian fountain has been switched back on after part of it fell apart during cold weather.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Earl Of Dudley had the Perseus and Andromeda fountain built to impress his guests when he owned Witley Court in Worcestershire
There are dozens of jets hidden among the fountain's sculptures, widely considered to be one of the finest in Europe, English Heritage said.
Repairs and conservation work has been going for the past seven months.
English Heritage said the elaborate fountain, completed in 1850, depicts the Greek myth of Andromeda chained to a rock as a sacrifice to appease a sea monster sent by Poseidon, as hero Perseus swoops down to rescue her.
The repairs were needed after Andromeda's right arm came off in December in 2015.
The house was ruined in a fire in 1937 and now stands empty, with visitors able to walk around its gardens set in 62 acres.
