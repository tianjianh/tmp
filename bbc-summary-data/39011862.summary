[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 2-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MK Dons scored twice in the opening 11 minutes to secure victory over struggling Shrewsbury and end their three-game winless run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieran Agard netted inside five minutes before Paul Downing added a second moments later, and Stephen Humphrys' late goal could not prevent Paul Hurst's Shrews from a second defeat in nine games.
MK's early lead came as Darren Potter's clever through-ball found George Baldock in acres of space alongside the Shrewsbury box, before the full-back's accurate cross reached Agard unmarked in the six-yard box to tap home his 12th goal of the campaign.
The hosts added a second when Leicester loanee Harvey Barnes was found unmarked inside the visitors' box after a clever corner-kick routine, before the youngster's cross through a crowded box found Downing at the far post to finish.
The visitors huffed and puffed as Jack Grimmer forced MK keeper David Martin into a decent save, before Humphrys snatched a late consolation goal from close range.
