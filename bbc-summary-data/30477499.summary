[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened on the Mullaghglass Road just before 02:00 GMT on Monday.
Two men, aged 53 and 47, and a 46-year-old woman were arrested. The 53-year-old was later released on police bail pending further inquiries.
The other two have been released unconditionally.
Police are investigating if the assault was linked to a collision involving a grey VW Polo car and a black VW Passat car on the Shaw's Road about half an hour earlier.
Det Sgt John McKendry appealed for anyone who was on the Shaw's Road or Mullaghglass Road in the early hours to contact police.
