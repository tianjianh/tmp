Talks offer ahead of Scottish regional airports stike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The operator of Scotland's regional airports has offered to hold talks with union leaders in an effort to stop a 48-hour strike by security staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Staff at AMSL, a firm that is part of Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial), voted last week to strike from midday on 7 April.
Hial said it had made an offer to the Prospect union to have discussions to resolve the pay dispute.
The union said it was open to "constructive negotiations".
Scottish government-owned Hial runs airports in the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, Argyll, Inverness, Wick and Dundee.
Hial said Prospect had sought an "unreasonable" 30% pay claim.
Prospect has disputed the 30% figure and said its members were seeking 5% increase in pay and fairer overtime, weekend working and sick pay terms.
In a ballot, 87% of the union members voted in favour of a strike on a turnout of 85%.
