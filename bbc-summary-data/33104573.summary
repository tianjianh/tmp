Klebsiella - a type of pneumonia - kills between 30 and 60% of those who get it and is resistant to all antibiotics.
However, researchers at Queen's University say they have discovered a therapy which eliminates it.
Team leader Prof Jose Bengoechea said that it was potentially a big breakthrough.
The new treatment uses a molecule called an inhibitor to prevent Klebsiella pneumonia from blocking the body's natural defences.
"The global problem of antimicrobial resistance is fast becoming one of the major health issues of modern times," Prof Bengoechea said.
"Of particular concern is the mounting prevalence of infections caused by Klebsiella pneumonia which has been identified as an urgent threat to human health by the UK government and the World Health Organisation due to extremely drug resistant strains.
"Our research has helped us gain a better understanding of the vulnerable pathways of human defences, meaning we have been able to develop a potentially ground-breaking new therapy that will block the bug and stop it in its tracks."
