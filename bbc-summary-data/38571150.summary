Supt Andy Parsons said: "We have received one complaint regarding verbal abuse and threats made to someone linked to the dance group.
"No complaints have been made about the Morris dancing performance itself. "
Mr Parsons added officers would also be speaking to witnesses to "understand exactly what happened" and determine if any offences were committed.
The issue has sparked numerous comments on social media, with many people voicing support for the dancers.
Among those was Bromsgrove MP, Sajid Javid, who said Morris dancers were "as racist as I am".
The use of black face make-up by Morris dancers has made headlines before after Shrewsbury Folk Festival banned the practice after receiving complaints.
However, supporters say the practice dates back centuries and is not linked to race.
