Wolves: Jack Price & George Saville staying, Mike Williamson released

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves have taken up the one-year options on the deals of midfielders Jack Price and George Saville.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Price, 24, and Saville, 23, were due to be out of contract on 30 June.
Defender Mike Williamson and winger James Henry, who spent the 2016-17 season on loan at Bolton, have been released by the Championship club.
Discussions are ongoing with full-back Silvio, who is also out of contract, while Wolves will not make an offer for on-loan centre-back Richard Stearman.
Stearman, 29, returned to the club on a season-long loan from Fulham in August 2016, a year after leaving Molineux for Craven Cottage.
He made 19 appearances in his second spell and scored one goal - the opener in Wolves' 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield in the FA Cup fourth round.
Williamson impressed in an initial loan spell at Wolves but injuries limited the 33-year-old to only six appearances after joining on a full-time basis from Newcastle in January 2016.
Henry, 27, was part of the team that helped Wolves to the League One title in 2013-14, but played just four times for Wanderers last term before joining Bolton.
Talks are continuing regarding the future of forward Andreas Weimann, who ended the season on loan at Wolves from Derby.
