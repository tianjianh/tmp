It happened on Monday just after 23:00 GMT in Cornshell Fields, in the Shantallow area of the city.
It is understood that a number of people were in the house at the time, but there are no reports of any injuries.
Police have said they are keen to trace a white vehicle which was observed driving in the area around the time of the incident.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Elisha  McCallion urged people with any information to contact the PSNI.
"Such attacks are wrong and I condemn it. There can be no place for the use of guns on our streets," she added.
