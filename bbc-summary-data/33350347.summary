Oxford Town Hall ceiling restoration gets under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major redecoration project is under way at Oxford Town Hall to restore its vaulted ceiling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grade II*-listed Victorian main hall is being repainted at a cost of Â£140,000.
Oxford Town Hall on St Aldate's is used as a venue for wedding receptions and council events.
It is hoped the work will be completed in time for events planned for September.
The town hall is one of central Oxford's most recognisable buildings.  Designed by Henry Hare, it was officially opened by the Prince of Wales in 1897.
The ceiling is being repainted for the first time in three decades.
The work involves hand brushing and vacuuming the ceiling to remove 30 years of accumulated dust and dirt before it is completely repainted.
Richard Clements, of Oxford City Council, said: "It was getting a little bit tired and the work is part of the overall maintenance plan we have for the town hall.
"Events generate over Â£500,000 - that's another reason for getting it maintain the hall back in great condition."
Neale Cole, from contractors Mitie, described it as a "complex job" with paint having to be carefully mixed to match existing colours.
A free standing scaffold has been erected so as not to damage any of the delicate plasterwork on the walls.
With painting each bay taking around a week, the work is "on track" to be completed by September.
The ceiling above the stage and the hall's original Henry Willis organ will be painted last.
