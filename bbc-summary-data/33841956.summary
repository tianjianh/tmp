A total of five gold, one silver and three bronze left Britain fourth in the medals table in Kazan, Russia.
The men's and women's 4x100m medley relay teams both missed out on medals on Sunday, each finishing fourth.
Meanwhile, seven-time world champion Sun Yang of China failed to show for the 1500m freestyle final.
"A no show for Sun Yang! Shocking! He has won the last seven world titles in Men's 400-800-1500," tweeted Fina.
Sun is the Olympic champion and world-record holder for the event and, earlier in the championships, won gold in the 400m and 800m freestyle and silver in the 200m.
There was no immediate explanation given for his withdrawal and, in his absence, Gregorio Paltrinieri of Italy won gold, with Briton Stephen Milne fifth.
There was speculation Sun was involved in an altercation with a female Brazilian swimmer in the warm-up, but a Chinese official refused to comment at a news conference.
"I felt uncomfortable in my heart," said Sun. "I made the decision by myself so I didn't talk to the coaches."
Great Britain won only one medal at the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona and head coach Bill Furniss admitted the team's performance in Russia went "better than planned".
Adam Peaty won gold in the 50m and 100m breaststroke, James Guy took the 200m freestyle, along with success for both the men's 200m freestyle relay and the mixed 4x100m relays teams.
"We had a good year last year at the Commonwealths and Europeans but my challenge to the team was 'that's at that level but can we do it at a World Championships or Olympics?'" said Furniss.
"It's a belief and cultural thing. I've got guys finishing fourth at a World Championships who are absolutely devastated and that's music to my ears. We're about trying to get to the podium.
"We've raised the bar. We don't reward anyone who is not a performer. That's not in a bad way, it's a tough regime but I suppose it's tough love in that we look after them as well.
"This is a stepping stone and we have to do better."
