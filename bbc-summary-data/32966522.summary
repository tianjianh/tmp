[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derry man accused of Carnhill samurai sword attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Londonderry man charged with possessing a samurai sword and assaulting a man and a woman during a burglary has been refused bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Emmett Rogan, 29, from Altcar Park, is alleged to have committed the offences at a house in the Carnhill area of the city on Sunday night.
A police officer told Londonderry Magistrate's Court three children under the age of 10 were in the house.
Both the man and the woman in the house suffered minor cuts.
The officer said the woman was cut on her hand when she grabbed the sword as she tried to pull the attacker away from the man.
He said the attacker was pointing the sword in a downward manner towards the man's neck and upper body area.
The court was told that the alleged male victim, who also sustained a minor cut, managed to punch the man on the nose.
The attacker then left the house.
The defendant was later arrested at his home. After his arrest he denied any involvement in the incidents.
Refusing bail a judge said the defendant had six previous convictions, a number of them for violent offences.
He remanded him in custody until 18 June.
