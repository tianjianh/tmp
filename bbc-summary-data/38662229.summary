A Skye shinty player's comedy rap has helped to get a video on the shortlist of Gaelic short film competition FilmG.

Ally MacLeod performs in Girls, Strì and Macaroni, a short film made by Iain Wilson from Staffin on Skye.
The video is among entries in the running for best mobile short and best comedy. Mr MacLeod has also been shortlisted for the best performance award.
The full list of shortlisted films can be found on the FilmG website.
Mr MacLeod, 20, a crofter on north Skye and a Skye Camanachd player, added tin foil to a pair of sunglasses and a "gangsta rap swagger" to his usual look for the last-minute entry.
Mr Wilson, 22, said he started work with Mr MacLeod on the film only a few hours before the competition's deadline for "a bit of fun".
Held annually, the competition attracted 105 entries - a record since the competition's inaugural year in 2008.
Films were sought on the theme of "strì", meaning "endeavour/conflict".
Best Gaelic sports commentary was a new category for this year's contest.
The four shortlisted commentaries include Kate Bradley, from Ardnamurchan, for her take on the women's shinty Valerie Fraser Cup Final and Christina MacDonald, from Skye, who commentated on the semi-final of the same tournament.
The awards ceremony will be held in Glasgow on 17 February.
