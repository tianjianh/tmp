Members of the Unite union at Hunslet Park and Bramley are to strike from 02:00 BST.
FirstLeeds said all Leeds routes would be affected "to some degree" but the park and ride service would run.
First buses from depots in Bradford, Huddersfield and Halifax will not be affected.

The company said the rejected offer would have delivered a pay increase of more than 3% in a one-year deal.
But the offer was rejected by members of the Unite union at Hunslet Park and Bramley at a meeting on Thursday.
The two sides had met with the conciliatory service ACAS on Wednesday.
