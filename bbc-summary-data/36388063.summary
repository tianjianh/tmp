The refurbishment of a 19th Century lighthouse will see it taken off English Heritage's "at risk" register, a senior councillor has said.

Seaburn's Grade II* white lighthouse will be repaired as part of Sunderland City Council's seafront regeneration.
It has been considered "at risk" since structural issues were identified in December 2014.
Council cabinet secretary Mel Speding said it had a "very special place in people's hearts."
He said it was one of the most recognisable landmarks in the city.
"It's also a really important Grade II* listed building so I'm delighted that we've been able to find the money to secure its future and take it off the at risk register," he said.
Built in 1856, the lighthouse was moved to Cliffe Park from the entrance to Sunderland's South Pier in 1983 during improvements to the harbour.
The council plans to start the restoration after the Sunderland International Airshow in July and finish in the autumn.
It has spent Â£10m on the Roker and Seaburn seafront since 2010, it said.
