Emyr Huws gave the home side the lead on 26 minutes with a controlled finish.
Brentford midfielder Nico Yennaris produced a fine equaliser to cap a flowing team move.
Sergi Canos had a shot cleared off the line for the Bees, while Cole Skuse forced Daniel Bentley into a save, but the game petered out to a draw, leaving Brentford 14th and Ipswich 15th.
The Bees went into the game after back-to-back wins over Sheffield Wednesday and Rotherham, but found themselves behind midway through the first half.
Tom Lawrence's cross into the area was brilliantly controlled by Huws, who sent a low shot from 10 yards past goalkeeper Bentley.
Lasse Vibe nearly hit back immediately, but his goalbound shot following Luke Chambers' mistake was blocked by Christophe Berra, before Romaine Sawyers fired a 20-yard shot just wide.
The visitors did level just before half-time with Yennaris capitalising on an intricate build-up involving Jota and Sawyers.
Myles Kenlock was on hand to hook the ball off the line after Canos' shot was partially blocked by Bartosz Bialkowski and Ipswich midfielder Skuse went close as both sides strove for a winner, but they remain separated by a single point.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "Brentford were very good while we weren't particularly good with the ball. They deserved the point and probably deserved to win it.
"We have played a lot better in the last five matches and we probably deserved more points than we have got.
"But we scrapped and fought and eight weeks ago, we probably would have lost that 3-1 and I would have had a face like thunder.
"I know it has been five draws but it is another point after a tough old time. It is a measure of the lads that they stuck at it when in the past we would probably have been beaten."
Brentford boss Dean Smith: "We started quite well but then they took over and got the goal.
"We got back into it and scored a well-worked equaliser and then I thought we were the better team in the second half and looked most likely to win the game.
"It was a scrappy game but the pitch was slow and bobbly and doesn't help with any flowing football.
"We had a lot of pressure and ball, but perhaps we didn't have the quality in the final third."
