[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bell ringer from Gwynedd who was killed during the Battle of the Somme is set to be honoured.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Evan Jones, 24, was killed while serving with 101 Company, Yorkshire Machine Gun Corps.
The bells of St John's in Porthmadog will ring out in his memory with a special "quarter peal" on Saturday at about 14:30 BST.
It is part of a UK-wide commemoration by the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers.
The organisation is arranging peals to mark the centenary of each death of their members killed during World War One.
Their names are also written in an illustrated set of books called the Rolls of Honour, which are kept in a display cabinet in St Paul's Cathedral.
Every month their names are published in a list titled The Ringing World.
Pte Jones learned to ring the bells at St John's from the age of 13.
Mae Peter Furniss, of the North Wales Association of Church Bell Ringers, said: "I will bring with me the Ringing World in which Evan Jones is listed.
"Mercifully, the North Wales Association did not lose too many members in the war. From memory, five or six.
"Thus far, the deaths of all have been commemorated by quarter peals or full peals rung by members of the association."
