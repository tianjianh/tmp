Lifelong fan Nigel Daws said he created the figures, which include Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, to mark the club's 150th anniversary.
He said he has tried to make the players' facial expressions and hair look as realistic as possible.
Mr Daws said Peter Shilton's perm and Garry Birtles' quiff were among the most challenging parts of the project.
The designer, who is originally from Ilkeston but now lives in Manchester, said a friend had seen the England Lego team he had created for his son and asked if he could do one of the Reds.
Mr Daws said: "I tried to make the facial expressions as close to the real thing as I could - including Kenny Burns with his little snarl."
"Shilton was another interesting one to make - with his tight permed hair," he said.
"Lego don't do perms - so the only thing available  was like an afro style - which I bought, but it looked ridiculous, so I had to find another one."
Mr Daws said Garry Birtles was also difficult to get right.
"There were a lot of mullets back then," he added.
Mr Daws has no plans to exhibit the 1.57in (4cm) figures, but added "it would be fantastic" if the club wanted to use them in some way to mark its anniversary.
A number of other tributes are also being paid to Nottingham Forest to mark the club's anniversary.
A documentary film - called I Believe in Miracles - tells the story of the club's rise under Brian Clough, from second division strugglers to European champions in 1979 and 1980, and is due to be premiered at the City Ground in October.
Nottingham Contemporary will also hold a short exhibition, alongside the release.
