Boreham Wood 2-0 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln were dumped off the top of the National League table following a 2-0 defeat at mid-table Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ricky Shakes opened the scoring against the run of play in the 64th-minute and the hosts sealed the win late on with a classic counter-attack finished off by Bruno Andrade.
The Imps dominated the first half as Nathan Arnold went close twice inside the opening quarter of an hour and winger Josh Ginnelly tested keeper Grant Smith with a couple of decent efforts before curling a shot just wide six minutes before the break.
Lincoln were well on top when Shakes broke the deadlock and the Wood completed the win when Morgan Ferrier got the better of Sean Raggett and squared for Andrade to seal the points 10 minutes from time.
