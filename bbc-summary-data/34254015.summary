How Australia has reacted to its new prime minister

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Australia woke to news that another prime minister had lost his job mid-way through a parliamentary term, views were divided within political circles about what Malcolm Turnbull's ascension to the top post would mean for the country.

Mr Turnbull on Monday ousted Tony Abbott 54 votes to 44 in a late-night party room ballot, promising a new economic vision for Australia.
On Tuesday, interests groups - everyone from gay marriage supporters to climate change advocates - were lining up to push their case to Malcolm Turnbull.
Here's how some players reacted to the news:
Western Australian Liberal Premier Colin Barnett: "To topple an elected and serving prime minister in his first year in office is nothing to be proud of."
Independent senator Jacqui Lambie: "Australia now, after two years of the coalition being in government, is now open for business. Certainly, as long as the policies change along with the leader then there's a good chance we'll get Australia back on its feet."
Independent senator John Madigan: "The new prime minister may have the support of the party room but he doesn't have a mandate. Now it's time to put it to the people."
Opposition Labor Leader Bill Shorten: "Australia doesn't need another Liberal leader - we need a change of government, and Labor's up for the fight. Australians know that with Malcolm, it will always be about Malcolm."
Australian Greens MP Adam Bandt: "A new PM. A chance for a new direction on climate change? Or has [Turnbull] made promises to deniers to get the gig?"
News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch: "Sad to see such a decent man as Abbott toppled. Now Turnbull needs a November election before Labor sacks Shorten."
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chief Executive Officer, Kate Carnell: "Mr Turnbull has a track record in business ... We hope to see Mr Turnbull continue with efforts to repair government finances, fix the problems of federation, undertake critical tax reform and advance the cause of free trade."
Australian Marriage Equality director Rodney Croome: "This is the first time in Australia's history that both the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition have supported marriage equality, giving us an unprecedented opportunity to achieve the reform."
Leichhardt MP and Liberal Warren Entsch, who introduced a gay marriage private member's bill to parliament earlier this year told AAP he didn't think Mr Turnbull would overturn a party room decision to have a national vote on marriage equality rather than a free vote in parliament.
Chair of the national committee of the Australian Republican Movement, Peter FitzSimons: "The Republican Movement now looks to Malcolm Turnbull to complete our nation's journey towards independence."
