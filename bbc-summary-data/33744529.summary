[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two late Dundee United goals condemned Motherwell to defeat at Fir Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A moment of agony for Louis Laing gave United an 83rd-minute lead, the defender slicing into his own net following a low cross from Paul Dixon.
Substitute Simon Murray sealed United's first win of the season on the counter attack after Well goalkeeper Connor Ripley had gone upfield for a corner.
Both sides had passed up a multitude of chances before Laing's mis-hit broke the deadlock in the second half.
United join Motherwell on three points two weeks into the campaign.
Motherwell, who replaced the injured Stephen Pearson with Jack Leitch, began brightly and Marvin Johnson's shot from the edge of the area had to be touched round  a post by goalkeeper Luis Zwick.
After a promising start, the match got bogged down into a midfield battle until a stunning effort from United midfielder Scott Fraser. His high, fizzing shot from around 18 yards looked a certain goal but was brilliantly saved by Ripley.
The visitors, who had striker Darko Bodul making his first start, claimed unsuccessfully for a penalty after Joe Chalmers handled, with referee Bobby Madden seeming to accept it was ball-to-hand.
With half-time nearing, Charlie Telfer stung the palms of Ripley from 20 yards and, after the break, the keeper again denied the United attacker.
Johnson was then through one-on-one on Zwick's goal but the German made the block.
Chalmers should have scored after getting on the end of a cross but he fired over, much to the anguish of the home crowd.
A spot-kick appeal for the home side followed when a shot from substitute Dom Thomas appeared to strike the hand of John Souttar but, again, Madden was not interested.
Motherwell replacement Louis Moult had a header tipped over by Zwick and, at the other end, substitute Aidan Connolly's fierce drive was batted away by Ripley.
But a goal was in the offing as Dixon sent in a fizzing cross and Laing erroneously swiped the ball past Ripley.
The keeper joined his team-mates for a stoppage-time corner but United broke and Murray was able to apply the finishing touch into the empty net from 12 yards.
