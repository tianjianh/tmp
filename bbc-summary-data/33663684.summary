The blaze broke out on Thursday night in a unit on Hollygate Lane in Cotgrave.
A witness described an explosion and fire at the estate as looking "like Armageddon".
The fire severely damaged the large two-storey building which housed six separate units. There were no reports of any injuries.
Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service station manager Tom Clark: "As a result of the work we have done throughout the day, we can now conclude that the fire was an electrical fire caused by one of the manufacturing processes in the building."
Businesses on the estate included a dry cleaner, steeplejack and a plastics firm.
"There were also a couple of gas cylinders involved and there was a kerosene tank of 400 litres which needed protecting in the next building," a fire spokesman said.
