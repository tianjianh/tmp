[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £12m primary care centre on the site of a former school in Cumbria has been given the go-ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Built on the site of Alfred Barrow School in Duke Street, it will replace "old, inefficient" facilities.
A number of services, including three GP practices, a response base for the North West Ambulance Service and a pharmacy will operate from the centre.
Barrow GP Geoff Jolliffe said he was "delighted" to be creating a "much better" service for the community.
The development was approved by Barrow Borough Council's planning committee.
Demolition is likely to start this summer, with the new centre expected to be complete by the end of 2017.
The secondary school closed in 2009 and became part of Furness Academy.
