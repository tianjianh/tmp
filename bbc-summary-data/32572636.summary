The 89-year-old has lived with type II diabetes for more than 20 years, and has had several spells in hospital in recent months.
A message on his website said: "I am in home hospice care at my residence in Las Vegas.
"Thanks to all for your well wishes and prayers."
The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time.
Known for such hits as The Thrill is Gone and Every Day I Have the Blues, he had been touring up until last year.
But he was forced to cancel the remainder of a tour last October when he fell ill during a show, and was later diagnosed with dehydration and exhaustion.
