Super League: Leigh Centurions 50-34 Wigan Warriors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leigh Centurions moved off the bottom of Super League with an emphatic derby win at home to Wigan Warriors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leigh went in 20-14 ahead at the break thanks to tries from Ryan Hampshire, Danny Tickle and Lachlan Burr.
Liam Marshall, Josh Ganson and George Williams had replied for Warriors and they got within two thanks to a try from the returning Oliver Gildart.
Mitch Brown, Liam Hood, Cory Paterson and Matty Dawson tries gave Leigh their biggest ever Super League win.
Ben Reynolds' nine completed kicks were also a Super League record for Centurions, who move above Widnes into 11th after their first win over Wigan since 1984.
Champions Wigan, meanwhile, have not won in five but did begin well when Gildart, back from 10 weeks out with injury, set up Marshall for his 18th league try of the season.
However, Leigh turned the game on its head with three unanswered tries - including an 80-metre dash for the line from former Wigan player Hampshire.
Gildart finished off a flowing move to make it 20-18, but the hosts began to pull away, including a double from Hood.
Frank-Paul Nuuausala, Joe Burgess and Ganson scored as Wigan produced some late fight, but it was too late to count and Centurions, who had lost 11 of their previous 12 matches, had already got enough on the board.
Leigh head coach Neil Jukes:
"It's probably my biggest win as Leigh coach. It's a big win for me, the club and the town. It was more than two points for us and our fans.
"The guys do turn up for each other every week. The results might suggest otherwise sometimes but they really do put the work in.
"We've stayed at it and not been far off it for the last few weeks. We were really good with the ball in hand today."
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane on BBC 5 live:
"Fifty points at Leigh, all respect to them, is not good enough, but we've got some players coming back and hopefully that will change things.
"We defended lots of sets really, really well, forced errors, but our decision making on our own line was ordinary. When I show the players tomorrow they'll be wounded when they see how easily it can be fixed.
"We're hurting really badly, too many bad losses, but we're a strong group and everybody in that dressing room knows we can get back."
