The boxer joins her on the track Iconic alongside Chance The Rapper with Nas and Nicki Minaj appearing on two other songs.
Rebel Heart was recorded in London, LA and New York and will be released on 10 March via Interscope.
Madonna has produced some of the tracks herself and has drafted in some of the biggest names in the business to work on other tunes.
Kanye West worked on the track Illuminati and Diplo was behind three tunes.
Billboard, DJ Dahi and Blood Diamonds also made music for some of the 19 tracks on the album.
Madonna was forced to release some of the tracks early before Christmas because of a leak.
One of them, Living For Love, went to number one in more than 40 countries on iTunes.
She said at the time that she was annoyed that people had leaked demos of 10 of her tracks.
"It's just the age that we're living in. It's crazy times," she said.
"The internet is as constructive and helpful in bringing people together as it is in doing dangerous things and hurting people. It's a double-edged sword."
When the leak happened she told Billboard magazine that her new music was a cross between house and soul.
"It's kind of like the old me and the new me all mixed in together," she said.
