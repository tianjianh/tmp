Osama Abdul Mohsen fell while running across the Serbia-Hungary border last week. The camerawoman, Petra Laszlo, was fired and later apologised.
Mr Mohsen, who coached a football team in Syria, will now work at a sports school near Madrid.
"The future will be very good for my son in Spain," Mr Mohsen told El Mundo newspaper (in Spanish).
The family was due to arrive by train in Madrid late on Wednesday.
He said he and his seven-year-old son Zaid had endured a difficult journey to Europe, after meeting with another son, Mohammad, who had already reached Europe by boat.
"The journalist's kick was scary and hard," he told El Mundo.
"My feeling was surprise. And then pain when I saw the fear and panic in the face of my son. Zaid cried for two hours. I was terrified."
He said he was then threatened with jail by Hungarian authorities.
Miguel Angel Galan, the director of the Cenafe football school in Getafe, near Madrid, said officials had decided to "help a fellow coach".
"They will get the most important things: housing, food, clothes and the job as a coach that we are going to give him," he said.
Spain has agreed to take in 17,000 refugees this year.
