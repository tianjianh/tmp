What the Scottish papers say

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most of the newspapers lead on Alex Salmond's announcement that he will stand down as Scotland's first minister after the country rejected independence.

The Scotsman writes that Mr Salmond led his party "from a minority movement into an election-winning political machine". The newspaper says there is "little doubt" Mr Salmond's deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, is favourite to succeed him as leader. David Torrance, analysing the impact of Mr Salmond on Scottish politics, says he is "perhaps the most significant politician to emerge from Scotland in the past three decades".
In coverage of the referendum result, political correspondent Scott Macnab writes that "women and older voters were the secret weapon" that helped the "No" campaign win.
The Herald runs with a quote from Mr Salmond's speech, in which he said "the dream shall never die", on its front page. The paper describes the announcement as "dramatic" and speculates that local government minister Derek Mackay and Humza Yousaf, the minister for external affairs, may also stand for the leadership. Columnist Iain Macwhirther writes of the resignation that Mr Salmond "was astute enough to realise that his time had finally come."
The newspaper also writes that there is anger in the Labour party over plans to restrict what Scottish MPs can vote on at Westminster. And it has a pullout of analysis and results from Thursday's vote.
The Daily Record, on its front page, describes Mr Salmond as "beaten but unbowed", running with a picture of the first minister with his wife Moira after they left his official home in Edinburgh, Bute House. The paper's political editor David Clegg says Mr Salmond "took the cause of Scottish nationalism to unimaginable victories" before Friday's "agonising defeat". Among tributes in the paper is one from Colin and Chris Weir, the euromillions winners who donated large sums to the "Yes" campaign.
The paper also carries a pledge from Labour leader Ed Miliband that he will deliver more powers for Holyrood.
The Scottish Sun splashes with a mocked up Looney Tunes image, with the headline "Nats all folks". The paper says Mr Salmond was "close to tears" during the announcement, which came after a "crushing referendum defeat". The paper, in its editorial, describes the first minister as "true colossus". And in a personal tribute, Ms Sturgeon says the "personal debt of gratitude" she owes Mr Salmond "is immeasurable".
The paper also covers trouble in Glasgow's George Square on Friday night, saying hundreds of unionists clashed with police and "Yes" supporters.
The Courier runs with the headline "Salmond steps down", The Express says he fell on his sword and The Daily Telegraph writes that the First Minister decided to "throw in the towel".
A number of the UK papers cover the result of the referendum too. Proposed changes to government across the UK following the referendum result are also causing controversy. The Times says that there is deadlock in moves towards further devolution,  while The Independent describes the United Kingdom as "disunited".
The Guardian writes that the battle for new powers has now moved to England, with Labour and the Conservatives differing over who should vote on English laws.
