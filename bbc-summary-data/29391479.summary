The intelligence-led operation on Saturday evening came seven days after shots were fired at two addresses.
In the first incident, a parked car was shot at in the Murrays Brae and a few minutes later, shots were fired at a property in Gilmerton Dykes Drive.
The ammunition was found in the Blackford area and has been sent for further analysis.
On Saturday, officers carried out high-visibility patrols in areas where the shots were fired and spoke to people to try to get more information.
The shootings are being investigated by the Organised Crime Unit and police said activity would continue until those responsible have been identified.
Det Ch Insp Kenny Gray said: "The recovery of the firearms ammunition on Saturday evening is significant, as it sends a clear message to those involved in serious organised crime that we are continuing with our efforts to shut down their illegal activities.
"Incidents like those witnessed last week remain extremely rare, but can cause significant distress to the local communities when they do occur."
Officers have said they want to trace two people seen on a motorbike in the area. They were wearing lighter coloured trousers, dark tops and the rear passenger may not have been wearing a helmet.
Four people have already been detained. No-one is believed to have been injured in the incidents.
