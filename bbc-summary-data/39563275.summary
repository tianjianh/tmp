Stormont talks: Irish Foreign Minister in Belfast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan is in Belfast on Tuesday, as talks to form a power-sharing executive continue.

Legacy issues and an Irish Language Act remain two of the biggest stumbling blocks.
Snap elections on 2 March resulted in Sinn Féin coming within one seat of the Democratic Unionist Party.
The talks are showing little sign of progress towards achieving a deal between the main parties.
NI Secretary James Brokenshire has said he will bring in legislation after Easter to collect rates if there is no agreement.
If an agreement is not reached, he is obliged to call a fresh election within a reasonable period or introduce direct rule.
The Northern Ireland Office said on Tuesday that the government wanted to see the parties "come together to reach an agreement to form an Executive", but that if they could not "clearly the UK Government has responsibility for political stability in Northern Ireland".
"As the Secretary of State has stated, if no agreement is reached following the Easter recess then he would seek to bring forward legislation to set a regional rate to enable collection of the rates to go ahead, and take steps to provide further assurance around the budget for Northern Ireland," it added.
"The government's priority is for parties to continue to engage over the coming days to ensure devolved government is restored as quickly as possible."
Mr Brokenshire recently stated that there was "no appetite for another election".
Northern Ireland's two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, blamed each other for the failure of initial talks.
The political deadlock came after a snap election on 2 March brought an end to Stormont's unionist majority and the DUP's lead over Sinn Féin was cut from 10 seats to one.
Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement, the executive must be jointly run by unionists and nationalists, with the largest party putting forward a candidate for first minister.
Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness quit as deputy first minister in January in protest against the DUP's handling of a botched green energy scheme.
The party said it would not share power with Mrs Foster as first minister until the conclusion of a public inquiry into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme.
Mr McGuinness died last month at the age of 66.
