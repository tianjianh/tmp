[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super League: Warrington Wolves v Leigh Centurions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Westwood returns to the Warrington side for the first time since breaking a bone in his hand in May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Lineham and Declan Patton also return, while centre Ben Pomeroy is set to make his debut after arriving from Lezignan Sangliers in June.
Leigh Centurions prop Jamie Acton misses out as he waits on the decision from a disciplinary hearing.
Centre Ben Crooks is suspended for one game but hooker Mickey Higham and back-rower Samisoni Langi return.
Acton faces a minimum eight-game ban if found guilty of a Grade F offence of "other contrary behaviour" on Tuesday, 11 July.
He appeared to grab the shirt of Catalans Dragons' Greg Bird, lift him and push him back to the floor while he lay injured during the Centurions' 40-36 defeat last weekend.
