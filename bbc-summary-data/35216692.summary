Kyrgios, fined Â£16,200 for remarks about Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend in August, beat German Alexander Zverev in the mixed teams event in Perth.
The 20-year-old faces world number two Murray when Australia Green, one of two teams representing the host nation, play Great Britain on Wednesday.
"I have been looking forward to that for a long time," he said.
"I'm going to go and do everything I can to physically prepare for that battle."
Kyrgios recovered from losing the first set 6-4 to take the next two 6-1 6-4 as he beat Zverev in just over an hour.
Murray, who teams up with Heather Watson, currently being coached by his mother Judy, knocked Kyrgios out of the Australian, French and US Opens in 2015.
