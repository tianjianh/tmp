£20m disability care fund replaces scrapped scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £20m fund to help 1,600 severely disabled people in Wales pay for care will replace a UK scheme being scrapped in June, Welsh ministers have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Claimants in Wales currently receive, on average, £335 a week from the Independent Living Fund (ILF).
Local councils will make payments from the new fund from July, helping with things such as eating and dressing.
The UK government's decision to close its fund was ruled lawful by the High Court last December.
The new scheme for Wales will run from July until the end of March 2017.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I hope the actions the Welsh government is taking will alleviate some of the concerns expressed by ILF recipients and that they will be able to maintain their current care and support packages under a new process and remove employment concerns raised by their carers."
UK ministers have argued that the vast majority of disabled people with care needs are already looked after through the adult social care system.
