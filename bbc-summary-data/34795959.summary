A record number of people celebrated Diwali in Leicester in what is thought to be the largest event outside India.

About 41,000 people descended on the city's Golden Mile to mark the Hindu festival of light, with entertainment including fireworks and dancing.
The lights switch on earlier this month also attracted a record attendance with 37,000 in Leicester's south Asian area.
The festival, also marked by Jains and Sikhs, celebrates the victory of good over evil.
At the centre of Leicester's celebrations was a 110ft (34m) ferris wheel, known as the Wheel of Light. About 6,000 coloured lamps were strung up around the city.
As well as fireworks and the street lights, shops put on entertainment and there was traditional dancing and music to mark the festival.
Rangoli sand art decorations and light displays also wowed the gathered crowds.
The demolition of the Belgrave Flyover last year allowed for an extension of the celebration along the full length of Belgrave Road.
