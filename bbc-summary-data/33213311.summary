Northamptonshire General Hospital said the eggs hatched in the enclosed Willow Garden courtyard earlier in the week.
Staff gathered up the chicks and transferred them to Midsummer Meadow next to the River Nene.
A hospital spokesman said: "The garden was always designed to be wildlife-attracting, but we weren't expecting this special delivery."
