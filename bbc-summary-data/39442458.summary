[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal British Legion service to recruit dementia nurses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Royal British Legion has launched a recruitment drive in Wales for extra nurses for a service helping those with dementia and their families.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are almost 200 specialist Admiral Nurses in the UK, focused on improving the wellbeing of carers and people with dementia.
The service has been developed alongside Dementia UK.
Paula Smith, the legion's Admiral Nurse lead, said there was a "genuine need" for more support for families in Wales.
To qualify for support, the carer or the person with dementia needs to be a Royal British Legion beneficiary, which includes anyone who has served in the British armed forces, their family and their carers.
