Two people were hurt in the collision outside Soho House's Pizza East in Highgate Road, Kentish Town.
One man suffered non-life threatening injuries, while a woman was treated for minor injuries, the Met Police said.
The crash happened after the police car was in collision with another car, at the junction between Sanderson Close and Highgate Road, at 19:44 BST.
Two police officers were treated for whiplash injuries, following the crash.
Both victims are believed to be aged in their 30s, police said.
Freelance newsreader Zora Suleman tweeted: "One minute everyone was chatting and drinking next sirens then a huge bang and ppl screaming."
The other vehicle involved stopped at the scene and the driver is assisting police with their inquiries, the Met said.
No arrests have been made, and local road closures are in place.
"As a matter of course, this incident has been referred to the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards," the Met confirmed.
