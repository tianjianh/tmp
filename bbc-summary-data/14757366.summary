A Swansea City fan has been banned from football matches in the UK for four years following disorder at games, says South Wales Police.

Michael Jordan McGuire, 19, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, also had to pay Â£1,000 costs in a hearing at Swansea Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.
Police said the order also stopped McGuire from entering towns and cities where Swansea or Wales were playing.
They added that McGuire contested their court application to ban him.
A spokesman said the court was shown video footage of McGuire during disorder at three games - Wolves versus Swansea in 2008, Swansea versus Charlton Athletic in 2009, and Swansea versus Leicester City last year.
The court was also shown photographs from the Swansea versus Cardiff City fixture in 2009.
The order was made on the basis that McGuire caused or contributed to violence and disorder at these matches, said South Wales Police.
Police said the court agreed he should be banned despite having never been arrested or convicted of football-related violence.
They said the ban extended to matches in the UK which were regulated under the Football Spectators Act 1989.
Supt Phil Davies of Swansea police said: "South Wales Police can, and will, pursue civil banning orders against those who are frequently and actively engaged in incidents of disorder at football events regardless of whether they have been arrested or convicted.
"I'm sure no Swansea City fans will want to miss any of this season's Premier League fixtures and therefore this case should be a deterrent to anyone thinking of getting involved in disorder.
"The feedback we have had following the opening three matches of this season has been extremely positive, including positive comments from Greater Manchester Police on the behaviour of the Swans fans and from Sunderland fans about the good atmosphere during their visit to Swansea last weekend."
