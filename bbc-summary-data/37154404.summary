Drifters was made in 1929 by acclaimed Scottish documentary-maker John Grierson.
It shows fishermen harvesting shoals of herring off Scotland's east coast.
East London-born sound artist Jason Singh will provide vocal sound effects during screenings of the film in Lerwick, Helmsdale and Anstruther.
The tour, called Following the Fleet, is supported by the National Lottery through Creative Scotland and also by Film Hub Scotland, which is part of the British Film Institute's Film Audience Network.
Between 31 August and 18 September, the film and performances will be held at venues in Baltasound and Lerwick on Shetland, Stromness on Orkney, Helmsdale in Sutherland, Aberdeen and Anstruther.
Singh, who will also deliver workshops on beatboxing and other sound effects for secondary school pupils at the venues, said: "I'm really excited about the Following The Fleet tour.
"I am keen to see what people will make of a live beatboxed score to a silent film.
"I'm also really looking forward to running workshops as it will give people the opportunity to explore their own voices in new ways and it will also give me the chance to meet, share and explore with new communities and cultures."
