Leicestershire Police re-open child sexual abuse cases

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five separate child sex abuse cases have been reopened by Leicestershire Police after a review of 20 years' worth of reports.

Detectives were ordered to re-examine thousands of accounts dating back to 1994 in light of the Rotherham scandal.
They found no evidence of "historic, systematic abuse" but have reopened five unconnected cases, the force said.
The review only included reports which are not linked to current investigations.
A team of experts looked at reports into 866 individuals to decide if they had been victims of sexual exploitation.
In cases where they had, they assessed whether the complaints had been properly investigated at the time.
This uncovered further names - a total of almost 7,000 - all of which were followed up.
Details of any potential victims were passed on to teams of detectives, who felt five cases warranted reopening.
The report concluded: "There is no evidence to suggest that any large scale systematic child sexual exploitation has been uncovered in Leicestershire".
Police and Crime Commissioner Sir Clive Loader, who ordered the report, known as Operation Sepia, said he was "reassured" by its findings.
Assistant Chief Constable Roger Bannister said he was satisfied the "comprehensive" review would have uncovered any evidence of systematic and organised abuse if it had existed.
But, he added, only records from Leicestershire had been examined, and called on victims to come forward if they felt their case had not been adequately investigated.
