Kent head coach Matt Walker says veteran all-rounder Darren Stevens is improving like a "fine wine" after he helped bowl Gloucestershire out for 61.

Stevens took 6-22 in the second innings to help Kent earn a 334-run victory on Sunday in their first Championship Division Two game of the season.
The 40-year-old medium-pace bowler has taken 367 first-class wickets, including 98 over the past two seasons.
"Not bad for a 60-year-old is it?" Walker joked to BBC Radio Kent.
"He is a bit of a fine wine is Darren, with the ball especially he does just seem to get better.
"It doesn't matter how fast or slow you bowl or whatever level of cricket you play, if you bowl the ball in the right areas enough, you're going to be in the shake-up of getting wickets.
"And mixed in with that, Darren's skill levels are so huge. The craft he has with the ball is exceptional, it was an absolute masterclass of skill and accuracy."
