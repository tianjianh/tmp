[SN]TITLE[SN]
The damning report that made Ferguson's police chief quit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police chief of Ferguson resigned following a damning report by the Department of Justice into his department. What were the report's main findings?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At each juncture in the criminal process, the law is enforced more harshly against black people than others.
Ferguson's police practices are shaped by a focus on maximising revenue rather than improving public safety.
The court's practices impose unnecessary harm, overwhelmingly on African Americans.
Many officers are quick to escalate encounters with subjects they perceive to be disobeying their orders or resisting arrest.
