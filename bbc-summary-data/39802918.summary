Nottinghamshire have signed India batsman Cheteshwar Pujara to provide short-term cover when James Pattinson joins up with Australia this month.

Pujara, who averages 51.32 in 48 Test matches, will join Notts in mid-May.
The 29-year-old will be available for four County Championship matches - two against Gloucestershire, as well as games against Glamorgan and Derbyshire.
Notts will be without Pattinson following the fast bowler's call-up for the ICC Champions Trophy in June.
Pattinson has taken 20 wickets in three four-day matches since joining, at an average of 11.15.
Director of cricket Mick Newell said Pattinson's replacement did not have to be a bowler, and that signing someone with the quality to make the team better was the most important factor in Notts' decision.
He added: "We have depth in our squad with regards bowling and - particularly as we'll be without Alex Hales during that period - we're more than happy to welcome a world-class batsman to the club."
Pujara's previous stints in red-ball cricket in England saw him amass 483 runs at an average of 54 for Derbyshire and Yorkshire.
"I love playing county cricket and Trent Bridge is a great venue. I'm really looking forward to my first experience there as a home player," Pujara added.
The Champions Trophy takes place between 1 and 18 June in England and Wales.
