Cory Allen: Cardiff Blues centre's future with region in doubt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales centre Cory Allen's Cardiff Blues future is in doubt after head coach Danny Wilson said he was not currently being considered as a centre option.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old has been overlooked while New Zealanders Rey Lee-Lo and Willis Halaholo have taken over in the Blues' midfield this season.
Blues recently signed Leicester's Welsh centre Jack Roberts for next season.
Meanwhile Allen, who has four Wales caps, has been linked with Blues' Welsh Pro12 rivals Ospreys.
In the announcement of Roberts' signing, Blues stated: "He will add depth and compete with Rey Lee-Lo, Willis Halaholo, Garyn Smith and Harri Millard for a centre spot next season."
Allen scored a first-half try hat-trick in his last Wales appearance, against Uruguay in Cardiff at the 2015 World Cup, but later pulled a hamstring after the break and went off.
He is out of contract at the end of this term and Wilson was questioned about his name being omitted from the centre options beyond that.
Wilson said: "Currently the names that were mentioned in there were the names that will be competing for that position for next season."
