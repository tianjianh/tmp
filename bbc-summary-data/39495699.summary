The attack happened in the Jenkins Dale area of Chatham at 17:26 BST. The child, thought to be a young girl, was rushed to a London hospital in a critical condition.
The dog was shot dead by police firearms officers.
Two people have been arrested in connection with the attack and are in custody as police inquiries continue.
Neighbours told the BBC the injured child was a two-year-old girl who lived locally.
One eyewitness, Alisha Robinson, said she saw the girl receiving first aid.
"They were trying to keep her alive. You couldn't see her face, she was covered in blood. Then her mum came up screaming, that did it for me, I wanted to cry," she said.
Other people reported hearing a shot fired and seeing a child under a blanket being carried to an ambulance.
Jaspreet Uppal said: "First I heard a gunshot, there was a dog on the floor. A few officers carried out a child from the back area of the flats.
"There is a little park there. I could not see the child, they were covered. I think they were quite small."
Charlie Helder witnessed the police marksmen as they arrived in Jenkins Dale.
"I saw two police officers with guns," he told BBC South East. "One said 'stand back' and he shot it twice."
Following the attack, MP for Chatham and Aylesford Tracey Crouch, tweeted: "Horrid news from Chatham this evening. My thoughts and prayers are with the child & their family tonight."
Kent Police has asked that anyone with footage of the events to contact them and not upload it to social media.
