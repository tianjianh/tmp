In a quiet first half, Tarique Fosu broke the deadlock, capitalising on York goalkeeper Scott Flinders' mistake to finish into the bottom corner.
Bradley Fewster came close to converting for the Minstermen, before Josh Windass doubled Stanley's lead with a strike from the edge of the box.
After numerous York chances, Windass added a late third for Stanley.
Following Stanley's dominant start, York began to create chances of their own. Fewster turned and shot over the bar before Luke Summerfield placed his effort straight at Accrington goalkeeper Ross Etheridge.
The result leaves York 10 points behind Newport with only two games left, as the Minstermen's four-year stay in the Football League is brought to an end.
Meanwhile second-placed Stanley strengthened their chances of automatic promotion to League One, stretching their buffer to the play-offs to two points after Plymouth lost to Dagenham and Redbridge.
