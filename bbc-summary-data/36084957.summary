US election 2016: New York primary results

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New York holds primary elections on Tuesday where voters have their say over who wins the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Full results provided by the Associated Press news agency are available here after polls close.
Winning delegates, the people who endorse a candidate at the party conventions in July, is key to securing the nomination.
The Democratic totals include the delegates won per state, as well as so-called "unpledged" or "super delegates". Hillary Clinton has a huge lead among the party leaders and elected officials who each get a vote at the convention.
AP conducts surveys of these super delegates, and adds them to a candidate's totals if they indicate their support.  But super delegates can - and do - change their minds during the course of the campaign, so the figures may shift as the race unfolds.
The delegate tracker is updated automatically. There may be a short delay between the delegates being assigned and the totals changing.
