[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Man chief minister: Beecroft, Cannan & Quayle in race for top job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three members of the Manx parliament have been nominated for chief minister.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kate Beecroft (Douglas South), Alf Cannan (Ayre and Michael) and Howard Quayle (Middle) all received the necessary backing of at least two MHKs.
But Rushen MHK Laurence Skelly, who previously told the BBC he would be throwing his hat into the ring to replace Allan Bell, is not a contender.
The new chief minister will be elected by all 24 MHKs and the 11 members of the Legislative Council on 4 October.
That will take place in a full sitting of Tynwald.
A key test will come on Friday, however, when the three candidates will present a statement of their policies and field questions from their parliamentary colleagues.
Mr Bell, who has been chief minister since 2011, is retiring from Manx politics after 32 years as an MHK.
During that time he has held ministerial roles in tourism and leisure, industry, home affairs, the treasury and economic development.
Of the three candidates only Mr Quayle has held a minister role before - he is a former health and social care minister
All three candidates have five years' experience as an MHK.
