Dean Keates' side will travel to face local rivals Chester on Saturday 11 November with the return at the Racecourse on Saturday 10 March, 2018.
Wrexham face Barrow away on Boxing Day before hosting the same side on New Year's Day.
The Dragons close the regular season at the Racecourse against league newcomers AFC Fylde on 28 April. 2018.
"We couldn't have asked for anything more than the first game of the season being at home," said Keates.
"Hopefully it'll be a decent turn out and we can send the fans home happy on the opening day."
The new season will see the introduction of a change in the play-off system with six teams instead of four now contesting the second promotion place to the Football League.
Keates believes it will make the campaign more exciting.
"It'll open things up for a lot of teams now and they might have found a bit more revenue to try and push themselves towards those two extra spots," added Keates.
