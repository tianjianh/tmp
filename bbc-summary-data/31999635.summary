[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners have set out to protect a former Turkish Baths building in Lewes by getting it registered as a community asset and listed by English Heritage.

The building in the East Sussex town is home to Lewes District Council's print room, but the operation is closing.
Ruth O'Keeffe, from Lewes Little Gardens, said she feared the building could be lost.
Lewes council said there were no firm plans for the building and future options were being investigated.
Ms O'Keeffe said the Turkish Baths opened in Lewes in the 1860s, but only remained open for about 20 years because of competition from Brighton.
"They had a warm and cold bath, tepid and cold plunge baths, showers and living accommodation for the attendants," she said.
"We're worried that it might not be there any more if we don't try to save it," she added.
She said the print room operation was a separate issue, but local community groups used it and might not have anything similar available to them.
