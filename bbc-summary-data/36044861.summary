Interest in Dumfries and Galloway 'grow your own' teacher scheme falls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A project designed to help fill rural teaching vacancies in Dumfries and Galloway has seen interest fall despite more places being available.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council-run "Grow Your Own" scheme initially let education department staff with degrees do a post-graduate teaching diploma.
Thirty people applied for nine training places in 2015.
This year the figure has fallen to 18 applications from council staff despite 30 places being available.
The scheme was introduced to help tackle problems in recruiting and keeping teachers in the region.
It was first opened to education department staff but extended to employees across the council this year.
However, it has not generated the same level of response with the number of applications falling by 40%.
