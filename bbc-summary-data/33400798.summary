Plans have been put forward to transform Aberystwyth University's Old College into community facilities, including exhibition space, artists' studios and a cafe/restaurant.
The project also includes developing its Assembly Rooms and other university buildings in the area.
A public consultation event will be held at the Old College on Tuesday.
Speaking ahead of the consultation, the university's Pro Vice-Chancellor Dr Rhodri Llwyd Morgan said the vision was to develop the Old College into "a dynamic hub of learning, heritage and culture".
