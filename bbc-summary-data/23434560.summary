Life expectancy: Women in poorer areas dying sooner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman born in one of the poorest areas of Wales can expect to die 10 years before one living in a more affluent part, new figures have shown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A woman born in Blaenau Gwent has a life expectancy of 79.9, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Only Manchester was lower in England and Wales at 79.3 years.
But women living in Monmouthshire can expect to live until they are 89.9 years old on average.
Life expectancy for men living in the county is 80.5 and 79.8 in Ceredigion.
But in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) it is just 75.8.
Only six cities - including Liverpool and Manchester - ranked lower than RCT.
Men in Blackpool have the lowest life expectancy in England and Wales combined at 73.8 years.
Life expectancy for both men and women at birth in Wales has improved since the year 2000.
Men's average life expectancy in Wales has increased from 75.3 to 78 by 2011.
For women in Wales, the average increased from 80 in 2000 to 82.2 by 2011.
Life expectancy in England and Wales was highest in East Dorset. Men can expect to live to 83 and women can expect to live to 86.4 years.
Meanwhile, Welsh government figures released on Tuesday have predicted the population of cities in Wales was set to rise over the next 25 years.
The Census figures indicated the number of people living in isolated, poorer areas would shrink.
Cardiff's population is expected to grow by nearly a third (32.7%) by 2036, which is the largest across Wales.
Blaenau Gwent is expected to see its population fall by 6.7%, as is Anglesey (2.7%) and Monmouthshire (1.3%)
Total population of Anglesey, Monmouthshire and Blaenau Gwent is projected to be lower in 2036 than in 2011.
Wrexham is projected to have a 21% increase and Swansea 13.1%.
But while Conwy, Flintshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Torfaen will see a rise in population in the years leading up to 2026, after that populations are expected to fall.
