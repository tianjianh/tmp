The banking giant said it had told its 230 employees in Forth Valley that the service was moving to Edinburgh and Asia.
About 100 jobs will be relocated to Edinburgh, while 70 IT roles will move to India, China and Poland.
The move is part of a review of office space and part of the bank's programme to cut costs by the end of next year.
HSBC, which employs 3,700 people in Scotland, said 26 people would be retained at a smaller office in Stirling.
John Hackett, chief operating officer at the bank said: "As a global organisation, we constantly review roles to make sure they are in the right location.
"We will do all we can to support our colleagues through these changes, which will take place by the end of 2017."
