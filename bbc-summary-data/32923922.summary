Simon Bradbury, director at Thomas Morris in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, started broadcasting open house events via his tablet earlier this month.
"To have people tuning in and looking around the house, asking questions about the nearest schools, the nearest railway stations, how many bedrooms it has got was really, really impressive," he said.
The BBC was given access to his latest viewing at a house in Cambridgeshire.
