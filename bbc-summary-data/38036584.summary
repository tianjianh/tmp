[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gillingham 3-0 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Frank Nouble's first League One goal of the season helped propel Gillingham to victory over Rochdale at Priestfield Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rochdale had won their last three matches in all competitions - including back-to-back 4-0 victories - but striker Nouble struck after the break before Jay Emmanuel-Thomas and Mark Byrne wrapped up the three points late on.
In a quiet first half Gillingham found the net in the 37th minute when Baily Cargill turned in Bradley Dack's free-kick, but his glancing header was ruled out for offside.
Justin Edinburgh's side could not be denied after the break as substitute Nouble's shot ricocheted into the net off Dale captain Callum Camps.
Cargill went close twice within a minute shortly after as Conrad Logan was at full stretch to tip his header round the post and from the resulting corner he had a second header cleared off the line by Steven Davies.
Matty Lund had a shot hooked off the line by Scott Wagstaff as Rochdale fought back but Gills put the game beyond doubt in the closing stages.
First, Emmanuel-Thomas latched onto substitute Byrne's through ball in the 89th minute before slotting under Conrad Logan, who was beaten again deep into injury-time when Byrne converted Rory Donnelly's brilliant cross.
