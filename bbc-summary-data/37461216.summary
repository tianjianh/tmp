Thieves who hit and bit a Carlisle shopkeeper who tried to stop them stealing wine worth Â£14 have been jailed for 15 months.

Danielle Nicholson and Tania Liddle attacked the man at the Fusehill Street Spar in May last year.
Liddle, 35, hit him while Nicholson, 27, sank her teeth into his arm. A third unidentified person attacked him with a broken bottle.
Judge Peter Davies at Carlisle Crown Court called the attack "disgraceful".
Both Nicholson, of Chatsworth Square, Carlisle, and Liddle, of Heathfield Crescent, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, admitted affray and theft.
The judge said "vulnerable" shopkeepers need to be protected.
