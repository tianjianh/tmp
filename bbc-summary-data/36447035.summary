[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former police sergeant dismissed from his job for kicking a teenage boy while making an arrest has had his appeal against the decision rejected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Stevenson was sacked from Humberside Police in 2015 following a complaint about his treatment of the boy at Hull Fair in October 2014.
His appeal against the outcome of the misconduct hearing was refused by a Police Appeal Tribunal.
Humberside Police Federation said it was "disappointed" with the decision.
According to reports Mr Stevenson kicked the 16-year-old boy while arresting him on suspicion of stealing a moped.
Det Ch Con Garry Forsyth said the tribunal's ruling meant Mr Stevenson would not be reinstated.
Paul Yeomans, chair of the Humberside Police Federation said: "It's been a very difficult time for everybody involved, including Mr Stevenson and his family, friends and colleagues.
"We've got a decision here today that's not the decision we would have wanted and Mr Stevenson is naturally disappointed."
He said the Federation would await the panel's written ruling before making a decision on whether to continue with Mr Stevenson's appeal.
