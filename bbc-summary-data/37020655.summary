Work to restore York's flooded Jorvik Viking Centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has started to rebuild a Viking museum which was forced to close because of severe flooding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jorvik Viking Centre, in York, closed on 27 December, after parts of the attraction were submerged beneath up to 3ft (1m) of water from the flooded River Foss.
A campaign to raise £1.5m towards the cost of rebuilding the museum has so far raised about £500,000.
The centre is expected to reopen in Spring 2017.
The museum, which is owned by the York Archaeological Trust, opened in 1984.
The city's Norse history was revealed in the 1970s when an archaeological dig at Coppergate found Viking streets buried below the modern pavement.
