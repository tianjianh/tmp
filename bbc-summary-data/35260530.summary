'Banksy' house in Cheltenham put up for sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A house with a famous Banksy mural painted on it has been put up for sale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The property in Cheltenham, with the Spy Booth artwork on it, has a guide price of Â£210,000.
The mural, on the Fairview Road house, has been the target of thieves, been fought over and vandalised since it appeared in 2014.
Before the property was placed on the open market, Cheltenham Borough Council said a deal was being negotiated to buy the Grade II listed building.
The Peter Ball & Co. estate agent's website describes it as "a rare opportunity to acquire a Grade II listed, Victorian, three bedroom end terrace property with a genuine 'Banksy' on the gable wall."
The mural, located about three miles from government listening post GCHQ, has been daubed with white paint, sprayed with silver and red graffiti, and had people trying to steal it.
Businesses and communities have also fought over its ownership.
In a bid to protect it under the property's Grade II listed status, the "unauthorised" work was granted retrospective planning consent last February.
Since then, the council has served notice on the property's owner David Possee demanding he fix the damage, "apparently" done in an "abortive attempt" to remove it, by April this year.
An urgent works letter to repair the rendering on the wall with the Banksy on it, was also served.
