[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron will stay on as MP for Witney until the next general election, he has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The news comes after his announcement on Friday to step down as prime minister by October after the UK voted to leave the European Union.
But he has now said he will not leave the House of Commons until the end of this parliament.
The PM backed Remain but was defeated by 52% to 48% despite London, Scotland and Northern Ireland's backing.

In a statement Mr Cameron said: "I will continue with my duties as the MP for Witney. It is an enormous privilege to serve the people of West Oxfordshire."
Speaking after the referendum vote, he said "fresh leadership" was needed and he would be leaving 10 Downing Street by October.
He said it would be for the new prime minister to carry out negotiations with the EU and invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which would give the UK two years to negotiate its withdrawal.
Boris Johnson, the ex-London mayor and the public face of Vote Leave, is now a front-runner to be the next prime minister.
