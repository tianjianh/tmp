Fish stunning begins in Union Canal at Linlithgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of fish are being stunned in a section of the Union Canal to enable them to be moved before it is partially drained for the first time in 40 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aquatic scientists using electro fishing gear have lifted fish, including pike, perch and eels, from a section of canal in Linlithgow.
The water level of 5km (3 miles) of the canal is to be reduced with 30,000 cubic metres of water drained.
It will allow engineers to carry out a detailed study of embankments.
They will also repair leakages, and remove any obstructions.
The engineering of the 200-year-old canal will also be explored.
On 4 February, visitors will be able to hear from an engineering team about how they are working to safeguard the canal's heritage and take a tour.
The section will be refilled on 16 February.
