Farrell, who led the team to a World Series win in 2013,  said his cancer of the immune system is "very treatable".
Red Sox assistant coach Torey Lovullo will serve as manager while Farrell receives treatment.
Doctors discovered the cancer when Farrell was undergoing hernia surgery earlier this week.
"I can honestly tell you that I'm extremely fortunate that it was found," Farrell said on Friday. "It's localised. It's highly curable."
Farrell started his career as a Major League Baseball pitcher and also served as the manager of the Toronto Blue Jays from 2011 to 2012.
On Friday, Farrell received an outpouring of support from fans and colleagues on social media.
Even the Red Sox's arch-rivals, the New York Yankees tweeted: "Wishing RedSox manager John Farrell a full and speedy recovery."
