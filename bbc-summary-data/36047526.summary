[SN]TITLE[SN]
IPCC to investigate Police Federation fraud allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Allegations of fraudulent activity at the Police Federation of England and Wales are to be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The investigation relates to the alleged transfer of Â£1m to a charitable account connected to the federation.
Three serving police and one retired officer were arrested on suspicion of fraud and released on bail last month.
The IPCC said it will carry out a "thorough independent investigation".
The criminal inquiry was originally launched by Surrey Police, following a report from the federation, which has its headquarters in Leatherhead.
The IPCC said it will also take over the criminal investigation into the allegations.
Those arrested include two serving Metropolitan Police officers, one South Wales Police officer, and a retired Greater Manchester Police officer.
In a statement, the IPCC said its investigators were liaising with Surrey Police about the handover of documentation relating to the case.
IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor said: "We will carry out a thorough independent investigation into these serious allegations.
"The investigation is in its very early stages and we will be working closely with Surrey Police to ensure a smooth handover of the investigative work which has been carried out so far."
The Police Federation - which represents rank and file police officers - has said it is co-operating with the inquiry.
