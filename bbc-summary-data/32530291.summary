[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Greenwood, Green Party candidate, said he was "fed up with the constant sell-off threat" to the woodland.
Conservative's Mark Harper and Liberal Democrat's Chris Coleman agreed the forest should remain publicly-owned.
Labour's Steve Parry-Hearn wanted legal protection while UKIP's Steve Stanbury said it was a "precious resource".
The five parliamentary candidates had been asked about the leasing of forest land when they took part in a BBC Gloucestershire radio debate on Wednesday.
Mr Greenwood referred to a holiday company which he said had been given a 125-year lease for a piece of land.
He said: "We have to see a moratorium on land being disposed in the forest and stop these long leases."
He claimed a lease could be traded and said it was "effectively a sell-off".
Mr Harper said: "It's very important to develop tourism - getting more people to come to the Forest of Dean and spending money and developing local jobs is a very good thing and should be encouraged."
He said the forest should be kept in "public ownership".
Mr Parry-Hearn said he was against long leases adding: "We could find ourselves in a position where there is privatisation because that lease could then be sold on."
Lib Dem Chris Coleman said: "When you're talking about a 125-year lease, that is longer than any of us in this room can imagine - that is a sell-off."
He said he was "wholeheartedly against privatisation".
UKIP's Steve Stanbury said the management of the forest should be "done in a balanced way".
He said: "We need to make sure the business community, on which so many livelihoods depend, is actually engaged and that the forest works for everybody."
The candidates for the constituency are:
Christopher Coleman -  Liberal Democrat
James Greenwood - Green
Mark Harper - Conservative
Steve Parry-Hearn - Labour
Steve Stanbury - UKIP
