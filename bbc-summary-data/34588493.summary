Sheeran visited the Mills Meadow Care Home in Framlingham, Suffolk.
Mills Meadow's home manager, Sue Hill, said: "We are over the moon that Ed could visit us and officially open our new Sheeran Suite.
"Ed is delightful. We are really grateful that he could spare the time in his busy schedule to pop in."
Resident Mary Swan, who helped Sheeran cut the ribbon, said: "It was a very exciting day and I enjoyed meeting Ed. I even got his autograph."
Sheeran toured the home, which features four suites with names chosen by residents.
Care UK handed Sheeran a Â£500 cheque for his chosen charity EACH (East Anglian Children's Hospice).
The singer, who released a 2011 song called Lego House, was also presented with a Lego set by the residents.
