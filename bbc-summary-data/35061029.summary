Sports Direct fail to have Rangers chairman Dave King jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sports Direct have failed in a bid to have Rangers chairman Dave King jailed for breaching a gagging order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But a judge still has to rule whether or not he is in contempt of court for breaching confidentiality undertakings.
Sports Direct allege Mr King did commit a breach during a media interview when he mentioned talks and a meeting about contracts between the firm and club.
Mr Justice Peter Smith is expected to give his full decision at London's Royal Courts of Justice on Friday.
The judge warned Mr King, who was sitting in the back of the court: "I think Mr King should say absolutely nothing (to the press) except how happy he is not to go to prison, and Mr Justice Peter Smith is a fair-minded judge."
The origins of the case go back to the retail agreement which Sports Direct entered into with the club's previous board.
The new board, which was elected earlier this year, has said before that it would like to renegotiate the deal.
Mr Ashley won a court injunction preventing Rangers, and anyone on the new board, from revealing details of the agreement.
Sports Direct alleged that Mr King breached this injunction during an interview he gave to Sky at his home in South Africa.
Mr Justice Smith dismissed the firm's motion that Mr King should be jailed.
