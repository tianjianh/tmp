Dutch Connection, trained by Charlie Hills, made a late challenge in the final couple of furlongs to win ahead of second-favourite Home of the Brave and 13-2 shot Gifted Master.
"He's a world-class jockey and still very young. I think we'll see more of him," Hills told Channel 4 Racing.
"He seems very laid back and he has a good relationship with horses."
McDonald, a New Zealander based in Australia, followed up his victory in the feature race with a second in the Summer Stakes run on 8-1 shot Qewy.
"The track's very tricky," McDonald told BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght.
"The last couple of days I've been studying the map - which way to go. I've got it pretty down pat,"
The Mick Channon-trained Elidor, a 16-1 chance ridden by Silvestre de Sousa, beat McDonald on Qewy to take the Summer Stakes.
Earlier, Adam Kirby was victorious on 8-1 joint-favourite Fire Fighting in the opening race of the day, with Ryan Moore winning the Vintage Stakes on board 6-4 favourite War Decree.
Kirby took his second win of the day on 13-2 shot Boom the Groom in the 16:20BST race, while James Doyle, riding Saeed bin Suroor-trained Best Solution (11-2), won the penultimate race of the day.
The first three home in the final race were all 13-2 joint second-favourites, with Oisin Murphy on Desert Haze leading the way followed by Andrea Atzeni on Haggle and Paul Hanagan on Home Cummins.
Day two's feature race is the Sussex Stakes, which has Â£1m in prize money, with the Aidan O'Brien-trained The Gurkha a 7-4 favourite in a 10-strong field.
