The 34-year-old returned to the Test side for the tour of the West Indies, 18 months after leaving the Ashes tour with a stress-related illness, but managed only 72 runs in six innings.
"This was a tough decision but I don't feel my game is at the level needed to play for England," said Trott.
"I was honoured to come back and play international cricket again and I'm disappointed it didn't work out."
The Warwickshire right-hander scored 3,835 runs in 52 Tests, including a century on his debut in the 2009 Ashes decider.
He played in two more successful Ashes campaigns and was named the International Cricket Council player of the year in 2011.
"I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped me and given me the chance to represent England and to thank supporters for all their backing over the years," added Trott.

"I've had incredible highs and some real lows but wouldn't change a thing."
South Africa-born Trott made his England debut in a Twenty20 international against West Indies in 2007, his first of seven T20s.
But it would be the longer form of the game where he made a real impact, coming into the Test side two years later for the fifth Test against Australia and scoring a second-innings century as the Ashes were regained.
Trott was part of the team that ended a 24-year wait for a win down under in 2010-11 and reached the top of the world Test rankings later that year.
"It has been an absolute honour to play alongside Trotty in every one of his 52 Tests," said England captain Alastair Cook.
"He can be incredibly proud of all he has achieved  and it is no coincidence that his time in international cricket has seen the team achieve some very special things."
Trott left the 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia after the first Test defeat in Brisbane, initially citing a stress-related illness.
A first comeback with Warwickshire was aborted, but a second was sustained and successful, earning him a place on the England Lions tour to South Africa.
He was recalled to the Test side for the tour to the Caribbean, but his return to the highest level was as an opener, rather than his previous position of number three.
Trott made 59 in his third innings back, but only 13 runs in five other knocks, including three ducks.
After both his dismissal in the second-innings and the conclusion of the final Test in Barbados, he waved a goodbye to England's travelling fans.
"To come back from events around the Brisbane Test in 2013 and earn a place back in this side is testament to his character and spirit," added Cook.
"Although things didn't work out as we all hoped on this current tour, he gave absolutely everything every time he wore the cap.
"I speak on behalf of this current team and all those who have shared a dressing room with him over the years when I say it was a privilege to play alongside him."
