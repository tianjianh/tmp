Cornwall foodbank extending opening to three days a week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A foodbank in Cornwall is to increase its opening times to three days a week because demand is so high.

The Camborne, Pool and Redruth Foodbank opens two days but will increase in the new year because so many people "cannot manage", co-ordinator Don Gardner said.
Food for nearly 2,000 meals was given out in a two-hour period in the week, staff said.
Volunteers said the call for food on Thursday was the most demand the service had ever experienced.
The foodbank distributes donated food throughout the year to more than 500 families finding it difficult to afford to buy food.
Mr Gardner said: "When we opened, we only expected it to be here for about two-and-a-half years. It's now nearly four.
"People are just not able to manage, and it's not just those out of work.
"We're getting far more families in now that are working and still can't manage."
The foodbank's Santa's Meal Appeal is aiming to provide about 200 families with a Christmas lunch delivered to their door and ready to cook, as well as distributing more than 1,000 presents.
The Christmas meals are due to be delivered on Sunday and Monday.
At a House of Commons debate on Wednesday, shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said the rising number of people relying on food banks in the UK was a "damning indictment" of the government's record in office.
Labour MPs blamed the increase on the government's welfare reforms but Conservative MPs said the need for foodbanks had been rising for a decade and attributed it to the economic climate after the financial crash when Labour was in power.
