[SN]TITLE[SN]
Devon & Cornwall Police probed over theft suspect death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The way police treated a man who was found dead at his home in Cornwall less than 24 hours after being released from custody is being investigated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Logan Peters was arrested in Plymouth on 7 May on suspicion of criminal damage. He was charged and released but was found dead the next day.
The IPCC will consider a complaint from the 22 year old's family that excessive force was used during the arrest.
IPCC Commissioner Tom Milsom will oversee the investigation.
Mr Milson, who will meet Mr Peters's family as part of the investigation, said: "I would like to assure them that we will look at the force used at arrest and all of the actions and decisions taken in relation to the risk assessments during Logan's time in custody.
"Additionally, we will look at the communication processes between the custody staff, and the period of detention, to determine whether all national and force policies and guidelines were adhered to."
