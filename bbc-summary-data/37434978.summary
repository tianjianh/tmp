Two women killed in Donegal car crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two women, aged 19 and 38, have been killed in a crash in County Donegal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They were fatally injured when the car they were travelling in left the road, collided with a pole and came to a stop in a parking area for trucks outside Ballybofey.
It happened at about 16.15 local time on Wednesday.
The 19-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene, while the second woman was taken to Letterkenny General Hospital, where she was later pronounced dead.
A man in his 40s, who was also in the car, was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
The road between Ballybofey and Logue's Bridge is closed and diversions are in place.
The county has seen a high number of road deaths in recent months - in July five people were killed on the roads within the space of two days.
