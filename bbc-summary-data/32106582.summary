Luis Suarez says Liverpool is the only team he would play for in England if he ever returned to the Premier League.

Suarez left the Reds for Barcelona last summer and was back at Anfield on Sunday for an all-star charity game.
He told Liverpool TV: "You never know in football what the future holds but if I ever play in England again I will play for the Liverpool team and not another team.
"I've missed the fans. They know they are in my heart."
Suarez spent three and a half years with Liverpool and scored 31 times in the Premier League last season as Brendan Rodgers's side finished second to Manchester City.
The Uruguay international, 28, came on as a second-half substitute in the charity match between a Steven Gerrard XI and a team led by ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, which ended in a 2-2 draw.
Gerrard, who is currently serving a three-match ban for his sending-off in Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United a week ago, scored two penalties for his side.
Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli and Chelsea's Didier Drogba had earlier put Carragher's team 2-0 up in the game, which featured six members of Liverpool's 2005 Champions League-winning side.
As well as Gerrard and Carragher, John Arne Riise, Xabi Alonso, Luis Garcia and Harry Kewell also appeared.
Former Arsenal legend Thierry Henry and Chelsea's former England captain John Terry played in the game, which was a sell-out, with funds raised going to the Liverpool FC Foundation, Alder Hey Children's Hospital and other charitable organisations in Liverpool.
Gerrard's XI: Brad Jones, Anthony Gerrard, Glen Johnson, John Terry, John Arne Riise, Kevin Nolan, Steven Gerrard, Xabi Alonso, Ryan Babel, Thierry Henry, Jerome Sinclair. Substitutes: Scott Dann, Ashley Williams, Luis Suarez, Fernando Torres, Charlie Adam, Jay Spearing, Stephen Warnock, Joao Carlos Teixeira.
Carragher's XI: Pepe Reina, Jon Flanagan, Jamie Carragher, Alvaro Arbeloa, Martin Kelly, Harry Kewell, Stewart Downing, Lucas, Jonjo Shelvey, Didier Drogba, Mario Balotelli. Substitutes: Peter Gulacsi, Luis Garcia, Craig Noone, Alberto Moreno, Gael Clichy, Fabio Borini, Craig Bellamy.
