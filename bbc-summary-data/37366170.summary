[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Joe McMinn, 28, was found in a wooded area known as Devil's Den, near the Goodwyns housing estate in Dorking, Surrey, on 28 March.
He had been stabbed repeatedly with a kitchen knife, police said.
Richard Taylor, 21, of no fixed address, appeared before Guildford Crown Court, where he was told he would serve a minimum term of 20 years.
He was arrested after making a 999 call to Surrey Police, during which he admitted to killing Joe, stabbing him in the neck and hiding him in the woods.
Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz said the two men had "a long personal history which dated back over a number of years" and "a mutual dislike of each other".
In a tribute, Mr McMinn's family described their "dear son, brother and uncle" as a "kind man who would go out of his way to help people".
