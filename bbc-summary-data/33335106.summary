Wrexham mental health ward concerns to be investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concerns over standards of care at a second north Wales mental health unit will be "investigated thoroughly", the health board's interim chief has said.

New allegations have emerged about Wrexham Maelor Hospital's Gwanwyn ward following a spot check in December.
Simon Dean said Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board would deal with any cases of mistreatment or abuse "through the proper processes".
This follows the scandal at the Tawel Fan ward, run by the same health board.
There was a damning report written about standards of care at the Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire.
Richard Lumley's father died on the Gwanwyn ward in November after sustaining head injuries.
He said there are many questions still surrounding his father's death which have not been fully investigated by the coroner and claims the hospital still has not completed an internal review.
"I believe, I try to recall now, being told by a member of staff that another patient had been involved in the incident which led to dad's fall," he said.
Mr Lumley said his family is concerned at the lack of communication from the health board.
The  North Wales Community Health Council has also raised concerns that issues on the ward "have been largely ignored".
Mr Dean confirmed he was aware of allegations concerning Gwanwyn ward and said: "I can give a categorical assurance that these will be investigated thoroughly.
"Where any cases of mistreatment or abuse are identified, these will also be dealt with through the proper processes.
"If we are to rebuild trust in our services, it is vital that people know that their concerns will be listened to and acted upon.
"I also want our staff to be confident that we will not allow the reputation of the many who provide high quality and compassionate care to be tarnished by other people's poor conduct."
