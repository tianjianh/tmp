Other offences included coercing a suspect to admit a crime he had not committed, damaging a vehicle while drunk, and the theft of soft drinks.
The figures come from misconduct hearings held between January and November.
The force said 11 other officers received final written warnings.
A further 10 were given standard written warnings, eight received management advice, and three left the force.
Det Ch Supt Tim De Meyer, the head of the force's professional standards department, said it took allegations of misconduct "extremely seriously".
Out of 64 misconduct hearings, 24 resulted in the allegations being found not proven, and in one no further action was taken
Of those remaining, 30 involved constables, five concerned special constables, and four dealt with sergeants.
A spokesman said the force and the Independent Police Complaints Commission deal with more than 1,000 investigations each year, the vast majority of which find that the officer has done nothing wrong.
He said only the most serious matters were referred to misconduct hearings, which are held in public and presided over by independent, legally-qualified chairs.
