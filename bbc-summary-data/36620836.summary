The 20-year-old has not featured for the Seagulls since the end of the 2014-15 campaign, and had spells on loan at Bury and Plymouth Argyle last season.
Walton has won 12 caps for England's Under-19 and Under-20 sides, having come through Plymouth's youth system.
"I am delighted to have signed a player of Christian's quality and pedigree," said Luton boss Nathan Jones.
"I worked close to him at Brighton and I know he has the potential to be a top keeper. It is a real coup for us as he had many options, but he's chosen us as he believes in what we do."
