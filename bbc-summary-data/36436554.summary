Alex Danson believes a strong "mental and psychological edge" will prove invaluable for Great Britain hockey in the build-up to the Rio Olympics.

The Reading striker feels form and results in their current Test series against Netherlands will be key.
The 31-year-old, from Southampton, was part of the first Test win against the Dutch in Amsterdam on Tuesday.
"There's a really strong sense of belief in our squad that we've got an edge," she told BBC Radio Solent.
"To get that, you need to have done it against the best," added Danson, who returned to the GB squad last month following a hand injury.
"We've beaten the Dutch on our last two occasions, so we have that in our mental locker.
"We know on our day we can beat the big teams in the big tournaments."
Great Britain face Netherlands again on Thursday before another meeting in the Champions Trophy at London's Olympic Park later this month, alongside pool matches against Argentina, New Zealand, USA and Australia.
"To an extent, you can't read too much into results before an Olympics," said the 2012 bronze medallist. "But in the back of your mind you know you've done it before and you know you can do it again."
