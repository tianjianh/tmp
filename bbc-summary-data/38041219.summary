Harry Kane is one of the best strikers in the world, says Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino.

Kane scored two late goals for Spurs as they came from behind twice to beat West Ham on Saturday and maintain their unbeaten start to the league season.
The 23-year-old, who missed seven weeks of this season through injury, has five goals in seven club games in 2016-17.
"Harry Kane is always very important, he is our main striker," said Pochettino.
"You miss that type of player when he does not play for 10 or 11 games.
"He is one of the best strikers in the world."
Kane's brace provided a dramatic finish to Saturday's match at White Hart Lane.
West Ham had led twice, through a Michael Antonio header and Manuel Lanzini penalty, either side of Harry Winks' goal for the home side on his Premier League debut.
But, in the final minute, Kane was on hand to finish Son Heung-Min's low cross before scoring the winner from the penalty spot after Son had been tripped by Winston Reid.
It leaves Spurs fifth in the table, three points behind joint leaders Liverpool and Manchester City.
"The table looks much better, we are three points off the top and 12 unbeaten from the beginning," added Pochettino.
England international Kane said: "What a win, it looked like it would be a disappointing afternoon. I thought we had played well and we left it late, what a night, what a performance.
"We wanted to win and give the fans something to cheer about and a lot of them will go home happy."
Tottenham's next game is in the Champions League at Monaco on Tuesday. The London club are currently third in Group D, four points behind the French side and two points and a place behind Bayer Leverkusen with two to play.
"It is an important week and we didn't want to go into that game having lost the first one," added Kane. "It is a must-win game, we're excited, we'll train tomorrow and travel on Monday."
