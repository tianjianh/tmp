Alastair Eykyn: "Wales are traditionally slow starters, but Italy will afford them no wiggle room.
"Captain Alun-Wyn Jones has tasted defeat in Rome, and knows embarrassment lurks just around the corner. Rob Howley has selected the tried and trusted, and now the likes of Sam Warburton, Dan Biggar and George North have to repay his faith.
"If they manage to throw off the shackles and expand their style, it will be a bonus.
"In his first Championship game in charge, Conor O'Shea will have Italy firing on all cylinders.
"They beat the Springboks in November, they have warriors in Sergio Parisse and Lorenzo Cittadini, and an unpredictable magician in Carlo Canna at fly-half."
Italy head coach Conor O'Shea: "We need to concentrate on our performance, be the best Italy possible. Most importantly, [we need to] grant 400 minutes of great performance right to the end of each one of the five matches.
"I look at the bench and think that we really have a good team. Men like Ghiraldini, Furno, Campagnaro, Furno and Minto will be able to have a great impact with their experience."
Wales interim head coach Rob Howley: "We are against a very competitive Italian side away from home in the Six Nations. We have gone with a lot of experience.
"I was just thinking back to when we have started tournaments well and achieved momentum. That's our goal - to go over there and start this tournament well.
"The side that's been selected has about a 70% winning ratio in the Six Nations. They know what winning looks and smells like in the Six Nations, and that's the challenge on Sunday."
