The Humber Bridge, Ferens Art Gallery, Holy Trinity Church and Hull City Hall are among the sights that fill the square spaces on the board.
Six special playing pieces including a toad, a trawler and a Ferris wheel were chosen after a public vote.
Jean Bishop, 94, known as "Bee Lady", is recognised in a Community Chest card, which credits her charity work.

Makers of the board game said it was "a celebration of everything Hull - its rich past, jubilant present and vibrant future".
Benjamin Thompson, custom games executive at Winning Moves UK, said: "The toad is a nod to its cultural side, the trawler - of course - to symbolise its dominant industry. The Ferris wheel represents its fun side. The football and rugby balls are in tribute to its great sporting traditions and even more the unswerving support.
"The crown, perhaps, is a surprise. It came in a distant sixth in the voting, narrowly ahead of a bridge... The crown (or three crowns) is the historic symbol of the city dating back very many centuries.
"We feel these six symbols define the city beautifully and respectfully."
The toad token is a reference to two poems, of the same name, by late poet Phillip Larkin, who was a librarian at the University of Hull.
This is the second time the city has been featured in the famous game.
In 2004, Hull beat off competition from Leeds, Sheffield, and York in a Yorkshire-wide poll to determine which should land its own board.
Other UK cities to get a Monopoly board include Lincoln, Wolverhampton, Stratford-upon-Avon and Oxford.
