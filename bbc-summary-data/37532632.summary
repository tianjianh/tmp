Oxford United 1-3 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon recorded their first-ever win over Oxford with victory at the Kassam Stadium to extend their unbeaten run to five matches in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dons had failed to win in 12 previous attempts against their bogey team, but a stunning first half saw them three goals up at the break.
Tom Elliott headed the visitors in front from close range following a 20th-minute corner which Darius Charles nodded back across goal from the far post.
Liam Sercombe went close to levelling soon after when he shot just wide after a sharp turn.
But Charles scored a spectacular second goal in the 42nd minute, curling the ball into the top corner from 20 yards as Oxford's players protested about what looked like a dangerous tackle on Wes Thomas by Dean Parrett.
Oxford's players were still rattled by that controversial decision when Andy Barcham ran through the middle in first-half stoppage-time and slotted home Jake Reeves' pass under goalkeeper Simon Eastwood.
The hosts pulled a goal back four minutes into the second half when Charles turned Chris Maguire's cross into his own net.
Barry Fuller headed Phil Edwards' effort off the line as the home side tried to come back but they lost Joe Skarz to a shoulder injury, and their second-half fight back petered out.
The win, coupled with MK Dons' defeat by Port Vale, moved Wimbledon up to 10th and above Dons in the league table for the first time in their history.
