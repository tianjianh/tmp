The woman was injured after she slipped and fell near the summit of Goatfell, near Glen Rosa, on Monday afternoon.
Arran Mountain Rescue Team was called out and she was winched to safety by the coastguard search and rescue helicopter at about 16:30.
The rescue team helped the rest of her party down the mountain. The extent of the woman's injuries are not known.
The mountain rescue team said: "The team were called out to a female who had slipped and fallen 100-150 metres, sustaining various injuries, just below the summit of Goatfell.
"Due to her injuries Rescue 999 winched the casualty off the hill and the rest of her party were walked down off Goatfell by team members.
"Our hills are still very much in winter conditions at the moment and we advise anyone venturing to them to have an axe and crampons and adequate winter gear."
