A gun battle is under way at an army camp in Indian-administered Kashmir after three militants forced their way in, military officials say.

The camp is near the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
An army officer told Reuters that the attackers cut through a perimeter fence and entered the Tangdhar camp.
Kashmir is claimed by both nations in its entirety and has been a flashpoint between them for more than 60 years.
Indian news channels reported that fighting was continuing, and the army had launched a counter-offensive to combat the gunmen.
No further details were immediately available.
Last week, fighting in the same district saw an Indian colonel killed in a gun battle with militants, while two soldiers were seriously injured.
