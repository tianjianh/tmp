He became the 21st person to be arrested after the attack, which killed 22 people and injured 116 as they left an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May.
Some 12 have been released without charge. Nine remain in custody.
Earlier another 20-year-old was detained in Manchester, on suspicion of offences against the Terrorism Act.
Attacker Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer just after 22:30 BST.
The blast killed young people attending the event and friends and family who were waiting to meet them.
Abedi was one of three siblings and was born in Manchester to a family of Libyan origin.
His younger brother Hasham, 20, was detained in Tripoli on suspicion of links with the so-called Islamic State group on the same day.
Abedi's older brother Ismail, 24, who was also arrested after the attack, has been released without charge.
Reuters news agency told the BBC that Abedi's father, Ramadan, had also been detained in Libya.
