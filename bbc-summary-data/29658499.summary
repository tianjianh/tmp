Choristers arriving for rehearsal at the West Flanders church were met by a cloud of smoke when they opened the door, Belgium's Nieuwsblad reports.
They were unable to control the fire on Thursday evening with extinguishers.
Emergency services suspect that a heater may have exploded inside the recently renovated church.
Dozens of people were evacuated from the area around the church of St John the Baptist, but were allowed home later on Thursday evening, Nieuwsblad adds.
