Severnside Provisions, of Leeway Industrial Estate, was also ordered to pay £400,000 at the city's crown court on Friday.
Directors Anthony O'Sullivan, 47, and Martin Lincoln, 46, were given 24-week terms after admitting 12 offences.
An investigation was launched in December 2013.
In a statement, Newport city council said the pair were warned in 2010 that their company was not permitted to carry out turkey processing.
However, it said records showed that large quantities of meat was sold by Severnside Provisions in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
After an investigation started, environmental health officers found large quantities of turkey defrosting outside in dirty water and being processed in a garage in "unhygienic conditions".
Items seized were destroyed but the Food Standards Agency launched a national recall after finding turkeys had already been sold to butchers' shops and restaurants.
The council said O'Sullivan and Lincoln had admitted 12 food hygiene offences, including that they sold food that was unsafe and failed to keep equipment clean.
As well as being jailed, the two directors were ordered to pay a confiscation award of £271,815 under the Proceeds of Crime Act and council costs of £35,185.
The company was also fined £100,000.
Newport councillor Bob Poole said: "This company was putting people's health at serious risk for the sake of profit."
