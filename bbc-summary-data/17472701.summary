The last remaining block of a housing estate known as the Billybanks, which has been derelict for almost a decade, will finally be demolished next month.

Flats at the old Penarth Heights estate in the Vale of Glamorgan will be flattened to make way for a new development.
The site, which has sweeping views of Cardiff Bay, has become a target for vandals and squatters.
The new housing development is expected to be completed by 2017.
Developer Crest Nicholson said the demolition will take 20 weeks.
Managing director Tim Beale said: "Every effort will be made to ensure the demolition is undertaken in a manner that minimises disruption to the local community."
The estate was a bustling community in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and will now be replaced by more than 370 town houses.
It was once voted Wales' ugliest eyesore, and has been a target for arsonists and vandals in recent years.
Leader of the council Gordon Kemp said the new development will "enhance" that area of Penarth.
"The Billybanks was an award-winning development, but times have moved on," he said.
"I think it will be a very good thing for thing for the town."
