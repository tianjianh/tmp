The PC was breaking up a brawl on 31 August in Elgin Crescent when the youth lashed out with the drawn knife.
At Wimbledon Youth Court, the teenager pleaded guilty to wounding and possession of a knife with intent to cause threats and violence.
Police arrested a total of 67 people for having weapons at the carnival.
The PC, from Catford Police Station, had to have stitches in the 1in (3cm) deep wound in his arm.
Det Supt Raffaele D'Orsi, from Kensington and Chelsea Police, said the case showed the dangers police face.
"I am thankful that his injury was not life-threatening," he said.
