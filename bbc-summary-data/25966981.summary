The 40-year-old spent the majority of his 19-year playing career at Canterbury before moving to Essex at the end of the 2008 campaign.
Walker, who was appointed as assistant to Essex head coach Paul Grayson at the end of 2011, is replaced by Chris Silverwood at Chelmsford.
"I am delighted to be returning to my roots," Walker told the Kent website.
"I cannot wait to get back to Kent and get started in helping the club deliver some on-field success.
"I would like to thank everyone at Essex for the support they have given me and I wish them well for the future.
"A return to my home club is something I hoped for and I aim to help a talented group of players deliver what they are capable of."
Grayson said it was "hugely disappointing" to see Walker, who scored 12,197 first-class runs at an average of 36.08 during his career, leave Essex.
"He is an excellent coach," he added.
"He is a super bloke and we've enjoyed him as both a player and also coach in the last two years. We completely understand his reasons for going.
"He's going to leave us with a lot of memories and will be missed but we wish him all the best in his new career."
Meanwhile Kent have appointed Dan George as first-team physio, Michael Najdan as analyst and Jon Fortescue as strength and conditioning coach.
