[SN]TITLE[SN]
Red light camera on Luas line in Dublin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An automated camera system targeting motorists who break traffic lights has been introduced at one of the busiest junctions on Dublin's tram line.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The camera has gone into operation at the Blackhall Place-Benburb Street junction on the Luas red line.
Motorists breaking a red light will automatically receive three penalty points and a fine of up to 120 euros (Â£88).
Penalty points will increase to five if there is a court conviction.
The first such system in Ireland has been introduced in response to the large number of collisions between road vehicles and trams at the junction.
Since the Luas went into operation in 2004 there have been 338 collisions between trams and vehicles and 95% have occurred on the red line, which serves Saggart and Tallaght to the city centre.
One of the worst junctions for collisions was identified as the Blackhall Place-Benburb Street junction in Dublin 7.
It is understood the system could be rolled out to other junctions.
