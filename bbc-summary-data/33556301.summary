Eileen Swannack, 73, and her partner John Welch, 74, were among 30 British tourists killed in Sousse on 26 June.
The Wiltshire couple had been together for eight years and had visited the country annually since 2011.
Her family paid tribute saying she "had a heart of gold and was always first to offer help to others".
Mrs Swannack, who was one of five siblings, moved to the village of Biddestone with her husband Eddie in the 1960s.
She met Mr Welch, a former plumber from Corsham, having been widowed in 2005.
"John Welch had become her close companion and the couple enjoyed holidaying together," her family said.
"They had visited Sousse, in Tunisia, for the preceding four years, loving the resort and sunshine."
Brought up in Bristol, Mrs Swannack worked in the stores at the Westinghouse in Chippenham before taking a job at a local pub.
"Eileen was always full of energy. She exuded youthfulness and had a real sense of fun and mischief," her family said.
"She played an important role in the lives of all who knew her."
Following her funeral at St Nicholas' Church in Biddestone, her family thanked family and friends for helping them "get through this incredibly difficult time".
They also thanked the team at RAF Brize Norton, Thomson Holidays and the Counter Terrorism Unit among others, for bending over backwards to "make the difficult process as trouble free as possible".
"We offer our particular thanks to the professional way that Eileen was repatriated back into the UK with compassion, professionalism, dignity and care. This has been of utmost comfort to us," they said.
Mr Welch's funeral is likely to take place next week, the BBC understands.
