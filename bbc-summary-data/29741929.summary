A dog was shot through the skull with a bolt from a crossbow which "narrowly" missed his brain and eyes.

The Staffordshire bull terrier was found in remote woodland near Wansford, Peterborough on Wednesday morning. It is thought he was left roaming with the bolt stuck in his head for a few days.
The 50cm weapon had gone through one side of his head and out the other.
An RSPCA spokesman said: "Whoever did this took a very intentional shot at very close range."
The dog, called Ziggy, is now recovering from surgery.
The vet who removed the bolt said the weapon had "deflected off the skull and missed Ziggy's organs by mere millimetres".
He said it was too early to speculate on the recovery from his ordeal and operation and his progress was being closely monitored.
RSPCA inspector Justin Stubbs said: "I think they must have been aiming at the back of the head and Ziggy must have moved at just the right distance right at the last minute."
He said it was likely the dog had been "roaming about in the middle of nowhere for a couple of days with this bolt stuck in his head, terrified and in complete agony" before being spotted by two walkers.
"It really broke my heart this one," Mr Stubbs said.
"What really got me was the way Ziggy sat there, with that bolt through his head, wagging his tail at me in such a good-natured way asking for a bit of a fuss."
The RSPCA has appealed for information about the attack.
