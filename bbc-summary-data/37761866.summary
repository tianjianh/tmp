Isabella Jackson is also accused of claiming there were bombs planted at two US embassies and sparking a bomb scare at Harrods in London.
Some of the email threats allegedly made by the pensioner, from Buckhaven, Fife, were investigated by GCHQ intelligence analysts.
Sheriff Jamie Gilchrist QC set a trial date in December.
Ms Jackson faces a total of five charges of threatening and abusive behaviour under the Communications Act.
She is alleged to have made death threats against Mrs May - then the Home Secretary - in November 2014.
The charge states that on 24 November 2014 she behaved in a threatening and abusive manner likely to cause fear or alarm at her home or at the Palace of Westminster, and threatened to kill the politician.
A second charge alleges that on the same day at her home or at the GCHQ in Cheltenham she threatened to kill Mrs May.
Ms Jackson is further alleged to have sent communications by email to the US embassies in London and Paris with the intent of inducing the false belief that bombs were present at the embassies.
Those offences are said to have happened between 13 December 2014 and 7 January 2015 at her home and GCHQ.
A fourth charge alleges she sent a message to Fife Council between 30 August and 10 September 2015 stating that a Susan Johnston had died, causing her annoyance, inconvenience and needless anxiety.
The fifth and final charge alleges that on 14 September 2015, Ms Jackson communicated by email with the intent of inducing the belief that there was a bomb at Harrods in Knightsbridge, London.
