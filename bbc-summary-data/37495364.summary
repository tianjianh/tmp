Roper, 29, spent six years with Rochdale before joining Oldham in 2015, where he won promotion to the Championship that same season.
This year he was in the Roughyeds side that beat Hull KR in the Challenge Cup, before returning to help the Hornets to League One promotion in July.
"He's the type of player we need," said new head coach Carl Forster.
Haven were relegated from the second tier at the end of the 2016 season.
