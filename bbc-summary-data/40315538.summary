Barry Middleton converted Harry Martin's ball before Christopher Griffiths added the second inside eight minutes later when he tapped in.
Malaysia made it 2-2 with goals from Faizal Saari and Tengku Tajuddin.
Samuel Ward and Mark Gleghorne scored two each, and Middleton struck again in a superb win, with Saari scoring late.
Middleton - England's most capped player - took his goal tally for his country and Great Britain up to 109.
Later on Saturday, Scotland were beaten 3-0 by Pool B leaders the Netherlands.
Goals from Robbert Kemperman, Mink van der Weerden and Valentin Verga leave Scotland fourth, level on points but with a superior goal difference over bottom side Pakistan, who they play next on Monday.
England's next match is against Argentina on Sunday. They both have a maximum six points from their two games, but England lead Pool A on goal difference.
As well as attempting to reach the World League Finals later in the year, the top five teams qualify for the 2018 World Cup in India.
