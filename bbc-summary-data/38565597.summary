[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Non-league Lincoln City reached the FA Cup fourth round for the first time in 41 years as Nathan Arnold's injury-time strike secured a deserved victory over Ipswich at Sincil Bank.

Arnold fired home in the first of four added minutes to secure a famous triumph against the Championship side.
The Imps were dominant throughout and a bigger margin of victory against a team 59 places higher in the league pyramid would not have flattered them.
They now host Brighton in round four.
After twice coming from behind at Portman Road to earn a replay in the first meeting, Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy promised his side had noted the lessons of that scare.
But if they had learned anything, his players were unable to put it into practice, managing just one decent attempt on the Lincoln goal in 90 uninspiring minutes.
Graham Taylor was in charge of Lincoln the last time they reached the fourth round, so it was fitting the National League leaders matched that achievement on the night the club paid tribute to their former manager.
Lincoln's run in the cup was just one highlight among many during Taylor's managerial reign between 1972 and 1977, which was followed by successful spells at Watford and Aston Villa before landing the England job in 1990.
A minute's applause was held before kick-off in memory of Taylor, who died on 12 January at the age of 72, and he was remembered again later in the match with more applause and a show of lights from fans in the stands.
But far and away the best tribute was saved until the end when Lincoln substitute Adam Marriott's pass sent Arnold sprinting clear of the Ipswich defence and he rounded the goalkeeper before knocking the ball into an empty net.
Former Ipswich defender Terry Butcher, who was at Sincil Bank for BBC Sport, did not hold back in his criticism of his old club.
"I can't remember ever being so embarrassed and humiliated as an Ipswich fan," he told BBC Radio 5 live. "Ipswich lost the wrong way, not enough fight, not enough passion.
"I am bitterly disappointed. Over the 180 minutes Lincoln have been by far the better team, it wasn't a fluke.
This was a mid-table Championship side totally - and I mean totally - outplayed over two games
"When you lose like that then Mick McCarthy will be concerned, but the club won't have any knee-jerk reactions."
The margin of defeat could certainly have been greater but for a brilliant first-half save by Ipswich goalkeeper Dean Gerken, who stuck out a hand to somehow claw away Luke Waterfall's close-range header on the stroke of half-time.
Danny Cowley's side put Ipswich's back line under pressure with a barrage of crosses, with burly striker Matt Rhead spurning one opening and midfielder Alex Woodyard heading a very presentable chance wide when unmarked.
Ipswich's best opening came with a low Josh Emmanuel shot just before the hour, but Imps goalkeeper Paul Farman was always behind it and made a good save.
Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy: "I should congratulate Lincoln. They deserved to win. From my point of view the way we lost the game was ridiculous. We had a chance to score ourselves and then seconds later they scored.
"On the back of the performance on Saturday it was surprising how we played tonight. They controlled the game but I'm not going to stand here and give my team stick.
"The fans want to see these upsets. It's great for TV but not for me unfortunately. The fans made their thoughts quite clear tonight. I'm not happy about producing that kind of football in front of the fans."
Lincoln City's manager Danny Cowley: "The way they've worked day in, day out, is incredible. You can have great days like this if you put so much work in like we have.
"I thought we competed really well and worked every minute so hard. We pressed from the front and actually thought we had great control in the game even against a Championship side like Ipswich.
"What a brilliant finish from Nathan. Not an easy finish when the whole of Sincil Bank is hoping he sticks it in. It's a great night and an amazing feeling for the club."
