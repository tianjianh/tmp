The first of the eight-book series, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4, was published in 1982.
Mrs Townsend died at home in Leicester on Thursday after a short illness.
Chief executive of Leicester's Curve theatre, Fiona Allen, said staging the show early next year would be an "amazing tribute" to her.
Mrs Townsend, 68, was born in Leicester in 1946, and set her most famous work in her home city.
Ms Allen said they had been working on the musical for the "past couple of years".
"It's been commissioned, it's written," she added. "It has a producer and director and she really was working as the lead creative on this project.
"Obviously we need to be sensitive to timings but the project will go ahead.
"We are looking at spring next year and that would be an amazing tribute to the woman."
In 2009, Mrs Townsend was given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester.
