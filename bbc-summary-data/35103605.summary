Gus Hodgetts, Greg Davis, Scott Ruderham and Cyril Renouf beat a Scotland side including Commonwealth Games gold medallists Paul Foster and Alex Marshall 15-14 in the final.
The victory also earned Jersey a place at next year's World Championships in New Zealand.
"To get into a medal play-off is an achievement in itself, to win gold in the absolute optimum," Hodgetts said.
"We beat Wales and England in the groups and we beat Ireland in the semis and Scotland in the final, so to beat the four British Isles is a big deal," he told BBC Sport.
Jersey held a four-shot advantage going into the last end of their final in Cyprus and narrowly held on to take the title.
