The recommendations have been made because some children in England as young as five, have decayed, missing and filled teeth.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, say that teeth brushing in school should take place in certain areas with high levels of tooth decay.
They also say free toothbrushes and toothpaste should be handed out for use at school and at home in these areas.
