Officials of Wrexham FC have responded to criticism by fans over a plan for players to train on a council playing field next season.

Last year the club left its former Colliers' Park training ground at Gresford, opened ten years ago at a cost of Â£750,000.
The facility was taken over by Glyndwr University in 2011 and Wrexham were unable to reach a deal to stay.
The club is now preparing to lease Wrexham Council's Nine Acres site.
The Wrexham players have been training at the Stansty Park ground of Welsh National League side Lex Glyndwr, less than a mile from Wrexham's Racecourse stadium, this season.
Now the club is preparing to lease Wrexham Council's Nine Acres - and the move has divided supporters.
Television reporter Bryn Law, who resigned earlier this year as president of Wrexham Supporters' Trust, said he recognised the club's situation, but  "lamented" the loss of the Colliers' Park training ground.  "It's a first class facility - the envy of many bigger clubs," he wrote on social media.
"From owning this to asking permission to use a field in Wrexham? I'm angry right now. I think we're at the jumpers for goalposts stage now, sadly."
However, club director Spencer Harris said he hoped the club would be able to lease the council site for a nominal rent. "We realise that the Colliers Park facility was dear to many people's hearts, but we haven't owned the site for seven years," he told the Wrexham leader.
"We've now got to make the best of the situation and move forward.  We're happy that Nine Acres is a good site and we will be developing the pitches there to a high standard suitable for a professional football club."
