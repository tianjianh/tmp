MH17 plane crash is 'defining moment' for Russia, says PM

David Cameron has said the Malaysia Airlines crash in east Ukraine is a "defining moment" for Russia.

Some 298 people died, including 10 Britons, when flight MH17 crashed in a pro-Russian rebel-held area last week.
The PM said Moscow was fuelling the Ukraine conflict by arming the rebels, who are accused of downing the jet.
He said it was unlikely the plane was shot deliberately - but warned of "hard-hitting" sanctions if Moscow did not change course on Ukraine.
Mr Cameron said there was "anger" at what had happened and urged Moscow to stop training separatists and supplying them with weapons.
The UK is set to push for increased sanctions against Russia at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, rebels in eastern Ukraine have handed over two flight-data recorders from the downed plane to Malaysian experts.
And a train carrying bodies from the crash site left a station at nearby Torez for the city of Kharkiv.
Mr Cameron called for "unfettered access" to the crash site for international investigators and for bodies to be repatriated.
Addressing MPs in the Commons, the prime minister said: "The context for this tragedy is Russia's attempt to destabilise a sovereign state, violate its territorial integrity and arm and train thuggish militias."
He said the "weight of evidence" pointed to the jet being shot by a missile fired by pro-Russian separatists and that "a conflict that could have been curtailed by Moscow, has instead been fomented by Moscow".
He said: "President Putin faces a clear choice in how he decides to respond to this appalling tragedy. I hope he will use this moment to find a path out of this festering and dangerous crisis by ending Russia's support for the separatists.
"If he does not change his approach to Ukraine in this then Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia."
Mr Cameron said the rest of the European Union could no longer "turn a blind eye" to the crisis.
If Moscow does not "change course", he said: "Russia cannot expect to continue enjoying access to European markets, European capital, European knowledge and technical expertise while she fuels conflict in one of Europe's neighbours."
Deputising for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has been meeting President Barack Obama in the United States, Harriet Harman, the party's deputy leader, said: "The evidence is growing that this was not simply a tragedy but a terrible crime."
Calling it a "moment of reckoning for Europe", she added: "Europe must show its sorrow but it must also show its strength."
And later Mr Miliband said: "I'm afraid what's been done so far has been proved to be inadequate.  And I think that we need to show and follow the lead that has been taken by President Obama, and Europe needs to step up."
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that the EU had so far failed to "act with the right collective resolve", but that there was "a change of mood" on sanctions.
In other developments:
Relatives of some of the UK passengers have called for their bodies to be returned home.
Jordan Withers, nephew of Glenn Thomas - who was among the 10 Britons on board - said the bodies of victims had been treated "inhumanely".
Barry Sweeney, whose son Liam was also on board, told ITV's Good Morning Britain he hoped the 28-year-old was in a body bag, "because I don't want him to be lying there somewhere where there's nobody there to give him a good cuddle, you know".
A memorial service was held at St James' Park football ground earlier in honour of Liam Sweeney and fellow fan John Alder, who also died in the crash.
They had been travelling to New Zealand to watch the team.
The informal service, which included a poem to the fans, ended with a minute's applause. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has already said the forthcoming season will be dedicated to the pair.
