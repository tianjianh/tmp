PC Lisa Bates suffered a fractured skull, broken leg and lost a finger when she responded to an incident in Sheffield on 13 April.
Colleagues said they were "moved" by the support for Ms Bates, including online donations of more than Â£7,500.
Four other officers were also injured during the incident.
Nathan Sumner, 35, of Plowright Close, Sheffield, has been charged with attempted murder and 12 other offences in relation to the incident.
Sheffield South West Local Policing Team said officers were grateful for the "extraordinary outpouring of good wishes and sympathy" following the attack in Gleadless.
"We have been very moved by the support from the community, not only in Gleadless but across the city and we are very grateful for all the cards, flowers and donations that have been sent to our friend Lisa who is currently recovering well in hospital," they added.
Officers also paid tribute to the "brave actions" of eyewitness Simon Ellis who went to the aid of Ms Bates.
Mr Sumner is due to appear at Sheffield Crown Court on 13 May.
