Head coach Philippe Montanier has said Nottingham Forest's second-half display against Derby County was poor in so many areas of the pitch.

The Reds were only a goal down at half-time, but were run ragged after the break as Derby strolled to a 3-0 win.
Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham: "The first half was decent but the second half was very poor, technically, tactically and physically.
"When we play Derby we have to show another level, it's a disappointment."
Forest went into the game on a three-match winning streak, including the previous week's 2-1 victory over Championship leaders Newcastle United.
However, Derby were on a five-match winning run and they made is six with considerable ease thanks to Nicklas Bendtner's own goal and strikes from Tom Ince and Will Hughes.
"A derby is a very important game," continued Montanier. "It's a big disappointment for our fans as it is a game for our fans.
"We lacked everything, especially passion but technically too. We didn't play as a unit.
"For me, I just can't understand why we play such a poor second half."
