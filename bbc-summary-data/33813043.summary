The National Eisteddfod is considering scrapping the traditional Maes when the event visits Cardiff in 2018.

Chief executive Elfed Roberts said the organisation was in discussions about holding the cultural festival in buildings around the city centre, rather than on a temporary site.
Talks are ongoing with Cardiff council, with a final decision due in November.
The Maes is home to the pink pavilion and shops, performing spaces, art exhibition and food outlets.
"It's never been done before, though it has been mooted before by a number of people," Mr Roberts said.
"I think Cardiff is the best place to try and do it, and you can never tell until you try it, so we'll have a go."
The National Eisteddfod is not thought to be considering ditching the Maes permanently after its visit to Cardiff in 2018.
Mr Roberts said the eisteddfod had introduced a number of changes to the event in recent years and it was important to keep reviewing it.
"It would be the end of the festival if we started thinking 'we've arrived' and we don't have to do anything else," he added.
