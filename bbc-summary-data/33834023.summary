Police, fire and ambulance crews were called to the river near The Myrke at 19:00 BST on Friday.
South Central Ambulance Service said another man was taken to Wexham Park Hospital suffering the effects of cold.
Police warned anyone looking for the missing man not to enter the water as they could also be in danger.
Supt Kate Ford of Thames Valley Police said: "They should search from the bank only and, if they see anything they think is significant, they should speak to a police officer at the scene."
An ambulance service spokeswoman said: "We were called at 19:02 to reports of people in the water at Jubilee River.
"We sent two ambulance crews, an ambulance officer and Thames Valley Air Ambulance."
