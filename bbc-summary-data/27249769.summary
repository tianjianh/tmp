Learco Chindamo, 33, was 15 years old when he murdered the father of four outside St George's School in Maida Vale, north west London, in 1995.
The 48-year-old teacher had gone to the aid of a 13-year-old boy who was being attacked when he was fatally stabbed.
"We can confirm a three-member panel of the board has directed the release," a Parole Board spokesman said.
"The decision to release is a matter for the board, which is independent. Practical arrangements for the release are a matter for the Secretary of State. We are unable to comment further on the details of this case."
Chindamo stabbed Mr Lawrence through the heart following a stand-off at the school's gates on 8 December 1995.
A feared gang member, the Italian-born teenager was jailed indefinitely following his conviction at the Old Bailey.
He served 15 years and was paroled in 2010 but was recalled later the same year amid accusations he had intimidated and robbed a man at a cash machine. He was later acquitted by a jury.
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: "The re-release of life sentenced offenders is directed by the independent Parole Board once the board are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community.
"Their life licence lasts for the rest of their lives, and they may be recalled to prison at any time for breaching their licence conditions.
"Additionally, they will be subject to strict controls and restrictions for as long as their risk requires them."
The news comes just days after teacher Ann Maguire was killed in front of her pupils at Corpus Christi College in Leeds.
