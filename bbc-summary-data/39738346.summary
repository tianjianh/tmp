[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Moffat, of Hopeman, Moray, began abusing the girl when she was just four years old.
The judge told him "no child should have to undergo" the ordeal she went through.
The 30-year-old denied the charges but was found guilty after a trial of raping and sexually abusing the child between January 2014 and May 2015.
The crimes happened at an address in Kinloss, Moray.
Lord Matthews told Moffat the victim had been "an innocent wee girl".
He said: "No child should have to undergo not only the abuse, but also the confusing emotions that sort of conduct engenders."
Moffat will be supervised for two years on his release. He will also be on the sex offenders list indefinitely.
