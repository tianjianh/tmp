Smoke from the site has not yet fully dispersed and may still be visible, Vale of Glamorgan council said.
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service has declared the incident closed, with all local roads now reopened.
The blaze at the Siteserv plant on the Llandow Industrial Estate started on 2 March, with five engines sent to tackle the fire.
The plant had its licence suspended by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) on 6 March, but the suspension has now been partially lifted for some waste to be accepted at the site.
NRW said they were launching a full investigation into the fire.
Nadia De Longhi, NRW operations manager, said "regulatory controls remain in place" at the site.
She added: "We will now undertake a full investigation, in cooperation with South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, and consider any appropriate enforcement action."
Acrid smoke from the fire reached as far as Bridgend, Barry and Cowbridge, with residents advised at the time to keep their windows closed.
