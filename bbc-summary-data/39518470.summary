[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohammed Syadul Hussain, 25, was found guilty of assisting Mohammed Kadir, who is suspected of murdering Koran teacher Jalal Uddin in Rochdale before fleeing to Syria.
Mr Uddin, 71, was bludgeoned in the face in an attack in a children's play area in February 2016.
Hussain, of Oswald Street, Rochdale, was jailed for five years at Manchester Crown Court, Crown Square on Thursday.
Last year, Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 21, also from the town, was convicted of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years.
He drove Mr Kadir, suspected of striking the fatal blows that killed the the imam, to the park before the attack.
The pair were said to have been consumed by hatred of Mr Uddin because he practised a form of Islamic healing in Rochdale's Bangladeshi community which the so-called Islamic State (IS) considers "black magic".
Mr Kadir, of Chamber Road, Oldham, has left the UK and is thought to be in Syria.
In the hours following Mr Uddin's murder, Hussain "openly expressed his approval" of the imam's death on WhatsApp, Greater Manchester Police said.
He later spoke on the phone with the alleged murderer Mr Kadir, who was his friend, before meeting with him and Syeedy early the following day.
This "placed him in the company of the two men responsible mere hours after the murder", police said.
Hussain then withdrew Â£700 from his bank and gave it to Mr Kadir two days after the murder.
Det Ch Insp John Harris said: "Not only did he not come forward and assist the police, but he actively sought to impede the investigation by helping the man believed to be responsible to flee the country."
