The Welsh Government is consulting on two options to tackle congestion on the A494 and A55 around Queensferry and Deeside in Flintshire.
The blue route would change existing roads which residents have said would create noise and affect local routes.
The red option is to build a new link to the A55 at Northop which one farmer has said would spoil the countryside.
Northop farmer Robert Hodgkinson said: "The countryside can't speak for itself and there are very few to speak for it.
"We are told to protect the countryside so it is wrong that this countryside is lost."
A group of residents opposed to the blue route plans claimed the red route would affect fewer people.
A494 News Forum community group chairwoman Sue Clamp said it was unfair the blue route was being considered as similar options were rejected at a public inquiry in 2008 following a campaign by residents.
"People are asking why this has come up again," she said.
A public meeting is being held at St David's Hotel in Ewloe on Monday from 19:00 BST by the A494 News Forum group which is open to anyone.
The government consultation is open until June.
