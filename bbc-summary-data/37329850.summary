[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City's board has undergone a reshuffle following the club's American takeover.

Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan led a consortium which bought a 68% controlling stake in the Swans in July.
American investors Robert Hernreich and Romie Chaudhari join as directors, while Leigh Dineen leaves the board despite remaining vice-chairman.
Brian Katzen has resigned having sold the 21.1% share he held with business partner Jeffrey Crevoiserat.
John van Zweden is another to step down from the board having sold his 5.3% stake in full.
The other long-term directors who have left are Steve Penny, Gwilym Joseph and Don Keefe, though none of those three were shareholders.
Club accountant Gareth Davies has been appointed secretary, while Huw Cooze remains in his role as the Supporters' Trust's board representative.

Like Kaplan, Hernreich and Chaudhari are both from investment firm backgrounds.
Hernreich is also a former co-owner of Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball team the Texas Rangers.
They are understood to have relatively small shareholdings, with Levien and Kaplan holding the vast majority of the consortium's 68% controlling stake.
Swansea are the only Premier League club with a fan's representative on its board, and the Supporters' Trust has previously suggested it would consider requesting a second board member.
The Trust has met with Levien and Kaplan on several occasions and has retained its 21.1% stake in the club.
