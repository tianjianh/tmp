Woods had spent all of his career in English football prior to heading for the Highlands last summer.
Having started as a trainee at Leeds, he spent seven years at Doncaster.
He also briefly had a spell in the Premiership under Mick McCarthy at Sunderland, alongside Liam Lawrence, now Shrewsbury's captain.
Woods also played for Hartlepool (loan), Rotherham United, Yeovil Town, and Barnsley, where he first encountered Town boss Micky Mellon, who was assistant manager at Oakwell.
"I spoke to the manager a couple of weeks ago and he was quick to get things sorted," said Woods.
"He's very infectious and good to have around, and I also spoke to Liam Lawrence too. I played at both Sunderland and Barnsley with him.
"I really like playing in England. That was something I was after over the summer, although I've really enjoyed this season at Ross."
