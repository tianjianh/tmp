[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Yorkshire Police investigated by IPCC over Scarborough death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police watchdog is investigating the response by North Yorkshire Police to concerns about the welfare of a man who was later found dead in a lake.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gavin Francis Egan was found in the lake at Peasholm Park, Scarborough, at about 11:30 GMT on 24 February.
The IPCC investigation regards the actions taken by the force in response to information from the ambulance service.
The force said it was "inappropriate to comment" on the investigation.
North Yorkshire Police referred this incident to the IPCC, the statement added.
Police had been told by the Yorkshire Ambulance Service at 04:00 of a telephone call from a member of the public saying a man had been pulled from the lake, said the IPCC.
It seems the man reportedly pulled from the lake was not found by the ambulance service or police until later that day, it added.
Tom Milsom, of the IPCC, said: "Our investigation will examine how North Yorkshire Police responded to the report by the ambulance service to determine whether the appropriate action was taken."
Investigators want to hear from witnesses who saw or heard anyone in the lake or the subsequent police search in the park between 04:00 and 11:30 on Wednesday 24 February.
