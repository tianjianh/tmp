[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 1-1 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New boss Russell Slade was denied his first win as Coventry boss by a last-gasp leveller at Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The struggling Sky Blues were on course for victory after skipper Jordan Willis converted a Chris McCann cross in the 19th minute.
While that effort did prove enough to snap a run of seven successive League One defeats, Michael Bostwick's dramatic equaliser denied Slade's side victory.
The hosts had been way below par in a game of very few chances. It took until the second minute of the second half for them to test Coventry keeper Lee Burge, who kept out a Lee Angol header.
Burge then saved a 25-yard rocket from Marcus Maddison before a brilliant block prevented Bostwick from slamming in the rebound.
Burge also held a late Ryan Tafazolli effort in a scramble before Bostwick headed in Maddison's cross to rescue Posh a point in the third minute of added time.
