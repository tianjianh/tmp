[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simpson, 28, could face jail after being found guilty of assaulting his ex-girlfriend at a house in Worsley.
A Foxes statement read: "He'll not be considered for first-team duties while the club examines legal proceedings.
"Due to the ongoing nature of the legal process, the club will be making no further comment on the matter."
The former Manchester United player, who denied the charge, was arrested on 29 December after police were called to reports of a row.
In a statement released to the Manchester Evening News, Simpson said he was "shocked" at the verdict and intended to appeal.
Manchester Magistrates Court heard Simpson was found with his "hands around the throat" of his ex-partner at a house in Worsley, Greater Manchester.
Former Newcastle and QPR full-back Simpson, from Eccles, Greater Manchester, will be sentenced next month.
