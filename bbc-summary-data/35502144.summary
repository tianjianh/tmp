Six Nations 2016: 'England will try to bully Scotland'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul Grayson believes England will look to "bully" Scotland in the Six Nations opener at Murrayfield on Saturday.

The former England fly-half says despite suggestions of a change in style, the English will play to their traditional strengths.
"Parity in the scrum for Scotland should see England have to play away from the scrum a little bit."
"But ultimately, despite all the talk about change, England will try to bully Scotland," Grayson said.
The Scots have not beaten England since 2008, and have won only one opening fixture in 16 seasons of Six Nations rugby.
They did show signs of improvement at last year's World Cup, however, where they fell agonisingly short of a momentous quarter-final upset against Australia.
Grayson, who won 32 caps between 1995 and 2004, says England will be expecting a tougher test than they have received against Scotland for several years.
"Scotland have shown in the World Cup and the work they've done under Vern Cotter it's not smoke and mirrors," the former Northampton Saints man told BBC Scotland.
"They've got a very good squad. They've got young players that are playing together and winning together with Glasgow's success in the Pro12.
"So it is a credible threat from Scotland, it's not just a war of words. England will be nervous."
