The 28-year-old joined from Millwall on a month-long loan earlier this month and received an ovation when replaced on his home debut against Morecambe.
"I'm not used to that, having played at Millwall," Martin told BBC Northampton.
"I maybe wasn't a fans' favourite put it that way, but it was really nice and something that I haven't been used to for a while, to just go out and play."
Northampton are currently two points clear at the top of League Two, with a game in hand on nearest rivals Plymouth.
Martin started his career at Manchester United and had made 11 appearances for League One Millwall before making the move to Sixfields.
"I've had a bit of pressure on my back being out of the team at Millwall and struggled a little bit, so I'm just happy to finally get back playing football," he added.
"They're a great bunch of lads here and I think that helps - team spirit's massive and sometimes smaller squads prosper from it."
