Nick Alexander, 35, of Colchester, Essex, was killed at the Bataclan concert hall where he was selling merchandise.
The service was held at St Andrew's Church in Weeley, which he had attended since he was a child and last visited a few weeks before he died.
He was one of 130 people killed in the attacks on 13 November.
His parents Barry and Sheelagh Alexander led mourners at the funeral, along with their daughter Zoe Alexander.
The service included the song Across the Universe by The Beatles.
Reverend David Newman, who conducted the service, said the family has shown "considerable strength" and "great dignity".
"They have become very aware of the suffering of others especially those whose families are mourning those who died along with Nick," he said.
Updates on this story and more from Essex
Mr Alexander was selling T-shirts for the band Eagles of Death Metal when he was shot in the concert hall, where 89 people died. It was one of a series of co-ordinated attacks by gunmen across the city.
An inquest heard he died from gunshot wounds to his stomach and chest.
An online fundraising page for Mr Alexander's family has raised more than Â£70,000.
In a message posted on the page, his sister said the family were "truly overwhelmed" by the "unbelievable support" they have been shown from across the world.
"We knew Nick had a lot of friends and had touched a lot of lives but we had no idea quite how many," Ms Alexander said.
"To see donations from people who never met Nick but have been touched by his story alongside those from friends and colleagues in the music world is unbelievably touching and we cannot thank you enough for your kindness and support."
She said the family is setting up a charitable trust in her brother's name, with the money used to cover funeral costs and the remainder to be held in the trust.
