The cheeky wild monkeys on Gibraltar are having a bit of an argument with the people living there.
The animals are very smart and often steal food when people aren't looking and the people who live there are getting fed up.
But these monkeys - called Barbary macaques - are also endangered and need protection.
Now a charity has been trying to keep the peace.
