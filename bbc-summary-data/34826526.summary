Scottish Labour claims 'hidden waiting lists' in hospitals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour has said there should be an independent audit of what it claimed are "hidden waiting lists" in Scottish hospitals.

The call follows the death of a man on a trolley at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.
He had been waiting eight hours for treatment at the hospital.
The Scottish government said acute assessment units have "evolved in different ways according to local circumstances".
About half of the units have a separate area for patients referred directly to the hospital by GPs for admission or assessment to avoid them having to wait to be seen by another doctor in the emergency department.
The government said about 40% of patients returned home in less than 24 hours.
According to Labour, the length of time patients spend in assessment units is "not transparently monitored".
Labour spokesman and former GP Richard Simpson said: "It cannot be right that the length of time a patient waits for treatment is measured if they go through one door, but not another.
"Treatment in our NHS shouldn't be a postcode lottery; we need to know what is happening to patients in these units.
"The SNP government introduced a string of waiting time targets in our NHS, and boast of the transparency of their performance. But they are silent on this."
A spokesman for the Scottish government said: "Long unnecessary waits on trolleys anywhere in a hospital are unacceptable and we're clear patients must be appropriately and safely monitored in any facility by health boards.
"Prior to 2007, these waits were not monitored.
"We're already working with the Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh to share best practice across the different assessment units in place across the country, including sharing information on clinical models and clear and common methods of monitoring."
