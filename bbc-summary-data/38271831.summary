[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 2-3 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David McGoldrick grabbed a later winner as Ipswich consigned Wigan to a fifth-straight home Championship defeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brett Pitman's penalty put Town ahead after Dan Burn brought down Tom Lawrence, but Yanic Wildschut smashed in an equaliser after Max Power's free-kick was parried.
The Dutchman added a fine second from a tight angle to put Wigan in front.
But McGoldrick teed up Pitman to level and then won it with a glancing header from Grant Ward's cross.
The Latics began the game as the Championship's lowest scorers and without a goal in five games at the DW Stadium.
But they created plenty of chances to go ahead at the break with Town keeper Bartosz Bialkowski keeping out Will Grigg's header and then turning Power's low shot around the post.
Ipswich started the day with the division's second-leanest goals record, but they were clinical, scoring with all of their efforts on target, while Jonathan Williams' volley also hit the post.
The hosts continued to carve out chances after the break as Bialkowski made a double save from Grigg and Jake Buxton, and then kept out Power's 20-yard shot, before substitute McGoldrick ruined Wigan's day.
Ipswich's fourth win in 15 matches lifts them up to 15th, while Wigan's fourth-straight defeat leaves them second from bottom.
Wigan boss Warren Joyce:
"I'm disappointed obviously with the first goal; it's a real kick in the teeth because it's not a penalty, and suddenly we're 1-0 down and in a difficult situation.
"With the way results have gone - results, not performances - it tested our character, and I thought we showed great character.
"I thought we played some really flowing football in the second half, and I don't think scoring three or four goals would have been unrealistic, really."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"Warren Joyce must be scratching his head, wondering how they've lost that game.
"A third goal would have killed us, but I never thought we were out of it. And our subs have made a real impact; they've changed the game.
"If I could explain momentum in a game of football, how it changes and why, I'd write a book and I'd be able to retire off the proceeds.
"I just know that it changes on the back of goals. Once they got their second goal, they were battering us for a while. Once we got our second, we looked like we would go on and get a third."
