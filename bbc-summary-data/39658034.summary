Policeman cleared of breaking man's collarbone in cell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police custody sergeant accused of breaking a suspect's collarbone has been cleared of gross misconduct and using excessive force.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Pritchard, 42, had been in the police cells in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, when the alleged incident happened in December 2015.
Sgt Jethro Christie, 43, a former wrestler, was accused of putting him in a full Nelson hold.
But a Colwyn Bay tribunal panel found his actions were not excessive.
In directing no entry should be made on Sgt Christie's record, its chairman Ian Boys said: "We are also not satisfied that the arm hold caused the fracture."
The tribunal heard Mr Pritchard fell off a cell bed and this may have caused the injury.
