[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury climbed off the bottom of League One with victory against Oxford as Paul Hurst's impressive start as manager continued.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
AJ Leitch-Smith and substitute Shaun Whalley scored the goals to earn Shrewsbury a first league win since 3 September.
Oxford created the game's first chance but Chris Maguire's 20-yard shot was comfortably gathered by goalkeeper Mark Halstead.
Shrewsbury moved ahead in the 19th minute as Leitch-Smith scored his fourth goal in his past three league and cup games.
The in-form striker reacted quickest to turn in the loose ball from close range after goalkeeper Simon Eastwood pushed a 20-yard drive from Louis Dodds against the crossbar.
Eastwood then kept Oxford in contention with two fine saves before half-time, tipping away a powerful volley from the lively Dodds before getting down low to his right to instinctively keep out a low 12 yard shot from Dodds after he was picked out by Abu Ogogo's inviting cross.
Oxford chased an equaliser in the second half with a powerful header from Kane Hemmings impressively tipped over by Halstead, who then turned away a free-kick from Maguire.
Liam Sercombe also drove narrowly wide before Shrewsbury carved out late chances with Eastwood pulling off sharp stops from Adam El-Abd and Ivan Toney.
Shrewsbury eventually made the game safe deep into stoppage-time when Whalley ran from inside his own half and lifted a shot over the advancing Eastwood to make it four games unbeaten in all competitions under new manager Hurst.
