[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to create 17 new posts to oversee the police in Northamptonshire have been revealed by the county's new police and crime commissioner (PCC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a report, Conservative PCC Adam Simmonds outlined the proposals, which include employing a chief of staff and four assistant commissioners.
Under the old police authority, there were seven staff members - but the new commission would have 10 extra posts.
The report says the PCC wants to "stand up" for local community interests.
Three new departments, for drugs eradication, faith-based and neighbourhood initiatives, and the protection and security of the county, would also be created.
The commission carries out the work that the previous police authority did of overseeing targets and setting budgets.
But the office also has new responsibilities of prevention and taking care of victims of crime.
For 2012-13, the budget for Northamptonshire Police is Â£120.55m - Â£2m less than 2011-12.
Savings of Â£20m have to be made over four years.
Mr Simmonds was unavailable for comment about the plans on Thursday.
Paul Varnsverry, who stood for the Liberal Democrats in the elections,  said: "I will watch with interest to see how the ideas are refined."
Jim MacArthur, who represented UKIP, said: "My initial thoughts are that it sounds complicated."
John Norrie, an Independent candidate in the PCC election, said: "I would be a bit more careful with taxpayers' money. I thought this job was for one person with a few staff."
The Labour Party regional office was not available for comment.
A spokesman for the commissioner said staff would be consulted about the plans in the first four months of next year.
