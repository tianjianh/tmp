The singer, who supports Celtic, contributed to the fundraising drive for Ryan Baird after getting in touch with former Rangers captain Richard Gough.
Mr Baird, 39, died after the supporters' club bus he was travelling on crashed near Kilmarnock.
The fans were travelling to see Rangers play Partick Thistle at Ibrox stadium.
Mr Gough told the Evening Times: "As soon as it happened Rod got in touch with me and said as soon as a fund was set up I was to let him know. Which I did.
"He made a contribution, which is fantastic, which I have thanked him for. He is a good man."
In Sir Rod's message to Mr Gough, he said: "At sad times like this we are one big football loving family. RS(Celtic)."
The accident left 18 other people in hospital.
Mr Baird, originally from Northern Ireland, had been living in Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway.
He was travelling with the Nith Valley Loyal Rangers Supporters Club.
Meanwhile, Rangers players have visited injured fans in hospital.
The supporters' club thanked Rangers for all their support and said managing director Stewart Robertson, manager Mark Warburton, assistant manager David Weir and players had met with supporters at their base on Tuesday.
They said four first-team players have also visited the two fans who are still in hospital.
The supporters' club said in a statement: "These visits have been valuable in helping our members, especially the youngsters, start to come to terms with what has happened.
"Rangers directors have been in touch with us and the family daily. The Nith Valley loyal and our community will never forget what they've done for us."
Police said inquiries into the crash continue.
