They have been trialled in Aberdeen over the past 18 months, and the scheme will now be rolled out across the Moray and Aberdeenshire divisions.
The force said more than 90% of cases pursued, using evidence from the cameras, resulted in early guilty pleas.
Supt Nick Topping said: "We have been delighted by the difference made."
He explained: "As an evidence-gathering tool they have surpassed our initial expectations and the results really do speak for themselves.
"By rolling out the project across the entire force, every single officer or pair of officers on duty will now have access to this technology.
"The cameras can provide potentially crucial evidence through the clear and accurate digital video that they record and offer an extra layer of protection for officers.
"Most significantly, the cameras have helped to bring about earlier guilty pleas - which means officers are able to spend less time in court and more time out and about in communities, making a real difference."
