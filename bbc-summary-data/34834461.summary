[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Obsessed' John Arthur Jones 'shone lights at RAF jets'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man "obsessed" with RAF activity on Anglesey repeatedly shone bright lights into the cockpit of its planes during night flights, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Arthur Jones, 65, of Bodffordd, denies 13 counts of recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger aircraft or persons in an aircraft.
The trial at Mold Crown Court heard Mr Jones lived near the Mona airfield.
The jury was told he was "annoyed" by activity in the skies over his land.
John Philpotts, prosecuting, told the court 208 Squadron, which trains fast jet pilots, is based at RAF Valley and uses Mona airfield as part of the training for Hawk pilots.
"An important part of their training involves night flying," he said, including take off and landing.
He added: "It's the prosecution's case that Mr Jones endangered aircraft and their pilots repeatedly... and he did that, the prosecution say, by shining a bright light into the cockpits."
Mr Jones kept detailed notes of RAF activity and, Mr Philpotts said: "He was a man on a mission so far as RAF Valley was concerned."
The trial continues.
