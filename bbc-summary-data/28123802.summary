Floods which devastated an island in 1953, killing 59 people, have been remembered on a 262ft (80m) sea wall.

Almost every one of Canvey Island's 13,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes during the North Sea tidal surge.
The floods have been depicted on panels along a mural on Concord Beach, painted by professional artists and Canvey inhabitants.
The project was made possible with a Â£10,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The idea to paint the mural was put forward by the charity Friends of Concord Beach.
Its chairman, Colin Letchford, said the mural was intended to "involve and educate the community".
He said school groups and others had already been to visit the wall and learn about the history of the island and its relationship with the sea.
"People have wept at the pictures because of the memories they've brought back. They've also wept with joy," he said.
