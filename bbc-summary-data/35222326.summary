Threats to kill pupils in a shooting on Monday at Montgomery High School in Blackpool were posted on social media. The user said they planned to "kill as many people as possible".
The school confirmed 260 of its 1,375 pupils have attended.
Parent Anne Hindle said her 15-year-old son and daughter were "very scared" by the "pretty dark" posts.
Police officers have been patrolling outside the school for "reassurance", a Lancashire Police spokeswoman said.
The planned attack was in revenge for alleged bullying, according to the Facebook post.
The unnamed social media user also praised gun killers in schools in the US and posted on the school's Facebook page: "Nobody talks to me or notices me except when they're calling me a nerd and pushing me around."
Responding to one student, the user asked: "You think it's a joke? You'll see bullets, bodies, and blood."
Ms Hindle, who has a son and a daughter studying for GCSEs at Montgomery High School, decided to keep her children at home.
"They are very scared, to be honest," she said. "They are both aged 15 and in their GCSE year, so it is a big decision to take.
"I have read the posts on Facebook and they are pretty dark. The police say there is no credible threat but we have no guarantee."
School principal Tony Nicholson said: "One wonderful thing that just shows the commitment [of the staff] is that I have got 100% attendance - it is a large school [and] every single staff member was here early."
He said parents should be reassured by the police assessment that this was "a non-credible threat".
"That's been repeated throughout the whole course of the week. The police are here in a reassuring capacity and in significant numbers."
The school has told parents it had planned "for an orderly start to the term with 'safe business as usual' being our aim".
Blackpool Council has provided counselling services for any students who have "found the last few days upsetting and stressful".
In a statement, Lancashire Police said there was "nothing to suggest these messages pose a credible threat".
