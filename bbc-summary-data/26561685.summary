First Minister Carwyn Jones' special award was presented by April's parents Paul and Coral at an event in Cardiff.
The minister said the community's spirit during the "horrifying events of October 2012 remains an inspiration".
Olympian Jade Jones, singer Cerys Matthews and scientist Dr Lyn Evans were also among those honoured.
The St David Awards recognise inspirational people making a difference in Wales.
The people of the Powys town received the special award for their resilience following the disappearance of April Jones in October 2012, for whose murder Mark Bridger is serving a life sentence.
Carwyn Jones told the ceremony: "We heard incredible stories coming from this community. The help came from every area - from the bin men who searched endlessly, to the head teacher who offered support in helping the children come to terms with what had happened, to the hundreds of people who searched day and night, donating food, making sandwiches, helping any way they could."
The Reverend Kathleen Rogers, speaking for the Machynlleth community, said: "April Jones, in her very short life, has left a lasting legacy to our community and that is the true meaning of unity, compassion and love. She will always be in our hearts.
"It is the intention of the representatives to arrange a family day in the summer for the community of Machynlleth - a day to say thank you."
Categories for the new awards included bravery, citizenship, culture, enterprise, innovation and technology, international, sport and a young person's award.
The winners were unveiled at the ceremony at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff on Thursday night.
Carwyn Jones, who first announced the introduction of the honours last year, said: "The winners of these awards are exceptional people.
"They have done extraordinary and inspiring things and I'm proud that the Welsh government has been able to recognise their achievements through these first-ever St David Awards."
