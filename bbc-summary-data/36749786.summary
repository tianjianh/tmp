The bus was taken from outside Watford Junction station at about 22:00 BST on Thursday.
Hertfordshire Police received a number of calls from the public as it was driven through the town.
A 35-year-old man from London was arrested on suspicion of aggravated vehicle taking without consent.
The bus travelled along roads including Clarendon Road, the Watford ring road and Radlett Road.
It caused damage to a number of vehicles before coming to a stop in St Albans Road following a further crash.
Sgt Steve Alison said: "The bus is believed to have travelled some distance, colliding with parked vehicles, barriers and other objects along the route.
"Fortunately, no passengers were believed to have been on the bus at the time it was taken and no one was hurt as a result of the incident.
"We would like to speak to anyone who believes they saw the incident taking place."
