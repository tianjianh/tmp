Nottingham is at the centre of a festive mystery after the city made a bizarre cameo appearance in the trailer for a Hollywood film.

Krampus, in which a boy accidentally summons a Christmas demon, appears to have no connection with the East Midlands.
The fleeting shot prompted bafflement on Facebook, with one person even demanding producers "pay royalties".
Legendary Pictures and Universal have not yet commented.
The brief appearance of Nottingham's Christmas market was spotted by the son of a city council employee.
A spokesman said the authority was not approached about using the footage, but it does not necessarily have to be.
He said: "We do give permission for people to film in the city all the time but they don't always need permission, so if this footage already exists somewhere we wouldn't necessarily know about it.
"It is surprising to see Nottingham in a Hollywood trailer and we are pleased it has been used to depict a Christmas scene.
"Out of all the footage they could have picked, they chose Nottingham to show a typically Christmassy scene."
The horror movie starring Toni Colette and Adam Scott was filmed in New Zealand, according to IMDb.

Nottingham's Christmas market takes place in the city's Old Market Square, known affectionately by residents as Slab Square.
People commented on the film cameo after a story appeared in the Nottingham Post.
On Facebook, there was speculation that it was "just CGI" or it "may have been photoshopped a bit", but the council has confirmed that the footage did show the real Nottingham.
