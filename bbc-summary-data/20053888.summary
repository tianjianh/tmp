Network Rail said work would start next month on Wokingham station to build new shops and a footbridge, and improve waiting areas and extend the platforms.
Wokingham Borough Council is also planning a complete reworking of the roads around the station.
It said the scheme would simplify the road layout but some residents think it does not address the real traffic issues in the town.
Councillor Keith Baker, in charge of highways and planning, said a new station link road was part of the plans and would "transform the experience" for commuters and motorists.
Resident Dorian Edwards said: "They've been talking and talking about putting new access roads in but they don't seem to have come up with anything that will make traffic flow more freely.
"It's a real bottleneck around there."
Network Rail said train services would run as usual during the work to upgrade the station, which starts on 28 November and is expected to be completed by August 2013.
It has also announced it is introducing four extra train services on the London Waterloo route through Wokingham in the evening and morning rush hours from the summer of 2014.
The plans for the station and road network will go on show at Wokingham Town Hall on 7 November.
