Westbrook scored his 42nd triple-double of the season to eclipse the previous best set by Oscar Robertson in 1961-62.
He scored 50 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists to end the Nuggets' play-off hopes as well as sinking a dramatic long range-winning three-pointer.
"It's something you dream about as a little kid," said Westbrook.
A triple-double means a player has recorded a double-digit number in three of five statistical categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.
Westbrook, 28, recently made the highest scoring triple-double in NBA history with 57 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists against Orlando Magic.
His performance against the Nuggets also saw him secure his third 50-point triple-double of the season, which is another record.
