Hereford FC have appointed Peter Beadle, the last manager of Hereford United's 90-year history, as the reformed club's first boss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The much-travelled 42-year-old will be assisted by Matt Bishop.
Bishop, formerly number two to Dean Holdsworth at Aldershot, currently works for the Football Association as a coach educator.
"I'm very proud to have been appointed as manager of Hereford FC and cannot wait to get started," said Beadle.
"It will come as no surprise to people when I say that Edgar Street has a special place in my heart
"Matt and I are hugely excited by the journey that lies ahead and, although we are under no illusions about the challenges we will face in our new roles, we have no doubt that we are the right people to take this club forward.
"We have a lot of work to do between now and the start of the league season in August because we are going to be putting a squad together from scratch. However, with our contacts, we believe we can put a squad together that Hereford FC supporters deserve."
Beadle's appointment came only after a five-week selection process that went to a round of second interviews.
Hereford FC football director Martin Watson added: "This is an extremely important decision for the club and one that we have taken a lot of time over.
"However, we felt that the way Peter Beadle and Matt Bishop intend to work together as a team offered us the best possible chance of achieving the targets we are setting in terms of climbing up the leagues."
The club have already been granted a lease to play their future home games at Edgar Street, but it has not yet been ratified in which league they will play next season.
