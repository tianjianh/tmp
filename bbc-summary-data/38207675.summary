Forces keep records of hospitality and gifts offered to officers and staff.
Thank-you gifts included free trouser repair and Hindu robes in recent years.
Gwent Police Federation chairman Tim Wilcox said: "It's really nice to acknowledge that members of the community want to say thanks to individual officers."
Officers in Wales are unlikely to go hungry while in the office or out on the beat, judging by disclosures from four forces.
By far and away, the most common gifts to officers and staff were treats - with enough biscuits, cakes and sweets to feed a small army.
One chip shop even gave a hungry patrol officer in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, a free chicken pie and small portion of chips.
The officer reported the gift, saying: "I was told that they were closing soon and didn't have a full portion of chips left but I could have what was left for free. I accepted with thanks.
"They also offered a chicken pie which I initially declined but when they told me it was only going in to the bin as they were closing I accepted."
The officer was told the gift was "approved on this occasion in line with policy" but in future, efforts should be made to reimburse the company.
Alcohol is another common gift, but depending on circumstances, cannot always be accepted.
Simon Newport, North Wales Police Federation chairman, said: "Years ago, you'd get whiskey, wine, boxes of chocolate which you could accept providing you'd disclose it.
"It happens less and less now - it's a modern day culture. It's difficult to say no to a little old lady who comes to the nick with a bottle of wine to say thank you."
For some people, the only proper way to show their appreciation was to make something themselves.
A walking stick with the carved head of a dog, soap and jam were among the gifts with the personal touch.
When gifts fall foul of the rules they are either returned or, where appropriate, can be donated to charity.
Mr Wilcox added: "When declining, it's crucial we acknowledge the thought behind it and, generally, police officers are good communicators."
