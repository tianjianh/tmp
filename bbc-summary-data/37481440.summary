The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have visited a remote First Nation community in British Columbia on day three of their Canadian tour.

The pair were welcomed to the Great Bear Rainforest by Heiltsuk people from the island village of Bella Bella, and presented with traditional vests.
They also took part in a ceremony marking the forest's membership of the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy network.
The network helps to preserve indigenous forests.
Prince William said: "The establishment of the canopy is a loud and unambiguous statement that the citizens of all Commonwealth countries believe that nature is fundamental to the health of our societies.
"When we protect our rivers, oceans, atmospheres, or like today, our forests, we are telling our children that their future prosperity cannot be disconnected from the health of the natural world."
Chief council member Marilyn Slett welcomed the couple and said they were there as part of the "healing" the First Nation community is undertaking.
The Cambridges heard passionate statements from community leaders about their battle to stop the plunder of the natural resources of their lands and the struggle to preserve their way of life for future generations.
As the couple were given their ceremonial blankets, they were told: "We use these blankets to wrap the spirits of our ancestors around you and to unite your spirits together with ours."
A downpour prevented them taking a seaplane tour of the forest - the world's largest intact temperate rainforest - but the couple later took a stroll through it.
Later, the Duke of Cambridge joined Canadian chiefs for a reconciliation ceremony and added a ring to Black Rod, a ceremonial staff.
The rod has three rings representing British Columbia, Canada and a link with the UK.
William added a fourth, engraved with eagle feathers and a canoe, to symbolise the First Nations in BC.
But Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, leader of 115 First Nation tribes in the province, boycotted the ceremony over his people's treatment at the hands of Canada's government.
There was a reception for the royal couple at Government House in Victoria on Monday evening.
