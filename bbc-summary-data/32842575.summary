South Oxfordshire councillors vote for allowances hike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in South Oxfordshire have voted to increase their allowances by nearly 58%, £1,000 more a year than was recommended by an independent panel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The increase, from £2,900 a year to £4,575, was agreed at full council meeting on Thursday evening.
An independent remuneration panel report recommended the basic allowance should be raised to £3,500.
The amount has not increased since 2007, before the number of district councillors was reduced from 48 to 36.
The Conservative leader for the council John Cotton said the total budget for allowances had increased by 10%.
He said: "There is never a good time to do this as people will always criticise, but the reason I thought it was a good time was that there had been a reduction in the number of councillors.
"As we get even closer to a merger with the Vale [of White Horse District Council] we wanted to align councillors' allowances."
The Conservative ward member for Sonning Common, Paul Harrison, said: "It came down so were were the lowest-paid district council in the country - we are still in the low end."
The Labour ward member for Didcot South, Margaret Davies, was the only councillor to vote against the new allowance.
She said: "I think it's too great an increase. I did support the independent remuneration panel's recommendation because it had been eight years since there has been an increase, but a 58% increase is disproportionate, it's too much."
Ms Davies also criticised an increase in the allowance for council leader John Cotton, from £10,000 to £18,151.
She said: "On top of that, they get the basic allowance - that equals the average income in the South East for a household."
Other special responsibility allowances have also been increased.
The revised allowances are effective from 11 May.
