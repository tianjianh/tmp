Shots went ahead on 15 minutes with a superbly worked goal. Cheye Alexander crossed deep for Bernard Mensah, who looped a header into the far corner.
A powerful close-range header from Liam Bellamy, on his comeback from a foot injury, doubled the lead in the 26th minute.
Matt McLure almost made it three before the break, but after bursting through his chip was cleared off the line by Ben Middleton's header.
Rory Watson kept the Villagers in the game early in the second period, the 'keeper smothering Scott Rendell's effort, before both sides went close just after the hour and the visitors threatened late on.
