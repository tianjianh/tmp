The accident happened on the A85, two miles east of Gilmerton, Perthshire, at about 20:00 on Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain overnight has led to flooding across Aberdeenshire and Moray, with people rescued and homes evacuated in the village of Portsoy.
The weather has also caused disruption for travellers, with road, rail and ferry services affected.
The man who died has not been named, but Police Scotland said his next of kin had been informed.
Scottish Fire and Rescue crews used cutting equipment to free the victim. A spokesman said: "Crews were called to the scene at Gilmerton at 7.57pm on Tuesday to a report of an RTC involving a vehicle and fallen tree.
"Fire crews used cutting equipment at the scene."
On Wednesday, three elderly people were rescued by the fire service after six homes were evacuated in Soy Avenue in Portsoy, Aberdeenshire, due to flooding.
Water levels at the Loch of Soy were also being monitored. The fire service said it was currently involved in alleviating and diverting flood waters in the area.
Schools have been closed, including Fordyce, Ordiquhill, Portsoy and Whitehills in Aberdeenshire and Dallas, Mosstowie, Rothiemay and Crossroads primary schools in Moray.
Moray Council warned the river Spey was continuing to rise and said flooding was likely in Garmouth.
The local authority said pallets of sandbags had been sent to the village.
ScotRail said the line between Aberdeen and Inverness had also been hit by flooding.
Services were terminating at Keith and Forres, and the company said replacement bus services were running.
A spokesman said: "We are doing all we can to keep customers moving. Anyone delayed by more than 30 minutes should keep hold of their tickets, and claim compensation from scotrail.co.uk."
In Edinburgh, tram services between the city centre and Edinburgh Park were disrupted after heavy rainfall on Wednesday morning flooded the track.
Meanwhile, police in Orkney are dealing with reports of flooding at Evie; on the Airport Road near Kirkwall; and at Grimness in South Ronaldsay.
Northlink Ferries warned its Pentland Firth sailings could be subject to "minor delays" while the Wednesday morning sailing from John O'Groats to Orkney was cancelled.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency said 11 flood warnings were in force, mostly in Moray and Aberdeenshire.
A spokesperson said: "The lower Spey is particularly high, with potential localised flooding in Kingston and Garmouth. SEPA and Moray Council are monitoring the situation across the area."
