All-Ireland SFC: Mayo stun Tyrone in Croke quarter-final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mayo earned a narrow deserved 0-13 to 0-12 win over 14-man Tyrone in the All-Ireland quarter-final at Croke Park.

The sides were tied at 0-7 apiece at the interval and were still equal on 0-11 each when Sean Cavanagh was sent-off for a second yellow card on 59 minutes.
A fine David Clarke save from Connor McAlliskey in the second half proved vital while Darren McCurry wasted a good chance for a late levelling point.
Niall Morgan was unable to convert three long-range frees, one late on.
Tyrone's eight-year wait for Sam Maguire Cup success continues and this defeat will be particularly hard to take as they went into the game as favourites after an impressive triumph over Donegal in the Ulster final on 17 July.
Tyrone named the same team which beat Donegal in the Ulster provincial decider almost three weeks ago, but Mayo manager Stephen Rochford recalled Diarmuid O'Connor, while Jason Doherty and Alan Dillon were late additions to the starting line-up.
Mayo were shocked by Galway in the Connacht Championship but since then saw off Fermanagh, Kildare and Westmeath in the qualifiers.
Mayo also had a good record against the Red Hands in the Championship, having earned a third victory in four games between the counties when they won the 2013 All-Ireland semi-final 1-16 to 0-13.
An evenly-contested first half saw the sides go in all-square at the interval, Mattie Donnelly kicking three points for the Ulster champions and Cillian O'Connor contributing four for the Connacht men.
Aidan O'Shea and Niall Sludden traded scores to make it 0-1 apiece after 10 minutes but points from Andy Moran and an O'Connor long-range free edged Mayo into a merited lead as the game began to open up.
Ronan O'Neill and Peter Harte (2) joined Donnelly on the score-sheet for Tyrone but, crucially,  goalkeeper Morgan was off-target with a couple of long-distance free attempts.
Colm Boyle knocked over the final point of the half to leave the score 0-7 each at half-time.
The second half was as keenly fought as the first and there was never more than two points between the teams.
McAlliskey squandered the best goal-scoring opportunity of the match, although credit must go to Clarke, and soon after a high challenge by Cavanagh saw him dismissed with just over 10 minutes remaining.
Subsequent points from O'Connor, with a free, and Lee Keegan with his second point, proved enough to see Mayo through, a McCurry free being Tyrone's only reply.
O'Connor finished with seven points, with substitute Tom Parsons also pointing for the victors, while Peter Harte (2), McAlliskey (2) and McCurry were the Ulster county's second-half scorers.
Former Tyrone player Enda McGinley on BBC Radio Ulster: "Tyrone are out of the Championship without hitting top gear and this is a huge blow to the momentum Mickey Harte had with this team.
"Tyrone struggled right throughout the game and when their plan of counter-attacking football failed, they had no plan B. Mayo didn't even need to be at their best."
Mayo will play Tipperary in the first of the All-Ireland semi-finals on 21 August, with Kerry facing Dublin, conquerors of Donegal on Saturday, in the second last-four tie a week later.
