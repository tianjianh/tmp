Wales football supporters found selling on priority tickets for the World Cup qualifier in Austria next month could face action, a fans group has warned.

Some of the 2,776 tickets for the match on 6 October went on sale using a loyalty scheme on Friday.
Football Supporters' Federation Cymru said the Football Association of Wales (FAW) would stop any found sold on.
A spokesperson said: "It's not rocket science. If they get caught, the FAW will suspend their membership."
An FAW spokesman would not confirm fans could face suspension, but said the association was "aware of the concerns and will continue to monitor the situation".
Wales will play Austria at the Ernst Happel Stadion, in Vienna, in the vital qualification clash.
FSF Cymru said the FAW was "between a rock and a hard place" as it tried to manage demand after a surge in support since the team reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
Last month, almost 16,000 tickets to watch all of Wales' home World Cup qualifying matches were sold in a matter of days.
"Fans have got to grow into the loyalty scheme. The FAW has to protect the old guard, while encouraging the new guard," the FSF Cymru spokesman said.
Wales face Moldova, Georgia, Serbia, Austria and Republic of Ireland in Group D with all home games to be held at Cardiff City Stadium.
Only members who have been to at least two of the last seven away qualifier and friendly matches - meaning matches at Euro 2016 in France do not count - were eligible to buy tickets during stage one, which kicked off on Friday.
Stage two, which will be open to members who have been to one away qualifier or friendly during this period, will open on 15 September.
A third stage will sell any remaining tickets to other fans from 21 September.
Chris Coleman's side beat Moldova 4-0 in their opening game of the qualifying campaign at home on Monday.
