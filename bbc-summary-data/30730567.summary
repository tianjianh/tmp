Swansea City manager Garry Monk says it is important that Manchester City meet their £30m valuation of striker Wilfried Bony.

Monk says talks are on-going ahead of the 26-year-old's proposed move to the Premier League champions.
The Ivory Coast international's agent Francis Kacou said on Wednesday that the deal should be completed soon.
"Unless they reach the valuation we hold . . . then obviously no business can be done," said Monk.
"There are talks between the two clubs and at this moment in time it's ongoing.
"Obviously they have talked about fees, but whether they are close or far apart is unclear at the moment.
"It's important that whatever happens, whatever player that we try to make agreement with or sell, that it reaches the valuation that Swansea hold."
The Swans boss also played down the possibility of losing another striker, Frenchman Bafetimbi Gomis, 29, to Crystal Palace and dismissed reports linking the Welsh club with Tottenham Hotspur's full-back Kyle Naughton, 26.
Bony joined Swansea for a club-record £12m from Vitesse Arnhem in 2013.
The fee being discussed would break the Welsh club-record sale of £15m that Liverpool paid Swansea for midfielder Joe Allen in August 2012.
Bony, who scored an injury-time equaliser for Swansea against QPR on New Year's Day, is on Africa Cup of Nations duty with the Ivory Coast for at least the next three weeks.
"I spoke to him after the QPR game and just wished him all the best for the Africa Cup of Nations. That's the only conversation I've had with Wilfried," said Monk.
"Wilfried has been fantastic for me, I've enjoyed working with him daily and improving him.
"If the two clubs agree the right fee for Swansea City then I'm sure that deal will be done and we'd wish Wilfried all the best. But if not, he comes back to Swansea and then it's the same as normal."
Monk also repeated he will not seek to bring on-loan Michu back to the Liberty Stadium from Napoli.
Michu joined Swansea from Rayo Vallecano for £2.2m during the summer of 2012 and was the club's top scorer with 22 goals in his first full season.
His performances saw him linked with big-money moves, but he extended his stay in south Wales by signing a four-year deal in January 2013.
The former Oviedo and Celta Vigo player's second season with the Swans was marred by knee and ankle problems and he scored only two goals in 15 starts in the Premier League.
The Spaniard has not played for the Italian club since October 2014.
