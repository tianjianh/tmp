[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegation-threatened Kidderminster Harriers have extended the youth loan of midfielder Ben Whitfield from Premier League side Bournemouth until the end of the season.

The 19-year-old has become a fans' favourite at Aggborough after scoring four goals in 15 appearances.
The National League side have also tied the midfield pair of Ousmane Fane and Elton Ngwatala to new deals.
The French duo, both 22, are contracted until the end of the 2016-17 season.
All three players have helped the Harriers hit their best run of form of the campaign, with the club winning three successive games in February to lift themselves off the bottom of the National League table. Before this month, Kidderminster had won just two of their previous 28 league fixtures.
With 15 matches remaining, the Harriers are seven points from safety.
Chief executive and majority shareholder Colin Gordon has been back in caretaker charge since Dave Hockaday left the club last month.
