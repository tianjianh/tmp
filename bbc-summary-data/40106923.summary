After Hampshire won the toss, the visitors started well, left-arm paceman Keith Barker taking two of the wickets to reduce the hosts to 31-3.
However, Adams (104 not out) and Ervine (160 not out) batted sensibly on a slow wicket for the day's last two sessions.
Both made their 22nd first-class tons to leave Hampshire on top at stumps.
Warwickshire's day started brightly, as Barker (2-62) dismissed Michael Carberry and Rilee Rossouw to go past 300 first-class wickets.
But the Bears, who are still looking for their first win of the season, struggled to make further inroads, captain Ian Bell using seven bowlers to try and break up Adams and Ervine's partnership.
Warwickshire's other wicket-taker was fit-again Boyd Rankin, on his first start in 11 months.
Ervine brought up his first century of the season before Adams reached 13,000 first-class runs as the pair set a new Hampshire record for the fourth wicket in games against Warwickshire.
Hampshire batsman Jimmy Adams told BBC Solent:
"It was a big relief to get those runs as it had been a while and we were in a bit of strife at the beginning of the day. To do it at a time when it was needed means a lot.
"I am just delighted to see it through as you have days where you know you're not at your best. You just stick in there and do what the team needs. To have someone like Slug going well at the other end was important.
"I heard the PA over the speakers say about the record. Me and Slug had a chuckle about that. It's a nice milestone, especially when you hear it has been so long. Unfortunately, Slug got most of them."
Warwickshire first team coach Jim Troughton told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"We knew it would be a good toss to win and get a bat out there. Then we got them 30-3 and we thought we could get into them and open the innings up.
"But Adams and Sean showed their experience there and put on a great partnership for them. Whatever the ball did do it did slowly, so it was hard work for our boys.
"Barks, Boyd and Clarkey all bowled exceptionally well but they got the better of us in that partnership. We stood together well. This game hasn't got away from us."
