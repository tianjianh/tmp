The defender, 19, followed in the footsteps of father Paolo and grandfather Cesare by pulling on the armband for Milan's under-19s.
Left-back Paolo, 47, won five European Cups and seven Serie A titles over a 25-year career with the Rossoneri.
Centre-half Cesare won Serie A four times, the club's first European Cup in 1963 and managed AC Milan and Italy.
Christian was given the armband for Milan's Primavera side in a friendly against Novara on Saturday, in honour of Cesare who died a few days earlier, aged 84.
