Fire crews were called to the heavily smoke-logged house on the Portadown Road just after 08:30 BST on Saturday.
Six firefighters, wearing breathing apparatus, entered the building and rescued the man from the living room. He was taken to hospital by ambulance.
Another man, who was also in the house at the time, managed to escape from the building before the rescue.
Both men were treated at the scene by paramedics.
Group Commander John Denver told BBC Radio Ulster: "Seconds are vital in any fire, so getting the crews there quickly and getting that person out to a safe area was vitally important.
"We worked really quickly as a team together and we we're able to get the casualty out.
"So, the person who escaped and, unfortunately, the person who has been injured were certainly lucky that the Fire Service was able to get them out to be treated by the Ambulance Service," Mr Denver said.
