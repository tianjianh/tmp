US golfer Palmer, regarded as one of the greatest and most influential players in the sport's history, died at the age of 87 on 25 September.
His private funeral for family members was last Thursday.
Phil Mickelson and most of the US team were at St Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, along with leaders from the PGA Tour and European Tour.
Fellow golf great Jack Nicklaus was also among those gathered in Palmer's hometown to celebrate his life.
He told those present: "I hurt like you hurt. You don't lose a friend of 60 years and don't feel an enormous loss."
Private planes descended on Arnold Palmer Regional Airport - which was named after the legend in 1999 - about an hour before the service.
Palmer's plane repeatedly circled over the college, tipping the wing, during the service.
