Police said there were "a few pockets of disorder" and that CCTV around Birmingham's St Andrew's ground and the city centre would be reviewed.
Four people were arrested for disorder-related offences.
Birmingham City won 2-1 to dent Wolves' hopes of promotion from the Championship.
The match was "comprehensively risk-assessed over many weeks" and there was "a strong police presence in and around" St Andrew's, the West Midlands force said.
Match commander Ch Supt James Andronov said: "Some people have questioned the decision to allow both sets of fans to leave the ground at the same time.
"It is rare these days to hold back supporters - it's not been done at this fixture for several years - as evidence suggests to do so often increases tension and the prospect of trouble."
He said, as with all large operations, the force would review the policing of the match.
