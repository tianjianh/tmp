The youngster, from Blackhall in County Durham,  who has neuroblastoma, has struck up a moving friendship with Sunderland player Jermain Defoe.
He was due to be a mascot for Sunderland in their game with Middlesbrough on Wednesday night.
But his family said the youngster was "not good" and in "horrendous pain".
Earlier this month Bradley's family revealed that his latest and final round of treatment had failed.
His mother, Gemma, said: "Bradley is not good. He has been in horrendous pain with his leg since yesterday to the point [where] he couldn't move in bed.
"We have had him to the hospital and they have given him an X-ray, but it didn't show anything.
"The doctors' gut feeling is that it is his cancer progressing, but we need to wait and watch for a few days to see what happens.
"I am hoping and praying that it is nothing serious and he starts to improve as I'm not ready for this to happen yet."
Bradley got a rousing reception from England fans as he walked out as a mascot for last month's World Cup qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley. An online fundraising campaign for treatment has raised almost Â£67,000
Jermain Defoe has been a regular visitor to his hospital bedside and has promised to attended his sixth birthday party next month.
Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer with an unknown cause that affects babies and young children.
