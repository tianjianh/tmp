Championship Preston reached round three of the Capital One Cup as Marnick Vermijl's goal saw off Premier League Watford, who finished with 10 men.

Defender Vermijl, on loan from Sheffield Wednesday, scored from inside the box after Josh Brownhill's eighth-minute shot had been blocked.
It was enough to condemn the Hornets to a first defeat this season.
Watford debutant Miguel Britos received a straight red card with 15 minutes left for an elbow on Bailey Wright.

With Saturday's trip to leaders Manchester City in mind, the Hornets made 11 changes to the side that started Sunday's 0-0 draw with Southampton.
But Quique Sanchez Flores' understudies failed to impress as Preston sealed a deserved win.
Watford finally began to exert some pressure as the second half wore on, but Britos's dismissal after the Uruguayan had gone up for a corner halted the Hornets' momentum, and Preston were able to see out the final 15 minutes with relative ease.
They came close to adding to their lead when former Watford striker Joe Garner saw a long-range effort deflected narrowly wide.
