The crater in Craster Square in the Coxlodge area of Gosforth appeared shortly before 11:00 GMT next to a row of garages, and spans the width of the road.
The hole has revealed old mine workings in an area which used to have a number of pits.
Newcastle City Council and the Coal Authority said they are assessing the extent of the collapse.
One man who lives a few doors away said: "I thought at first, 'that's my garage gone' but it's a bit further along from me.
"There was a lady who was getting her car out of the garage and the hole went and so she phoned the police straight away.
"It's the main pit shaft - it's all pit workings round here.
"It's really shocking to have it happen."
A Coal Authority spokesman said an investigation is under way to determine the cause.
He said the hole has been fenced off and will be filled with stone to make the area more stable, allowing closer inspections.
