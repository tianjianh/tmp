The hosts moved into the lead through Kire Markoski and Enis Bardhi doubled their advantage before the break.
David Babunski also had a penalty saved by Ryan Fulton in the first half following Oliver McBurnie's handball.
Iceland's defeat at home to Ukraine meant Macedonia won Group 3 to seal a place in Poland next year.
France finish in second place after also overtaking Iceland. However, the French, who won 3-0 in Northern Ireland, do not progress to the play-offs as they are not one of the four best runners-up.
It was Scot Gemmill's second match in charge of the Scots, with the former Nottingham Forest, Everton and Scotland player taking over from Ricky Sbragia before last week's 2-0 loss to Iceland.
Scotland finished the six-team group in fifth place, winning just two of their 10 matches.
