[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 99-year-old Netherlands woman has fulfilled a "bucket list" dream - by spending time in a police cell.

Most people in custody are less than happy about it, but in pictures shared by officers on Facebook, Annie could not have been more delighted.
Annie, who had not committed any crime, was allowed to sit in a cell at the police station in Nijmegen Zuid, 75 miles south-east of Amsterdam, in order to achieve "one of her last wishes".
The idea came from her family.
"Her niece came to us with this request," a police officer at the station told the BBC. "When she was reporting a crime, she told the police officer about Annie's 'bucket list'."
And social media users around the world have been queuing up to congratulate her, as the post detailing her stint inside a cell has been widely shared, generating thousands of reactions online.
"You are no-one until you go to jail. Great job Auntie!" one user commented. Others praised the police for helping Annie to realise her dream.
"You get many unusual requests with this profession," the police officer said. "We thought it would be nice to do something special for Annie."
