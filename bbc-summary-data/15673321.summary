The American won the Tour de France in 2006, but was later stripped of the title after failing a dope test.
Last year, he confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career.
Landis's former trainer, Arnie Barker, was also convicted by a Paris court and received the same suspended sentence.
Neither men were present for the trial and both are the subject of international arrest warrants.
Landis was found guilty by a French court of masterminding the hacking into the computer of the lab, south of Paris, that found abnormal levels of testosterone in his system.
Prosecutors accused the pair of using the hacked documents to prepare their failed legal challenge to the Tour de France disqualification.
Landis announced his retirement from cycling earlier this year after failing to find a new team.
