Rangers: Matt Gilks signs at Ibrox after Burnley exit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Matt Gilks on a two-year contract after the 34-year-old was released by Burnley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gilks, 34, was a target for Hearts and was also attracting interest from League One clubs in England.
He will provide competition to Wes Foderingham after Cammy Bell joined Dundee United.
Gilks, who only played twice during his two seasons with Burnley, won the last of three Scotland caps in 2013.
He worked alongside the current Rangers goalkeeper coach, Jim Stewart, while on international duty.
Rochdale-born Gilks, who began his career with his local club before moving to Norwich City, won his international honours while with Blackpool.
He helped Blackpool win promotion to the Premier League in 2010.
However, Gilks left the Seasiders after their relegation in 2014 but was unable to dislodge number one Tom Heaton at Burnley.
He last played a competitive game for the Championship winners in August, a 1-0 win over Port Vale in the Capital One Cup.
