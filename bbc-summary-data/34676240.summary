A 50-year-old woman, who was arrested by police investigating the death of a man in west Belfast last year, has been released.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Corrigan, 31, died in hospital after he was found at a flat in St Mary's Gardens in September 2014.
Post mortem results indicated he may have died in suspicious circumstances.
The woman, who was arrested in west Belfast on Thursday, was released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
Last month, police renewed their appeal for information about Mr Corrigan's death.
