The New Saints boss Scott Ruscoe expects a big step up in class against Rijeka in Tuesday's Champions League second qualifying round, first-leg tie.

The Croatia side ended Dinamo Zagreb's run of 11 league titles last season.
TNS overcame Europa FC in the first round - where Rijeka had a bye - after a thrilling extra-time win against the Gibraltar champions.
"Rijeka are a good team to watch... they've just beaten Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0 in a friendly," Ruscoe said.
"Friendly or not, if you're beating that standard of team and looking comfortable then you're obviously a good level.
"They've got good players, lots of international players so we'll be up against it, but we'll have a game plan again and give it our best.
"Like against the Gibraltar side, if we play at our maximum anything can happen."
