Durrant, 45, is the BDO's world number one and was the top seed at this year's World Championship at Lakeside.
However, the Middlesbrough thrower lost 5-4 to Scott Waites in the quarter-finals on Friday.
Durrant told BBC Tees in December that he would make a decision on his future after the tournament.
He won six ranking titles in 2015, including the prestigious World Masters and Finder Masters events.
A statement on the BDO website read: "Sue Williams, head of the British Darts Organisation, has announced that after speaking to Glen, he will be staying with the BDO and will not be attending (the PDC's) Q School later this month."
Q School takes place in Wigan on 13-16 January, with 16 players earning automatic Tour cards to play full-time on the Professional Darts Corporation circuit.
Further places will be available based on finishing positions in the final Q School Order of Merit.
