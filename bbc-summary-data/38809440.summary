Man in court over Derby Sikh temple murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elderly man found dead near a Sikh temple had been beaten so badly police believed he had been hit by a car, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sukhraj Singh Atwal has gone on trial for the murder of Satnam Singh, 74 - the father of his mother's ex-husband - in Derby in July 2015.
The prosecution at Nottingham Crown Court alleged he repeatedly stamped and jumped on Mr Singh.
The 29-year-old, of Pear Tree Crescent, Derby, denies murder.
Mr Singh had been walking to the temple where he volunteered in the early hours of 23 July when he was attacked on the corner of Coronation Street.
He was found with 41 fractures to his ribs, lacerations to his heart and blunt force injuries to his head and face.
Mr Atwal's car appeared several times on local CCTV at the time of the attack.
The beating itself was not caught on camera but the vehicle was seen entering the spot where Mr Singh died immediately before the attack and leaving four minutes later.
Footage from a garage forecourt showed Mr Atwal appearing to inspect his light-coloured trousers.
He also returned to the scene several times "to observe what was happening", the prosecution alleged, wearing different trousers.
Mr Atwal was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving four days later, giving no comment at interview, save that police should "check the forensics" on his car.
He was arrested in April 2016 on suspicion of murder after tests determined Mr Singh had not been hit by a car.
Examination of Mr Atwal's phone revealed he had travelled to a remote location near Carsington Water, near the Peak District, later that day where the prosecution alleges he disposed of his trousers.
A text message on his phone said he had not hit Mr Singh "with my car" and he even taunted police in a letter from custody saying they "couldn't even get the cause of death right".
The trial continues.
