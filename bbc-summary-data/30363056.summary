US President Barack Obama has had a persistent sore throat, and has briefly visited a hospital for tests, the White House says.

Mr Obama had experienced a sore throat over "the past couple weeks", which appeared to be caused by acid reflux, his doctor said.
Mr Obama had a fibre optic exam, followed by a CT scan, on Saturday.
Acid reflux, where stomach acid leaks up the throat, is a common condition and is not considered serious.
The initial fibre optic exam "revealed soft tissue swelling in the posterior throat", Mr Obama's doctor, Ronny L Jackson, said in a statement.
Dr Jackson said that he decided "further evaluation with a routine CT [computerised tomography] scan was prudent".
Mr Obama was given a CT scan at the Walter Reed military hospital. The results of the scan were normal, and Mr Obama would be treated for acid reflux, Dr Jackson said.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that the quick scheduling of the scan was "a matter of convenience for the president, not a matter of urgency".
The health of US presidents and presidential candidates can generate considerable media interest in the US.
Candidates for president and vice-president often release medical documents or letters from their doctors to the media to demonstrate that they are healthy.
