Independent TD Clare Daly told the Dáil two weeks ago a garda witnessed a colleague shooting a member of the public.
She claimed he was told by senior officers to say he was not present.
Ms Fitzgerald said anyone with information should produce evidence.
She said the matter would then be investigated
RTÉ reports that Garda Commissioner Noírín O'Sullivan said she was not aware of the details of any such case but that anyone with information could report it to her or to the Garda Ombudsman.
Ms Fitzgerald said An Garda Síochána was the appropriate body to investigate the claim.
Ms O'Sullivan said she was aware of the allegation but not the specifics and said there was no police investigation under way.
She said police would need more details before concluding that this was an allegation of murder.
Ms Fitzgerald said all information in relation to the statements made in the Dáil were now being examined and would be followed up.
She said she had asked for a full report on the matter.
