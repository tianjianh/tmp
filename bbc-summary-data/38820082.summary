Notts County sign Jorge Grant, Marc Bola and Josh Clackstone on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County have completed the loan signings of Arsenal defender Marc Bola, Nottingham Forest's Jorge Grant and Hull defender Josh Clackstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bola, 19, signed a professional deal with the Gunners in April after playing regularly for their under-21 side.
Midfielder Grant, 22, has played 17 league games for Forest since joining the Championship club in 2013.
Clackstone, 20, can play at right-back or centre-half, with all three players joining for the rest of the season.
Grant lined up against Notts in a Central League Cup match on transfer deadline day before the deal was agreed.
The trio join on the same day that Notts County boss Kevin Nolan was registered as a player and West Brom forward Tahvon Campbell arrived on loan.
