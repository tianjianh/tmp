New Charlton Athletic head coach Bob Peeters says his squad will need a team ethic to succeed next season.

The 40-year-old was appointed on a rolling one-year deal by the Championship club last month.
"In my opinion, in football - if you see it in the World Cup or in Belgium - the basics are the same," Peeters told BBC London 94.9.
"With good organisation, good shape and a lot of passion and will you can achieve a lot as a team."
The former Belgium international quit Belgian side Waasland-Beveren to accept the Charlton job and take his first post in English football.

Peeters, who had a two-year spell as a player at Millwall between 2003 and 2005, is looking forward to testing himself as a manager in the Championship.
"I always loved British competitions," he said. "I played in the Championship and it is a tough but lovely competition.
"For a 40-year-old manager it is a big challenge. I want to work in a bigger competition and try to develop myself as a manager as well. I'm looking forward to it.
"I am a young manager and if I feel happy after this season and Charlton are happy, we go on. If one of the sides is not happy then we move on."
Charlton signed Standard Liege midfielder Yoni Buyens on a season-long loan at the weekend and are closing in on a deal for FC Copenhagen striker Igor Vetokele.
Roland Duchatelet took over the Addicks in January and since then the south east London club have made six signings from clubs owned by or linked to the Belgian businessman.
It is very expensive to bring in players from the Championship and it is not easy to sign English players. I have my say in every player who is coming to play for Charlton
Peeters is wary that Charlton may have to look abroad to strengthen their squad but is adamant he will have his say on potential signings.
"We need some new players in and need to start a little bit from zero," he said.
"We are looking in several countries. First you look in the Championship but it is very expensive to bring in players from the Championship and it is not easy to sign English players.
"The two players we have brought in - Yoni Buyens and Igor Vetokele - are ones I know but we are still looking for players.
"It's not a one-man decision. I have my say in every player who is coming to play for Charlton. I have been informed about every player that has been followed or proposed."
Meanwhile, Peeters is hopeful that defender Michael Morrison and midfielder Diego Poyet will sign new deals to remain at The Valley.
"Morrison is an experienced centre-back and I want him to stay," he said.
"Diego was one of the biggest talents in the Championship last season and we are begging a little bit that he will re-sign. Hopefully he makes the right decision and wants to play for Charlton."
