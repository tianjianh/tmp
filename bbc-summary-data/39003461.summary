Callum Evans: Macclesfield Town sign Barnsley defender on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League side Macclesfield Town have signed Callum Evans on loan from Barnsley until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old defender has made just two Championship appearances for his parent club in 2016-17.
The move is likely to help the Silkmen provide cover for captain Andy Halls, who suffered a hamstring injury in Wednesday's 1-0 defeat by Barrow.
Evans could make his debut in Saturday's match at home to Braintree Town.
