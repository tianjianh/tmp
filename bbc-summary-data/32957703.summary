[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chetham's music professor 'raped student in car', court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former professor at a prestigious music school used his "power and influence" in order to rape a female student, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malcolm Layfield, 63, denies raping an 18-year-old from Chetham's School of Music in the early 1980s.
Manchester Crown Court heard the attack occurred during a trip to Cornwall.
Prosecutor David Cadwallader said the alleged victim didn't complain at the time "because nobody would have believed her back then."
She said Mr Layfield plied her with drink, took her to a remote spot in his car and raped her.
The court heard the student went on to have a consensual relationship with Mr Layfield.
But Mr Cadwallader said she only "went along" with it despite her reluctance, because the teacher was "critical" to her success at the school and future career.
"It is alleged, in short, that he used his power and influence improperly," the prosecutor said.
"He admits that he had inappropriate sexual relationships with a number of female students.
"The complainant in this case was one such student."
During a filmed interview shown to the jury, the woman described the encounter alleged to have taken place in Mr Layfield's car.
"He was going to have sex with me and there wasn't a thing I could do about it.
"I gave in and I have hated myself for that ever since."
Mr Layfield, of Castle Quay, Castlefield, also taught at Manchester's Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM).
In 2001, the woman wrote to RNCM alleging Mr Layfield had been involved in inappropriate relationships with students.
He was later promoted to head of strings, Mr Cadwallader said.
The trial continues.
