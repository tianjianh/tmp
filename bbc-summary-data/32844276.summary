[SN]TITLE[SN]
Knighthood for ex-minister Eric Pickles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-Conservative Cabinet minister Eric Pickles is to be given a knighthood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Downing Street said the award was in recognition of his service as an MP and, before that, in local government.
Mr Pickles was the major casualty of David Cameron's post-election reshuffle, leaving his post as Communities Secretary - a job he held throughout the coalition government.
The former leader of Bradford Council has taken on a new role as anti-corruption tsar.
Mr Pickles, a former chairman of the Conservative Party, has been MP for Brentwood and Ongar since 1992.
He was returned with an increased majority at the recent general election.
Mr Pickles said his family were "absolutely delighted" and he was looking forward to his investiture.
"I'm obviously very pleased with the honour and am looking forward to my day at the Palace," he said.
"When I left the Cabinet the prime minister asked if I would accept a knighthood and I indicated that I would but it then has to go through a committee. I'm very pleased."
