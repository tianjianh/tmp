The front-runner, for now, appears to be Donald Trump, who is heading the polls and receiving plenty of media coverage - not all of it positive.
Here's a selection of Mr Trump's many, many colourful quotes. Could the tycoon be the next president of the United States?
"They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken."
- Declaration speech, 16 June 2015
"They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards, and they're telling us what we're getting."
- Declaration speech, 16 June 2015
"Three weeks ago...I thought he was probably born in this country. Right now, I have some real doubts."
- NBC News interview, April 2011
He then offered to donate $5m to charity if Mr Obama revealed his birth certificate to show he was born in the US. Mr Obama did just that.
"When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time."
- Declaration speech, 16 June 2015
"Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody."
- Declaration speech, 16 June 2015
"I dealt with Gaddafi. I rented him a piece of land. He paid me more for one night than the land was worth for two years, and then I didn't let him use the land. That's what we should be doing. I don't want to use the word 'screwed,' but I screwed him. That's what we should be doing."
- Fox News, March 2011
"Sadly the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before and we will make America great again."
- Declaration speech, 16 June 2015
