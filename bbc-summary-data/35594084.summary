Lottie Pauling-Chamberlain, who sleeps outside Lush in Oxford, said she challenged a thief on 10 February.
Now a woman, 29, of no fixed address, has been held on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and possessing Class A drugs, police said.
A man, 42, also of no fixed abode, has been arrested on suspicion of burglary.

Staff at the shop in Cornmarket Street said a laptop and large box of cosmetics had disappeared when they opened the shop last week.
The next day Ms Pauling-Chamberlain, who sleeps rough in the area with her dog Marley, returned the stolen items.
A donation fund set up by the store has so far raised Â£9,245, which was donated to by 537 people.
But a spokeswoman for the cosmetics chain said the fund had now been put on hold while police carried out an investigation.
She added Lush had been advised not to comment further. Thames Valley Police said its policy was not to name those arrested.
Both suspects have been released on police bail until 14 May.
