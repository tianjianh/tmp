Leverets saved amid cat attack fears in Kelso

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four baby hares have been recovered from a garden in the Borders by the Scottish SPCA.

They were called out after the week-old leverets were found without their mother in Kelso.
The Scottish SPCA said it would normally have left them alone but there were concerns a cat could attack them.
The leverets - which have been named John, Paul, George and Ringo - are being cared for at the National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Fishcross.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said: "The caller was concerned about a cat attacking them so gave us a call.
"If they hadn't been in danger of an attack we would have left them as the mother hare will usually leave them in long grass, under a hedge or in woodlands and will visit them daily at dusk or dawn to feed for roughly 20 minutes.
"So far the little guys are being hand reared and are feeding well. They should be ready for release at about eight weeks once they are self-feeding and have spent some time in our outdoor aviaries."
