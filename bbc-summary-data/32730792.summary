[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prince Charles: The lobbying prince

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The publication of Prince Charles's secret letters offers the briefest of glimpses of Charles, the lobbying prince.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
And lobbying on an eye-watering range of subjects: historic buildings, herbal medicine, the albatross, healthy food and sustainable fishing.
It's a wonder the heir to the throne has time to sleep.
Royal officials insist he has done nothing inappropriate and at no stage, in any of the correspondence, did he stray into party political matters.
These letters have resonance and relevance because of his proximity to the throne.
Charles's challenge is that their content will not generate a unified response to the activities of a prince who'll one day occupy the unifying role of head of state.
His critics will accuse him of secret meddling.
His supporters insist he cares about the issues he raises and he is only doing his duty.
