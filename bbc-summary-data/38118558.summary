"It was a battle," Selby told World Snooker.
"My focus dipped in and out. It is still the early stages of the tournament, I don't want to peak too soon."
Higgins won four of the last five frames to overcome Saengkham, ranked 69 places below him at 73 in the world.
"I dodged a bullet there, I'm just delighted to get through," said Higgins.
"I really did think I'd be heading up the road when I went 4-3 down. A lot of these boys are not frightened of top players any more. I felt as if the luck had ran out but the luck's still with me just now."
