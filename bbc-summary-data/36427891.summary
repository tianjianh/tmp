Plans for Sunday parking charges in Edinburgh city centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motorists face paying to park in Edinburgh city centre on Sundays for the first time under new plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Options include bringing in full restrictions across central roads between 08:30 and 18:30, or limiting charges to the afternoon.
Another alternative sees restrictions between 13:00 and 18:30 on all streets except main roads, where charges would also operate in the morning.
Councillors have agreed in principle to extend parking controls to Sundays.
They will work out exactly how the change will be implemented on Tuesday.
