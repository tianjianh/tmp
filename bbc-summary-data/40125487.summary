The 33-year-old Scotland captain made 97 appearances for the Baggies after joining from Manchester United in 2015.
"This is a new challenge for me now and I like to think I respond well to new challenges," Fletcher told Stoke's website.
Fletcher will officially join Mark Hughes' side on 1 July when his contract at The Hawthorns expires.
The Scot, who recovered from chronic bowel disease ulcerative colitis to resume his career in December 2013, made 342 appearances for United but started only five times for the club after Louis van Gaal took over as manager in 2014.
He was granted a free transfer to join West Brom and was handed the captaincy by boss Tony Pulis shortly after his arrival at the club.
Pulis said: "Of course there is a disappointment in seeing 'Fletch' move on and we wish him well.
"I was happy that we made him a fair and competitive offer but, as is his right, he has chosen to accept another opportunity.
"He has been my captain since he came into the club and he has led the team superbly. But that is football and we move on. Nothing stays the same forever and the game moves on."
