Opera theatre plan at Carphone Warehouse founder's estate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carphone Warehouse founder David Ross is bidding to build the first permanent opera house in England in just over a decade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Ross wants to transform the listed stables at his stately home in Leicestershire into a 400-seat opera theatre.
If approved, construction will start at the Nevill Holt Opera in late 2016.
Mr Ross's goal is to replace the current temporary seating with "a perfect venue" for young opera stars.
The current structure, near Market Harborough, can seat up to 350 but is "inadequate and beyond effective economic repair," Nevill Holt Opera general manager Rosenna East said.
Operas have been staged at Mr Ross's home since 2013, but a temporary structure has been used by touring companies for a decade.
Mr Ross wants to expand the summer opera festival and run community and education programmes at the new opera theatre during the rest of the year.
Mrs East said: "It would be a game changer for us at NHO and bring something really special for the region.
"It is a 17th Century stable block which is Grade Two listed and we want to turn it into a beautiful state-of-the-art auditorium for opera."
She said the walls of the stable block are "a beautiful golden colour and they are not going anywhere".
The current structure is not suitable for winter as it is "too cold" so the permanent theatre will allow events on a year-round basis, she said.
"We believe in nurturing young opera stars and this will be a perfect venue for them."
Dating back to the 13th Century, the Nevill Holt estate became home to the opera in 2000.
Mr Ross, who will support the project through his David Ross Foundation, also has a large private collection of modern British sculpture at the hall.
