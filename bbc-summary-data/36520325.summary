Businesses and commuters have blasted delays caused by a weekday road closure which has turned a ten-minute journey into a two-hour "nightmare".

The Mancunian Way in Manchester has been partially closed since it was damaged by heavy rainfall last summer.
The key commuter route is totally closed for a full inspection until it reopens at 06:00 BST on Wednesday.
Manchester City Council said closing it over the weekend would have added to congestion caused by a music festival.
But Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce rejected this, saying: "To think that the disruption would be less on a weekday than at a weekend, even allowing for the Parklife Festival, just doesn't stand up or make any sense."
Commuter Nathan Yates said a 10 minute journey from the Broughton district of Salford to Ancoats in Manchester took him two-and-a-half hours.
"It was horrific, a total nightmare," he said.
Dianne Ellis, from Leeds said her journey of one hour 20 minutes to her workplace in Manchester took three hours 20 minutes.
"I knew about the closures but there was no way I was able to vary my working hours," she said.
Heavy rainfall caused of the holes to open in August, with the second appearing close by a month later.
The problems led to a partial closure while replacement sewer pipes were installed.
Councillor Kate Chappell the executive member for environment and roads on Manchester City Council said the disruption would have been worse at the weekend with 70,000 music fans heading to the Parklife festival at Heaton Park.
"This was the least worst option," she said.
