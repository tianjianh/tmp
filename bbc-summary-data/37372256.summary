[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A finance firm from Manchester has been fined Â£30,000 after sending 65,000 spam texts in just four months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The firm, Carfinance247, was investigated by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), after it received 912 complaints from members of the public.
When challenged by the ICO, the firm claimed the messages had been sent by another company.
The texts were designed to persuade people to visit the firm's website.
Typical messages read: "You have been accepted for Car Finance no upfront costs or credit checks, drive away in a car within 24hrs at www.go-finance.com to stop txt stop."
The website named is now defunct.
"Carfinance247 Ltd tried to hide behind another company and distance themselves from the marketing practices involved," said Steve Eckersley, the ICO's head of enforcement.
"Let me be clear - if your business has hired someone else to provide direct marketing then the responsibility for the campaign is yours. There is nowhere to hide. If you break the rules we will find you and fine you."
Under the law, marketing messages can only be sent to consumers who have already agreed to receive them, or who have been a customer in the past, and have been given an opportunity to opt out of such messages on each occasion.
