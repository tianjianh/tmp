Stirling-based Ramoyle Developments is behind the project at the former Burgh Yard in Galashiels.
It is hoped a planning application for the proposals can now be submitted before the end of this year.
Council leader David Parker said he was delighted the development had now come a "step closer" on the site which used to host a petrol station and garages.
"Since the opening of the Borders Railway, there has been increased activity and investment in the Scottish Borders and recent positive tourism figures underline the potential that the railway can bring to our region," he said.
"Over the next five years I expect further positive announcements and increased investment Borders-wide.
"In recent weeks, there have been positive job announcements in the private sector, with new distilleries on the horizon in Jedburgh and Hawick.
"Subject to planning permission, I look forward to this development enhancing facilities in Galashiels for visitors and the local community."
Jim Turnbull, managing director of Ramoyle Developments, described it as a "significant opportunity" at a "very exciting time" for the town and region as a whole.
"It adds to our currently-expanding development programme and we look forward to the early completion of the mixed use project which we are sure will add materially to what is on offer in the town," he said.
Bill White, the vice-chairman of community group Energise Galashiels, said it was an "exciting milestone" for the town.
"During recent months we have seen a number of projects coming to fruition, such as the Great Tapestry of Scotland, the development of a town centre Business Improvement District (BID) for Galashiels and announcements on a number of new employment and retail opportunities in the pipeline," he said.
"Galashiels is a town full of potential.
"We are delighted that the message is getting out and that the future looks very bright."
