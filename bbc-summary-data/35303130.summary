They might not be the best birds at flying, but this turkey didn't seem to have any problems getting airborne as it settled down for a flight with its owner.
A Twitter user who shared the picture was surprised by what she saw and her post has since gone viral across the world.
It's thought that the turkey may have been an Emotional Support Animal, pets that doctors can prescribe to help comfort people as part of a treatment for a disability.
