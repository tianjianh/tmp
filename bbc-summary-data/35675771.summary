"I think a draw's a fair result, it wasn't the most entertaining game.
"We were done by a set piece, but four points out of two games from where we were last Saturday, I have to take that, and be pleased with the lads' efforts, and the changes that we've made.
"The new players that have come in have given us something. They responded really well Tuesday and tried to do that again today."
