[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts started brightly, with on-loan Stoke winger Moha Choulay's fine run and pass setting up an early chance for Ivan Toney which the striker fired wide of the near post.
But Chesterfield, having collected seven points from their opening three league games, struck first when Jay O'Shea drove confidently home from 15 yards in the 14th minute.
Gboly Ariyibi almost doubled the Spireites' lead shortly afterwards, but his low shot was well turned around the near post by goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler.
Shrewsbury responded well and equalised with their first league goal of the season after 24 minutes as Choulay's corner from the right was headed in by left-back Junior Brown.
Chesterfield ended the half strongly with Leutwiler saving well from both Dan Gardner and O'Shea.
Ched Evans went close for the visitors after the break with a 30-yard free-kick which Leutwiler did well to save before Shrewsbury grabbed the winner six minutes from time when central defender El-Abd powerfully headed in Jim O'Brien's corner from the right.
