The American was cycling on the Rimini coastline on Wednesday, having raced in the World Superbike championship in Italy last Sunday.
The 35-year-old, who has been racing for Red Bull Honda's World Superbike team, is in intensive care in Cesena.
He won his only MotoGP championship in 2006, preventing Valentino Rossi from winning a sixth successive title.
"We would like to thank everyone for their messages of support and the assistance of emergency and medical services," said Red Bull Honda in a statement.
"Once an official statement regarding Nicky's condition is released by the hospital or Nicky's family, a further update from the team will be issued."
