The 27-year-old told the New York Times last week she had been in London preparing for a potential role and was "nervous but excited".
Mamet's play, which first opened on Broadway in 1988 starring Madonna, satirises the Hollywood film industry.
It will run at the Playhouse Theatre from 24 September to 29 November.
Lohan will play the role of Karen, a temporary secretary who puts the relationship of two Hollywood producers under strain.
It will be directed by Lindsay Posner, who previously directed other Mamet plays including Oleanna, A Life in the Theatre and Sexual Perversity in Chicago.
The West End production is being brought to the stage by Theatre Royal Bath, which was also behind recent West End productions Relative Values, Relatively Speaking and Fences.
Further casting will be announced later.
Speed-the Plow's first Broadway run was nominated for two Tony awards.
The role of Karen was later portrayed by Clueless star Alicia Silverstone in a 2006 revival and by Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss in 2008.
Its most recent London production was at the Old Vic in 2008 starring the theatre's artistic director Kevin Spacey as Hollywood executive Fox opposite Laura Michelle Kelly as Karen.
Lohan made her film debut in 1998's The Parent Trap before going on to star in Freaky Friday (2003), Mean Girls (2004) and Disney's Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005).
She also released two albums - Speak and Raw - in 2004 and 2005.
Her career floundered after spending much of 2010 to 2013 in either rehabilitation clinics or entangled in legal problems after a number of arrests and probation violations.
In 2012 she starred as Elizabeth Taylor in TV biopic Liz and Dick, and last year appeared in Paul Schrader's The Canyons.
