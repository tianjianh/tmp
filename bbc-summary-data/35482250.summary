The One Click Politics app has won the information category at the national Apps for Good Awards.
The students and their teachers will attend an awards ceremony at The Barbican in London on Thursday.
A Dragon's Den-style judging panel of 14 experts picked the winners.
Wick High School computer science teacher Chris Aitken said: "I am personally very proud of all our teams that have taken part this year.
"They have shown real focus and dedication and I am sure they will use the skills they've learned in their future school career and beyond."
Alasdair Allan, Minister for Learning and Science, added: "Taking part in a competition like this is an excellent way to show the real practical application of what is being learned in the classroom.
"I would like to congratulate the pupils and staff of Wick High School for winning through and wish them all the best for the launch of their app."
The Apps for Good programme has the backing of Digital World, a campaign promoting careers in the digital technology industry.
Skills Development Scotland has been involved in developing the campaign.
Two years ago, Wick High School held what was thought to be the first wearable technology competition of its kind in Scottish education.
Working in teams of two or three, S2 pupils were challenged to design an app for use with Google Glass eyewear or Samsung Gear 2 and Pebble smartwatches.
