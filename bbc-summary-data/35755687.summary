Chelmsford Crown Court heard the 24-year-old's death involved rival drug gangs. Three others were convicted last June for their role in his killing.
Danielle Russell, 27, from Southend, and two teenage boys were found guilty of manslaughter, conspiracy to commit GBH and conspiracy to commit robbery.
Russell was jailed for 11 years, and the teenagers, who cannot be named, were given detention orders for ten years and four months with a five-year extended licence.
Suleiman, who was also found guilty of robbery and unlawful wounding, was arrested in Norway at the conclusion of their trial.
Following the sentencing, Anton's mother said she was "very disappointed" that Suleiman had not been convicted of murder.
"He had the knife and he killed my son Anton Levin.  He has been jailed for 16 years but I would have preferred that he had been jailed for life.
"I hope he thinks about the harm and distress he has caused me and my family. But this will never bring my son back," she said.
