[SN]TITLE[SN]
East Sussex bus cuts rejected by council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposed cuts to bus services in East Sussex have been rejected by the county council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council has recommended the cuts, which would affect 62 bus routes in the area, saving Â£1.79m over two years, be rejected by the cabinet.
East Sussex County Council currently subsidises the bus services, which are run by private companies.
Campaigners previously branded the cuts as "deeply regressive" and said people in rural areas would be stranded.
The proposed cuts would see some buses running twice a week instead of daily while some Sunday services would be stopped altogether.
The final decision will be made by at a cabinet meeting on 16 December.
