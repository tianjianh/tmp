Mrs Tomlinson was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2000 and died in 2007 after raising almost £2m for charity.
Her husband, Mike, and a team of supporters, including TV presenter Charlie Webster and ex-Rugby League professionals Keith Senior and Paul Highton, set off from the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London in June.
The money pledged online for the ride has so far raised about £14,000.
Mrs Tomlinson was an ambassador for the 2012 London Olympics bid.
