Jackson and Love played together on 52 number one songs, supporting the likes of Elvis Presley, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin and the Doobie Brothers.
Isaac Hayes, Sam & Dave and Alicia Keys were among other acts they worked with.
Jackson's widow Amy said her husband had "led an incredible life" and left "an amazing music legacy".
Mrs Jackson said she was by his side on Tuesday night when he died in hospital in Memphis.
The Memphis Horns were a staple of much of the music made at Stax Records, one of the most important R&B and soul labels of the 1960s.
The duo provided the horn tracks on dozens of well-known songs, including Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline, Presley's Suspicious Minds and Al Green's Let's Stay Together.
The pair - who can also be heard on Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer and U2's Angel of Harlem - were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2008.
Love died in 2012 at the age of 70, not long after he and Jackson became only the second instrumental back-up group in history to receive the Grammy lifetime achievement award.
