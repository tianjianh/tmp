Newcastle have recalled defender Mike Williamson from his loan at Wolves after an injury to Jamaal Lascelles.

Williamson, 32, was due to remain with the Championship side until January but Lascelles suffered a minor hamstring injury at Crystal Palace on Saturday.
Williamson has made only two League Cup appearances for the Magpies this term and played five matches for Wolves.
Newcastle are one place off the bottom of the Premier League and have conceded eight goals in their last two games.
