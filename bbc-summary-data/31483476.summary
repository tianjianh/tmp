In pictures: Hong Kong 'parallel trade' protests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Angry protests have taken place in a shopping centre in Hong Kong against mainlanders who visit the territory to shop.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hong Kong residents have long complained about mainlanders buying up goods at lower tax rates and then selling them on at home at a profit, so-called parallel trading.
They say this leaves Hong Kongers with a shortage of basic supplies and pushes up the cost of goods, while also accusing the mainlanders of bad behaviour.
