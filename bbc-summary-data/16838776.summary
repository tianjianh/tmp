The thieves stole around Â£1,000 from the Compass Advocacy Network (CAN) in Ballymoney in January.
But now, the Holywood star, who recently met the group in Belfast, has donated a "substantial sum" to help the charity.
CAN works with children aged between 12 and 18 with learning difficulties.
The money stolen from the charity's Seymour Street ofices was raised during the BBC Children in Need campaign.
The manager of the charity, Linda McKendry, said they were "really, really touched" by Troyer's generosity.
In a letter to CAN he said: "I heard what happened and I just wanted to help you and the kids.
"Please tell them hello from me. Also, remember you can do anything you set your mind to, always be optimistic."
CAN is a registered charity that employs eight people and uses about 25 volunteers.
Around 240 people use the services the charity provides on a regular basis.
