Tranmere have released six players after their failure to win promotion back to the Football League.

Iain Turner, Adam Mekki, Erico Sousa, Sam Ilesanmi, Darren Askew and Tolani Omotola are all leaving the club.
Cole Stockton, Jake Kirby, Mitch Duggan, Luke Pilling and Evan Gumbs have been offered contracts, while Steve McNulty has a new 12-month deal.
Tranmere lost 3-1 to Forest Green Rovers in the National League play-off final at Wembley on 14 May.
After extending 33-year-old defender McNulty's contract by a further year, Rovers, who were relegated out of the Football League at the end of the 2014-15 season, also plan to offer new terms to Lee Vaughan, Liam Ridehalgh, Michael Ihiekwe, Lois Maynard and Adam Buxton.
