A burglar alarm at a supermarket may have been triggered by a feline intruder, police have said.

Officers arrived at the Co-operative store in Old Harlow, Essex, on Wednesday to find the building locked with the tabby prowler still inside.
Special Sgt Krystina Booth wrote on Twitter: "We found our suspect still on scene... Poor kitty."
The BBC has been unable to confirm what happened to the cat after police left the scene.
A Co-op spokesman said a power cut may have triggered the alarm, but added the cat was a regular visitor to the shop.
"He (or she) is a regular and walks through the automatic doors with customers. We have to shoo him (or her) out," the spokesman added.
Essex Police confirmed it had received a call at 02:20 GMT reporting the alarm was going off.
When officers reached the shop, they found the building was secure, but "located a cat inside the premises", a force spokeswoman said.
