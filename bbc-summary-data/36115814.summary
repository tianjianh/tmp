The 23-year-old Denmark international refused to be on the bench for the visit of Bournemouth on 9 April and is now training with the club's under-21s.
"After that game, he said that he didn't want to be considered for any of the games going forwards," said Black.
"I didn't have a choice apart from remove him. I don't want people who don't want to be at Aston Villa."
Villa's relegation from the Premier League was confirmed with last weekend's defeat at Manchester United.
On Friday, owner Randy Lerner released a statement accepting blame for the end of the club's 28-year stay in the top flight.
That came at the end of a week in which directors David Bernstein and Mervyn King left the club and striker Gabriel Agbonlahor was suspended for being pictured with what is alleged to be laughing gas.
