The seventh-seeded English pair, who won Commonwealth gold in 2014, took the match 21-17, 21-12.
They will face Indonesian Olympic champions Tontowi Ahmad and Liliyana Natsir in the next round on Friday.
"We're really happy with how we performed," Gabby Adcock told BBC Sport.
The Adcocks beat the Indonesian duo at the same stage at last year's event en-route to the semi-finals, which was their best ever result.
They are hoping to become the first British finalists since 2007 and first GB winners of the event since Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms claimed the mixed-doubles title in 2005.
"It would be nice if we could have the same result against Ahmad and Natsir as last year, but we know it's going to be extremely tough," Chris Adcock told BBC Sport.
"Our dream is to win this one day and it doesn't get any easier, but we'll give it our best and hopefully still be here for the final on Sunday."
In the men's doubles, it was an Indonesian pairing who reached the quarter-finals at the expense of British pair Peter Briggs and Tom Wolfenden, who lost 21-13 21-14 to Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo.
