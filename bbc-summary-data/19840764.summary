Sean Price: Career of disgraced police chief

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When he was appointed chief constable in 2003 Sean Price described the Cleveland force's sometimes troubled history as a "poison chalice".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was referring to the long-running Operation Lancet inquiry into alleged police corruption, which led to former Det Supt Ray Mallon - popularly known as  "Robocop" - being asked to resign.
Less than 10 years into the post Mr Price himself became the subject of an inquiry. He was found guilty of gross misconduct and has now been dismissed.
Born in 1957, Sean Price attended Liverpool Bluecoat School, then gained a BSc at Queen Mary's College, University of London.
He joined Merseyside Police in 1979 straight from university and within a few years was promoted to the rank of chief superintendent.
Notable postings included head of drug squad operations, and head of the unit responsible for the wholesale restructuring of Merseyside Police.
In 1998 Mr Price moved to Nottinghamshire, where he was responsible for all uniform and CID operational policing within the county.
Before his promotion to deputy chief constable in 2001, he gained a masters degree in criminology from the University of Cambridge.
At Cleveland Police he promised to deliver "citizen focused neighbourhood policing", even spending some time on the front line himself.
He introduced the "Putting People First" programme and received the Queen's Police Medal in the Queen's Birthday Honours in June 2005.
Cleveland Police was named Force of the Year in 2011.
Married to a police officer, Mr Price's recreations as listed in Debretts include cycling, cooking, reading, and playing musical instruments (badly).
The former chief constable remains on bail as part of Operation Sacristy, a corruption investigation relating to individuals with past and present associations with Cleveland Police Authority.
Mr Price said: "As chief constable I have been, and remain, immensely proud of the achievements of Cleveland Police and the dedication of its officers and staff.
"On a personal note, I continue to deny any wrongdoing in this or any other matter."
