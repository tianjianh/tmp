Windsor Park is hosting a match between Linfield and Cliftonville and delays are expected around Lisburn Road and Boucher Road from 14:00 to 17:00 GMT.
Belfast's Christmas lights are to be switched on, leading to delays in the city centre from 16:30 to 19:30 GMT.
M3 traffic could be heavy from 15:30 GMT onwards as the SSE Arena hosts the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
A police spokesman said motorists should leave extra time for their journeys.
