The well-known London Road Fire Station in the city centre is to be refurbished and expanded.
A boutique hotel and spa, restaurants, bars, flats, and offices are included in the plans, while a new glass prism will feature in a central courtyard.
Final tours of the building are taking place on Saturday and Sunday.
Tour guide Jonathan Schofield said his visits to the station, which closed in 1986, have been "the most popular and in some ways, the most emotional".
"The building speaks to the heart of Manchester with not only its scale and presence, but also its human story," he said.
Plans for the building's refurbishment have been submitted to Manchester City Council.
Developers Allied London, who bought the building in 2015, hope to start work on the redevelopment later in the year and said it would be "sensitively refurbished and expanded" to "preserve its unique character".
