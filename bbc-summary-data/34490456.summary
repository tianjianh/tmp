Chris Coleman's side needed just a point to reach next summer's Euro 2016 in France, after drawing with Israel last month.
They lost 2-0 in Zenica on Saturday, but Israel's home loss to Cyprus means Wales are through.
The result came after the Wales rugby team lost to Australia at Twickenham.
Coleman said after the match: "Wow. I can't explain how this feels. I'm disappointed we lost but I know what's coming."
Gareth Bale called it the best defeat of his life.
Midfielder Aaron Ramsey added: "What a great moment for Welsh sport. What a moment for making history. We have finally made it to a major tournament."
The historic qualification came on the day dubbed "Super Saturday", with the nation's rugby team taking on the Wallabies earlier.
Wales had already qualified for the quarter-finals but missed out on a more favourable tie as a result of Saturday's 15-6 defeat.
They will now face South Africa in the next round.
Captain Sam Warburton said after the game: "There's no easy way to the World Cup final."
At the time of Wales' last qualification for a major football tournament, Harold Macmillan was prime minister and Elvis Presley was top of the charts with Jailhouse Rock.
The team went into the weekend knowing either a draw on Saturday or in the home game against group minnows Andorra on Tuesday would guarantee them a place in France.
But Israel's 2-1 loss at home to Cyprus meant another point was not necessary.
Wales lost their unbeaten record and top spot in Group B to Belgium, after they won 4-1 in Andorra.
But thousands of fans back home took to social media to celebrate their first appearance at a gathering of football's elite nations for generations.
In 1958, Wales were eventually knocked out in the quarter-final at the hands of the eventual winners of the Sweden world cup, Pele's Brazil.
