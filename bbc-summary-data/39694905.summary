The 34-year-old, who has also played for Bedford Blues, won the Premiership with Quins in 2012 and the LV= Cup in 2013.
"The time is right for me and I feel very lucky to be able to make this decision on my own terms," Dickson told Harlequins' official website.
"I will be taking some time to consider my post-career options."
Dickson has played 167 times for Quins and scored 20 tries since making the switch from Bedford in 2009.
He was drafted into the England squad during the 2012 summer tour to South Africa and appeared in the second midweek match against the South African Barbarians, replacing his younger brother, Lee, currently at Northampton Saints.
Since 2015, Dickson has coached National League 3 London and South East side Effingham and Leatherhead and also turned his hand to refereeing, taking charge of the Championship clash between Richmond and London Irish on Christmas Eve last year.
"I am able to look back at my playing career with great pride and I will cherish the memories that Harlequins has given me, both on and off the field," he added.
"It will be difficult to watch on from the peripheries going forward, but John Kingston and the coaching team have this squad in a great place and I look forward to seeing their progression."
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston said: "Karl has had a wonderfully successful eight years at the club since he joined us from Bedford.
"He has frequently had to play the role of understudy to Danny Care but has always stepped up with tremendous consistency when asked to do so.
"I have no doubt he has been the best number two scrum half in the Premiership for many years and his style of play so accurately reflected the needs of the team."
