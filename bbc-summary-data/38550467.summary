[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Currently 35 part-time students are on six degree courses taught by 18 part-time tutors, all practicing artists.
The tutors said they had not been consulted over plans to withdraw the courses in their present form.
A university spokesman said it was conducting a wide-ranging review.
He said this is to "be able to face the challenges in the higher education sector in the years ahead".
"As part of that review the university is considering new ways of providing education for adults and fine arts programmes," he added.
Bangor University is "anxious to see these programmes continue" and in talks with the local tertiary college GrÅµp Llandrillo Menai as they are "exploring ways of providing the courses".
Wanda Zyborksa, a tutor on the fine arts course, told BBC Radio Wales: "We hope they will reverse the decision."
