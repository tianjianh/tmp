The BBC has bowed to pressure and changed the controversial format of its Wimbledon highlights programme after mounting criticism.

Wimbledon 2Day, hosted by Clare Balding, saw presenters mingle with a live audience and included funny home video clips alongside daily highlights.
In its review, The Guardian said: "The whole show is a mess."
A BBC spokeswoman said "Of course we listen to audience feedback and that helps to shape the changes we make."
In a scathing review in The Daily Mail, the show was referred to as "super right-on" and "tooth-achingly trendy".
