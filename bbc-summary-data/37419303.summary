[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A spurned mistress has been jailed for life after being found guilty of murdering her lover and putting his body in the boot of his car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zatoon Bibi, 37, enlisted the help of her ex-husband Gul Nawaz, 45, to murder DJ and music producer Tanveer Iqbal.
Nawaz was handed a life term and their 16-year-old son was detained for six years after also being convicted of murder at Birmingham Crown Court.
Mr Iqbal, 33, of Smethwick, was found strangled on 2 February.
Bibi plotted revenge after being rejected by Mr Iqbal and his remains were found crammed into a cardboard box in his car, the jury was told during the six-week trial.

A 17-year-old girl who admitted perverting the course of justice after providing a false alibi will be sentenced on Friday.
Judge Mark Wall said Bibi must serve a minimum 27-year sentence and told her: "Your selfishness and manipulative behaviour are truly breathtaking."
Gul Nawaz, of Roway Lane, Oldbury, must serve a minimum term of 25 years.
The judge lifted a reporting restriction to name their 16-year-old son Kashim Nawaz as the third person convicted of Mr Iqbal's murder.
He told Bibi: "You were the one person pushing your own son to commit murder."
Mr Iqbal and Bibi had an "unconventional and complicated relationship" which their spouses were "fully aware" of, the court had heard.
However, in August last year Mr Iqbal banned the pair from any contact and was angry after discovering in January that they had continued to talk in secret.
QC Sally Howes said: "It is clear that in the period leading up to January 31, Zatoon Bibi is stirring up trouble between Mr Iqbal and his wife."
Mr Iqbal ended the affair but was killed after Bibi lured him to her home on 31 January claiming she wanted to give him some birthday cake.
CCTV and mobile phone analysis linked Bibi and Nawaz to the killing, and subsequent efforts to abandon his remains.
Det Insp Paul Joyce said: "Although we can't say exactly what happened we do know that together - and with the help of their son - they strangled Tanveer inside Bibi's home."
The officer said three hours before Mr Iqbal went to Bibi's home, Gul Nawaz was in Poundland buying the "murder kit ready to kill him". The "kit" consisted of rope and heavy-duty tape.
Mr Iqbal's family said in a statement: "Tanveer was taken away from us in a way which has had a profound effect and changed our lives forever.
"It is indescribable pain to lose a loved one in such a brutal manner."
