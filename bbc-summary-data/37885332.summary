Edinburgh Leisure said the Meadowbank display could not go ahead because of a risk of debris and smoke blowing into the stand.
And Aberdeen City Council tweeted to say that the display at the beach was cancelled because of "deteriorating weather conditions".
Forecasters have predicted strong northerly winds across the country.
Winds are expected to be 27mph and gusting in Edinburgh by 18:00, when the Meadowbank event was due to start.
Organisers apologised but said it was not possible to reschedule the display. Anyone who bought a ticket will be refunded within 14 days.
About 5,000 people were expected to attend the sell-out event.
Edinburgh Leisure said in a statement: "We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused but hope you will understand that Edinburgh Leisure will always put the health and safety of our customers at the forefront of all its decisions."
Doors were due to open at 18:00, with the fireworks display due to get under way at 19:30.
Aberdeen City Council tweeted: "Unfortunately we have taken the decision to cancel tonight's firework display at Aberdeen Beach due to deteriorating weather conditions."
The display at the beach was due to begin at 20:00.
In North Berwick, a display due to take place at the East Lothian Yacht Club was also postponed due to safety concerns.
A statement on the ELYC website said: "It is with great regret that we have to postpone the fireworks due to the strength and direction of the wind making it unsafe. It is vital that safety for spectators, volunteers and buildings is the top priority."
The club said it planned to arrange an alternative date for the display.
