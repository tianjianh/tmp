There are replicas of more than 300 iconic buildings, such as Grand Central Terminal, the Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal - and even Stonehenge!
The team behind Gulliver's Gate says it's the world's largest display of miniatures, and opens to the public this week in Times Square in New York City.
The attraction is 49,000 square feet (4,552 square metres) in size, and cost around US$40 million (about Â£32 million)!
Take a look at the vid above, with Michael Langer from the exhibition to explain more.
