[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 1-0 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mohamed Eisa's fourth goal in three games was enough to earn Cheltenham a League Two win against Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decisive moment came in the 38th minute when Eisa headed in a fine cross from Kyle Storer on the right.
Cheltenham lost playmaker Jerell Sellars to injury in the first half and Jon Flatt had been called into action several times to keep Crawley out before the opening goal.
The on-loan Wolves goalkeeper denied Mark Randall, Lewis Young and Jordan Roberts with smart saves.
Enzio Boldewijn shot high from a good position for Crawley early in the second half, but Cheltenham then pressed for a second goal.
Crawley had the ball in the net after 57 minutes, but Thomas Verheydt had fouled Flatt, knocking the ball out of his hands and it was disallowed.
Jordon Forster had to clear off the line for Cheltenham after a corner was met by the head of Mark Connolly, who saw another header bounce just wide.
Substitute Matt Harrold also went close to levelling, but Cheltenham held on.
