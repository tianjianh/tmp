The 21-year-old will be the headline act at the Fusion Festival in Birmingham's Cofton Park in August.
He'll headline the festival's first ever Friday night. Bieber was last in the UK for the 2013 Believe tour.
Also announced for the event are Tinie Tempah, Rixton, DJ Fresh, Fuse ODG, Rudimental and McBusted. "I love the UK and I'm excited to be playing at Fusion this year," says Bieber.
"There are some great artists on the line-up so to be headlining the Friday night, is a real honour."
His gigs in 2013 at London's O2 Arena upset fans after he started one concert late, leaving some of them stranded and others having to go home shortly after it began.
Another concert was disrupted when he left the stage mid-song after complaining of being "light of breath".
The Canadian was also forced to explain himself after he lashed out at a photographer after what he said had been a "rough week".
Bieber explained in a series of messages on Twitter shortly afterwards that his adrenaline was running high and he had "let the paps get the best of me" in London.
