After struggling for first-team football, the England international has been linked with a January move to Premier League rivals West Ham.
Sturridge has yet to score in his nine top-flight appearances this season, of which only four have been starts.
"There is absolutely no thought to sell any player from the first-team squad," said Klopp.
"I don't think it would make sense."
The 27-year-old forward has scored four goals in the EFL Cup and two for England, but is sidelined with a calf injury and will miss the Reds' trip to Bournemouth on Sunday.
"Unfortunately Daniel is not in training now and that is what I am more concerned about than any transfer rumours," Klopp added.
"But I am prepared for everything you could ask me in January."
