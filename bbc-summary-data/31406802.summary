The Hoegh Osaka was run aground after listing at 50 degrees on 3 January.
The 51,000-tonne vessel was eventually righted and towed back to Southampton. The vehicles onboard, worth Â£60m, have been removed over the past two weeks.
It set sail on Tuesday afternoon under its own power and arrived in Falmouth, Cornwall, at 09:45 GMT.
A spokesman at Falmouth docks said two tugs were in attendance when it came into port.
An underwater survey will begin on Thursday before work to repair internal steelwork and remove contaminated oil and water can be carried out.
The vessel departed Southampton at 14:30 on Tuesday after "generator issues" led to two-and-a-half hour delay, a spokesman for the owners of the ship Hoegh Autoliners said.
After repairs, which are expected to take up to three weeks, the ship is expected to return to normal service, he added.
A previous inspection showed only "minimal damage" to the ship.
More than Â£60m worth of Jaguar Land Rover, Hyundai and Mini cars, as well as JCB vehicles were on board the ship when it was grounded.
The incident is being investigated by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.
