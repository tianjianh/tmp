[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England captain Joe Root hit a six off younger brother Billy to win the match as Yorkshire began their One-Day Cup campaign by beating Nottinghamshire.

Notts were always up against it after being bowled out for 185 on home soil.
Australian batsman Pete Handscomb then aided Root - who finished unbeaten on 75 - as the Tykes got home on 191-3, with more than 17 overs to spare.
It was a second group defeat in as many games for Notts after losing to Worcestershire at New Road on Thursday.
Notts were always struggling after being asked to bat first, Tim Bresnan claiming 3-22 as they were bowled out with 55 deliveries unused.
In a contest which had 18 full internationals on show, Zimbabwean Brendan Taylor top-scored for the hosts, with 60 from 59 deliveries.
Riki Wessels (41) and Michael Lumb, son of former Tykes opener Richard, made 35 but there was little else of note.
And the visitors' third-wicket stand of 127 between Root and Hanscomb, who made 46, nullified any hopes of an Outlaws' fightback.
After hitting seven fours, Root even finished the game in style at Trent Bridge as he pulled his brother's off-spin over midwicket for a mighty six.
"At the end, it was difficult when I hit my brother for six," said Root. "But the professional side took over."
