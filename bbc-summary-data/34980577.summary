Scottish MPs taking part in Syria air strikes debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish MPs are taking part in a Commons debate and vote on whether the UK should launch air strikes against the Islamic State terror group in Syria.

Nicola Sturgeon confirmed the SNP would vote against military action.
Labour's only Scottish MP Ian Murray also opposes air strikes.
Former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said he would back David Cameron's motion, along with his Liberal Democrat colleagues.
RAF Typhoon jets are reportedly being readied for deployment from Lossiemouth in Moray to join any military action in Syria.
The prime minister caused controversy on the eve of the vote by labelling Mr Corbyn and other opponents of military action as "terrorist sympathisers", but refused to apologise when he faced angry calls to do so as the debate opened in the Commons shortly after 11:30.
Mr Cameron said the debate was about "how we fight terrorism" rather than "whether we fight terrorism" and that he respected the views of those who are opposed to air strikes in Syria, and described the Islamic State group as an "evil death cult" and "medieval monsters".
Calling on MPs to "answer the call from our allies" and take action, Mr Cameron said: "The House should be under no illusion that these terrorists are plotting to kill us and to radicalise our children right now."
He asked: "Do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat and do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands from where they are plotting to kill British people, or do we sit back and wait for them to attack us?"
The SNP's leader at Westminster, Angus Robertson, pressed the prime minister over his claim that there were 70,000 "moderate" troops in Syria who would be able to back up air strikes by taking and holding territory from the Islamic State group.
Mr Robertson asked how many of these were truly "moderate" and how many were fundamentalists, and questioned how the UK could plan long-term stability in Syria given its record in Libya.
Mr Robertson said the government "may well win the vote tonight, but it will do so with the support of only two out of 59 Scottish MPs."
He added: "Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past, let's not give the green light to military action without a comprehensive and credible plan to win the peace."
Former SNP leader and Scottish first minister Alex Salmond warned that the UK was being asked to intervene in a "bloody civil war of huge complexity" in Syri.
He added:  "We're being asked to do it without an exit strategy and no reasonable means of saying we're going to make a difference.  We should not give the Prime Minister that permission."
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said a decision to bomb Islamic State terrorists in Syria would "almost inevitably lead to the deaths of innocents".
Mr Corbyn refused to answer directly whether he would want Britain to also withdraw from air strikes against IS in Iraq, but accused the prime minister of attempting to rush a vote through the Commons before public opinion shifts against "ill-thought-out" military action.
He added: "In my view only a negotiated political and diplomatic endeavour to bring about an end to the civil war in Syria will bring some hope to the millions who've lost their homes, who are refugees camped out in various points across Europe dreaming of a day that they can go home.
"I think our over-riding goal should be to end that civil war in Syria. And obviously also to protect the people of this country."
Mr Corbyn has been been forced to offer a free vote to his MPs after a shadow cabinet rebellion.
Some nights in Westminster you can feel a crackle in the air, you can sense the tension, and sometimes even see the weight of responsibilities that MPs know they carry collectively in the looks on their faces. Last night was one of them.
For government ministers this vote has been a very long time coming, an obvious extension of the action British forces are taking in Iraq.
Bombing is, to them, part of a complicated set of solutions, but a straightforward decision to make. Don't confuse that however with a sentiment that it is an easy choice.
MPs on all sides have agonised over making this decision and now, less than 24 hours before the vote there are still dozens who are yet to make up their minds.
The government is still confident of a comfortable majority. Significant numbers of Labour MPs are expected to vote with them, perhaps 50 or so have expressed as much. But on both sides of the argument there have been last-ditch attempts to screw down supporters.

The Commons timetable has been cleared for a 10 hour-plus debate before a crunch vote at about 22:00.
The government motion says military action is "only one component of a broader strategy" to tackle IS.
It adds that the UK government will not deploy troops in "ground combat operations". The motion would specifically authorise air strikes "exclusively" against IS in Syria.
At least 110 MPs from six different parties have signed up to an amendment seeking to block air strikes - spearheaded by Tory Foreign Affairs Committee member John Baron and the SNP's Angus Robertson.
The amendment welcomes the "renewed impetus towards peace and reconstruction in Syria" and the government's recognition that a comprehensive strategy is required to defeat IS.
But it states that it does not believe the case has been made for the UK to join the 10 countries that are already carrying out airstrikes in Syria.
SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlined her party's stance during a briefing of journalists on Tuesday.
She said Mr Cameron had made progress in convincing sceptics but the SNP remained concerned about the lack of reliable ground troops and the need for post-conflict reconstruction in Syria.
The Liberal Democrats said their eight MPs, including Mr Carmichael, would support the government in the vote.
The MP for Orkney and Shetland described it as the ''hardest political decision of my life'' but said supporting military action was the right thing to do.
Mr Carmichael said: "Whatever decision the Commons takes today will have consequences.
"Be in no doubt, however, that failing to act will also have consequences. The civil war that has killed thousands and which has seen unprecedented numbers of people displaced from their homes and come to Europe as refugees will continue."
