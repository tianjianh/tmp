Boxing: Liam Williams' title fight with Nav Mansouri postponed again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' British and Commonwealth super-welterweight champion Liam Williams' title defence against Nav Mansouri on Saturday has been postponed again.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A virus prompted Williams to withdraw from a bout scheduled for February.
Now Rotherham's Mansouri has pulled out of meeting Williams in London because of an Achilles problem.
Williams, an unbeaten 23-year-old from Church Village near Cardiff, claimed the vacant super-welterweight belt in December by beating Kris Carslaw.
