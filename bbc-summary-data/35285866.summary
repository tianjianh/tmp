The family of a British backpacker who died on holiday in Thailand say they have "concerns" over the investigation into his death.

Luke Miller, 26, of the Isle of Wight, died on the island of Koh Tao on Friday.
Thai police said a post-mortem examination showed he drowned.
But, his sister Maria said the family would not rely on what Thai authorities said as there was so much speculation as to what happened.
Mr Miller, a bricklayer from Newport, travelled to Thailand with a friend on 22 December to spend Christmas and New Year's Eve there.
He was found dead on 8 January in a hotel pool, on the same island where two British backpackers, Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were murdered.
His family said they have been receiving "different versions" of what might have happened.
According to police, Mr Miller's body was found on Friday morning at Sunset Bar on Sairee Beach.
Witnesses and CCTV footage at the bar showed he was there until the early hours of the morning.
But, the security guards who regularly search the pool for lost belongings after parties did not find Mr Miller when they made a search at 05:30 local time. His body was discovered at about 07:20.
His sister Maria said: "There's different answers everywhere, there is nothing set in stone, no actual facts have been displayed... I do have concerns about how it has been dealt with.
"I don't think anyone knows what really went on, but we will find answers and we will get answers."
Police Lt. Col. Napa Senatip, a police investigator on Koh Tao who handled the case, told the BBC that police were not looking further into the case because "the investigation showed no clues signalling that this was a murder", and the autopsy showed that the cause of death was drowning.
Mr Miller's mother Sara Cotton said the pain of losing her son was "just horrendous".
"I just want him home to cuddle him and tell him I love him," she said.
An online fundraising page to repatriate Mr Miller's body has reached its Â£10,000 target.
