Liverpool fan in £4,000 payout over Old Trafford toilet row

A Liverpool supporter has received £4,000 after allegedly settling a false arrest claim sparked by a row over fans being allowed access to the toilet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieth Culvin sued Greater Manchester Police (GMP) over his arrest for allegedly assaulting an officer after a match between Manchester United and Liverpool at Old Trafford in 2013.
The Spirit of Shankly committee member said he regularly negotiated with police before matches.
A GMP spokesman declined to comment.
Details of the case have been released by the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF), which helped Mr Culvin in his legal action.
Mr Culvin said he was among a Spirit of Shankly deputation which agreed with GMP that fans would be allowed access to toilets when they were kept behind at the stadium after the match had finished.
But, on the day of the game, he alleged he had to intervene when officers inside the ground did not appear to be keeping to the agreement.
He claimed as he tried to make the fans' case he saw a figure in yellow tumble over seats near him and he later discovered it was a police officer.
The fan alleged he thought he was arrested by officers who believed he pushed the PC over.
Mr Culvin claimed the case was later dropped when mobile phone footage appeared to exonerate him.
He asserted that relations between Liverpool fans and GMP had improved, but added: "Sadly on this occasion, the policing from some left a lot to be desired."
FSF case worker Amanda Jacks said: "What made the real difference here... was Kieth himself having the presence of mind to ask his fellow fans to use their mobile phones to film events as they unfolded."
