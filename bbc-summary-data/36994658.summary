[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sutton went ahead after 23 minutes when Dan Wishart curled home a 20-yard free-kick and the hosts found themselves a man down shortly after the goal as Bradley Wood was sent off for stamping on Roarie Deacon following an altercation.
But the Imps equalised six minutes after half-time when Sam Habergham spotted Ross Worner off his line and lobbed the goalkeeper from 45 yards.
Sutton made their numerical advantage tell late on as Jamie Collins headed home a corner with five minutes remaining and Deacon finished off a counter-attack in stoppage time.
