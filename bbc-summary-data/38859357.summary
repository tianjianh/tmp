Rooney, 26, is one start away from triggering a clause in his contract which will keep him at the Racecourse next season.
Mark Carrington and Paul Rutherford are also close to triggering new deals and Keates is keen to reach a resolution.
"All being well we can come to agreements with them," Keates said.
"I've explained the situation, what we want as a football club going forward.
"There's things that need ironing out and all being well we can get them done."
