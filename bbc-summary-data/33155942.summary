Emergency services were called to a bungalow in Penhalls Way, Playing Place, at about 13:45 BST, after they received a package, police said.
Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service staff used breathing apparatus to enter the property and police and ambulance crews were all at the scene.
A police cordon was set up. No other properties were thought to be affected.
Although two people were left unwell, police said three people - aged 25, 30 and 54 - were examined at the scene by ambulance crews.
Chief Inspector Ian Drummond-Smith, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the package would be sent off for forensic examination.
He said: "They did feel unwell. There were no serious injuries and no requirement for them to attend hospital."
Emergency services began winding down their operation at about 17:00.
