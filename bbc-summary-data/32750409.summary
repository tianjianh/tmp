Mayor Boris Johnson plans rickshaw ban for London

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boris Johnson has announced he wants to ban rickshaws in London to help ease traffic congestion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mayor does not have the authority to do that so he is seeking government legislation for a pedicab ban.
He also wants to reduce the number of minicabs, a move that the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association has welcomed.
It estimates there were 13,000 new private hire drivers in London in 2014 partly owing to the rise in popularity of cheaper car booking apps like Uber.
Mr Johnson has been making the argument to ban pedicabs since December 2012 because they "jam up the capital's roads and consistently fail to ensure the safety of their passengers".
On any night in the West End you can't miss the bells of Rickshaws (or Pedicabs as they are officially known) plying for trade.
While some tourists and the odd refreshed businessman seem to enjoy them, the authorities have wanted to get rid of them for a long time. While there are responsible operators, there is also a cowboy element where there are fears over safety and concerns over the amount they charge.
In 2002, I sat in court as the black cabbies tried and failed to get them banned. Pedicabs operate using a loophole in the metropolitan public carriage act 1869 and are classed as stage carriages not Hackney cabs and so can ply for hire. If the mayor wants them banned he will need to redo that legislation. That will take time and will probably involve legal challenges.
