Wirral flooding: Homes evacuated as water levels rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to a hundred homes were flooded in Wirral, forcing dozens of residents to leave, after "a month's rain fell in 48 hours".

People living near Dibbinsdale Brook in Moreton said their properties were "under eight inches of water" after a stream burst its banks.
Roads also flooded in Bebington, Heswall, Neston and Bromborough.
Housing association Magenta Living said 28 "families, couples and individuals" had to leave their homes.
A clean-up operation was continuing into Wednesday night as officers from the Environment Agency worked with Wirral Council to help affected residents and assess the damage.
Brian Simpson, chief executive of Magenta Living, said Maryland Lane Community Centre had been opened as a crisis centre and local shops were providing supplies, including meals.
He said staff were working to find suitable accommodation for those who needed it.
"We put the safety and welfare of our tenants first and will continue to work with them and get them home as soon as possible," he said.
Earlier, firefighters rescued a man from a car surrounded by flood water about 4ft (1.2m) deep in Bebington.
The Environment Agency said two inches of rain (approximately one month's worth) had fallen within two days.
Resident Darryl Reed, who only moved in a week ago, said six bungalows and a block of flats in Wastdale Close were among the properties affected.
"When we woke up this morning, the place was about eight inches under water - it's raining again and the water levels have risen to about 10 inches," he said.
"Outside on the street, it's about three feet deep."
Mersey Fire and Rescue Service earlier urged drivers "not to enter flood water on roads as it is difficult to judge how deep the water is".
Bus journeys were also disrupted, said Merseytravel.

The Environment Agency issued a formal flood alert for the area and was working with Wirral Council to clear blocked drains.
A spokesman said: "Surface water drains and ultimately the rivers were at capacity on this occasion and unable to clear the rainfall fast enough to prevent flooding.
"Whilst we expect the weather to ease during the evening we urge people to stay safe and not drive through flood water."
A Wirral Council spokeswoman said the volume of water was caused by "exceptional rainfall" since Saturday.
"There is very little we can do about it, other than to clear the roads as quickly as possible. The surface water drainage systems and the main rivers only have a finite capacity.
"We are working hard with our contractors to clear a number of flooded roads across the borough, but sheer volume of water caused by exceptional rainfall last Saturday and on Tuesday and Wednesday has meant that river levels at main water courses are high and causing some localised flooding."
Residents in one street have told me how the water level was knee-deep in their homes at one stage.
Many have been evacuated and now face a difficult night away from their homes.
The properties affected are next to a brook which flows into the River Birket. When the brook burst its banks this morning, some people's front gardens were swamped with water. Others have described floating floorboards, damaged electrics and water-logged furniture.
The Environment Agency has had officers here this afternoon and have pledged to work with Wirral Council to help those affected most seriously.
