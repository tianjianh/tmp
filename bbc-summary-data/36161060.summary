The City of the Unexpected event needs 2,000 choristers, 1,000 dancers, and 13 magicians - and a performing mouse.
The Wales Millennium Centre and National Theatre Wales production will take place on September 17 - 18.
Dahl's grandson Luke Kelly said it will be "one of the highlights" of celebrations.
Director Nigel Jamieson is also looking for 40 bald men, 13 magicians, four brass bands, three excavator drivers, a Spitfire pilot, firemen, circus artists, aerialists and rock climbers.
The event promises "madcap events will defy the laws of physics" in venues including Cardiff Castle and the National Museum.
A Millennium Centre spokesperson said: "The whole city will be humming with whispers of Roald Dahl; on street corners and from rooftops, in markets and cafÃ©s, on lampposts and even on your mobile phone.
"Some of his best-loved stories will be told in the unlikeliest of places by well-known fans."
