Corby Town's Jason Lee: Pint-drinking player 'busted by photo'

When your side scores a goal which takes them out of the relegation zone, sometimes the celebrations can get a little out of hand.

On Saturday, Corby Town defender Jason Lee started the party early, drinking some of a fan's pint while celebrating Ben Milnes' only goal in a 1-0 win over Mickleover Sports.
"After the goal was scored we all went off to celebrate with Ben, but a fan had spilled his pint, and another fan had thrown his pint up in the air," Lee told BBC Sport.
"Everyone was celebrating, everyone was drenched, but I didn't want the spilled pint to go to waste so I just thought I'd have a cheeky sip.
"I got busted, caught out by the photographer. Everyone within the five-metre radius thought it was funny. I thought I was just going to get a kick out of making those guys laugh, and now it's gone viral."
The victory took them out of the Northern Premier League drop zone, but the contents of the plastic cup took Lee by surprise.
"I thought it was going to be a lager, took a big swig, to find out it was a cider. I thought 'I can't stop here' so carried on," the centre-back added.
"But with about 10 or 15 minutes to go I got severe heartburn. Although it tasted nice and refreshing at the time, I just wouldn't recommend it for elite athletes."
Lee works for a building contractor and said those at work think he is now "some kind of famous person" after the picture was shared widely on social media.
"Hopefully for the rest of the season I hope I don't score another goal because I don't know how I could top that as a celebration," he said.
