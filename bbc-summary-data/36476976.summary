The team from South Queensferry was sent out after a member of the public reported a possible aircraft coming down in the Firth of Forth on Tuesday.
The team reached the object but discovered it was a giraffe-shaped helium balloon.
A coastguard spokesman said the call at 21:55 was made in good faith.
He said: "The team was called out to a possible aircraft ditching in the Firth of Forth which turned out to be a giraffe-shaped helium balloon.
"The man who called wasn't trying to mislead us. He saw it and he thought it was an aircraft."
