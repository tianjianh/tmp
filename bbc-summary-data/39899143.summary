'Pint of Science' research talks in Cardiff pubs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scientists will take to the stage in Cardiff pubs to tell people about their research.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is part of a world festival of public science talks, which is coming to Wales for the first time.
The three-day Pint of Science event will see 24 scientists giving demonstrations, live experiments and talks in the city's pubs from Monday.
Events also take place in more than 100 other cities across 12 countries and also include quizzes and puzzles.
Festival co-ordinator Michael Motskin said: "Science can often get lost in translation, leading to the spread of pseudo-science and myths.
"The best way to overcome this is for people to be able to talk to scientists directly in a familiar environment, such as in a pub over a pint."
