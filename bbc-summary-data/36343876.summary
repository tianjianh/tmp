[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brendan Howlin elected as new Irish Labour Party leader

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brendan Howlin has been elected unopposed as the new leader of the Irish Labour Party.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He replaces Joan Burton, who stepped down after the party suffered major losses in February's general election.
The party's deputy leader Alan Kelly failed to secure the necessary support to contest a leadership battle.
The new leader served as public expenditure minister in the last government, in which the Labour Party was a junior partner with Fine Gael.
