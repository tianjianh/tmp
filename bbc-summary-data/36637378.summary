At least five people have been killed and 15 others wounded in a multiple suicide bomb attack in north-eastern Lebanon, officials and medics say.

Four bombers blew themselves up outside a house in the predominantly Christian village of Qaa, close to the border with war-torn Syria.
It was not immediately clear who or what the attackers planned to target.
Al-Manar TV, which is owned by the militant Shia group Hezbollah, blamed the Sunni jihadist group Islamic State.
IS has carried out previous suicide bombings that have killed scores of people in Lebanon, but has not yet said whether it was behind Monday's blasts.
Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that the first suicide bomber blew himself up in front of the house at 04:20 (01:20 GMT).
The three other attackers followed, detonating their suicide vests one after the other as people gathered in the road nearby, it added.
Four soldiers who went to investigate the first explosion were among the wounded.
"Qaa is the gateway to the rest of Lebanon, and here we stopped a plan for a much bigger explosion," mayor Bashir Matar told the AFP news agency.
"We chased the fourth attacker and shot at him, and he blew himself up," he said, adding that five villagers had been killed in the attack.
The NNA reported that the army had cordoned off the area and were searching for possible accomplices.
The explosions reportedly occurred about 150m (490ft) from a Lebanese customs border point, on the road linking the Bekaa valley to the Syrian town of Qusair.
Most of Qaa's residents are Christians, but one area called Masharia Qaa is predominantly Sunni.
A large number of Syrians refugees have also set up an informal camp adjacent to the village, according to AFP.
Lebanon has seen repeated attacks linked to the five-year conflict in Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad.
