Paul Stinton, 45, from Ashford, died from his injuries three weeks after being knocked down in Simone Weil Avenue in Ashford on 4 January 2014.
Linda Ann Jenns, 49, from Richborough Way, Kingsnorth, had denied the charge at Canterbury Crown Court.
She was also disqualified from driving for four years.
Mr Stinton was hit by a Ford Kuga driven by Jenns as tried to cross the road.
When interviewed by Kent Police, Jenns said that she had driven through the traffic lights as they were amber.
Investigating officer PC David Jeeves said: "This tragic collision happened at a busy set of traffic lights.
"The Highway Code states that even amber lights should be stopped at unless you have crossed the stop line or to stop would cause an accident."
