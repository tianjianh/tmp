Ben Glynn: Bristol lock says Championship play-off experience will be 'advantage'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol's Ben Glynn says the heartache of their previous Championship play-off defeats will stand them in good stead for their second leg against Doncaster.

They finished top of the table for the fifth time in seven seasons but have been out of the Premiership since 2009.
Bristol hold a 15-point lead from the away leg and will play in front of a packed Ashton Gate on Wednesday.
"We know what it's like to be in the other camp, so it gives us a kind of advantage," he told BBC Points West.
"I don't think you can compare it to previous years - obviously you can say we've been in similar situations before."
Andy Robinson's side were dominant at the semi-final stage this season, thrashing Bedford 90-35 on aggregate.
Glynn, who plays at lock, is one of Bristol's longest-serving players and thinks there is still room for improvement from the first leg.
"Obviously the scoreline is slightly in our favour at the moment but we weren't 100% happy with our performance, so there's lots of little things that we can tweak and work on," he added.
"There are lots of areas that we've looked at. We're hard on ourselves, I think that's good - we've been like it all season.
"We know what it's like to be on the other foot and obviously Doncaster will still have that belief."
