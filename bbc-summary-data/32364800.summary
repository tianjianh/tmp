A runaway cat missing for five weeks has turned up 128 miles away after hitching a ride in a caravan.

The owners of 18-year-old George, who lives in Llanrwst in the Conwy Valley, were searching for him for more than a month before he turned up on a doorstep in Brighouse, West Yorkshire.
Gemma Davison-Lemalle said she thinks her pet must have sneaked into a nearby caravan site before being driven off.
"It's bonkers to think he travelled so far," she said.
