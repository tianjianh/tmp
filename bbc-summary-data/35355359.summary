Bridgnorth cottage with underground cave for sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A terraced cottage with its own underground cave has gone on sale with an asking price of just under Â£200,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The sandstone cave under the property in Bridgnorth, Shropshire features vaulted ceilings and pillars.
Artist Antony Dracup transformed the house before his death in 2002. His son Dennis said his father had chiselled much of the basement by hand.
"His persistence was rewarded with noticeably stronger chest muscles and extra living space," he said.

Mr Dracup said his father had created the features after deciding to extend a small, existing cave in the back garden.
"In true Colditz style - a little every day, but persistently - he chiselled away," he said.
Estate agents Nock Deighton said: "The key feature is the wonderful cave, which forms a stunning lounge/living space with ornate vaulted pillars and unlike anything else you are likely to see."
