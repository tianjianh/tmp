Saido Berahino: West Brom put striker on weight-loss training plan

West Brom striker Saido Berahino has been put on a weight-loss training plan in a bid to get him fit, Baggies manager Tony Pulis has revealed.

The 23-year-old has not started a game since the trip to Bournemouth on 10 September, with tests showing he was eight pounds over his ideal weight.
"I don't think there's just one reason [why he's not fit]," said Pulis.
"We've put a fitness programme in place and we're hoping and praying that it'll help him get back."
He added: "The lad has bought into it and wants to get himself fit."
Berahino has appeared five times for the Baggies this season and has yet to score.
He came to prominence two seasons ago when he scored 20 goals in 45 appearances for his club. This attracted interest from Tottenham who had three bids rejected, including one for £22.5m, in the 2015-16 summer transfer window.
In response to not being allowed to leave, the forward suggested he would not play for Baggies chairman Jeremy Peace again. He eventually featured 35 times last season, but only scored seven goals.
Both Stoke and Crystal Palace had £20m bids for the player rejected during the last transfer window.
