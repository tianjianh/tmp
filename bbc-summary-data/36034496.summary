Jean de Villiers set to leave Leicester Tigers at end of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-South Africa captain Jean De Villiers is set to leave Leicester when his contract with the Premiership club expires at the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
De Villiers, 35, has only played two games for Tigers since joining after last year's World Cup.
Director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester: "He is out of contract, and with Matt Toomua coming, it was always just for this season.
"Whether Jean decides to carry on playing or not is a question for him."
