The Northern Irishman carded four bogeys and a solitary birdie in a second successive three-over-par 73.
Padraig Harrington's dismal form this season continued as he added a 73 to his opening 77 to finish on 10 over.
Three-time major winner Harrington has not qualified for next week's big event at Oakmont.
McDowell won the US Open at Pebble Beach in 2010 but he has struggled for consistency over the past three seasons and he is currently 75th in the world rankings.
American Daniel Berger has a three-shot lead at the halfway stage after a six-under-par 64 left him on nine under.
Another American Tom Hoge is on six under with Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Brooks Koepka all four shots off the pace.
