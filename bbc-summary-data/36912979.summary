Northern Lights will showcase the work of designers who have chosen to stay in Scotland to build their careers.
Products on show range from hand-crafted wooden furniture to ceramic jewellery.
Organisers said the show would highlight  the "increasing confidence" designers felt in basing their businesses in Scotland.
Product and furniture designer Scott Jarvie said: "London Design Festival will be the centre of the design universe in September, so I'm thrilled to be part of the V&A Dundee show, exhibiting alongside leading lights in contemporary Scottish design.
"The V&A in London has been a great inspiration and influence on my work as a designer, since being captivated by the place as a child. "
The London Design Festival was first staged in 2003 and includes more than 400 events and exhibitions.
Philip Long, director of V&A Dundee, said: "We are delighted with the calibre, ambition and volume of submissions we received to exhibit as part of Northern Lights.
"London Design Festival allows us to highlight these most exciting contemporary product designers, showcase their ideas and ingenuity, and give them an opportunity, whether they are an established or emerging designer, to raise their profile internationally."
