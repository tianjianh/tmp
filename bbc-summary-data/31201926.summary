Teesport deal to handle SSI steel secures 100 jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to 100 port jobs on Teesside have been safeguarded after a seven-year deal was secured to handle millions of tonnes of steel for export.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Teesport owner PD Ports said the agreement, with Redcar steelmaker SSI, could also create a further 30 posts.
It will mean an estimated 2m tonnes a year of slab steel being processed for export through the port.
SSI, which employs 2,000 people, took over the former Corus steel plant three years ago.
