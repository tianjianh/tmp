The victory was only Cathro's third in nine games since succeeding Robbie Neilson as head coach in December.
"Right throughout the difficult moments we've had, I've always known where we were going and what the football would be like," he told BBC Scotland.
"I'm just pleased that tonight 17,000 inside Tynecastle got to see it."

Hearts made a flying start to Wednesday night's rout when Krystian Nowak headed home after four minutes. Rangers were level before the break through Emerson Hyndman, but Jamie Walker's double, and a goal from Don Cowie sealed an emphatic win.
"I wouldn't say we exactly got everything we wanted (from the game), but for sure we had the intensity, we had good pressure at times," Cathro said.
"Maybe in the middle of the first half we had some difficulties and had to make some adjustments, but across the 90 minutes it was the most complete we've been.
"It will be an ongoing thing and the results will determine the narrative. What I feel pleased about is that all of us, the players primarily, have had some difficult times, we've had to suffer, we've had some results we didn't like, and tonight was all of us getting our frustrations out and I'm pleased we had that opportunity."
