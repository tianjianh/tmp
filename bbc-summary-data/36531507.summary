In the first defence of his WBA title in Manchester last month, Crolla stopped previously unbeaten Venezuelan Ismael Barroso in the seventh round.
The 29-year-old Mancunian has now won 31 of his 38 professional bouts.
Ex-WBC champion Linares, 30, also from Venezuela, has won 40 of 43 bouts, most recently against Ivan Cano in October.
He has fought in Britain once before, when he stopped Britain's Kevin Mitchell in the 10th round at 02 Arena in May last year.
Crolla and Linares will fight for the WBA, WBC 'diamond' and Ring Magazine world lightweight titles.
Linares was stripped of the WBC belt - since claimed by Dejan Zlaticanin - in February, and the winner of September's bout is set to challenge the Montenegrin for that title.
