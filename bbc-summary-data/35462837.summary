South East airports expansion: MP wants answers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An MP says the public are being left in the dark over plans to increase airport capacity in the South East.

Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, is demanding details of figures that led to an extra runway at Heathrow being recommended.
Gatwick bosses say his intervention adds weight to the feeling that the report that recommended Heathrow ahead of Gatwick was "seriously flawed".
The government says it will strive to ensure the right decision is made.
An independent report by the Davies Commission recommended building a new runway at Heathrow and extending an existing one rather than providing a second runway at Gatwick.
The government has delayed acting on the report until further analysis of potential environmental impact is carried out.
But Mr Tyrie, the Conservative MP for Chichester, said his committee was still waiting for key information from the government on the figures that helped influence the commission's recommendations.
He has written to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, demanding answers to the committee's detailed questions on issues including likely impact on fares and passenger demand.
Mr Tyrie said the commission's case was "opaque in a number of important respects" and that "a good deal more information is required" if the government's decision is to be properly scrutinised.
Stewart Wingate, Gatwick's chief executive, said: "It's clear to us that the government needs to really assess the environmental impacts and the economic benefits of the runway schemes.
"And if they do that, there is only one deliverable option - it's got to be Gatwick."
A Department of Transport spokeswoman said it had not yet been able to respond to all Mr Tyrie's questions but would do so as soon as possible. "It's vitally important we get the decision right so that it will benefit generations to come."
In the meantime, Gatwick continues to cater for rising passenger numbers, regardless of whether it gets the green light for large-scale expansion.
Eastbourne MP Caroline Ansell has formally unveiled the latest element of its Â£200bn development - an Â£80m access system for passengers heading to and from planes at its north terminal.
