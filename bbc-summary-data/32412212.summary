They were killed in central Huambo province when police raided a camp looking for leader Jose Julino Kalupeteka on 16 April.
He is accused of inciting civil disorder and is now in police custody.
Police have denied reports that more than 200 of Mr Kalupeteka's followers were killed in retaliation for the death of 13 police officers.
Mr Kalupeteka, who formed his Seventh Day Light of the World church 14 years ago after being expelled from the Seventh Day Adventist Church, has thousands of followers across Angola.
The main opposition party, Unita and human rights activists says the Angolan army has now sealed off the Sume region.
"The area is surrounded, people are banned from moving around, and anything that breathes or moves risks death," the statement reads.
Police spokesman Paulo Gaspar de Almeida said 13 of Mr Kalupeteka's private guards and nine civilians had died after they tried to "destabilize and neutralize a police operation".
He said all the necessary measures had been taken to avoid the death of civilians.
Mr Kalupeteka preaches that world will end in 2015, and urges its followers to abandon all their belongings and go on seclusion in camps the mountains.
