[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Perthshire Hotel, which hosted the Ryder Cup last year, includes three golf courses.
Property firm Jones Lang LaSalle is reported to have been hired to test the water before Diageo decides whether to sell.
A Diageo spokesman said it had received "numerous expressions of interest, particularly since the Ryder Cup".
The company has tested the market on at least two occasions. In 1998 offers of £60m fell short of the expected figure - thought to have been about £100m.
Diageo is understood to be considering offers from a number of parties.
The spokesman said: "Gleneagles is one of the UK's finest luxury hotels and one of the world's most fantastic golf resorts.
"We are sure there are many people who would love to own Gleneagles and have received numerous expressions of interest over the years and particularly since the Ryder Cup.
"As you would expect we have a duty to consider such interest carefully."
