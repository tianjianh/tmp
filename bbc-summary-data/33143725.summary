First Minister Carwyn Jones has said more than 95% of his government's promises are being met, with less than a year to go to the assembly election.

But opposition parties said the Programme for Government annual report contained claims that were "fantasy".
The report says all five main 2011 Labour manifesto promises were met.
But some pledges will not be fulfilled - including a promise that NHS operations cancelled twice must be carried out within two weeks.
The document details progress on more than 500 separate commitments made by Mr Jones's administration.
The five key ones the review says have been met involved expanding the Flying Start pre-school programme for disadvantaged families, longer GP opening hours, providing 500 Community Support Officers, creating the Jobs Growth Wales employment scheme and raising schools spending.
Mr Jones said: "Back in 2011 we put forward the most ambitious and comprehensive government programme since devolution.
"I'm absolutely delighted to say that even in the toughest financial circumstances, we've delivered for the people of Wales."
However Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said: "First I started off chuckling, then I was laughing out loud, because it's frankly ridiculous, and then I was mad.
"It's a fantasy".
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said a "tired" administration had produced a report that "glosses over its failures and paints an inaccurate picture of Labour's performance".
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies described the document as "another glossy update that ignores the big issues and dismisses the need for clear targets".
The data is compiled by civil servants and includes data on education, health and economic performance.
