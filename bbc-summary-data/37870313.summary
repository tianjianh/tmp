India v England: Tour expected to go ahead despite 'financial issues' at BCCI

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's tour of India is "business as usual" despite reports it may be in doubt because of financial issues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Local newspapers say the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked England to pay for their own travel costs because of a court order preventing the execution of contracts.
England trained as scheduled in Mumbai on Friday and a team spokesman said "there is no change to any plans".
The first Test of a five-match series is due to begin in Rajkot on Wednesday.
The court order is reported to have been imposed by the Supreme Court-appointed Lodha Committee, which is proposing reforms to the BCCI.
A letter from Ajay Shirke, secretary of the BCCI, to England team manager Phil Neale apologised that India cannot pay the tourists' accommodation costs.
The letter stated: "The BCCI is at present not in a position to execute the memorandum of understanding between the Indian Cricket Board and the ECB. This is due to restrictions on execution of contracts imposed on the BCCI by a court order.
"The BCCI will inform you as and when further instructions are received by the BCCI from the Lodha Committee
When asked about the situation, England batsman Joe Root said: "My biggest challenge in the morning is making sure I make the team bus.
"For whoever it concerns, I think it's very important that they worry about it and we just get on with the cricket."
There were reports that New Zealand's tour of India in September and October could be cut short because of BCCI financial issues but it continued as planned.
