Some of Britain's biggest trees are growing in Snowdonia, according to the national park.

A survey by the Tree Register of the British Isles (TROBI) has shown the Plas Tan y Bwlch centre in Maentwrog, Gwynedd, is home to four UK champions.
Among the biggest is a Japanese red cedar that stands at 37.5m (123ft).
The gardens are also home to nine Welsh champions, plus a further 16 Gwynedd champion trees.
Dr. Owen Johnson, who conducted the survey, said: "The woods at Plas Tan y Bwlch probably have the best series of Japanese cedars of any estate in Britain."
"There is also an attractive range of trees in the main garden, including a Davidia (dove tree) unsurpassed from its crown-size and beauty."
The Victorian-Gothic mansion Plas Tan y Bwlch is located within the Snowdonia National Park.
The immediate gardens around the mansion, which cover 13 acres (5.2 hectares), were laid out between 1879 and 1912.
Head of Business at Plas, Andrew Oughton, said: "We have long been aware of the magnificence of the trees at Plas, but had no idea so many of them were the biggest of their kind."
The garden's other champion trees include a 24m (79ft) golden-leaved Lawson cypress, a sawara cypress at 23m (76ft), and an 8m (26ft) variegated holly tree.
