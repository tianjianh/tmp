[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ivor Gifford, from Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, was found guilty of sending explicit messages to fake profiles set up by a Paedophile hunting group.
The group, known as 'The Hunted One' later confronted Gifford and passed chat logs and evidence to the police.
Judge Daniel Williams told Gifford he represented "a high risk" to children.
Newport Crown Court heard two profiles 'Jessie' and 'Jodie' were set up by the group, which Gifford then contacted.
Gifford was also made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years and he will be prevented from working with children.
