The previous facility at Bootham Park hospital closed after inspectors found it unsafe.
People needing inpatient treatment since Bootham Park was closed have had to travel to Middlesbrough, about 50 miles (80km) away.
The new Peppermill Court in North Yorkshire had been due to open earlier this year but was delayed for various reasons, including a fire in August.

Ruth Hill, of Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Trust, said: "We understand how difficult it's been for service users and their families.
"Over the last 12 months we've done all we can to support people, including helping with travel arrangements and costs but we know it hasn't been easy."
The trust is in consultation about a permanent hospital to replace Bootham Park and hopes to open a 60-bed facility in 2019.
The Leeds and York Partnership NHS Trust was given five days notice to close the Grade-I listed hospital, in September 2015 after inspectors said there were serious risks to patients poor hygiene and not enough staff.
The Tees Esk and Wear Valley NHS Trust took over mental health services in the Vale of York on 1 October.
