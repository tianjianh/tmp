Spelthorne council officers could get body-worn cameras

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Enforcement officers tackling problems such as abandoned cars, dog fouling and fly tipping could be given body-worn cameras to wear in part of Surrey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Spelthorne Borough Council said using the cameras could deter aggressive acts, or verbal and physical abuse.
The plan is to have a more "imposing" recording system to address high levels of anti-social behaviour, the council said.
Under the plans, the technology will also be given to parking officers.
And in the future, cameras could also be worn by officers from other departments.
The council said cameras would be able to capture images close up, record audio, allow an officer to have their hands free while recording an incident, and provide evidence for dealing with investigations.
Cameras would also help with investigating claims of inappropriate conduct by officers, the council added.
Consultation on the move runs until 9 July.
