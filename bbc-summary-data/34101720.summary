Irish minister Charlie Flanagan warns of 'grave' political situation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan has described the political situation at Stormont as "grave".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Saturday, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said that it would leave the Northern Ireland Executive.
The party's ruling body made the decision after police said Provisional IRA members were involved in murdering ex-IRA man Kevin McGuigan Sr.
Sinn Féin's denial that the IRA existed made it "impossible to do business with them," party leader Mike Nesbitt said.
Speaking to the Irish state broadcaster RTÉ, Mr Flanagan said there is no benefit in "car crash politics".
Difficult politics
He said denials by Sinn Féin over the existence of the IRA were unhelpful and that people did not believe them.
"I believe that normal politics will only be introduced on this island fully if Sinn Féin uses its influence to ensure that the IRA is put firmly out of business."
Mr Flanagan will meet with the Secretary of State Theresa Villiers next week.
He will discuss a wide range of issues that are feeding towards "a very difficult and grave situation".
