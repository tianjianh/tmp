[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who took a job as a delivery driver despite being banned from the road for life has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Scott had been given several lifetime bans from driving over 57 offences before he was caught behind the wheel in Perth in July.
The 30-year-old was jailed for eight months after admitting driving while disqualified for the fifth time.
Perth Sheriff Court heard Scott had "something akin to an addiction" to driving.
Scott had racked up 17 driving bans totalling 76 years, as well as a number of life bans, having convictions for 57 driving offences.
He was given a lifetime ban in 2007, and was jailed in June 2014 for driving while disqualified.
Police were informed that Scott was driving while disqualified, and caught him driving off from the Marmaris takeaway in Perth on 31 July.
Solicitor Kris Gilmartin said Scott "ought to know better", having been jailed for this offence before.
He said: "His position is that he feels some sort of release when he is driving. He has been disqualified for life and ought to accept he should go nowhere near any vehicle for any reason whatsoever."
Jailing Scott and banning him from the road for a further 10 years, Sheriff Lindsay Foulis said: "You have driven a coach and horses through the prohibition banning you from driving for life."
