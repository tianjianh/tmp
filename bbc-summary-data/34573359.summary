[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain's James Davis boosted his hopes of a place at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio by winning a World Cup silver medal in San Jose, USA.

The 24-year-old, ranked 14th in the world, beat world champion Yuki Ota of Japan 15-13 in the semi-final.
But the Briton then lost 15-8 to Russian Timur Safin in the final.
Olympic qualification is initially based on team rankings, but if Britain do not qualify then Davis is in a good position for an individual spot in Rio.
