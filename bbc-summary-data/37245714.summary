Dogs used for hare coursing in Lincolnshire 'will be seized'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police team set up to combat hare coursing in Lincolnshire has said it will focus on seizing dogs and vehicles as part of its annual clampdown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The county's police force said feedback from both farmers and those caught hare coursing said it was the greatest deterrent.
Traditionally offences start to rise in the autumn after crops have been harvested and continue until spring.
Last season, 176 men were arrested or reported for summons.
During the busiest months of November and December an average of 15 calls a day were received with the South Holland area the hardest hit, the force said.
Lincolnshire Police said it would also focus on working with neighbouring forces as part of its clampdown.
The National Farmer's Union's Lincolnshire advisor for the Holland region, Gordon Corner, welcomed the move.
He said many farmers had been threatened with violence and threats when facing gangs of hare coursers.
