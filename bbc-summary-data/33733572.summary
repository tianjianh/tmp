The 21-year-old came through the club's youth system and has made a total of 94 appearances for the Addicks since his debut in August 2013.
"It's a good feeling to secure my future," he told the club website.
"I've been here for a very long time and I'm proud to come from this academy. It's my home, I feel part of the club and I want that to continue."
Cousins, who has represented England at Under-20 level, will now remain at The Valley until the summer of 2019.
Meanwhile Charlton forward Piotr Parzyszek has joined Danish Superliga side Randers on a season-long loan.
The 21-year-old Poland Under-21 international, who moved to south-east London in January 2014, spent last season with Belgian club Sint-Truiden.
