[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stoke City v Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City could be bolstered by the return of three players, including Tom Huddlestone after suspension.

Dieumerci Mbokani is fit after six weeks out with a hamstring injury, while Harry Maguire's knee problem will be assessed.
Stoke midfielder Joe Allen is ruled out by injury, while Jonathan Walters is a doubt with a knee problem.
Goalkeeper Jack Butland could be involved for the first time since injuring his ankle in March last year.
Ibrahim Afellay is likely to miss the remainder of the season after undergoing a knee operation.
John Roder: "For very different reasons both of these teams need a win this weekend.
"Hull require three victories from their remaining six fixtures to be safe, according to Phil Neville on last Saturday's Match of the Day.
"However, with vastly contrasting home and away records since Marco Silva's arrival, can Hull record their first away win under the new head coach?
"Stoke have finished in ninth place in the Premier League for the past three seasons but a run of four successive defeats - and only two wins in their last 11 - has seen them drop to 13th."

Stoke City manager Mark Hughes: "(Our) mindset is good. We've had a run of fixtures that was always going to test us.
"We have done okay in games but made mistakes to allow good opposition good opportunities to score.
"We've got six games to go and we are going to try to win every one."
Hull City head coach Marco Silva: "We need to pick up points away to stay in the Premier League.
"We need to show and prove we can do that.  It is important to end the run away from home.
"I think Stoke is a good chance for us. We must believe."
Stoke are having a shocking time, with four straight defeats. I see them bouncing back with a win here though, because Hull are just not the same force on the road.
