He changed his Facebook profile picture to a photo of his head superimposed on an image of Where's Wally and went on to post a series of videos, including one in which he sang along to Lionel Richie's Hello, which contains the line "is it me you're looking for?"
He also filmed himself surrendering to Harrogate police station and broadcasted the event on Facebook.
