A busy city road beset by problems after two sinkhole-like holes appeared has been closed to all traffic for two days before finally reopening.

The Mancunian Way in Manchester has been partially closed since the end of last summer because of the holes.
The key commuter route was shut in both directions for a full inspection on Monday and Tuesday, for an inspection and further maintenance.
It is due to reopen in full at 06:00 BST on Wednesday.
Heavy rainfall caused of the holes to open in August, with the second appearing close by a month later.
The problems led to a partial closure with a contraflow while replacement sewer pipes were installed.
John Fryer, of Transport for Greater Manchester, said: "The full reopening of the Mancunian Way is undoubtedly great news.
"It has been a significant challenge for us in terms of managing the traffic flows on already busy roads, but we've used our state-of-the-art control centre to adjust traffic signal timings to minimise delays as far as possible."
Kate Chappell, executive member for the environment at Manchester City Council, said: "This two-day inspection closure, which was postponed while other work was going on, is the final push before the welcome full re-opening of the Mancunian Way."
