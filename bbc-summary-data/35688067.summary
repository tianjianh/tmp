Only 13% of blue plaques in London are dedicated to women, English Heritage has revealed.

The organisation (EH) is appealing for people to nominate more notable women for the plaques, of which there are currently 902 around the capital.
The appeal comes as Women's History Month gets under way, and in the blue plaque scheme's 150th year.
According to a survey by EH, 40% of people think women had less impact on history than men.

Film star Ava Gardner, ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn and the cookery writer Elizabeth David are among the latest people to be awarded plaques.
"Our scheme relies entirely on public nominations so we're calling on people to get in touch and tell us who they think deserves a plaque," said Anna Eavis, curatorial director for EH.
"Is the person a significant figure who made a positive and lasting public impact? Does the London building where the person lived or worked still stand? And has the person been dead for more than 20 years?"
A spokeswoman said EH did not want to "sway nominations towards particular women, so we haven't put together a list of women who don't have plaques.
"This will mean that we can assemble a full list of really diverse nominations.
"We need to have people helping us dig for them."
EH took over the blue plaque scheme in 1986, following the abolition of the Greater London Council. The first plaque was erected in 1867, for Lord Byron.
