The birds, which are the third-largest type of penguin after the Emperor and King species, travelled to the UK from New Zealand.
The centre drafted in the West Midlands Fire Service and Severn Trent Water to help fill the colony's new tank with 70,000 litres of water.
The centre's general manager, Amy Langham, said the penguins will be kept comfortable at an indoor temperature of 8C (46F).
Curator James Robson said the colony will be used in a conservation breeding programme.
