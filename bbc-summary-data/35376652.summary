[SN]TITLE[SN]
Poppi Worthington death file to be reviewed by CPS

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors are to review the death of Poppi Worthington after a family court judge ruled her father sexually assaulted her before she died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 13-month-old was found with serious injuries at her Barrow home in 2012, and pronounced dead in hospital.
Her father, Paul Worthington, was arrested but later told he would face no charges. He denies any wrongdoing.
The CPS has now said that, following the family court judge findings, it will be reviewing the file.
The judge criticised Cumbria Police for the way it handled the initial investigation into Poppi's death, with evidence thrown away.
An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is under way, and will be published in due course.
However, the IPCC has now said that a serving Cumbria Police officer would face a "performance meeting" which has the power of dismissal if gross incompetence is proved.
It said in a statement: "As a result of the evidence we presented, one serving officer is to face a third stage performance meeting - which has the power of dismissal if gross incompetence is proved.
"A second officer has received management action. A third officer cited in the report has since retired from the force."
In a statement, the CPS said: "We received a file from Cumbria Police in relation to the tragic death of a 13-month-old girl in December 2012.
"We conducted a thorough review of the evidence in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
"This review included consideration of expert evidence which was carefully considered by the prosecutor, who took advice from experienced counsel.
"We decided there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and therefore no-one was charged with any offences relating to her death.
"Following the findings of the family court judge, we are now reviewing the case."
Mr Worthington, who was arrested along with Poppi's mother following her death, said he did not accept the findings of the family court and had never hurt his daughter.
Neither of the Poppi's parents were ever charged.
