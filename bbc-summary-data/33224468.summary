Southampton bee swarm removed from bollard

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of bees had to be removed from a concrete bollard in Southampton after the swarm descended on a street.

Passer-bys were sent "running" as they were warned of the bees by worried workers at a nearby bar.
Dave Norris, from the Southampton and District Beekeepers Association, was called in to lure the queen bee into a large box with the swarm following.
He estimated there was up to 7,000 bees and said the swarm resembled a "policeman's helmet".
Mr Norris, who removed the swarm on Friday, said: "I have no idea what attracted them to the bollard - if I could tell you why they choose certain places I would be a very rich man.
"They like dark places so the box lures them in and they tend to follow the queen."
Chloe Adams, from the Orange Rooms, said: "They just appeared - a big ball of bees. People passing had to do a double take while others ran away."
It is thought more swarms are being found in towns and cities due to an increase in inexperienced beekeepers taking up the hobby.
