Dixon, 53, had denied assaulting the man in Dunstable in May last year.
But a jury at Luton Crown Court found him guilty and the judge warned him he could face a prison term when he is sentenced.
Dixon, a former Chelsea player, was granted bail and will be sentenced on 19 June.
Judge Barbara Mensah told Dixon: "I have taken the view that this is a serious assault, for which I will be considering a custodial sentence."
She granted bail, but made it a condition that he not go into the Nags Head pub in Dunstable where he had attacked 38-year-old father-of-two Ben Scoble.
The assault, captured on the pub's CCTV system, was played to the jury and showed Dixon delivering a flurry of punches, knocking the builder off the stool and down onto the floor of the pub where he continued the attack.
Dixon had pleaded not guilty to a charge of assaulting Mr Scoble occasioning him actual bodily harm.
During the trial, Dixon had claimed he was being hassled by Mr Scoble, who sat on a stool by the bar where the ex-striker had been sitting with his girlfriend through the evening.
In court Dixon claimed he feared he was about to be attacked by Mr Scoble and struck out in a pre-emptive strike, which he said was in self defence.
During the trial, Dixon told the jury that at the height of his career in the mid-1980s he had earned Â£400 a week.
Following the jury's verdict of guilty, the court was told Dixon had a previous conviction for driving with excess alcohol in 2000 and had been cautioned for common assault in June 2002.
