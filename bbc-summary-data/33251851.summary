Tom Brady: Patriots' player waits on ‘Deflate-gate' appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has made his appeal against the four-match ban he received for his part in 'Deflate-gate'.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brady presented his case during a 10-hour hearing on Tuesday.
The 37-year-old was punished by the NFL (National Football League) after it was decided he was "generally aware" of a scheme to deflate footballs.
The incident happened in the Patriots' play-off win over Indianapolis Colts, which sent them to the Super Bowl.
An NFL investigation claimed the Patriots had deflated match balls to give themselves an advantage in their 45-7 victory. They went on to win the Super Bowl XLIX.
According to reports, 11 of the 12 game balls they provided for the rain-affected match were under-inflated below set standards by about two pounds per square inch, giving Brady more grip in the cold and wet conditions.
Brady was "at least generally aware of inappropriate activities", according to the independent Wells Report.
But Brady's father, Tom Brady Sr, labelled the investigation "Frame-gate", and the player's agent Don Yee said the ban was "ridiculous" and lacked "legitimate basis".
The quarterback will not receive any pay during his ban, while the team were fined $1m (£642,000).
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell presided over Brady's hearing, despite a request from the Players Association' for a neutral arbitrator.
No set time frame has been made for the outcome of the appeal.
