Election 2015: Plaid welcomes SNP support for parity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plaid Cymru has welcomed support from the Scottish first minister for Wales to have the same level of funding and power as Scotland.

Nicola Sturgeon backed the idea as she launched the SNP's general election manifesto in Edinburgh on Monday.
Plaid leader Leanne Wood said she was "very pleased" to have that support.
"Just as the SNP is doing for Scotland, Plaid Cymru is fighting for the best deal possible for Wales in this election," she said.
"Parity of funding with Scotland would see Wales receiving an extra Â£1.2bn a year - Â£400 for each man, woman and child."
Ms Wood said Plaid Cymru would prioritise health and education for extra spending.
She added: "I look forward to Plaid and SNP MPs continuing to work together in Westminster after May 7th in order to fight for policies that will benefit not only the people of Wales and Scotland but the people of the UK as a whole."
Answering a question at the SNP manifesto launch, Ms Sturgeon had said: "I do support Leanne Wood's and Plaid Cymru's call for parity for Wales but not at the expense of Scotland, because I do not accept that Scotland is subsidised and I will argue passionately against that notion for as long as I am in politics."
