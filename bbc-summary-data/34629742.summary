Intercontinental Cup: Namibia frustrate Ireland in Windhoek

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland were frustrated by a last-wicket stand of 48 as Namibia reached 250-9 at the close on day one of the Intercontinental Cup game in Windhoek.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Irish had Namibia struggling on 82-5 before JP Kotze's 78 steadied the home innings.
George Dockrell brought up his 200th Irish wicket to put the Namibians in trouble again at 202-9 before Christopher Coombe's unbeaten 34.
Dockrell, Tim Murtagh and John Mooney all took two wickets.
Kevin O'Brien and Craig Young were among the early wickets as Ireland took control after losing the toss.
However, Kotze's fine innings frustrated the Irish before Coombe's late resistance along with also unbeaten Bernard Scholtz (16 no).
Namibia's fightback will give them hope of staying in contention, but Ireland will hope to build a strong lead when play resumes in Windhoek on Sunday.
A win for either side would see them move top of the table above current leaders the Netherlands.
In the potential scenario of the side winning the match after conceding a first innings lead, the Dutch will drop to third as in this situation the side that wins the match will collect 13 points while the side that claims the first-innings lead will get seven points.
In the first round of fixtures, reigning champions Ireland defeated the United Arab Emirates by an innings and 26 runs in Malahide in June, while Namibia recorded a 114-run victory over Hong Kong in May.
Captain William Porterfield and Ed Joyce are back for the Irish after being rested for the four-day tour game against Zimbabwe A.
