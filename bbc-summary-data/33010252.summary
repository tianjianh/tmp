Ukraine's surge in violence raises stakes for Poroshenko

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Even though the Ukrainians claim they are fighting "terrorists", Petro Poroshenko is, in the eyes of most of the world, a wartime president, and the reality on the ground in eastern Ukraine defines most of what he does and says.

His assertion that there are 9,000 Russian troops fighting in the rebel-held east will be met with a great deal of scepticism.
Yes, there has been significant and credible evidence gathered by media organisations like the BBC that Russian troops have been involved, and died, in the conflict.
Two alleged Russian soldiers were captured by the Ukrainians last month, and 10 Russian soldiers claimed they were lost when they were taken prisoner near the Russian border last August.
But with the evidence we have to date, and taking into account the size of rebel-held territory, the figure of 9,000 appears high.
Mr Poroshenko also tackled the potentially explosive "Nato question" - whether Ukraine will join the alliance.
"Only the Ukrainian people will decide," was his message.
In other words, make no mistake, Ukraine is a sovereign nation. He wants to counter the popular narrative in the Kremlin that Russia has a legitimate interest to be concerned and act in the east if it perceives that events run contrary to its interests.
However, leaders in Washington and Western Europe are aware that offering Ukraine membership of Nato, given the current climate of mistrust with Moscow, would only add fuel to a smouldering fire.
Mr Poroshenko acknowledged that this ambition is, for now, on hold.
The claim by Ukraine's president that pro-Russian rebels are about to launch a major offensive is nothing new.
He might be correct, but the rebels often claim that the Ukrainian army is about to do the same.
If there is a spike in fighting, like the battle in the town of Maryinka on Wednesday, then both sides know that they cannot be seen as the aggressor, because they lose credibility and damage the negotiating position of their allies, either in Moscow or in European capitals.
Neither side wants to be seen as responsible for breaking the highly publicised, but so far unsuccessful, Minsk peace agreement.
And bargaining power for either side will become ever more crucial, because in three weeks the European Union will decide whether to renew sanctions against Russia.
The stakes are high.
