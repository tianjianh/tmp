Darryl Gittoes, 21, hit Mary Evans, 73, in Hereford city centre last July and she died in hospital nine days later, the Crown Prosecution Service said.
Gittoes, who pleaded guilty to causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving, was jailed for 12 months.
The defendant, of Homestead, Hereford, was riding a defective bike recovered from a scrap metal lorry, the CPS said.
His bike was examined and found to have had no brakes, a deflated rear tyre, a cracked front tyre and no bell.
Gittoes was jailed at Worcester Crown Court on Monday following his guilty plea on 18 May.
The court heard he had been warned a number of times about riding his bike along Commercial Street, where a Traffic Regulation Order prohibits cycling between 10:30 and 16:30, including on the day before the collision.
Emily Lenham, senior crown prosecutor from West Midlands CPS, said: "Darryl Gittoes was fully aware that his bike was not in a roadworthy condition and he knew of the prohibitions which were in force along Commercial Street, however, on 30 July 2014 he disregarded the previous warning he had received from the police and rode his bicycle along this street and in doing so, he collided with Mary Evans, knocking her to the ground.
"Mrs Evans would later die due to the head injuries caused by the collision.
"This case clearly highlights the dangers of riding a cycle in a pedestrian area and the tragic consequences of Mr Gittoes' actions should serve as a reminder to cyclists to take heed of prohibitions in place within such areas, which are necessary to preserve the safety of pedestrians."
