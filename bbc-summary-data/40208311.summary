The 31-year-old fly-half will lead the team for the first time since their World Cup win in 2015, with regular captain Sarah Hunter named on the bench.
Hooker Vicky Fleetwood is set to make her 60th international appearance while Sarah Bern is given her first start.
The Red Roses will also play New Zealand and Canada in the series.
It will be the last chance for players to stake a claim for a place in the squad for the World Cup later this summer in Ireland.
"We are excited to take on Australia, a team we have not played for seven years," said coach Simon Middleton.
"To be playing them in the southern hemisphere makes the occasion even more special."
England Women team: Emily Scott; Kay Wilson, Megan Jones, Rachael Burford, Sarah McKenna; Katy Mclean, Leanne Riley; Vickii Cornborough, Vicky Fleetwood, Sarah Bern ; Tamara Taylor, Abbie Scott; Harriet Millar-Mills, Izzy Noel-Smith, Alex Matthews.
Replacements: Amy Cokayne, Justine Lucas, Heather Kerr, Emily Braund, Sarah Hunter, Natasha Hunt, Emily Scarratt, Lydia Thompson
