The Argentina centre-back, 27, was one of three Swans players the club received offers for in January, according to chairman Huw Jenkins.
But Fernandez, who played a major part as Paul Clement's side beat relegation rivals Leicester City on Sunday, said he was pleased to stay.
"Probably in the next week I will sign a new contract," said Fernandez.
Fernandez, who joined Swansea from Napoli in August 2014, did not reveal which clubs had been keen on signing him last month, but said assurances from the Swans had helped make up his mind.
"They said I was very important for the team. They are confident in me," he said. "The offers came in, the club said no and I am happy to stay."
Against the Foxes, Fernandez's defensive partner Alfie Mawson, opened the scoring with an impressive volley.
Fernandez said he was enjoying playing alongside Mawson after the Swans initially struggled to cope with the loss of former captain Ashley Williams, who joined Everton in the summer.
"Alfie works hard every day on the training ground," said Fernandez.
"I try to stay compact and help him next to me. He's got a lot of potential. He's a young guy. He will play in the Premier League for many years I hope.
"He tries to score goals like that in training, but that one was amazing."
The win over Leicester meant Swansea leapfrogged their opponents and are now 15th in the table, four points above the relegation places.
"We have a long way to go, but we are doing things in the right way," added Fernandez, whose side are away at leaders Chelsea next (25 February, 15:00 GMT kick-off).
