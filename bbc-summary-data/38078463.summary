UK Championship 2016: Mitchell Mann's win over Kyren Wilson a 'massive relief'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mitchell Mann hopes his impressive 6-3 win over world number 13 Kyren Wilson in the UK Championship first round will help him relax into the tournament.

The world number 115 from Birmingham had won just twice in 11 matches this season before seeing off one of game's rising stars at the York Barbican.
"I feel like I just fell over the line in the end," said Mann, 24.
"When you are not winning many matches on the tour it makes you doubt yourself when you see the winning line."
Mann, who reached the World Championship for the first time in his career in April, will play world number 46 Sam Baird in round two.
"It's a massive relief to get through because my results this season have not been where I want them," added Mann. "I feel like as though I can freeroll in the next round."
