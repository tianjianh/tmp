Swansea-born Coleman, 46, led Wales to their first major tournament in 58 years by qualifying for Euro 2016 this summer in France, where they went on to reach the semi-final.
He previously managed Fulham, Coventry and Real Sociedad after his playing career was cut short by a car accident.
Wales are currently unbeaten in their 2018 World Cup qualifying group.
Also becoming an OBE is burns specialist Thomas Potokar.
In 2006, he founded Interburns, an international network for training, education and research at the Welsh centre for burns and plastic surgery at Swansea's Morriston Hospital.
The work involves training doctors and clinicians in poorer countries to treat burns using the resources available to them.
Former Swansea council chief executive Jack Straw said he was "delighted" to be appointed an OBE for services to local government.
Mr Straw became assistant city treasurer for the former Swansea City Council in 1989 and has also held a number of senior posts in the NHS in Wales and was chief executive of Swansea local health board until 2005.
He then joined Swansea council as director of social services and housing before being appointed executive director in 2009 and chief executive in March 2011 before stepping down earlier this year.
Volunteer RNLI crewmember Vivienne Grey, who has been credited with directly saving the lives of eight people, has been appointed an MBE.
Ms Grey, who has been with Little and Broad Haven RNLI since 1990, said she was "very lucky to serve with so many amazing crew and members of the wider RNLI family".
There were also MBEs for Aaron Moores, for services to swimming in Swansea, along with volunteer coastguard Anthony Parfitt for services to maritime safety.
Prison officer Richard Owen, from Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, has become an MBE for services to prisoners and voluntary service to ex-service personnel.
Meanwhile, the Welsh Ambulance Service's senior education and development lead for driving, Andrew Challenger, has been awarded the Queen's Ambulance Service Medal.
Mr Challenger, who has been with the service for almost 30 years, has led many significant educational projects which have resulted in substantial improvements for patients and staff.
Among the BEM awards are Pembrokeshire duo Brian Harries and Martyn Williams for services to charities.
