[SN]TITLE[SN]
Caged animal fight organiser jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The ringleader of a gang which carried out attacks on wild animals including putting a dog in a cage with a fox has been sentenced to 20 weeks in prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Coombes, 41, from Abbey Road, Bovey Tracy, Devon, was also disqualified from owning dogs for life.
The dog killed the fox after the two animals fought in a tiny cage, Plymouth magistrates heard.
Eleven men have been sentenced after admitting or being found guilty of a total of 27 offences.
Referring to photographs of a dog with its mouth and neck ripped open by a badger, District Judge Diana Baker said to Coombes: "You are the ringleader of organised animal hunting and killing and you had no regard to the welfare of these animals.
"You were videoing it and you were clearly excited by what was happening."
The court heard how dogs were also set on badgers, on deer and in one case, a pig.
It also heard dogs had been mistreated or not cared for when injured.
Magistrates were shown mobile phone footage of the attacks, including the one in which the fox and the dog fought in a cage.
Several members of the gang covered faces with their hands as it was shown.
