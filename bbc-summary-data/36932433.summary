Ward D4 at Royal Bolton Hospital has been hit by the illness and several appointments have been cancelled.
The hospital said there had been a rise in the number people suffering sickness symptoms in the area.
Norovirus can be potentially serious for the elderly and very young, and those who are already unwell.
Andy Ennis, chief operating officer at Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, said: "The illness is largely spread by members of the public who either come in with the illness or are visited by others with symptoms.
"We ask people not to visit with current or recent symptoms and for everyone to wash their hands thoroughly in the sinks on each ward and not just to use the alcohol gel.
"We will be monitoring the situation carefully."
