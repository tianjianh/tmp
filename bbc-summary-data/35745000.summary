Danny McGuire: Leeds Rhinos captain 'positive' on recovery progress

Leeds Rhinos captain Danny McGuire says he is back running again in his rehabilitation from a knee injury, and feels positive about his progress.

The 33-year-old stand-off sustained the problem in the Rhinos' opening-day defeat by Warrington Wolves, and is expected to be out until next month.
In his absence, Leeds have lost four out of five games in all competitions.
"I've started running again, which was good but felt weird after a month off," McGuire told the Super League Show.
"It's going really well. It's four weeks since I got injured and I've been working really hard with the physios and rehab team.
"I'm looking forward to getting out there, training with the team and getting on the field."
Rhinos head coach Brian McDermott has been unfortunate in terms of personnel, with McGuire one of a number of casualties from the opening four Super League games.
Jamie Jones-Buchanan, Ashton Golding, Tom Briscoe, winter signing Beau Falloon and Carl Ablett were joined by Ash Handley and Joel Moon after Friday's win against Huddersfield.
"It's usually a lonely place in rehab, but it's not been that lonely because we've got a few on the injury front," McGuire added.
"There've been plenty of us training together and keeping everybody motivated, which is not what you want because you want everyone on the field.
"That's the nature of the game. I've had plenty of setbacks so I know how to handle the situation."
With McGuire currently sidelined and former skipper Kevin Sinfield departed for rugby union after last season's treble triumph, responsibility for leading the side around the park has fallen to two relatively inexperienced halves.
Liam Sutcliffe and Jordan Lilley, with 73 games between them, have combined in 2016 and McGuire has made sure he can pass on his expertise to the duo.
"I've tried to give them a few tips here and there but they're both level-headed, talented lads," the former East Leeds amateur said.
"They've been really good, Liam is coming off a serious cruciate ligament injury and Jordan's a 19-year-old kid thrust into the limelight and there's a lot of pressure.
"They've handled the situation well and done a decent job in tough circumstances."
