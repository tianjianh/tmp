Tries from Kurt Gidley, Stefan Ratchford and Tom Lineham secured an 18-10 win for Wolves, a week after they secured the League Leaders' Shield.
Wire have reached two Grand Finals previously, in 2012 and 2013, but have never won the showpiece event.
"Our boys just had that determination," Smith told 5 Live Sports Extra.
"I thought we made it a bit hard on ourselves as our kicking game wasn't fantastic and we made a couple of errors here and there - even where we attacked wasn't the smartest at times.
"But I just had that feeling that no matter what happened tonight they were going to work hard for each other and that's a really big ingredient in rugby league.
"You might not be squeaky clean or perfect in some areas but if you work really hard for each other you can cover over a lot of cracks."
