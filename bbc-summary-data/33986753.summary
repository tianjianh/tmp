Key moments in Lord Coe's career

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After being elected the new president of the IAAF, Lord Coe said taking the role was "probably the second biggest and most momentous occasion in my life" after the birth of his children.

But there are plenty of other options to choose from, including Olympic gold medals, world records and election to Parliament.
1979 - Three world records in 41 days
As a young middle distance runner, Sebastian Coe claimed a number of UK records and had already begun to show considerable talents as an athlete by 1979. But the year marked an important milestone when - aged just 22 - he broke the 800m, one mile and 1,500m world records within the space of just 41 days. He was the first person to hold all three records at the same time.
He also won Sports Personality of the Year.
1980 - First Olympic medals
Coe will always be remembered for his Olympic success. In 1980, amid intense rivalry with fellow British runner Steve Ovett, he won gold in the 1,500m in Moscow. He took silver in his preferred race - the 800m - finishing second to Ovett.
1984 - Second Olympic Gold
Despite spending months fighting illness, Coe returned to the Olympic track in Los Angeles four years later and became the first man to win successive 1,500m golds, beating fellow Briton Steve Cram into second (Ovett failed to finish the race). Coe was beaten into second again in the 800m by Joaquim Cruz.
1992 - Enters Parliament
After retiring from athletics in 1990, Coe pursued a career in politics and was chosen to fight the Falmouth and Camborne constituency for the Conservatives at the 1992 election. Coe beat the Liberal Democrat candidate by more than 3,000 votes and took his place in Parliament. He lost the seat in 1997 when Tony Blair's Labour Party swept to power.
He briefly returned to politics as chief of staff to William Hague, when he was Leader of the Opposition.
2005 - Helps secure Olympics for London
Despite London lagging in third place behind Paris and Madrid in early stages, the UK capital secured the games under Coe's leadership. Sports commentators said a speech he made, shortly before the vote, helped turn the race in London's favour.
"This is almost entirely on a different planet to winning the gold medals," Coe said at the time.
He went on to become Chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and is said to have been a key player in organising the Queen's appearance in the James Bond scene in the Games' opening ceremony.
2015 - Elected president of the IAAF
Despite one of the most impressive CVs in athletics history, Lord Coe suggested his election as IAAF chief topped all his achievements. He beat Sergey Bubka, a former Olympic pole vault champion, by 115 votes to 92. His first test, and perhaps his biggest yet, will be to deal with the fallout from doping allegations.
