[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 0-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County secured their first win of the season courtesy of Jamie Turley's first half goal against Leyton Orient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Turley scored his first Newport goal from an acute angle after Marlon Jackson's flick on from a corner.
Orient barely threatened apart from a late chance for Ollie Palmer, who headed wide.
Andy Hessenthaler's side are still searching for their first win of the season.
County's first victory since March and a first win at Orient in 34 years saw them move up to 12th in League Two.
Newport manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales: "It was fantastic. I said before the game I had a bit of confidence coming here, but the most important thing is to get the clean sheet.
"We had to stand shoulder to shoulder. We've done that and I thought we deserved the victory.
"Turls (Jamie Turley) has got a fantastic goal and then he's made an unbelievable block and that's what I expect off him."
