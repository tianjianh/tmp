[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Secretary-General [Ban Ki-moon] was shocked to learn about the large explosion in central Oslo and the shooting that took place in Utoeya today.
He condemns this violence and expresses his condolences to the government of Norway and the families of the victims. The United Nations stands together with the people of Norway at this terrible moment.
Our solidarity with Norway remains steadfast. Nato countries stand united in the battle against these acts of violence.
On behalf of Nato, I condemn in the strongest possible terms the heinous acts of violence in Norway. I would like to convey my sincere condolences to the Norwegian government, the Norwegian people and the families and loved ones of all those who suffered in these cruel and cowardly acts.
I wanted to personally extend my condolences to the people of Norway. It's a reminder that the entire international community holds a stake in preventing this kind of terror from occurring. We have to work co-operatively together both on intelligence and in terms of prevention of these kinds of horrible attacks.
I was outraged to hear about the explosion in Oslo and attack in Utoeya today that have killed and injured innocent people. My thoughts are with the wounded and those who have lost friends and family, and I know everyone in Britain will feel the same.
These attacks are a stark reminder of the threat we all face from terrorism. I have called Prime Minister Stoltenberg this evening to express my sincere condolences and to let him know that our thoughts are with the Norwegian people at this tragic time.
I have offered Britain's help, including through our close intelligence co-operation. We will work with Norway to hunt the murderers who did this and prevent any more innocent deaths. We can overcome this evil, and we will.
My feelings of sympathy go out to the victims of today's tragic events which have shaken my home country of Norway. The attacks were aimed at the heart of our democratic institutions and our open and peaceful nation. Those responsible for them must be brought to justice.
It appears the attack on the Utoeya youth camp was intended to hurt young citizens who actively engage in our democratic and political society. But we must not be intimidated. We need to work for freedom and democracy every day.
The Oslo bombing has reminded Europeans of the acute threat of terrorism which can strike out at innocent citizens anywhere. The Council of Europe will do all it can to combat terrorism and organised crime together with its international partners.
I was shocked and intensely saddened to learn of the attacks in Oslo and Utoya today. Canada stands with Norway on this tragic day.
We deeply regret the loss of life and injuries resulting from the explosion which occurred today in the government quarters... We were also horrified to learn that a gunman has opened fire at a youth camp at Utoeya.
Canada condemns these barbarous and senseless acts of violence and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, witnesses and all those affected by these attacks.
