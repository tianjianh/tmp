Toxicology reports released by the local medical examiner's office record that he had a blood-alcohol content level well above Florida's legal limit.
The 24-year-old pitcher and two of his friends died on 24 September in the Miami Beach accident.
It is unclear who was driving the boat at the time.
Miami-Dade County Associate Medical Examiner Kenneth Hutchins reported that Fernandez, 27-year-old Emilio Jesus Macias and 25-year-old Eduardo Rivero had each suffered blunt force injuries to their head and body.
Macias and Rivero both had blood-alcohol levels below the state's legal limit, while Rivero had cocaine in his system, toxicology reports report.
Investigators had found evidence that the boat was speeding when it hit the jetty, according to the Miami-Dade County State Attorney's Office.
Fernandez was born in Santa Clara, in Cuba, and defected to Florida when he was 16, after three failed attempts. He made his debut for the Marlins in 2013.
