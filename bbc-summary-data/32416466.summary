Police are investigating after nitrous oxide gas cylinders were stolen from Perth Royal Infirmary.

The metal containers filled with the substance, commonly known as "laughing gas", were taken sometime between 16:20 on Friday and 05:20 on Sunday.
Nitrous oxide has been known to be used as a recreational drug or as a fuel additive in cars, but police warned against misusing the "dangerous substance".
Officers have appealed for information.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Nitrous oxide, or N2O, is commonly known as laughing gas and has analgesic properties when used medically, however worryingly it has been known to be used illegally as a recreational drug and can be used by car enthusiasts as a fuel additive.
"Nitrous oxide can be a dangerous substance if it is misused or consumed without medical supervision.
"Also, any attempt to interfere with the pressurised cylinders may result in serious injury if they are not handled correctly."
