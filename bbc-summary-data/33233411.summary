[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire's Tom Fell hit a career-best 143 to give his side a slim chance of a final-day win against Middlesex.

Resuming on 195-3, Alex Gidman did not add to his overnight 30, bowled by Tim Murtagh (4-76), but a fourth first-class ton for Fell and Jack Shantry's unbeaten 41 helped the visitors to 385.
Sam Robson's poor season continued when he edged Charlie Morris behind for his second nought of the game.
But Nick Compton made 47 as Middlesex closed on 140-3 - a lead of 64.
Fell displayed maturity beyond his 21 years in his 228-ball knock as he kept concentration while wickets were falling at the other end to take Worcestershire past the hosts' first innings 309.
However, shortly after surpassing his previous first-class best of 133, he was back in the pavilion after pulling Toby Roland-Jones to Robson at deep square leg.
Shantry and Saeed Ajmal lit up the end of the innings with a breezy stand of 53 before Murtagh  removed the Pakistan spinner and Morris in the space of three balls.
In Middlesex's second innings, Robson, who has hit one century in 15 Championship knocks this summer, this time lasted two balls to follow his first-innings golden duck.
Ajmal bowled Nick Gubbins to claim his first Championship wicket since remodelling his action and Compton looked set for his fifth half-century of the season before edging Shantry to first slip to leave the hosts 73-3.
Paul Stirling and Joe Burns' unbroken stand of 67 saw Middlesex through to stumps, meaning a draw is the most likely result unless Worcestershire take early wickets.
Worcestershire batsman Tom Fell told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"I've felt like I've had quite a few starts this season without really going on to get a big score, so it was nice to do it today.
"Actually, I had a chat with (director of cricket) Steve Rhodes before this game and we spoke about going back to the plans I had in the first match of the season when I got a hundred against Yorkshire.
"This was one of the tougher hundreds I've scored - it was never easy out there and the pitch is getting worn and there's a little bit of up-and-down bounce which is obviously good for us.
"It would have been good if we could have got one or two more wickets tonight, but there is still a chance for us if we take wickets in the first session tomorrow."
