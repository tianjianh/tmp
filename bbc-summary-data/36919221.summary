Rare albino squirrel pictured in Sussex garden

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The odds of a squirrel being born white is thought to be about one in 100,000 - so when one turns up in your back garden it is certainly worth reaching for a camera.

That is what care worker Suzie Chadwick did when she spotted a rare albino squirrel in her garden in East Grinstead, Sussex.
Grey squirrels - originally brought to Britain from North America - are now estimated to number around two and a half million, vastly outnumbering the native red squirrel.
But albinos remain a rarity.
The squirrel, whom Suzie believes to be male, has been visiting her garden almost every day for the past week.
She says he plays with other grey squirrels and fights over the peanuts, sunflower seeds and bread on offer in the feeder - with tempers occasionally boiling over.
"He had a big scratch on his face after a fight last week," says Suzie, "but he keeps coming back because he seems to like a piece of the action."
In all other aspects, such as size and behaviour, Suzie says he seems like an ordinary grey squirrel, frequently pushing the other squirrels off the feeder.
According to Suzie he is accepted by the other squirrels but likes to show he's in charge.
She says she has not got a name for her visitor yet - but Henry and Harry are currently her favourites.
