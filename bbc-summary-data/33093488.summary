[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough severed penis man's death 'misadventure'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who survived after his penis was severed died a year later as the result of what could have been "an erotic game", an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kelly Hewitt, 41, was found by the side of the A66 on Teesside in March 2014 with severe injuries to his groin.
In May, he was discovered dead in his caravan at a Middlesbrough travellers' site. He was covered in blue paint and had a ligature around his neck.
The coroner ruled the father-of-six died as a result of misadventure.
During the inquest in Middlesbrough, coroner Clare Bailey said using the ligatures "may have been an act of some sort of erotic nature".
No-one was ever charged in connection with Mr Hewitt's injuries.
