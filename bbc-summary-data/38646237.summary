Ms Cherry has not been seen since October 2015.
Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: "We are continuing to support Victoria's family as they deal with this devastating news.
"The arrested man remains in custody, but I'm urging anyone with any information that would help our enquiries to get in touch.
"If you have information about Victoria's whereabouts since her disappearance in 2015, or if you hold any information about the events leading up to our discovery, please contact us as a matter of urgency."
