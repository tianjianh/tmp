Offshore dispute: Constructive talks between unions and Wood Group

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Constructive" talks have been held between unions and the Wood Group in an ongoing dispute involving offshore workers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both 48-hour and 24-hour strikes have already been held on seven Shell-operated platforms.
Further action was planned but was put on hold for fresh talks.
Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions said in a statement they had held two full days of constructive discussions which would continue next week.
The statement said: "These collaborative discussions have demonstrated a clear, shared understanding of the issues being raised by all parties, plus the challenges facing the North Sea.
"We remain focused on reaching a mutually-acceptable outcome, which demonstrates collective leadership in shaping the future of the North Sea."
The initial 24-hour strike on 26 July was the first industrial action of its kind in the North Sea in nearly 30 years and was followed by a 48-hour stoppage the following week.
The platforms involved are the Curlew, Brent Alpha, Brent Bravo, Brent Charlie, Nelson, Gannet and Shearwater.
Aberdeen-based Wood Group provides maintenance and construction to Shell and signed a three-year extension to its contract earlier this year.
