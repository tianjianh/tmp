[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old made 38 appearances for Gateshead this season, having joining in June 2016 after leaving Barnsley.
Smith had played 25 league games for the Tykes in 2015-16 as they won promotion to the Championship.
He has signed a two-year contract with Justin Edinburgh's League One side, providing competition for fellow left-back David Buchanan.
"That's the reason why I've come here, because I feel I can give him competition," Smith told BBC Radio Northampton.
"I can learn stuff off him and make myself a better player, but first and foremost try to take his shirt off him."
