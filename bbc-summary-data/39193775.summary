Ambulance service spokesman Jamie Arrowsmith said: "Crews arrived to find a 21-year-old man who said he had been run over by a dumper truck on a building site.
"Ambulance staff assessed and treated him for leg and hip injuries before he was airlifted to Royal Stoke University Hospital."
The man had been working for building contractors Kettle & Talbot and was injured whilst operating a plant vehicle.
"Police and ambulance services arrived on the scene and a man was taken to hospital as a precaution. He has since been discharged with bruising and is now back at work. Kettle & Talbot have now launched a full investigation into the matter," the firm said.
The theme park reopens to visitors on 25 March after its winter closure.
