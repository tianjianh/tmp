[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers 0-0 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn achieved their first clean sheet of the Championship season in a goalless draw with Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Town defender Adam Webster came closest to scoring, but his header was kept out by a sharp save from Jason Steele.
Tom Lawrence fired wide for the visitors before the break, while Rovers' Ben Marshall shot straight at Tractor Boys keeper Bartosz Bialkowski.
Ipswich created the better chances in the second-half, but were unable to score a first goal in five games.
Blackburn remain 23rd in the table and are on a three-match winless run, though they have now extended their unbeaten record against Ipswich to 10 league games.
Mick McCarthy's Ipswich are 17th, without a win in six games, and having now scored only four goals in their past 11 league matches.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle: "I thought we started the first 15 minutes well, looked to get our passing game going and created them a number of problems.
"I felt thereafter we got caught up in Ipswich's way of playing. They're a big strong physical powerful team. We knew we'd have to stand up and be counted, but we did.
"We knew it was going to be a tight game but the important thing today was that we showed we've learned a number of lessons. There was a real resilience and mentality to get that clean sheet.
"I do believe that game today, if it had been the first two weeks of the season, we'd have lost."
Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy:  "I thought we were the better team. If any team was going to win, it was going to be us.
"I would really love to get our fans back on side with me and the team and be excited by us.
"That was a start today. We've had more shots, crosses, attempts on goals than we've had in the last two or three games.
"The hardest thing in the game is putting the ball in the back of the net but if we play like that, more often than not, we'll win games."
