Power powered a superb 25-yard free-kick into the top corner before two goals in as many minutes.
James' shot found the roof of the net, and seconds after the restart Jacobs raced through to score.
Ollie Banks scored a late consolation for the visitors but the Latics avoided a repeat of the midweek comeback by Sheffield United to stay fifth.
