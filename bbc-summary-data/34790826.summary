Graduates from Greece, Portugal and Italy are being offered up to £30,000 to train as teachers in maths, sciences and languages in Norfolk and Suffolk.

Suffolk and Norfolk Initial Teacher Training (Snitt) said it had to be "proactive" to attract the best into teaching key shortage subjects.
Trainees will sign a "declaration" agreeing to stay for the two years.
Hilary Buckey, for the National Union of Teachers, accused it of "plundering" talent from Southern Europe.
Graham White, of Suffolk and Norfolk NUT said he had no problem with recruiting teaches from overseas but was concerned they may only stay for the obligatory two years.
"What's really important from an educational point of view is consistency of approach and also the stability from staff being in a school for a particular period of time."
Paul Law, from Snitt, said, "We can't put a ball and chain around anyone's leg to make them stay for the long term but there will certainly be an expectation they will stay for two years".
Snitt believes it is the first training organisation to increase bursaries for 2016 recruits by £5,000, and will also be offering them to UK graduates.
Both counties said they have struggled recently to attract teachers in maths, physics, chemistry, computing and modern foreign languages.
James Joyce, chairman of Norfolk County Council's children's services committee, backed the new European recruitment drive.
"This is only one part of the system for getting the very best teachers," said Mr Joyce.
Nikos Savvas, principal at West Suffolk College, said: "As the region's economy grows, with science and technology playing an increasingly important role, the need for inspiring and engaging teachers in these subjects has never been greater."
A Department for Education spokesman said it wanted all schools to be able to recruit "more high quality teachers" in core academic subjects, which was why it had announced these new "generous" bursaries  for 2016.
