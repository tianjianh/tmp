We do not know why the feud started, but over the last few days Snoop Dog and Iggy Azalea have been exchanging insults on Twitter and Instagram.

However, the row now seems to be over after Snoop said "sorry".
Iggy says she has accepted his apology and wants to move on and "focus on the positive".
In one message he wrote: "Say *****! You ******* with the wrong ******. Your ****** better check you before I do, you ******* *****, yeah, ******* ****!"
Snoop Dogg's behaviour has caused outrage on social media.
Let's remind ourselves about what Snoop is apologising for.
The rapper posted a picture on Instagram of a person with pale skin and cornrows, claiming it was a photograph of 24-year-old Iggy wearing no make-up.
It came just days after Iggy was photographed wearing minimal make-up at an airport in the US.
Snoop compared Iggy to the two main characters from the film White Chicks. He named a photo, "White Chicks 2 starring Iggy".
He also shared a photo of himself dressed as "Todd", his alter ego" and called Iggy "a man".
Not content with simply pledging his support to rapper Nicki Minaj, Snoop also decided to take a swipe at Iggy in the process.
He called Nicki the "queen of rap" and then asked: "Where is Iggy? Nowhere insight."
The rapper also implied Iggy was "fake" and a "non writer".
On several occasions, Snoop shared threatening videos and messages.
They included an expletive-filled rant where he warned Iggy that she was messing with the wrong person and a photo of himself holding a gun with the caption: "Keep talking".
Iggy initially seemed shocked by Snoop's behaviour, claiming on Twitter that she and her team had only ever "sung his praises".
However, as the abuse continued she fought back comparing him to the type of guy that asks for your number and then says you are "ugly when you say no".
She also asked why he was "trolling other artists" and said she was "disappointed" that he had taken things too far.
Many Twitter users have jumped to Iggy's defence, angered by Snoop's aggressive behaviour towards her.
She retweeted a couple of comments including one from gossip columnist Perez Hilton, who said: "Threatening, hinting at or joking about violence towards women is disgusting."
Shortly after, Snoop said he was "sorry".
In a short black and white video posted on his Instagram page, he revealed that he had had a rethink after speaking with fellow rapper, TI.
Looking directly into the camera, he said: "Hey, boys and girls. I just got off the phone with my homeboy Tip, and it's officially over.
"No more bad talk, I apologise, yeah, I apologise. I'm sorry, I won't do it again."
Iggy has accepted his apology and says she does not want to "dwell on the negative".
