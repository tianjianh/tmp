The money from Sustrans Scotland will support a number of initiatives in Dumfries and Dalbeattie.
It will be backed by funding from Dumfries and Galloway Council, making the total investment nearly £670,000.
Tom Bishop of Sustrans said the aim of the projects was to "improve the safety and ease" of pupils getting to school.
The schemes approved for funding are:
Colin Smyth, who chairs Dumfries and Galloway Council's economy, environment and infrastructure committee, said it was delighted with the award.
"The work at Marchmount Avenue and Moffat Road in Dumfries will be a key part of creating a cycle route between existing cycle routes and Dumfries High School and the extensive new residential development at Marchfield," he said.
"This will link these places with both Dumfries town centre and wider parts of Dumfries.
"Developing a sustainable active travel strategy for the Dumfries Learning Town will not only contribute to the objectives of that project but assist with the further development of the active travel network in Dumfries as a whole.
"The two projects in Dalbeattie reflect the strong community interest in that town in increasing active travel levels, as well as improving links to the new Dalbeattie school, currently being constructed."
