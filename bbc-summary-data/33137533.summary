[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A head teacher accused of having sex with two underage boys took a 15-year-old's virginity in a tent, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The alleged victim claimed he went on to have regular sex with Anne Lakey in the late 1980s.
Ms Lakey, 55, from Stanley, denies 13 charges of indecent assault involving two boys, one aged 13 or 14 and the other 15.
The trial continues at Teesside Crown Court.
The boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said he was on a group camping trip when he crept into Ms Lakey's tent at her behest.
He said her husband was sleeping in another tent nearby.
He added: "On the one hand, I was happy with my little self that I managed to lose my virginity before I was 16, which seemed really important at the time.
"On the other hand, everything was over so quickly. It should have been a bit more interesting than that.
"It was a bit of a confusing mix of emotions as I left the tent."
They continued to have sex at her home in the marital bed when her husband was away, he told the court.
He also said Ms Lakey rang him in 2012 after accusations were first made against her by another boy and she asked him to lie to police by saying they first had sex when he was 18.
The alleged victim said: "Here is somebody who has not spoken to me for 20 years who thought she could get me to pick up the phone and lie to the police.
"If that doesn't give you an idea of the control she had over us lads, I don't know what would."
Ms Lakey's trial also heard from the mother of the younger boy who said he had "tears rolling down his face" when, in his mid-20s, he told her about having sex with the teacher.
She said: "I was just so shocked, I was totally horrified.
"That's my child. He was a child, not a young man, not an adult."
His wife also recalled the complainant telling her about what happened, and she remembered him crying. "He was a very damaged, vulnerable young man," she said.
