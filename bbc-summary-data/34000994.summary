[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to use the backing of party members to force Labour MPs to support his agenda if he is elected leader.

Calling for "real democracy", the left-winger said MPs should not "stand in the way" of "empowering party members".
Mr Corbyn defended his own rebellions, saying they had been "principled".
Polls suggest he is frontrunner in the race to succeed Ed Miliband. The other candidates are Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham.
It comes as figures obtained by the BBC show the vast majority of 189,000 trade unionists who have registered as affiliated supporters to vote in the election are members of unions supporting Mr Corbyn.
The Unite union alone accounts for 110,000. Unison and the Communications Workers Union have signed up a further 40,000.
A number of Labour MPs have warned about the impact of Mr Corbyn winning the party leadership.
But speaking to the Independent newspaper, the left-winger said he would "absolutely" use support from the membership "to push our agenda up to the parliamentary party and get them to follow that."
"We have to encourage the Parliamentary Labour Party to be part of that process and not to stand in the way of democratising the party and empowering the party members," he added.
He said MPs are "not the entirety of the Labour Party", adding: "I want to see real democracy so this election gives a very strong mandate for change within our society."
Mr Corbyn, who has voted against the Labour leadership on hundreds of occasions since his election as the MP for Islington North, in London, in 1983, said he had always rebelled on a point of principle.
"I've taken what I believed to be a principled stand on issues and if people have some passionate disagreement the party is big enough to cope with that," he said.
Meanwhile one of Mr Corbyn's prominent supporters - former leadership candidate Diane Abbott - accused his opponents of "plucking" incidents from over the course of a 30-year career to try and discredit him.
On Thursday, Mr Corbyn admitted meeting controversial Lebanese activist Dyab Abou Jahjah - who is banned from the UK over his views on the Middle East..
Mr Corbyn said he met "many thousands of people" and that "doesn't mean that I share their views".
Ms Abbot added: "To try and build a case on the basis of guilt by association is very wrong".
Ms Kendall said Mr Corbyn had "questions to answer" about his approach to achieving peace in the Middle East. Ms Cooper said: "I'm sure Jeremy will want to respond to those questions."
