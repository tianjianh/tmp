Real, without the injured Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez, sit on 24 points level with Barcelona who beat Getafe 2-0 later on Saturday.
Isco gave Real the lead when he slotted in and Ronaldo's header made it 2-0.
Hernan Santana nodded in to reduce the deficit before Jese restored the two-goal advantage with a firm finish.
Santana's first-half strike was the first goal Real had conceded at home in five league outings this campaign.
Ronaldo was denied a second in the closing moments by goalkeeper Javi Varas, who made a brilliant block.
"We played very well again in the first-half. We started the game  sensationally well and then maybe with the advantage our tempo dropped in the second half," said Real boss Rafael Benitez.
"But we controlled the game in the second half thanks to our good play in the first."
Match ends, Real Madrid 3, Las Palmas 1.
