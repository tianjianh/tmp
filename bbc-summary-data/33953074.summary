Firefighters have tackled a small blaze at the Clutha bar, the Glasgow pub which only recently reopened after a police helicopter crash into it.

The bar reopened in July, almost 20 months after the disaster in November 2013, in which 10 people died.
Three fire engines went to the pub when the alarm was raised at about 01:40 on Sunday.
They were at the scene until 02:23 dealing with a small fire in a bin room.
The pub's Facebook page said the damage was minor.
It said: "Wee Fire at the Clutha - Nothing to worry about! A small fire broke out in one of the bins and caused a bit of smoke around the place.
"The fire service reacted very quickly and it was quickly under control.
"Wee bit of damage to a couple of doors but nothing more. They reckon it was caused by a fag end."
The message went on: "Thanks to everyone for their concerns and thanks again to the fire service and please anyone who does smoke can you make sure your fag is extinguished before throwing away."
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon joined relatives of the dead, survivors and members of the emergency services at the venue when it reopened on 24 July.
More than 100 people were in the bar on the night of 29 November 2013 when the tragedy took place.
The interior of the old bar where the helicopter crashed remains sealed off, but a new bar has been erected in a former smoking area.
