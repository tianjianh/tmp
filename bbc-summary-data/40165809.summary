The 24-year-old made 15 appearances for the Championship side, scoring once, after moving to Carrow Road in January.
But talks with Dijks' representatives have broken down and he will remain with the Europa League finalists.
"Unfortunately, we couldn't come to an agreement and will now be moving onto other targets," said Canaries sporting director Stuart Webber.
