The 25-year-old scored 10 goals in 40 appearances in all competitions for the League Two club last season.
The former Sunderland trainee worked under now-Forest Green manager Mark Cooper at Notts County last term and was one of 11 players released in May.
"It's a fantastic achievement for the club to be able to sign a player of his quality," Cooper told the club website.
After joining Notts in 2014, Noble made 61 league starts over two season with the Magpies.
Forest Green, who lost to Grimsby in the National League promotion final, also signed midfielders Drissa Traore and Mohamed Chemlal on Tuesday.
