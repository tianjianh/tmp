Former Wales manager Speed died, aged 42, in November 2011, having previously played 678 games for Leeds, Newcastle, Everton, Bolton and Sheffield United.
Fans will honour his memory with a minute's applause on 11 minutes, the shirt number he wore for both clubs.
Members of Speed's family will be attending the game.
"We ask supporters of both Leeds United and Newcastle United to join together in a minute's applause as we near the fifth anniversary of Gary's passing," a Leeds statement read.
Speed was in the Newcastle side that last visited Elland Road in 2003, with the teams playing out a 2-2 draw.
He had made his name at Leeds and played a key role as United won the First Division title in 1992.
