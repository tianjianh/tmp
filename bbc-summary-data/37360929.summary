[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish Conservative MSP has been reported to Police Scotland over allegations he breached election campaign spending rules.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aberdeenshire West MSP Alexander Burnett was elected in May.
The SNP said the allegations were a "serious matter", but the Scottish Conservatives said the SNP was "engaged in a nothing more than a politically-motivated fishing expedition".
Police said an election expenses complaint was under consideration.
An SNP spokesperson said: "The fact that these allegations have now been reported to Police Scotland, in line with the advice of the Electoral Commission, underlines the seriousness of this matter for Alexander Burnett and Ruth Davidson.
"As such, it is only right that the police are now given the opportunity to fully investigate any potential breach of election rules."
A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: "The SNP tried the Electoral Commission first, was told it had gone to the wrong place, and is now trying the police."
