Hughes hit 122, his third century of the season, and shared a third-wicket stand of 181 with Madsen (90) as Derbyshire moved from 78-1 to 413-6.
Just two wickets fell in the first two sessions, both to Graham Wagg, on a flat pitch in scorching temperatures.
The visitors reached stumps at Colwyn Bay leading by 72, with captain Billy Godleman unbeaten on 66.
Godleman and Shiv Thakor with an aggressive 29 pushed Derbyshire into the lead in the evening session and set up the chance of giving Glamorgan an awkward target to chase.
Despite a tough day for the bowlers, Glamorgan wicketkeeper Mark Wallace took his tally of catches in the match to eight, one short of the club record held by Colin Metson.
The blazing heat was in sharp contrast to the teams' previous meeting in April at Derby, which was interrupted by snow, sleet and hail.
Glamorgan wicket-keeper Mark Wallace told BBC Wales Sport: "It was hard work, harder if you're a bowler but we get so many games when it's cold and windy, you can't complain- it's been beautiful, proper North Walian weather.
"Hopefully it'll be less warm, overcast and better bowling conditions so we can pick up these last four wickets. As soon as they got ahead the game gets a little bit different but it's a good pitch, it's a small ground and any total around 200 is still very chaseable.
"(Eight catches behind the wickets) shows how well the seamers have bowled on a pretty unresponsive surface, but four more wickets to get, we'll take them any way they come."
Derbyshire batsman Chesney Hughes told BBC Radio Derby: "I enjoyed that one, the last four games I haven't got the scores I wanted to, so to get a hundred meant a lot and I thought I played well for it, because the ball swung for the majority of the morning.
"It's a pitch that's taken 30-degree heat for two days so it is breaking up and getting harder, so we know as a team that if we can get by that morning session and get a decent score on the board, it's game on.
"Ten first-class hundreds and I think I'm just starting to be a player now, so I look forward to scoring more!"
