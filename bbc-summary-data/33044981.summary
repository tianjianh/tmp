Turkish voices: The 'positive' change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The result of the Turkish general election has left the country without a majority government for the first time in 13 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The governing AK party (AKP) remains the largest bloc in parliament but was unable to secure a majority for the first time in 13 years. The People's Democracy Party (HDP) - a pro-Kurdish left-wing party - recorded more than 10% of the vote, allowing it to take seats in parliament for the first time.
Unless the AKP can form a coalition, it may not be able to push through a constitutional amendment sought by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan aimed at boosting the power of his office.
Turkish voters have been contacting BBC News with their reaction to the election and how they see it changing politics in the country.

The AK Party has gained almost 41% of the whole vote. This is a great success for most of the parties but not for the AKP.
My hometown is Konya, one of the fortresses of the AKP and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's hometown.
The most surprising thing about the election is the strong support of Kurdish people for the HDP. The HDP shifted itself from being a pro-Kurdish party to a more leftist party. I was expecting conservative Kurds would not support the HDP in the election, but it was not the case.
This is a new era for Turkey for two reasons - first, the Kurdish party became legitimised and now they are confident; secondly, there is no majority government for the first time.
In the short term there will be instability for Turkey but I believe, there will be more comprehensive solution at the end.

I have hope, after thirteen years; 98 women deputies, 40% of pro-Kurdish HDP's elected deputies are women.
Now there is a party in the parliament to talk about the rights of the LGBT community in Turkey, can you believe that?
I feel my vote can be work. I am not a Kurd but I want Kurds to have their rights. I want to end the civil war. It is impossible to forget the deaths but we have to learn how to live as brothers again.
Democracy won this election, and Turkey's citizens exhibited their faith for peace.
I voted at Sabiha Gokcen airport when I landed in Turkey. I live in England but both my parents are Turkish and I am currently on holiday in Turkey.
I was able to vote as I have dual nationality and I voted for the AKP as I feel it is the only party that can keep Turkey stable. I have seen Turkey develop as a nation and an economy and feel that this is down to the work of the AKP.
Turkish people have recently gone against the AKP government, ever since the economy started to decline and inflation increased. When food shopping in Turkey, I am shocked by the increase in the cost of food and drink compared to the minimum wage in Turkey which is around 1,000 lira a month.
It is known that coalition governments do not work well in Turkey, so I feel the people of Turkey have made a mistake in not voting for the AKP.

Which party was successful? Absolutely the HDP. There is a 10% threshold for parties. This threshold was formed against Islamist parties in 1982 but 20 years later it was used against Kurdish parties.
Kurdish parties couldn't get into parliament in 2002. They changed their tactic in 2007, and fielded independent candidates. This way they got 35 people into parliament. Now they will get almost 80.
The HDP party also had candidates from Armenian and Romani minorities. Since the Turkish Republic was founded there has not been any Romani representative in Parliament. There is only going to be only one in parliament, but this is important for Romani people.
For 100 years Armenians were persecuted. There will be three Armenian deputies, which is good news.
Armenians can have a voice in parliament and my hope is the Armenian genocide will be discussed much more openly.
Abbas Safa Bora, student, Ankara
It is the first time I'm happy about the results.
Especially over the past two years, many citizens have started to fear an authoritarian regime.
The success of HDP blocked that kind of fear. Right now, many of us are talking about possible early elections. Because of the confrontational politics of AKP, other parties in parliament do not want to join in a partnership with them.
There has been no freedom for journalists, there has been no freedom to protest against the AKP. Monitoring people's behaviours is a usual thing for our political culture.
If you quote my comments I will probably be followed by some state authorities. Anyway, sometimes, freedom needs self-sacrifice.
