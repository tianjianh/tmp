Wales local council elections 2017: All you need to know

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A year after the assembly elections and the EU referendum, Wales returns to the polls again in the first ballot box test for the parties since the Brexit vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On 4 May councillors will face the electorate, with all 1,254 seats up for grabs in Wales' 22 county and county borough councils.
Will Labour's low UK poll ratings mean the party will take a big hit in seats here? And will the politics of Brexit hurt - or benefit - the parties?
Labour is the party with the most seats in Wales - 580 - and therefore has the most to lose.
It did well at the last elections in 2012, adding 231 seats to its previous total.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has already warned that the elections will be tough for the party, in what appeared to be an effort in managing expectations.
Labour currently has a majority on ten councils across south Wales - stretching from Swansea to Newport - and also leads the Vale of Glamorgan and Flintshire as the largest group.
But some Labour activists fear it could lose its grip in areas such as Blaenau Gwent, where the party had a scare in the 2016 assembly elections.
And could Bridgend - Mr Jones' local council - slip into no overall control if the Tories gain seats and cut into Labour's majority?
If they have a really bad night, could Labour see numbers fall in north Wales?
Plaid Cymru has the second highest number of councillors at 170.
It had a bad night in 2012 when the party lost a council leader amid the Labour revival.
The party - which has a majority on Gwynedd council - will also be aiming to take overall control of Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, both of which it runs as a minority administration.
Plaid will also be looking for gains in the south Wales valleys.
The party will not discuss targets publicly, but there is potential for the party to do well in Rhondda Cynon Taf - where leader Leanne Wood won a seat at the assembly election last year.
Plaid will also work hard to get a majority on the Isle of Anglesey, where it is currently short by just four.
And could the party rebuild its councillor base in Caerphilly - an authority it has previously led?
The Welsh Conservatives currently stand in third place with 104 seats, and will be hoping it can benefit from Theresa May riding high in the polls.
The party - which runs Monmouthshire with Lib Dem support - could also do well in Swansea and in the Vale of Glamorgan, the local council of both Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies.   Any gains might mostly be at the expense of Labour.
Newport was led by the Tories as a minority administration with the Liberal Democrats from 2008 to 2012, and the Conservatives would undoubtedly think they can take a step forward in the city again.
The 2012 election left the Welsh Liberal Democrats the biggest losers - the party lost 66 seats, leaving it with 75 seats to defend in May.
Being on the losing side of the referendum has re-energised party activists, and they will be hoping to make gains in central Cardiff, where the party had an MP until 2015.
The Lib Dems lost control of Cardiff and Ceredigion at the last local election.  Both council areas voted Remain in the EU referendum.
And could the party make gains in Swansea?
It will surprise many how big the independent presence is at local council level. Independents are defending a large number of seats - 325.
They are a significant presence at Flintshire, Wrexham, Powys, Denbighshire, Conwy, Carmarthenshire, Ynys Mon, Pembrokeshire, Monmouthshire and Gwynedd.
And then there's UKIP. Its first AMs were elected in 2016, but its big issue is organisation on a local level. The former Welsh chair of the party, Chris Smart, has claimed the party is unravelling.
With no councillors in Wales currently, any seats won would be a boost.
If there is a natural home for UKIP in Wales, it may be the south east, where the party will want to capitalise on its strong showing at the general and assembly elections in Labour stamping grounds like Torfaen and Newport.
A big question at this election will be whether the EU referendum result will have any impact.
The Lib Dems will hope to rally voters around its strident pro-Remain views.
Plaid Cymru has pushed for years to expand its base in the south Wales valleys, but could its pro-EU stance damage those efforts in areas that voted heavily for Leave?
The same question could be raised of Labour, which is defending its running of councils in such areas.
But those parties may be helped by UKIP's difficulties, and the traditional weakness of the Conservatives in the Labour heartlands.
Most but not all councils count overnight. Nine out of the 22 will not start full counts until the next day.
Overnight counts:
Friday counts:
While laws are made at Westminster and the Welsh Assembly, councils operate services at a local level.
They do not run everything, but what they do run includes:
They also set rates of council tax.
Unlike the assembly elections, all councillors are elected on a first-past-the-post basis.
Voters in multi-member wards, though, would have the chance to select more than one councillor.
If you need to register to vote, you will need to do so by midnight on Thursday 13 April. You can do that at www.gov.uk/register-to-vote
Alternatively, paper forms can be downloaded or collected from local registration offices and need to be completed and handed in before the offices close that day.
If you want a postal vote and have not had one before, you have to apply by 18 April.
New proxy vote applications need to be made by 25 April.
