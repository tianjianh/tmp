"The first 42 minutes of the game - I'm really pleased. The manner in which we conceded the two goals - I'm really disappointed with.
"They were elementary mistakes, not League One mistakes.
"We should have dealt with the two goals better, and then we might have caused a few problems."
Preston manager Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire:

"We always knew this was going to be a tough game.
"We were comfortable enough but we needed to do a little bit better in the second half, in terms of getting closer to them and stopping them from playing.
"Once we got the second goal, it was quite a comfortable evening and it was nice to keep a clean sheet as well."
