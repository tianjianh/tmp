The centre, based at Virgin Money's headquarters, in Gosforth, will deal with bookings and customer feedback.
Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said: "Staff who know and use the line will be an asset to both Virgin Trains and Newcastle."
The company, along with Stagecoach, won an eight-year franchise in 2014 to run trains on the East Coast mainline.
The firm has previously announced plans to introduce 65 Virgin Azuma trains in 2018, which are being built at the Hitachi plant in Newton Aycliffe.
