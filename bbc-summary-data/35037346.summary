[SN]TITLE[SN]
Damion Vernon of Bridlington not seen for a year

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal for information about a man who has not been seen for a year has been made by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Damion Vernon, 32, of Bridlington, East Yorkshire, was last seen on 8 December 2014 and reported missing a day later.
He left a Vauxhall Corsa in Sycamore Street in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and has not returned home.
There is no suggestion of criminal activity and the case is to be kept open as a long-term missing person enquiry, said Humberside Police.
Officers investigating the case completed "all lines of enquiry" in June and nothing new has materialised since then, the force said.
Ch Insp Matt Baldwin said: "The past year has been an extremely difficult one for the family as, not only has Damion not returned home, his mother died in May."
He said officers had spoken to more than 200 people about the disappearance and carried out searches of the route that Mr Vernon, of Headlands Close, Bridlington, may have taken on the day he disappeared.
Images from CCTV have been watched and a search of a 35-mile (56km) stretch of the River Calder carried out but "every avenue has drawn a blank", Ch Insp Baldwin said.
The appeal has asked for anyone with information to come forward.
Mr Vernon is described as white, 6ft (1.8m) tall, with a slim build and light brown hair.
