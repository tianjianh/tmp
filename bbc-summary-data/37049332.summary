[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts winger Jamie Walker will serve a two-match ban after being found guilty of diving to win a penalty against Celtic last weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old attended a disciplinary hearing at Hampden to contest the Scottish FA charge of simulation.
Hearts say they are "deeply disappointed" with the verdict from the SFA's judiciary panel.
Walker was branded "a cheat" by Celtic captain Scott Brown following the incident at Tynecastle.
Despite Walker converting the first half penalty, Celtic went on to win the match 2-1.
He will be suspended for league matches against Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
