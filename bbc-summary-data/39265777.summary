Fake news: Five French election stories debunked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is little over a month before the first round of the French election. "Fake news" seeking to distort France's political conversation is increasingly seen as a threat to the democratic process.

The BBC is working in collaboration with CrossCheck, a journalism project set up by First Draft News comprising news organisations around Europe, to verify and debunk fake stories surrounding the upcoming French elections.
Here are five stories news organisations working with CrossCheck have investigated so far.
When Marion Marechal-Le Pen tweeted "30% of Macron's campaign funded by Saudi Arabia? We demand transparency", she appeared to have a reputable source. Le Soir is a French-language Belgian newspaper founded in 1887.
But she had been caught out by some digital trickery. Someone had cloned the newspaper website to make the story look legitimate and published a false story on a similar domain - LeSoir.info. To further cover the author's tracks, clicking on any of the links on the fake news report page took you to the real Le Soir website. It's unclear who created the false story, but the domain of the fake site is registered to a Donald Thomas in Delaware, United States. Ms Le Pen deleted her tweet.
After the deaths of French teenagers Zyed Benna and Bouna Traore, in October 2005, France was engulfed in rioting and unrest. A state of national emergency was called as police officers were attacked and over 9,000 cars were set on fire in the suburban "banlieues", often poor areas with large immigrant communities.
The map, which first appeared in a Daily Telegraph article on 8 November 2005, to highlight the riots and unrest then, has been shared thousands of times on social media in recent weeks. Far-right accounts have falsely claimed it depicts current rioting in France and have used it to endorse the existence of "no-go zones".
Le Figaro reports the Accor hotel group is selling 62 of its F1 brand hotels to the Societe Nationale Immobiliere (SNI) a community housing project. SAMU Social, a humanitarian public service offering emergency housing in several cities across France, will refer people who are in need of homes, including asylum seekers, to the project.
Separately, and entirely unrelated, in 2015 a subsidiary of the SNI, Adama, borrowed 100 million euros (Â£87.3 million) from the CEB. Adama helps people in difficulty, including workers in precarious circumstances, people on minimum social benefits, asylum seekers and migrants.
As Marine Le Pen visited Nantes for a rally in February, a tweet purportedly revealing her criticism of a children's cartoon was spreading on Twitter. But the image was a fake.
The person behind the tweet, who did not want to be named, told Crosscheck it was designed "to demonstrate how easy it is to misinform on Twitter" and that it "was part of the fight against [extreme right groups]".
The introduction of Muslim and Jewish public holidays in France is not a new idea. MEP Eva Joly proposed something similar when she stood as a French presidential candidate representing The Greens in 2012. And a recent report from the think tank, Terra Nova, reignited the debate when it recommended "integrating at least two important dates, Yom Kippur and Eid al-Adha, as public holidays".
However, the government has not announced such a measure and the think tank's recommendations do not have to be adopted.
