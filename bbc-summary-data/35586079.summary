Cavendish, 30, last competed at the event in 2009 and will partner Sir Bradley Wiggins again, after the pair won the world title the year before.
Last week, Cavendish won the Tour of Qatar road race for the second time.
Two-time world champion Becky James also returns after a two-year absence with a serious knee injury.
"We have selected the strongest squad available to us for these worlds," said technical director Shane Sutton. "We are in good shape and the team we have selected is close to the Olympic model."
Cavendish will take part in the omnium event at the Lee Valley VeloPark and combine with Wiggins in the madison, an event they won in Manchester in 2008.
Full Great Britain team for the UCI Track Cycling World Championships (2-6 March):
Women's sprint: Becky James, Katy Marchant, Jess Varnish.
Men's sprint: Matt Crampton, Phil Hindes, Jason Kenny, Callum Skinner.
