Birmingham Poundland admits rodent-chewed Santas charge

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evidence of mouse activity, including droppings on boxes of chocolate, was also found at the firm's large Corporation Street store in Birmingham, the city's crown court heard.
Poundland admitted eight offences relating to two of its outlets on the same street.
The city council conducted checks in February and September 2015.

Poundland, which has its head office in Willenhall, near Wolverhampton, pleaded guilty earlier this year to four food hygiene offences following the February check at the smaller of the two stores on Corporation Street.
The company's barrister admitted four further charges on behalf of the firm on Friday relating to the September check of the larger store including an allegation that "several chocolate items, being Father Christmas figures, had been gnawed at by a rodent or rodents".
The September inspection also uncovered the evidence of mouse activity, the court was told.
Further droppings were discovered on shelving in the shop floor area and on a trolley containing food while a hole allowing rodents access was found near pipework.
Poundland admitted several specific breaches of EU food and hygiene regulations, including failing to ensure food was protected from contamination.
Judge Richard Bond adjourned the case until 20 January after telling the court he needed further time to consider documents provided by the prosecution.
The judge said: "I have been in Poundland myself on many, many occasions.
"We are looking at a well-known limited company where the fines could be quite high."
