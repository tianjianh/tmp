Transfer deadline day signings in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The top two teams in the Scottish Premiership bolstered their squads on transfer deadline day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leaders and reigning champions Celtic completed the double capture of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven from Dundee United.
And second-place Aberdeen signed Kenny McLean from St Mirren.
Other Scottish clubs left it late to complete their squads for the rest of the season, including Rangers taking five Newcastle players on loan.
St Mirren have compensated for the loss of McLean by bringing in Emmanuel Sonupe on loan from Tottenham Hotspur, while United have signed Robbie Muirhead from Kilmarnock following the departures of Armstrong and Mackay-Steven.
Dundee signed up striker Paul Heffernan after he left Hibernian.
And Edinburgh clubs Hearts and Hibs also recruited, with Kenny Anderson joining the former and Fraser Fyvie moving to Easter Road.
The window closed at 00:00 GMT.
