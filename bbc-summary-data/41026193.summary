The 26-year-old joined Rangers in January 2016 from Doncaster and went on to make 44 appearances, half of which came in the Scottish Premiership.
"Harry brings a quality going forward that we need a little bit more of," said assistant manager Neil Cox.
"His goalscoring record is good, he's played at a higher level and he just wants to get started."
Forrester was on the books of Northampton, Watford and Aston Villa as a junior but made his breakthrough in senior football during a loan spell at Kilmarnock.
He joined Brentford in 2011, playing 69 times, and then had a two-and-a-half-year spell at Doncaster.
