The club made a loss after tax of £182,119, compared to £391,304 in the 2015 financial year.
Turnover for the year increased by more than £100,000, helped by an increase in prize money from the club's victory in the T20 Blast last season.
"I am exceptionally proud of this result and financial turnaround," chairman Gavin Warren said.
"It is testament to the hard work and belief that has gone on in the past two-and-a-half years by all stakeholders involved with Northamptonshire County Cricket Club."
An update on a proposed share offer will be given at the club's AGM on 30 March, after members voted to make the club a limited company in September.
