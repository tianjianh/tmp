Zoumana Bakayogo: Crewe Alexandra still waiting for left-back to sign new deal

Crewe Alexandra may be forced to look elsewhere for another left-back if Zoumana Bakayogo does not commit his future to the club soon reports BBC Radio Stoke.

Bakayogo, 29, was offered a new deal in May but is yet to inform the Alex whether he will be signing it.
He made 22 appearances as Crewe were relegated from League One last season.
"We are looking at other people if Zoum doesn't come," assistant boss James Collins said.
Former Millwall, Tranmere and Leicester defender Bakayogo signed a short-term deal in January at Gresty Road, after a two-year injury lay-off.
But Collins revealed they are still in the dark over whether he will be staying.
"It's strung along a little bit longer than we would've liked but these players have got to look after their families," Collins told BBC Radio Stoke.
"Nobody wants to hold players to ransom and say 'you've got to make a decision' but we also don't want to get to pre-season without a left-back in the squad - John Guthrie can fill in there but he's now an established centre-back.
"If Zoom doesn't come we're going to need one but it may come to a point where if somebody pops up first, who will be good enough, we may have to act on that.
"It's Steve's (manager Steve Davis) decision and I'm sure it'll come to a head soon."
