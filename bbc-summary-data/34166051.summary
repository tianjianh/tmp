Hundreds of migrants have been arriving in Germany and Austria as the migrant crisis continues across Europe.

Earlier this week, Hungary stopped migrants from travelling onwards by train, prompting hundreds to set off walking towards the border with Austria. Under pressure, Hungary eventually relaxed restrictions on the movement of asylum seekers.
Buses and coaches have transported thousands of migrants from the Hungarian capital Budapest  to the Austrian border, with others travelling by train. Hungary said on Saturday that its bus service to the border had been a one-off measure, however.
When they reached the border, migrants waited to board buses to a train station in the Austrian village of Nickelsdorf.  Hungary has said it is pressing ahead with plans to tighten border controls despite temporarily relaxing the restrictions.
Austrian police officers helped people board trains in Nickelsdorf, with some picking up young children. From there, many headed to Vienna.
There were large crowds at the western rail station in Vienna as the migrants arrived.  For many, the destination was Munich.
When they arrived in Munich on a special train service, they were greeted with cheers and applause by locals who had gathered to greet them.

Some 450 people arrived on the first service into Munich.

She has said Germany can cope with an influx of newcomers, with her spokesman saying the decision to open borders to asylum seekers was an exceptional case.
Meanwhile, migrants are continuing to travel into Europe in their thousands, with many travelling there from Turkey, by boat. Here, on the Greek island of Lesbos, they waited for a registration process to begin.

A new transit centre for migrants has been set up at the border between Greece and Macedonia. From there, this group boards a train heading to Serbia.
From Serbia, some are then travelling on to Hungary. This group is watched by riot police after crossing the border as they wait in a field near the village of Roszke.
