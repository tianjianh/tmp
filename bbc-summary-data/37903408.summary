Police investigating the fatal shooting of a man who left home after a knock at his door are appealing for a person who tried to save him to come forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Blake died in hospital after neighbours found him near his Manchester Road home in Westhoughton, Bolton on Thursday evening.
He left his home "willingly" with a man in a van and there appeared to be "no motive" for the killing, police said.
Police believe the witness who tended to him could hold vital information.
Police were initially called to what was believed to be a "fail to stop" collision.
However, officers found 28-year-old Mr Blake with a gunshot wound to his leg and the back of his head.
He died the next morning of his injuries.
Officers understand a man went to Mr Blake's home to report his injuries and then went back to try to administer first aid.
He had left the scene by the time police arrived.
Det Ch Insp Richard Mortimer said: "We are looking at several lines of inquiry in order to understand exactly what happened leading up to Michael being shot and establish a motive for such a brutal attack.
"I would like to appeal directly to the man who administered first aid on Michael after the incident to please get in touch, as your help could prove vital to our attempts to find those responsible."
Officers also want to speak to anyone in the Wigan Road, Park Road or Church Street areas between 22:30 GMT and 23:30 who saw anything suspicious or saw a light-coloured van.
