He completed the 138 nautical mile voyage from Cowes to Dinard in nine hrs three mins and six secs last month.
It has been acknowledged as the fastest single-handed crossing in a yacht less than 60 feet long by the World Sailing Speed Record Council.
"It's fantastic news and a great feeling to have an official world record under my belt," Sharp said.

Sharp sailed his 40-foot Imerys yacht between the isle of Wight and northern France on 24 November, taking almost three hours off the previous record that had stood for 12 years.
"Imerys was on fire in these windy conditions. These latest Class 40's are seriously optimised racing machines, averaging speeds of 15 knots and surfing at over 20 knots," he said.
"It is still difficult to believe that Imerys managed to carve three hours off the previous time. Hopefully this sets the bar high enough to hold on to the record for some time at least."
