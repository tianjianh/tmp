Powell, 21, featured 16 times last year and played in the season opener loss to Huddersfield, and a warm-up match against New Zealand Warriors.
"It is a big blow for Sam, who has worked really hard in pre-season," said head coach Shaun Wane.
"But with his character I'm sure he will bounce back stronger."
The full extent of Powell's injury will be assessed when Warriors return home after the game in Sydney.
