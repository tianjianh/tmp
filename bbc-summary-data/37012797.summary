Elaine Steele, 59, of Oxhenholme, Cumbria, was struck by the five tonne vehicle while walking by the A591 at Troutbeck Bridge in February 2015.
Angus Freemen, a farmer, admitted causing death by careless driving.
The judge at Carlisle Crown Court sentenced the 33-year-old to a 24-week prison term, suspended for 12 months.
He was also banned from driving for a year and told to pay Â£545 costs.
The court heard Freeman, who used the route every day, could give no explanation for failing to observe a "give way" sign immediately before joining the A591 and striking Ms Steele,
