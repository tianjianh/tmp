The With Love From Liverpool event, at the Echo Arena on 19 September, will raise funds for the British Red Cross.
Among those performing will be local acts The Farm, OMD and John Power.
The event's co-host, BBC Radio 2 presenter Janice Long, said she had been "blown away" by the city's response to the crisis.
She said: "People across Liverpool have shown that they really care in hundreds of different ways, and they've come together to do what they can to ease this terrible situation."
Peter Hooton, lead singer of The Farm, said: "When we were approached to perform at the concert, we immediately said 'yes' - it was a no-brainer, no matter how short the notice was. We've all been moved by what is a humanitarian crisis and we've all got a role to play in supporting those in need. I just know Liverpool and its people will come out in force to support this concert - it's what we do, it's who we are."
Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said: "Liverpool's response to last week's horrifying revelations surrounding the ongoing refugee crisis has been nothing short of overwhelming. When it comes to reaching out and offering solidarity to the families whose homes have been ripped away from them, Liverpool is leading the way.
"Now, Liverpool is stepping up to the plate once more with the With Love From Liverpool concert. We're using our reputation for world-class music to now help save lives across the globe."
