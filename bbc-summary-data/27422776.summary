The images were the top sellers in an auction of post-war and contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York.
Jeff Koons' sculpture Popeye went for $28.2m (£16.8m), breaching its estimated value of $25m.
The buyer, casino magnate Steve Wynn, said the sculpture would go on display in one of his Las Vegas properties.
Other highlights included Gerhard Richter's Blau, which fetched $28.7m (£17.1m), Jean-Michel Basquiat's Undiscovered, which took $23.7m (£14.1m), and an untitled work by Mark Rothko that sold for $12.2m (£7.2m).
Artists reaching new records for their works included Keith Haring, James Rosenquist, Dan Flavin and Mike Kelley.
An untitled work by Willem de Kooning, which was expected to sell for up to $25m (£14.9m), went unsold after it failed to reach the lower estimate of $18m (£10.7m).
Alex Rotter, Sotheby's worldwide head of contemporary art, described the market as "solid", although the sale failed to match the frenzied bidding at a Christie's sale earlier this week.
The Christie's sale of post-war and contemporary art, also in New York, raised $744m (£441m), the highest ever total for a single auction - with two works from Warhol's Death and Disaster series selling for a combined $100m (£59m).
