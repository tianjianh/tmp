Kieran Brookes, 14, from Devon, died after the straps of his backpack became entangled on a ski lift in Chatel.
The French court  in Chambery said no further action would be taken against SAEM Sports et Tourisme a Chatel.
French prosecutors had appealed on behalf of the family after SAEM was cleared of corporate manslaughter.

Judges in Chambery ruled there was no criminal wrongdoing by the company and rejected the application to appeal.
Kieran's father, Nick, said: "It's been a very long process and I am confident that they have investigated it and learned from it, but disappointed at the outcome."
Kieran, from Bovey Tracey, was in the French Alps resort of Chatel in 2011 when he was strangled by his clothing.
Richard Cettour, who was supervising the lift at the time, was found guilty of indirect manslaughter and received a six month suspended sentence in 2015.
He had been at the back of the hut cleaning tools at the time.
A civil case against SAEM is expected to take place in the UK at a later date.
