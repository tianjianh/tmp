Justin Skrebowski, 61 was buying balloons when he was attacked by a man who grabbed a knife from a shelf in the Abingdon branch on 7 December.
His wife Gulsen Alkan now wants retailers to display knives in locked cabinets or secure packaging.
Her petition has garnered more than 1,000 signatures.
Oxford West and Abingdon MP Nicola Blackwood, who supports the campaign, called on the government and retailers to "make it more difficult" to get hold of weapons in the wake of the fatal stabbing.
Ms Blackwood tweeted: "Justin's killer just picked a knife off the shop shelves. His widow Gulsen, with my support, is calling for change."
In the petition Ms Alkan said: "Police told me that Justin had no chance that day, it all happened so quickly he didn't even see the attacker's face.
"It's hard to believe that it was that easy to pick up a knife.
"Cigarettes are kept out of sight behind the counter; are cigarettes more dangerous than knives?
"It breaks my heart that I wasn't there for my husband when he was killed. I want to do something now."
David Cameron said he would look into the availability of "offensive weapons" during Prime Minister Questions last year.
Trevor Joyce, 36 of Franklyn Close, Abingdon was charged with murder after the attack and is due to appear at Oxford Crown Court on 7 March.
Thames Valley Police said it had voluntarily referred itself to the IPCC following the stabbing.
