They won only four games last season and failed to progress beyond the group stage for the first time since 2008.
Hampshire opened this year's T20 Blast campaign with a 22-run win over Glamorgan and face Sussex Sharks in their second game on Wednesday.
Hove has been a happy hunting ground for Hampshire, who have not lost there since 2010, winning five times.
"The boys feel confident, they've had a lot of success over the years. Last year lots of different things happened at the club," said White.
"We had lots of injuries and other issues, this year we don't have those issues and we have fit players, fingers crossed they remain fit."
"Then you're starting to select teams on merit and trying to get the best eleven, we didn't have that luxury last year and I think the results followed suit."
