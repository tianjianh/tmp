A police chief who wanted to "batter and break the legs" of a man convicted of a stabbing has defended his remarks.

Surrey's Police and Crime Commissioner, Kevin Hurley, posted on his Facebook page he was angry the "criminal has destroyed the confidence of a family".
He said the knifeman was about to be released from prison just months after stabbing his neighbour in Tandridge.
"I felt the pain of that family and I wanted to protect them. Of course I can't do that, it's against the law."
Mr Hurley, who is standing for re-election as an independent in this year's elections for Police and Crime Commissioners, said he was expressing his "sense of frustration and powerlessness" at the way in which "the criminal justice system is failing people".
"I'm here to speak out for the Surrey public and I will do so," he told BBC Surrey.
His Conservative rival David Munro condemned the comments as vile, and accused Mr Hurley of encouraging people to break the law.
"As a senior law and order officer in the county, why say it? I think it's grossly irresponsible.
"We've got a justice system, it's a good justice system, with all its flaws, in this country and we should obey it," Mr Munro said.
He added that Mr Hurley's Facebook post was "deliberate, childish, and irresponsible".
Mr Hurley said he had no regrets, and the post had attracted "thousands of likes, [and] hundreds of people are commenting online about how at last someone is speaking out for victims".
