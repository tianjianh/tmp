Michael Keen, 42, was stabbed in 15 times and was found dead at a house in Hazel Avenue, Darwen, Lancashire in August last year.
A Merseyside-based organised crime gang supplying drugs in the Darwen area was linked to the killing, police said.
Daniel Bamford, of Harvey Lane, Warrington, was found guilty of manslaughter. He was jailed for a total of 16 years at Preston Crown Court.
He had also earlier admitted one count of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and two counts of supplying Class A drugs.
Mr Keen had been forced into allowing Bamford, a gang enforcer, to oversee the supply of drugs from his home, police said.
The pair had argued and Mr Keen was stabbed in the head, neck, arm, abdomen and back on 25 August, police said.
Det Insp Zoe Russo said: "This was a challenging and at times complex investigation.
"Bamford is clearly a dangerous and violent offender whose actions led to Michael Keen's death."
