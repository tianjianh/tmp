About 50 hectares (124 acres) of the Tame Valley Wetland and its Grade II-listed structures, are being enhanced.
The project will also include the development of cycle and footpaths between Birmingham and Tamworth.
The work will be carried out by the Tame Valley Wetlands Landscape Partnership, led by Warwickshire Wildlife Trust.
Scheme manager, Tim Haselden, said he hoped the £2.5m project would create a "vital asset for the community and local economy".
"Our work will help to restore and reconnect this fragmented and threatened landscape, by creating new wildlife habitats," he said.
The wetlands extend along a 30km (18 mile) stretch of the River Tame; from Coleshill, in Birmingham, up to Tamworth, in Staffordshire.
