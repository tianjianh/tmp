The 34-year-old, who was released from his contract this summer after two years with Doncaster Rovers, has secured a one-year contract.
Tyson told Kilmarnock's website: "I'm very excited to face a new challenge as I've never had the opportunity to play top-flight football.
"When the chance came, I couldn't say no, so I jumped at it."
Tyson began his professional career at Reading and spent six seasons at Nottingham Forest, making more than 200 appearances for the club.
After further moves to Derby and Blackpool - plus loan spells at Fleetwood Town and Notts County - he joined Doncaster in 2014.
Tyson, who played for England at under-20 level, lost his place to new signing Gary McSheffrey at the end of the last season and had his contract terminated "by mutual consent" after Doncaster's relegation to England's League Two.
Port Vale manager Bruno Rebeiro had expressed his desire to sign the striker - who scored 21 goals in 80 Doncaster appearances - for the League One club earlier this summer.
However, last week he joined League Two outfit Carlisle United on trial and scored in a friendly against Queen of the South.
