Lucy Haughey, a Channel 4 Come Dine With Me winner, bombarded Sharon Low with messages for almost a year.
She was due to be sentenced earlier this month but the case was continued for the sheriff to ensure all abusive posts were removed from social media.
The 36-year-old admitted cyber-stalking Ms Low between June 2015 and May 2016.
Sheriff Linda Ruxton sentenced Haughey at Glasgow Sheriff Court after being told all comments had been taken off the internet.
She handed her a community payback order with the condition she must do 250 hours unpaid work within eight months, and granted a two-year non-harassment order.
The sheriff said: "I am satisfied that all postings concerning the complainer have now been removed from any social media sites.
"I made it absolutely clear on the last occasion that I regard this as a very serious offence.
"I said to you that your conduct was frankly wicked. You caused untold distress and misery to someone you did not even know, causing her embarrassment and public humiliation."
The two women had never met but Haughey, from Crosshill, Glasgow, repeatedly sent messages to Ms Low.
Haughey also admitted contacting Ms Low's mother by phone and calling Ms Low at her work and then hanging up.
Ms Low also received a text message which stated: "I know your secrets, all of them, leave us alone or it's all out there."
The victim closed down her Facebook account but received more messages to a new account she thought was anonymous.
One message included the words "watch your attitude, watch that high horse and watch your fake life on here, there's always someone watching who knows the truth".
Defence lawyer Paul McCue told an earlier hearing that Haughey was in an abusive relationship at the time and had been manipulated into making contact with Ms Low.
Mr McCue confirmed that Haughey had deactivated her Facebook account.
