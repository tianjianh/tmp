[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wrexham's Gerry McDonagh had the best opportunity of the first half but he missed from six yards.
Home keeper Rory Watson denied Callum Powell and John Rooney twice fired wide as Wrexham drew a third successive game.
A point was enough to see North Ferriby move off the bottom of the table.
Wrexham remain 14th in the table and Dean Keates' side are nine points off the play-off places.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "You look at the overall game and there was only one clear cut chance, on the stroke of half-time, and he's [McDonagh] got to score.
"It was very frustrating with not enough chances created on our behalf.
"It wasn't good enough and the intensity wasn't high enough. We played the game at their tempo and let them slow it down."
