Mansfield markets: Approved merger to be reviewed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Approved plans to merge two markets in a Nottinghamshire town, opposed by many stallholders, will be reviewed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision to join Town Hall and Westgate markets in Mansfield was taken by the district council on 13 November.
The move also includes the number of market days reduced, stalls moved and Â£100,000 in improvements to the existing Town Hall marketplace.
A group of councillors have formally challenged the move. The plans will be re-examined on 9 December.
Independent councillor Stewart Rickersey, of Mansfield District Council, had approved the plans, which include a reduction of trading days from six to five days a week to allow special events and concerts - prompting protests from traders.
Six opposition Labour councillors have now "called in" that decision.
Steve Buxton, who runs a stall on Westgate, said it was "marvellous the council is now listening to us... we have not been listened to all the way through this campaign".
However, Mr Buxton believes the redevelopment would be "great for Mansfield, but not at the expense of the livelihoods of 75 different traders and businesses".
Some traders believe if the change still goes ahead it will mean a drop in footfall.
Market trader Steve Louth had said: "We can't afford to drop any takings - it has happened before and that is why the market is half empty."
Westgate stallholder Sue McFarland added: "This will put us - me and plenty of others - out of business. We will not survive down there."
Executive Mayor Kate Allsop said she wanted the town to have "a bustling marketplace" with many new traders.
