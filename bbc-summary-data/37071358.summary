Rangers boss Mark Warburton admitted Harry Forrester could have been red-carded in the 2-1 win over Dundee.

Forrester, already on a yellow card, brought down Cammy Kerr and Michael Duffy but escaped a second caution.
"There were many contentious decisions. We were going to take him off anyway," said Warburton, who substituted Forrester after 69 minutes.
"Another referee might have given it [a second yellow] but I can't comment on that."
Forrester, who opened the scoring with a powerful volley, felt there was not too much in the challenges.
"It is what it is and the manager has decided to sub me," he also told BT Sport. "But I'll know to tone it down in future."
After Forrester gave Rangers the lead at Dens Park, Kenny Miller doubled the advantage.
Mark O'Hara pulled Dundee back into it after poor defending at a corner, and it was a nervy finish for last season's Scottish Championship winners before they eventually saw the game out.
"We were loose. We gave the ball away cheaply," said Warburton. "But at the end we should have been out of sight.
"We dipped a little bit in the second half, we were a little bit hesitant, a bit nervous."
The Rangers manager also said he is looking to make new signings next week.
"We are looking for a number of players," he added. "We're looking for a striking option and a defensive option. Hopefully we can make some progress in the next few days."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley is "hopeful" of being able to spend some of the money raised by the sales of Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart because he believes his team "needs reinforcements".
"We need it, especially in the final third," Hartley told BBC Scotland. "Hopefully we can add one or two additions to the squad.
"The [current strikers] have got to step up and show they're worth a place in the team, but we still want to strengthen and add to the group."
Rory Loy started up front and summer signings Yordi Teijsse and Faisal El Bhaktoui came off the bench to boost the attack.
"I felt the second half was really good," added Hartley. "In the first half we should have kept the ball much better. We lost two poor goals. There are really encouraging signs for us.
"We tried to exploit their weaknesses, tried to get in behind them. What we worked on all week nearly worked today."
