Nathan Joseph, 22, left his 30-year-old victim with serious head injuries following the attack at Ancaster Leisure Paintball Centre on 6 February.
Lincolnshire Police said the attack "could potentially have had a fatal outcome".
Joseph, of no fixed abode, was charged with attempted murder but admitted grievous bodily harm with intent.
His plea to the lesser offence was accepted by prosecutors at Lincoln Crown Court in March.

The court heard Joseph and his victim had been at the centre with separate partie.
Joseph had become aggressive with the other man during a confrontation, and began to hit him on the head with a paintball gun.
He continued to do so while he was laid on the floor, police said.
Det Insp Simon Bromiley said: "This was a serious and malicious assault that could potentially have had a fatal outcome and the lack of remorse from Joseph was noticeable."
