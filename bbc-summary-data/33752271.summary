Lucy Hargreaves was 22 when she was killed at her home in Walton on 3 August 2005.
Three men entered her house while she slept on the sofa, shot her and then set fire to the building.
Police have released images of a man they want to trace in connection with the murder.
Ms Hargreaves' partner and toddler daughter escaped the fire by jumping from an upstairs window.
Detectives continue to search for Kevin Thomas Parle, 35, who they believe is living abroad.
Det Ch Insp Mark Tivendale said: "Ten years on, this murder remains one of the most brutal and callous acts we have ever seen on Merseyside.
"Even as a toddler was heard crying upstairs, the offenders poured petrol around the living room and hallway and set fire to the house."
There is a European warrant out for Mr Parle's arrest in relation to the death of teenager Liam Kelly.
The 16-year-old was murdered in the early hours of 19 June 2004 as he got out of a car in Grafton Street, Dingle.
A number of images of what Mr Parle may look like now have been released.
"Lucy was an innocent victim and 10 years on, her family deserve answers for the loving mother and daughter they were robbed of," Det Ch Insp Tivendale said.
Detectives are also appealing for information about a gold Lexus car with the registration NAD 499. The car was found burnt out in Richard Kelly Drive, Clubmoor shortly after the murder.
