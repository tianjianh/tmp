The 60ft (18m) tree crashed onto two homes in Mendip Heights shortly after 21:00 GMT on Tuesday.
Fire crews had to use chainsaws to cut away the branches of the tree to free trapped residents.
Station manager Paul Webster said: "This must have been really scary for the occupiers. People don't expect a tree of this size to be blown over."

A parked car and a motorcycle were also crushed by the tree.
Neighbour Phil Keable said: "I heard this massive crack, grabbed the dog and ran out to the front door and there was a tree in the doorway."
The storm, in which winds peaked at 85mph, saw electricity cut off to several thousand homes in Oxfordshire.
A spokesman for Scottish and Southern Electric Power Distribution said engineers worked through the night, and power had been restored to all homes.
