[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two late goals from Ryan Hardie saw Raith Rovers move nine points clear of Championship bottom side St Mirren to leave the Buddies five points adrift.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors had 66% of possession in the first half but failed to manage a shot on target.
Rovers' Declan McManus hit the post with a free-kick, before Hardie headed the opener with 16 minutes left.
The 19-year-old, on loan at Saints earlier this season, rounded keeper Billy O'Brien to roll in his second.
While victory lifted Rovers up to seventh place, above Dumbarton, defeat was a major setback in St Mirren's bid to beat the drop to League One, having won their past two league games.
With 10 matches left they still have home games to come against each of the four teams immediately above them, but four of Saints' last five games are away to the current top four.
