Five people have been charged with multiple sexual offences after Sydney's police found footage apparently showing a gang rape of a 16-year-old girl.

Police said the suspects were four men in their 20s and a 17-year-old boy.
They were arrested after police conducting an anti-graffiti operation found the footage on a GoPro camera.
The alleged assault took place in May during a party in Sydney's suburb of St Clair, police said, and was not reported at the time.
The 16 minutes of footage, found later that month, depicted "multiple sexual assaults of a teenage girl by a number of male offenders," a New South Wales police statement said.
Police are alleging up to eight men were in the room at the time, with a number of them involved in the assault.
Detective Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans, from the Child Abuse squad, was quoted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that "it was quite obvious to investigators when viewing this footage that the child was either unconscious or semi-conscious during these assaults".
Officials believe that the victim - who has not been identified and is currently in counselling - may have had her drink spiked at the party.
Australian media have named two of the men charged with sexual assault at Penrith Local Court as Andrew Waters and Kurt Stevenson. Another man and an unnamed teenager also face similar charges.
A fifth person, Tristan Carlyle-Watson, was charged with concealing a serious offence.
