The 30-year-old joined Cobblers on a one-year deal last summer, making 25 appearances in all competitions.
But boss Justin Edinburgh said the club were unable to "get comfortable" with his commitments to DR Congo.
"Gaby is a top professional, we wish him all the very best for his future career," said Edinburgh.
