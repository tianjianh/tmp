It comes as Radio 1 has announced that the teenage cancer patient, who raised almost ??5m for charity before his death in May, will have an award presented in his name at this year's Teen Awards.
Jane Sutton added: "My son was courageous and inspirational.
"I'm immensely proud of everything he achieved."
The 19-year-old, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, died after launching an appeal in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.
He made a bucket list of 46 things he wanted to achieve and raised money during the process.
The charity recently announced ??2.9m of the ??4.96m raised through donations and gift aid would be invested in specialist cancer units for young people.
Jane Sutton said: "When he first started fundraising for Teenage Cancer Trust, never in his wildest dreams did he think he would reach ??5 million.
"As well as all the other ambitious goals on his bucket list, he really wanted to help other young people with cancer. He has certainly done that.
"He wasn't going to let his cancer stop him making the most of every minute and he often used to say, 'I may have cancer, but cancer doesn't have me'."
This year's Radio 1 Teen Awards will take place at Wembley Arena to honour some of the UK's unsung teenage heroes as well as music, online, sport and entertainment stars.
Radio 1 listeners have nominated friends and family aged 12 to 17 for the awards in recognition of their bravery, strength and selflessness.
Previous listener nominations have included relatives, work colleagues, friends and carers.
As well as the Teen Heroes, other prizes include best British group, British vlogger, British actor and British sports star, which will be voted for by Radio 1 listeners.
Stephen Sutton's mother added: "We will never forget Stephen, his spirit will live on in all that he achieved and shared with so many.
"His selfless fundraising and positive attitude to life touched countless hearts across the world and the huge outpouring of love and support he received in return helped him throughout his journey.
"Stephen found the kind words and messages of support from so many people he didn't know deeply humbling and I know that it made him really happy.
"He loved life and wanted to live every day to the full, preferring to measure life in terms of achievement and not time."
