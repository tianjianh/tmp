Football club owners across Europe spent much of January thrashing out multi-million pound deals to sign players during the month's transfer window.
In total, a massive £950m (€1.3bn; $1.4bn)  has been spent by the 20 Premier League sides this season - an all-time high transfer outlay - and the game's highest earners now receive bigger pay packets than ever before.
Back in 2001, when Sol Campbell left Tottenham for London rivals Arsenal, his £100,000 a week contract made him Britain's first footballer to earn a six-figure weekly sum. Fourteen years later, Wayne Rooney's current deal at Manchester United, signed last February, earns the England captain almost £300,000 each week.
According to football finance experts at Deloitte, the average wage for Premier League players rose to £1.6m during the 2012-13 season - the latest available data. That equates to £31,000 a week, which is more than the average UK worker earns in a year.
Special Report: A Richer World
The football wage calculator is part of the BBC's A Richer World season. Hosting three months of dedicated content across TV, radio and online, the season explores wealth, poverty and inequality around the world.
Note: Player salary figures used are reported by or understood to be accurate by BBC Sport. The figures are pre-tax and do not include additional player income from sponsorship or other commercial deals. Country and global average wage statistics have been produced by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The ILO's data only counts wage earners, not the self-employed or people on benefits. To compare wages across countries, the calculator adjusts all figures by using the World Bank's Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) conversion rate, which reflects variations in the cost of living from one country to another. Football shirt data has been collected in December 2014 from official club websites.
