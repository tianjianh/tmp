The 10-minute mini-movies will be shown on loop at 37 different sites, including Liverpool Cathedral, Granby Four Streets and The Beatles Story.
Peter Capaldi, Dominic West and Gemma Arterton are among the thespians starring in the films.
Shakespeare's Globe produced the series for the 400th anniversary of his death.
Liverpool is the only city outside of London to host 'The Complete Walk', which is also playing along the banks of the Thames this weekend.
The shorts include footage shot in the real locations of the plays.
Viewers watching the Merchant of Venice will see Jonathan Pryce playing Shylock at Banco Rosso in the Jewish Ghetto of Venice, while Anthony and Cleopatra has scenes filmed at the Red Pyramid in Egypt.
They also include footage of the BFI's Silent Shakespeare films and newly created animation.
Nick Bagnall, Associate Director of the Everyman and Playhouse theatres, directed three of the films and said he was "really excited" to see them screened.
"I think it's brilliant that we've got the hunger for it and the appetite for it.
"It's fantastic for the city... we're going to need a bike to get around all of the venues to see them!"
Dominic Dromgoole, artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe, said the films "give a flavour of that particular play and give a wonderful overview of the whole of the work."
