Officers have been at Harbour Road in Pagham for almost 24 hours after receiving a report of "threatening behaviour" at 16.10 BST on Sunday.
A woman known to the man was in the house at the time but left shortly after police arrived.
The man remains in the property alone, Sussex Police said.
A cordon has been placed around Harbour Road while negotiators make contact with the suspect.
Det Sup Carwyn Hughes said: "The safety of the local community is our utmost priority."
Mr Hughes added:  "People living in properties along Harbour Road are free to come and go with police support.
"We are doing all we can to make sure their daily routines and bank holiday plans are not disrupted."
