Counter-terrorism police investigating fraud allegations linked to extremists travelling to Syria have charged six men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men, five of them from London and one from Luton, have been charged with conspiracy to defraud. They are aged between 21 and 38.
The charges follow raids on six London addresses and one Luton address on Wednesday by the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command.
The men will appear in court later.
They are: Makzhumi Abukar, 23, of Holloway; Mohammed Sharif Abokar, 27, of Islington; Sakaria Aden, 21, of Stoke Newington; Mohamed Dahir, 22, of Finsbury Park; Yasser Abukar, 23, of Holloway; and Ibrahim Anderson, 38, of Luton, Bedfordshire.
Five of the men will appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates' Court later, while Mr Abokar will appear at Dunstable Magistrates' Court.
A 32-year-old woman arrested on Wednesday morning on suspicion of money laundering has been bailed.
A 46-year-old woman who was arrested at one of the addresses raided by officers in north London on suspicion of an offence under section 2 of the Child Abduction Act 1984 has been bailed.
The arrest is in relation to an investigation into a young girl who is believed to have travelled to Turkey, but whose current whereabouts are unknown, police said.
Two women, aged 20 and 21, were previously arrested as part of this investigation in February and have been bailed to a date in late June.
