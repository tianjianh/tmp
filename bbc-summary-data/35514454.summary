The England striker, 29, joined Leicester from Fleetwood for Â£1m in 2012, and his goals have helped Claudio Ranieri's side reach the top of the Premier League table this season.
"I'm absolutely delighted to be fighting to achieve something special with this club. I've never known a spirit like it," he said.
"I want to be part of it for a long time."
He added: "Leicester have shown nothing but total faith in me since the day I arrived and it's impossible to measure how much that belief has helped me to improve.
"I'll forever be grateful for the investment the club has made in me and I'll spend every day working to repay it."
In November, Vardy became the first player to score in 11 successive Premier League matches.
He broke the record, previously held by Ruud van Nistelrooy, when he put Leicester ahead in their 1-1 draw with Van Nistelrooy's former club Manchester United.
After Saturday's 3-1 win at Manchester City, Claudio Ranieri's side are five points clear at the top of the Premier League table.
Of Vardy, Italian Ranieri said: "Jamie is a fighter. He has had an unbelievable journey to get to this point in his career and continues to play every game as if it's his last.
"I love his spirit, which is a quality I want in my players above all else. I am very happy that he will stay with us for a long time."
