The ride will be one of the most unusual methods of travel for the torch during the 70-day relay.
Other North East landmarks the flame will visit include Hadrian's Wall, the Angel of the North, St Mary's Lighthouse and the Penshaw Monument.
It will also go through Ashington, in Northumberland, twice in one day.
During its time in the North East it will be carried down the coast of Northumberland and around the Tyne and Wear areas before arriving on Teesside.
There will be three overnight stops in the area with evenings of celebrations on each night.
These are in Alnwick on 14 June, Newcastle on 15 June and Durham on 16 June.
The North East leg of the journey will begin at Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland.
Councillor Neil Bradbury, from Northumberland County Council, said preparations were already under way for the torch's visit.
"Over the coming months, towns and villages along the route will be planning welcome celebrations on behalf of the surrounding communities so that we can all get involved," he said.
The flame will be carried through Sunderland on 16 June before heading to Durham for an overnight stop.
Councillor Paul Watson, leader of Sunderland Council, said: "This is a once-in-a lifetime opportunity and a very proud day for Sunderland.
"We want as many people as possible to have the chance to see the Olympic flame as it passes through our city.
"This is a fantastic opportunity for people to be involved in something that will be talked about for generations to come and to demonstrate the warm welcome that Sunderland is famed for."
The Olympic flame will arrive in the UK from Greece on 18 May 2012.
The relay will begin at Land's End, Cornwall, the next day and ends on Friday, 27 July in the Olympic Stadium.
