Kyrgios beat the 12th seed 6-4 7-6 (7-4) to set up a semi-final against Japan's Kei Nishikori.
The result means Kyrgios, who turns 21 on 27 April, will become the youngest man in the top 20 for seven years.
In the women's draw, Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova and Belarusian Victoria Azarenka won their semi-finals.
Raonic had not dropped serve all week in Miami, but Kyrgios broke the Canadian in the first game - the only break of the contest.
"That definitely set the tone," said Kyrgios. "I've really learned how to return this year and I'm moving really well, so I'm giving myself more opportunities."
Kyrgios fended off five break points and restricted Raonic to four aces over the course of one hour and 44 minutes.
Having won his first ATP title in Marseille last month, the Australian has now broken new ground at the elite Masters level.
"I'm feel as if I'm a lot stronger, a lot fitter and I've just got more experience," he said. "The last couple of years on tour have been a bit of a rollercoaster, but I've learned a lot."
Asked about the new ranking, he said: "It's pretty cool, but there are 19 guys in front of me."
Nishikori saved five match points to win a dramatic quarter-final against Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3).
Former US and French Open champion Kuznetsova reached the Miami Open final for the first time since she won in 2006 with a 7-5 6-3 victory over Swiss Timea Bacsinszky.
The 30-year-old, ranked 19th, beat Serena Williams in the fourth round and will return to the top 10 for the first time in six years if she takes the title.
"I don't think if I get to top 10 or not," she said.
"When I go and I see the rankings I am confident I can beat these players and players from the top 10."
The in-form Azarenka avenged her only defeat of the season against Angelique Kerber at the Australian Open as she beat the German 6-2 7-5.
Azarenka, 26, is now one win away from emulating Steffi Graf and Kim Clijsters by winning back-to-back Indian Wells and Miami titles.
"I have a job to do on Saturday, regardless if it's going to make history," said Azarenka. "I'm ready, I'm prepared and I'm going out there hungry."
