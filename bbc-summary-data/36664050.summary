Centuries from Gloucestershire pair Chris Dent and Graeme van Buuren lit up the final day of a drawn rain-affected match against Leicestershire.

When play began at 13:10 BST because of a wet outfield, Gloucestershire resumed on 69-0, 265 behind the Foxes and looking for batting bonus points.
The visitors ended on 403-2 at Grace Road, with Dent (165) sharing a stand of 177 with Van Buuren (121 not out).
Leicestershire are fourth in Division Two and Gloucestershire third.
Gloucestershire captain Gareth Roderick:  "I suppose you could say it's a winning draw, and it's good to finish a few points ahead of a team close to us in the table, but there just wasn't enough cricket left in the game.
"That said, it was a very pleasing effort with the bat today.
"Chris Dent is in a rich vein of form, and Graeme van Buuren is showing just what a good acquisition he is - and then to have Michael Klinger and Hamish Marshall to come, it shows what a good batting line-up we have now."
Leicestershire director of elite performance Andrew McDonald: "We probably weren't at our best with the ball today, which isn't like us, but they're a quality batting unit.
"It's very tight in the table, ten points or so covering the top four, and it will probably be tight until the end.
"There's an awful lot of cricket to play and a win here or there could make all the difference."
