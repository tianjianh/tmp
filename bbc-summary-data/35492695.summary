'Stingy' allowance led elderly woman to wear clothes of recently-deceased

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elderly woman's unpaid home fees and "stingy" allowance meant she had to wear clothes left behind by recently-deceased residents, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 95-year-old from the Manchester area, who cannot be named, was given less than £10 a month by her niece's husband, who controlled her finances.
As well as not paying fees, he "failed to explain" to the Court of Protection how he spent £30,000 of her money
As a result, Judge Denzil Lush revoked his power of attorney.
The court heard he had taken charge of her finances shortly after the woman, who has dementia, moved into the home.
The Office of the Public Guardian, which aims to act for people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions about healthcare and money, raised concerns about her finances after the fees went unpaid.
Her relative, a handyman in his 50s, defended how he managed her money and denied wrongdoing.
However, at the private hearing in London, Judge Lush took control of the woman's finances saying the man had not acted with "honesty".
He said the man had failed to treat the pensioner with "any semblance of dignity, empathy or respect" and his management of her property and financial affairs had been "a litany of failings".
"He failed to pay the nursing home fees and thereby put her placement in jeopardy," he said.
"The stingy sum he did deign to pay her - £290 over two-and-a-half years - amounted to less than £10 a month.
"Her clothes are old and worn and mostly hand-me-downs from former residents who have died or moved elsewhere."
