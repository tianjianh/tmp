Up to 200,000 people are expected to line the streets to congratulate about 350 athletes on their success in Rio.
The parade will begin outside the Museum of Science and Industry at 16:30 BST before moving through Manchester.
The event will be broadcast live on BBC One from 16:15 BST, with a highlights show at 20:30pm.
Team GB and Paralympic GB won a combined 214 medals in Rio this summer, coming second in both the Olympic and Paralympic medal tables.
The parade begins at the Museum of Science and Industry and will go down Liverpool Road before quickly turning on to Deansgate.
It will then continue through the city centre, before ending in Albert Square with an event at 17:30 BST.
For more information visit the Manchester City Council website.
About 350 of GB's Olympic and Paralympic athletes will be present, including the likes of recently retired heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill, boxer Nicola Adams, triathletes Alistair and Jonny Brownlee, gymnast Max Whitlock, swimmer Ellie Simmonds, the women's hockey team and many more.
One man who will not be attending is Britain's most successful ever Olympian Sir Bradley Wiggins, although he has not been present at any such event since 2004.
Mo Farah will also be absent, while Jason Kenny and Laura Trott are on honeymoon.
The forecast suggests there could be some rain during the parade - so pack a brolly.
Prime Minister Theresa May said: "It will be a celebration fit for heroes - and rightly so, because that is exactly what they are."
Tracey Crouch, the Sports Minister, urged the public to turn out for the two-day celebrations - the athletes will head to London for an event in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday.
She said: "Our Olympic and Paralympic heroes have made the nation proud. Now is the time for the public to come out on to the streets of Manchester and London to show their appreciation."
Manchester Council deputy leader Sue Murphy said the city "will be sure to show our athletes the meaning of celebration".
"Manchester has been a medal factory, pumping out golds as the home of British cycling and British Taekwondo," she added.
