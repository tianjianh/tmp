[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Attorney General has asked the Public Prosecution Service to review a decision not to prosecute any police officers following the shooting of an IRA man in County Down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colum Marks was shot dead on 10 April 1991 during an attempted mortar bomb attack on Downpatrick police station.
Officers were waiting when an IRA unit arrived to carry out the attack in St Patrick's Avenue.
It is claimed Colum Marks was not armed when RUC officers opened fire.
Gavin Booth, a legal representative for the Marks family, said: "We believe this is one of the shoot-to-kill operations by the state.
"There was no chance ever taken to arrest Colum which could have happened.
"They had the pre-planned intelligence, the knew the location, they knew Colum was going to be there."
The Attorney General, John Larkin, has now written to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory, asking for a review of a previous decision not to prosecute any police officers arising out of his death.
The PPS is now awaiting for the files to be sent to them.
