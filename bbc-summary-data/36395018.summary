It was the words "Feldenkrais" and "Gesellschaft" that made Jairam Hathwar and Nihar Janga co-champions of the US Scripps National Spelling Bee.

Nihar, 11, and Jairam, 13, went head-to-head for 25 rounds with the annual contest going late into the night in Maryland.
"I can't say anything. I'm just in fifth grade," said Nihar - the youngest champion since 2002 - after his win.
Each winner receives a trophy and $45,000 (Â£30,700) in cash and prizes.
This is the third tie in a row at the bee. The organisers had implemented the 25-round spell-off to try to avoid a deadlock.
Feldenkrais is a method of education
Gesellschaft is a type of social relationship
Biniou is a Breton bagpipe
Taoiseach is the Irish word for prime minister
Mischsprache is a fused language
Tetradrachm is a kind of coin
Despite the rivalry, the two boys gave each other encouraging hand slaps as they passed each other on the way to and from the microphone.
Jairam gave Nihar a chance to win when he missed "Drahthaar" a kind of dog. But Nihar then slipped up on "ayacahuite", a Mexican tree.
After several rounds the announcer said: "This is a beautiful moment. If you both spell the next word correctly, you will be declared co-champions."
They both got their words right and the audience erupted in cheers.
Jairam and Nihar are the ninth consecutive winners of South Asian descent. Jairam's brother, Sriram, was the 2014 co-champion.
The finalists are selected after two days of written and oral tests.
