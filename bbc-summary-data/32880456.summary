Ellesmere heron webcams installed on island

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten webcams have been installed on an island to allow birdwatchers to watch a colony of herons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A grant of Â£10,000 from the Big Lottery Fund paid for the cameras on Moscow Island in Ellesmere, Shropshire.
Images from the HD cameras, which are equipped with infra-red lights for night viewing, are being streamed live to the visitor centre.
A colony of around 25 pairs of herons nest on the artificial island.
Waste from the construction of a road in 1812 was used to create the island, which stands in a natural eight hectare (116 acres) lake.
Edward Bevan, from Ellesmere Heronwatch, said visitors were treating the life of the birds in the colony as a "soap opera".
