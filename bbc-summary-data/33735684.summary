Travelling people move from Inverness Caledonian Thistle stadium

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of travelling people have moved from the Inverness Caledonian Thistle car park after the football club went to court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The legal move had come ahead of the season-opening game against Motherwell on Saturday.
Sheriff Gordon Fleetwood granted a decree which allowed sheriff's officers to evict the travellers if they had not left by 17:00 on Friday.
The encampment comprised about a dozen caravans and a selection of trucks.
