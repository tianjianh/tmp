Dr Hinds, from Tandragee, was a consultant at Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh.
He regularly worked at the North West 200 motorbike races.
The poster has been put on display ahead of this weekend's Armoy road races.
Clerk of the course Bill Kennedy said the poster was created by the event's sponsors SGI International.
Dr Hinds led a campaign for an air ambulance service to be introduced in Northern Ireland.
Mr Kennedy said the poster paid tribute to Dr Hinds and also raised awareness of his family's plans to set up a charity to support his vision for the service.
"It is a tribute to Dr John as a person, he is a loss for everyone involved in motorcycling on the island of Ireland," he said.
"He was a great man in the field of medicine and was always trying to save people's lives.
"This has also been done to raise awareness of the need to get an air ambulance in Northern Ireland.
"As I understand, the family are about to set up a charity to get people involved in the concept of an air ambulance which would not just be for those involved in motorcycling.
"You could not have had a more professional man at his job, Dr John was also a true gentleman."
