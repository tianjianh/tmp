Thousands of fans spilled onto the pitch after Hibernian beat Rangers 3-2 to win the trophy.
The latest arrests for assaults and disorder at the match were made at addresses in Glasgow, Ayrshire, Edinburgh and Livingston.
Police said they "guarantee" there will be more arrests over the disturbances on the Hampden pitch.
Det Supt Kenny Graham, who is leading the investigation, said: "Today's operation sends a clear message to those involved in the violence and disorder that occurred on 21 May.
"You may think your behaviour has gone unnoticed, but I can assure you that our officers remain committed to identifying and arresting the perpetrators.
"I can guarantee you that there will be more arrests as part of this investigation, and if you were involved, we could very well be knocking on your door next time.
"Information from members of the public continues to be vital to this investigation and I would ask anyone who can assist with our inquiries to contact us."
Seven men, aged 19, 19, 22, 24, 28, 45 and 49, were held during the operation and are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Friday.
The total number arrested over the crowd disorder at the game now stands at 50.
