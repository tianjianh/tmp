Brexit 'may make it harder for UK acts to tour Europe'

Music and theatre groups may have to scale back European tours after Brexit and fewer European acts could travel to the UK, arts organisations have warned.

The Creative Industries Federation has set out a series of concerns about the UK's departure from the European Union.
It said British artists may have to spend more time and money on items like visas for tours if freedom of movement rules are tightened.
The federation also raised fears about areas like funding and copyright.
Federation founder Sir John Sorrell said the creative industries were "a key driver of wealth and global success" for the UK.
He said: "To imperil that would be to imperil our wider economy.
"That is why we need to be at the heart of the new government's industrial strategy and negotiating priorities in coming months."
The federation has published a report sketching out the possible impact of the UK's departure from the EU, based on contributions from almost 500 of its members.
It pointed to Cardiff-based NoFit State Circus, which said it cost Â£46,000 more for 13 people to tour the US compared with the EU, because of costs including visas, carnets for touring equipment and medical insurance.
And the Manchester International Festival cautioned that restrictions on movement could put European artists off coming to the UK.
"The increased cost of entering the UK to work may discourage many international acts from performing at the festival, reducing its quality and potentially, therefore, both its revenue streams and resultant spend within the local economy," the federation reported.
The federation also said:
Federation chief executive John Kampfner said: "This is the fastest growing sector of the UK economy and includes all the things that Britain is famous for - from our music to our films, television and heritage.
"We want to work with government to safeguard the jobs, the revenues and the prestige the creative sector offers."
In response, Department for Exiting the EU Minister Robin Walker said the creative industries are "a vital and growing part of the UK economy and they play a powerful role in shaping the UK's image and reputation abroad".
He added: "We want to work with our creative industries to help seize the exciting opportunities that will flow from a new place for Britain in the world."
