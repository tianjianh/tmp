The Wakefield Eastern Relief Road stretches for 4.6 miles (7.5km) between the A642 and A638 and crosses the River Calder.
The road could help to reduce congestion and pollution within the city, Wakefield Council said.
A development of 2,500 homes east of the city centre is planned to be built around the new road.
