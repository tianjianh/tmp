Laing, 23, spent three months at Meadow Lane on loan from Nottingham Forest in 2014 and has rejoined the League Two Magpies until 16 January.
Motherwell signed him from Forest last year after he impressed while on loan at the Scottish club.
"I'm really happy to be back here. The last time I was here I played what I felt was my best football," he told BBC Radio Nottingham.
He made 12 appearances during his previous stint at the club, during which time Notts kept six clean sheets.
