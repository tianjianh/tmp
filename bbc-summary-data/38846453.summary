Cornish Pirates coach Gavin Cattle says his side already has strong links with Exeter, amid talk that Premiership and second-tier clubs could 'buddy up'.

Reports have suggested the top-flight could abandon the A league, instead allowing Championship sides to loan up to 12 of their first-team players.
Pirates signed seven Exeter players on loan deals ahead of this season.
"There's a lot of talk going around, are we going to have a buddy up system with a Premiership club?" Cattle said.
"But I think one of our strengths is our relationship with Exeter - it's a two-way thing.
"I think we're doing a good job in terms of helping them with their development, and they're giving us a player that not only has good attributes rugby wise, but good men as well."
With London Welsh going out of existence and several clubs, including Pirates, experiencing financial difficulties, questions have been asked about the future of the Championship.
A potential 'buddy up' arrangement could see the Championship sides involved become ineligible for promotion.
"There are so many opinions on dual-registration or the buddy up system, but I think the overall matter is that Championship clubs do need, overall, more funding," added Cattle to BBC Radio Cornwall.
