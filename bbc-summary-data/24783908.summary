Assombalonga scored from point-blank range after being picked out by Mark Little's delightful low delivery.
Debutant Hogan Ephraim then stylishly slipped the ball through to Mendez-Laing to secure their passage.
Assombalonga dragged two other chances wide, while Arron Davies forced Posh keeper Bobby Olejnik into a late save.
Peterborough United boss Darren Ferguson told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:
"I thought we were patient the first half, maybe lacked a bit of quality but I thought for the whole of the second half we were very good.

"I think it typifies the problem at the moment where everyone expects us to win 6-0 when your first question says we didn't really get going until the 70th minute.
"They're a very good team, Exeter, fifth in League Two and a good footballing team. We just had to be patient and we had to produce a better quality in the second half to be fair and we've done that.
"I thought the second half we had a lot more life and energy and perhaps it was getting through to the players. There is frustration from people and I think you could see a release in them when we scored the first goal."
Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale spoke to BBC Radio Devon:
"They (Exeter players) didn't look inferior to the opposition whatsoever, we just needed to pack a punch around that last third when we had our moment and we didn't quite make that happen.

"We conceded a rather feeble goal and if we're going to be a good side that can't happen too often.
"So I leave today unhappy with the result, unhappy with the way it transpired, but happy with the players individually.
"It's been a character of our away performances this season that we've looked to be conservative and then build our game, and you can see that from the substitutions we made."
