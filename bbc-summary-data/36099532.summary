Newquay-born Bearman joined from Newport Gwent Dragons in 2011 but was out of contract at the end of the season.
The 37-year-old, who also played for Cornish Pirates, has scored four tries in 94 appearances for Ospreys.
"I feel I've still got plenty to offer this environment, so I'm really happy to have another year," Bearman said.
"At times this season the squad has been really young.
"But I've really enjoyed being in and around that, playing a part to help these boys develop, particularly when the internationals have been away."
Ashley Beck, Gareth Thomas, Ben John, Scott Otten, Tom Habberfield, Alun Wyn Jones and Rhys Webb have also signed new deals with Ospreys.
