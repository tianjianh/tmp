Britain's Amir Khan says Floyd Mayweather's manager told him "let's get that fight on" after the American beat Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas.

Mayweather, 38, took his unbeaten record to 48 fights with a one-sided points victory over Pacquiao.
Khan, 28, who takes on former light-welterweight world champion Chris Algieri on 29 May, says he has also been invited to fight Pacquiao, 36.
"I'm in a position where I could face either but I want Mayweather," he said.
Khan told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek that Mayweather's manager, Len Ellerbe, approached him after Saturday's fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.
He said: "Financially they know it will be a big fight and it will be an exciting fight.
"I think Mayweather's team want the fight - but I've spoken to Manny's team and they've said the same thing, that they want a fight."
Mayweather has said he intends to retire after one more fight, probably in September, because he no longer enjoys the sport.
But Khan, who is Muslim, will be fasting then.
"I really believe I have Mayweather's number and I'm ready for whatever he wants," he said.
"I can't do September because of Ramadan. It just depends on my schedule this year but if we can do this year or early next year I will definitely jump to it."
Khan, who has won 30 of his 33 fights, produced a dominant performance to secure a unanimous points victory over American Devon Alexander in Las Vegas in December.
And the Bolton-born welterweight believes he can succeed where Pacquiao failed against Mayweather, now the WBO, WBC and WBA champion.
"The mistake Manny made was to drop to Mayweather's pace," said Khan. "You need to stick to your own pace and that's what a younger man could do.
"Mayweather is a very classy fighter but he is not the biggest puncher. He won't hurt you.
"One boxer who can get to him, throw a lot of shots, and show a lot of heart, is Amir Khan."
