Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, from Croydon, died from multiple organ failure three days after taking the drug in Hayes in 2014.
The play by Southampton playwright Mark Wheeller previewed at Oasis Lord's Hill Academy in the city on Wednesday night.
Fiona Spargo-Mabbs said being involved in the production had been "incredible" but "extremely painful at times".
The play is called I Love You Mum, I Promise I Won't Die, the last words Daniel said to her before leaving home to go to a rave.
Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said: "Dan's death was so devastating for all who knew him that we committed ourselves to doing anything we could to prevent this happening to anyone else.
"We hope with all our hearts that this play will take Dan and his story to communities across the UK and beyond, and communicate a powerful message to young people about the risks, choices and consequences associated with drugs.
"We hope they'll learn through him the lesson he no longer can."
Mr Wheeller said he was "honoured" to have been trusted to tell the "tragic tale".
His previous plays are among the most performed for the Edexcel GCSE drama exam, and are set texts.
Following previews the production, performed by Southampton's Oasis Youth Theatre, will premiere at the Brit school in Croydon.
In 2014 Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, of Croydon, was jailed for five years for supplying drugs to Daniel and his friends.
The court heard Daniel, who paid Â£20 for MDMA, put about half a gram of the drug into 500ml of water. A witness claimed he possibly drank it in one go.
