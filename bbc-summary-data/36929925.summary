[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 2-0 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton's return to League One got off to a poor start as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neil Danns broke the deadlock with a 71st-minute penalty before substitute Kelvin Etuhu struck on 87 minutes to seal Bury's first opening-day win in eight years.
Charlton are second favourites for the title after being relegated from the Championship but the hosts were on top for most of the contest, with Jacob Mellis and Tom Soares going close early on.
The Addicks replied with Nicky Ajose, one of seven Charlton debutants, seeing a low strike parried by Ben Williams, one of five making their Bury bow.
Mellis and Tom Pope then tried their luck from long range before Charlton started the second half brightly, Ricky Holmes firing against the near post from a tight angle.
Bury regrouped and substitute Danny Mayor saw a header tipped over by Declan Rudd. From the resulting corner, Jason Pearce pulled back centre-half Nathan Cameron, with Danns drilling his spot-kick into the bottom corner.
Pope then flicked on Zeli Ismail's corner for Etuhu to bundle in Bury's second.
