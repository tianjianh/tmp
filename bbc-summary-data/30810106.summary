Nicki Minaj's new album The Pinkprint is currently sitting pretty at number two in the US Billboard album chart.

The Grammy-winning rapper has admitted it's her most personal album yet, littered with references to her break-up from boyfriend Safaree Samuels.
Now Samuels has broken his silence on their 11-year relationship, revealing he was the one who "walked away".
"It got to the point where I was being treated like an employee, instead of like her man," he said.
In an interview with Power 105.1's The Breakfast Club he told listeners Minaj was his "soul mate" despite the rapper saying she was single on Twitter last May.
The pair are understood to have got together when they were in a group called Hoodstars in the early noughties.
"We were friends at first and then it turned into a relationship," said Samuels.
"The group thing didn't work out and she had the drive to do things herself. I was just there to support her and do what I could."
But as Minaj's success rocketed, Samuels says the relationship started to change.
"Everyone around her works for her, you know?
"So it got to the point where it was like, 'I'm your man. I'm who you go to sleep with every night. I'm who you wake up with every morning.' And it got to the point where I was being treated like an employee, instead of like her man."
Then in late December the pair got involved in an argument on Twitter.
"I would never do anything publicly to try to pull her down," said Samuels.
"I could be out here telling a million stories, but I'm not gonna do that and I never plan on doing that.
"Don't say, 'Oh, I don't have no talent' because every time it came to writing raps and doing music, it was me, her and a beat.
"She doesn't do it by herself. It was me and her. Don't discredit me on what I've done for you, that's weak.
"I would never do that for her."
Since the split Minaj has been photographed with hip-hop artist Meek Mill.
"If that's who she decides to move on with, it is what it is," said Samuels.
"I'm not mad, I'm not bitter because if I wanted to make it work, I could've made it work.
"I walked away. I'm not going to say I broke up, but I'm the one who walked away."
