Down detector, a website that monitors internet failures, reported thousands of cases including parts of Scotland, London, Birmingham and Sheffield.
It began trending on social media with customers reporting issues.
BT confirmed that there had been problems but said most were fixed. It said there was no evidence of a hack attack.
"Large numbers of customers have been experiencing temporary issues with their broadband services this afternoon. Customers can still receive and make calls as normal," it said in a statement.
"We've been working hard to fix the issue and are glad to report that nearly every customer affected is now reconnected, approximately two hours after the problem started.
It did not give details of what may have caused the issue but said: "There is no evidence at this stage to suggest that we were subject to a malicious attack."
Its website had also crashed for a time and some users reported that its customer service line was down.
Hundreds of people took to social media to express their frustration using the hashtag #BTdown, which is currently trending on Twitter.
