[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby County 1-2 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby County's winless run extended to six Championship games as Blackburn Rovers came from behind to win their second league match of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All three goals came in a four-minute second-half spell, as Marvin Emnes and Danny Graham struck for Rovers moments after Matej Vydra had put Derby ahead.
Ben Marshall's penalty hit the post in a goalless first half, after Derby's Richard Keogh had brought down Emnes.
Vydra's low finish had given Derby a first home league goal of 2016-17.
Nigel Pearson's side took their total of league goals for the season up to three, but they have now lost five of their past six games in all competitions and slip into the bottom three.
Victory lifted Owen Coyle's Rovers above the Rams and they almost made the result more comfortable in the closing stages, but Emnes' shot was deflected wide.
His equaliser was deflected in from long range into the bottom corner, before he provided for substitute Graham to slot past Scott Carson at the near post.
Derby were denied a goal in between Rovers' quick-fire double, Jason Steele saving well from Vydra's header from Nick Blackman's cross.
Derby manager Nigel Pearson:
"That performance today doesn't really buy us any time for people to keep in a positive frame of mind with us.
"I say us because ultimately any team that's selected and goes on the field is my team. There was a level of anxiety in the stadium today which is something we've magnified ourselves through not performing in the way we should do.
"It's my team and I am responsible for it so I will shoulder the blame. I will be targeted I'm sure by people's unhappy feelings to why we are in the bottom three and not scoring goals and not winning at home.
"But the bottom line is we are where we are because of how we've performed so far."
REACTION: Derby County manager Nigel Pearson speaks to BBC Radio Derby
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle:
"We have to continue the momentum we are building. What we need to have is what we've seen today, a very tight-knit group that is prepared to run until they drop for each other, which they did.
"Within that I'm trying to bring some football quality and I thought we did that today. We want to get a platform to kick on from and days like today certainly help you achieve that."
