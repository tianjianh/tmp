Jaywick travellers: Security firm hired to stop vehicles using car park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council has hired a private security firm to stop more travellers taking caravans onto a public car park.

The local authority has paid the company about £1,400 to patrol the area at Jaywick in Essex.
Tendring District Council said about four caravans had parked at Beach Car Park on Tuesday.
Councillor Paul Honeywood said: "It's an extra cost but the idea is to make it significantly less desirable for the group to remain there."
The council said it was believed to be the same group of travellers which parked a month ago on land where Jaywick's market and car boot sale is held.
It said it had spent £20,000 this year on court actions and cleaning-up at illegal encampments.
Mr Honeywood, who is the cabinet member for housing, said: "[Security] was there to allow the caravans to leave the car park - and prevent them from returning or any new ones being allowed on."
The security firm would be at the car park for 24 hours and then make periodic checks.
A 'direction to leave' has been issued to the travellers and, if they remained, a summons to appear in court was likely to be issued on Friday, a Tendring spokesman said.
Council staff issued three £50 penalty notices at Beach Car Park to vehicles which were not displaying parking tickets.
