An escapee iguana that spent three months living up a tree has been plucked from his lofty perch by a cherry-picker.

Frank the Tank, as the reptile has been named, had become the talk of Pakefield, near Lowestoft, Suffolk.
The 5ft-long (1.5m) iguana was finally retrieved by a company called Froggy Hire, but was in a sulk and "sat and glared" at those who tried to feed him.
He has now been rehomed at a nearby petting zoo.

"He's not been the happiest of boys - he's had three months of freedom, and now he's back in a vivarium," said owner of Zoo-Tastic, Alison Gregory.
"It's the biggest one we've got and he's got freedom within the room."
Jason Cook, who owns cherry-picking firm Froggy Hire, used heavy duty gloves and a duvet to capture fugitive Frank after being persuaded into rescuing him by his 15-year-old daughter Kaitlin.
"I've done plenty of odds and sods in my time, but I've never rescued an iguana before," he said.
"I couldn't just leave him there. Even if I didn't want to rescue him, my daughter would have made me do it anyway."
Local resident Angela Hills stored Frank in her shed while people phoned around to find a new home for him.
"I had no idea reptiles could sulk but he just wouldn't eat, I gave him a leaf to eat and he just sat and glared at me," she said.
"We will actually really miss him, people still look up at the tree, and it's a really nice community thing... but he wouldn't have survived outside when it gets colder," she said.
