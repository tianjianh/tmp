The 23-year-old, who bats in the top-order, will be the club's overseas player until Klinger returns to the club at the end of May.
He won his first Australia cap in a Twenty20 loss to India in January.
"His hunger to come over and have a crack at county cricket really impressed me," head coach Richard Dawson told the club website.
"He wants to come and learn and improve his game and that was massive for me."
Gloucestershire start their County Championship Division Two season at Essex on 10 April, with Bancroft's stay lasting until their fifth game of the campaign, at home to Glamorgan from 15 May.
