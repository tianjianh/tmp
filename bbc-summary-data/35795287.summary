More than 7,000 visitors attended events such as battle re-enactments.
Tourists from 18 different countries exploring their heritage brought in a net total of £390,000 last year.
Clan chief Alexander Leslie, vice-convener of the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs, said there had been a renewed level of interest over the last 18 months.
About 50 million people globally claim to have Scottish ancestry.
Mr Leslie, vice-convener of the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs, said many "overseas Scots" were visiting each year.
He said: "The clan network and clan societies bring a lot of overseas Scots to Scotland every year and within the last year or 18 months there's also been a renewed level of interest in Scotland itself in which clan people belong to, which is very encouraging to see.
"We work hard with the Scottish Government on this issue and see it a win-win situation that Scotland as a whole, Scotland as a brand and Scotland as a destination will benefit."
The Scottish Clan Event Fund, administered by EventScotland, gives clans and clan societies up to £5,000 for gatherings, battle re-enactments and other associated heritage events.
The Scottish Government allocated £23,000 to the fund in 2015/16 and has announced up to £70,000 will be available in 2016/17.
There will be six supported events taking place across Scotland in 2016.
Tourism minister Fergus Ewing said: "The market for ancestral tourism in Scotland is considerable and creates opportunities for communities to benefit.
"I am pleased to see the fund has already had such a strong positive impact, capturing visitors' imagination and helping to inspire and promote fun, colourful and inspiring events across the country."
