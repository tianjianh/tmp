The Old Library opened on the Hayes in February this year with a Â£400,000 grant from the Welsh Government.
Last month, the board wrote to Cardiff council asking for help with, or a reduction in, its Â£100,000 rent.
"We're only a small charitable organisation and it's very difficult for us to find those sums of money," said the board chairman, Huw Onllwyn.
Mr Onllwyn told BBC Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf programme the Old Library had been a "very successful project" with well-supported gigs, screenings and workshops.
"The only problem that we face is the financial situation where we find that it doesn't really make sense for us to pay the rent for this building.
"That's why we wrote to the council drawing their attention to this difficulty."
Asked if he thought the project was too ambitious, Mr Onllwyn said: "The demand for the Old Library is there, the support for the Old Library is there and people do enjoy coming to the events that we put on."
"We have the experience now of running the place for 10 months, we know what sort of income we can generate and I'm sure we can find a way through this," he added.
Cardiff council confirmed it has been contacted and a spokesman said it was working with the organisation to "look at possible solutions".
