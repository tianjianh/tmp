Protesters have placed surgical masks over famous London statues, including Eros in Piccadilly Circus and the Oliver Cromwell statue at Parliament.
The group says it plans to target 17 statues in the capital on Monday.
Four people have been arrested in connection with the protests.
Emergency services are at the scene in Trafalgar Square and have cordoned off the area around the bottom of the monument.
London's Metropolitan Police said four people were arrested in connection with the protest at the Oliver Cromwell statue at Parliament Square at about 06:20 GMT.
Other statues targeted by the group include the Sherlock Holmes statue, which stands near the site of the fictional detective's home at 221b Baker Street, the Winston Churchill statue outside the Houses of Parliament and the statue of footballer Thierry Henry at the Emirates Stadium.
Greenpeace said the protest was to highlight the "public health crisis" of air pollution, which it said was "cutting short 40,000 lives every year".
The group wants the government to focus on greener public transport, push electric vehicles and create clean air zones around schools and hospitals.
