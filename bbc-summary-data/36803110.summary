"The truth is that Taylor Swift and I are together, and we're very happy," the actor told the Hollywood Reporter.
"That's the truth," he continued. "It's not a publicity stunt."
Hiddleston has been speaking about his first Emmy nomination for The Night Manager, saying it was "fantastic" to to be up for outstanding lead actor.
Hiddleston played concierge-turned-spy Jonathan Pine in the BBC's adaptation of John le Carre's novel.
He was nominated on Thursday for the prize for lead actor in a miniseries or movie, alongside fellow Brits Benedict Cumberbatch and Idris Elba, and US stars Bryan Cranston, Cuba Gooding Jr and Courtney B Vance.
But it is speculation about his relationship with Swift that has been rife in the press since they were snapped embracing near Swift's home in Rhode Island last month. The images went viral online.
Hiddleston, 35, who is in Australia shooting reprising his Loki role in the latest Thor film, had previously refused to discuss the relationship with the press. There had been reports that they could have been filming a music video together.
"I'd rather just talk about my work if that's all right," he told one reporter in Queensland earlier this week.
But when asked by the Hollywood Reporter how he would "respond to people who claim that you're involved in some sort of publicity stunt", the British actor rejected the "notion".
The magazine reported that he laughed at the question and thanked them for asking it.
Swift was previously in a relationship with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, who 'unfollowed' her on Twitter after images of the singer kissing Hiddleston appeared online.
