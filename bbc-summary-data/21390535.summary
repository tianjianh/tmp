HMV's chief executive has been made redundant by administrators in charge of restructuring the failing music and DVD retailer.

Trevor Moore, previously boss of camera firm Jessops - another recent High Street casualty - was among 60 people made redundant from HMV's head offices.
HMV entered administration in January and the closure of 66 stores across the UK was announced on Thursday.
That move puts the jobs of nearly 1,000 staff at risk.
Administrators Deloitte said the latest cuts across the head office network at Eastcastle Street in London, Marlow and Solihull had been "a difficult decision, but a necessary one in restructuring the business".
Deloitte still hopes to sell the business on but it is likely to become a much smaller operation.
HMV currently has 220 stores in the UK, employing about 4,000 staff.
When administrators were called in last month Mr Moore said he was convinced that the music chain could be saved, and that he hoped to remain involved in the business in the future.
He took over as HMV chief executive in August last year, moving from camera retailer Jessops, which also went into administration in January and has ceased trading.
