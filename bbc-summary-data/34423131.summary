Landmark Cadbury's sign lowered from Somerdale factory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A six-metre-high sign considered as a local landmark has been removed from the former Cadbury works near Bristol.

The building closed in January 2011 and the site is being redeveloped for retirement homes.
The sign will go into storage while it is decided what to do with it but the apostrophe is to be presented to site archivist Hugh Evans.
Mr Evans, who started work in 1975, has documented the history of the Somerdale site in Keynsham.
He lists his favourite chocolate bars as Crunchie and Turkish Delight and said a lot of his generation had given 35 to 40 years' service to the company.
"It was a stunning setting to work in and we had lots of fun and lots of laughs," he said.
"We used to joke you could be born on site, go to school on site and work on site - soon you will be able to live on site as part of a retirement community."
The Â£50m scheme by the St Monica Trust will see 151 assisted living apartments and a 90-bed care home when it opens in spring 2017, as part of the wider development of the site.
The factory closed after Cadbury was taken over by US food giant Kraft.
