[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Voters are going to the polls in two Westminster by-elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
New MPs for Witney, in Oxfordshire, and Batley and Spen, in West Yorkshire, will be chosen on Thursday.
Former Prime Minister David Cameron, who stood down as an MP after quitting Downing Street, is being replaced in Witney.
The by-election in Batley and Spen was prompted by the death of Labour MP Jo Cox, who was shot and stabbed in Birstall in June.
Mrs Cox won the seat with a majority of 6,057 in 2015, while in Witney, the Conservatives are defending a majority of 25,155.
Polls in both constituencies opened at 07:00 BST and will close at 22:00 BST.
The BBC weather forecast for both constituencies is largely the same, with no rain predicted and a top temperature of 13C.
