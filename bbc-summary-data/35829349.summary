Derek Serpell-Morris disappeared in July prompting high-profile campaigns by his family to find him.
Police confirmed on Wednesday remains found near Cribbs Causeway were that of the missing pensioner.
Artist Stewy said he chose to paint portraits of the the DJ around the city as he "symbolised multiculturalism and something positive about Bristol".
His final print of DJ Derek artwork will now be given to the family.
Stewy's first portrait of Derek Serpell-Morris was on the Star and Garter pub in July 2013, just before the DJ announced his retirement.
It has since been removed but there is another in Leonard Lane, painted in May.
The third, stencilled on a white gate in Richmond Avenue was made in February, when the DJ was still missing. Another tribute can be seen inside the St Werburgh's Farm pub.
Stewy said: "He symbolised something positive in Bristol, in embracing black music which people in his generation might have dismissed."
Stewy said there are no plans to create any more portraits of the popular DJ, as he did not want to profit from his death.
Instead, he is supporting local fundraising efforts to create a memorial mural of Mr Serpell-Morris which will be painted by the artist Inky.
DJ Derek, a former accountant, was known to thousands of music fans and played hundreds of sets at local clubs and pubs, as well as at the Glastonbury festival.
He was a resident of St Pauls in Bristol since 1978 and also appeared at gigs across the UK including the Big Chill, worked with Massive Attack and appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video.
