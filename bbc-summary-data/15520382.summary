Isle of Man public told of deadly tree disease

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A forestry presentation is to be held to inform the public about a deadly disease threatening trees and shrubs on the Isle of Man.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evidence of Phytophthora ramorum was discovered in September during routine aerial surveys of Manx plantations.
Felling has already started and about 25% of the island's larch tree population has so far been affected.
A government spokesman said the presentation would be held on 10 November at the Glen Helen Hotel.
Phytophthora ramorum, a fungus-like pathogen, causes the ramorum disease which is particularly serious in Japanese larch trees and rhododendrons.
Signs of the disease are wilting blackening foliage, discoloured tops and resin bleeding.
Phytophthora ramorum has also caused extensive damage to trees and other plants in parts of the UK, Europe and the USA.
More information about the presentation is available from the environment department.
