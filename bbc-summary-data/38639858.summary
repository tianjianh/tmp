[SN]TITLE[SN]
MSPs to quiz Lord Advocate over Crown Office 'concerns'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs are to question Scotland's Lord Advocate over "serious concerns" about the country's prosecution system.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Holyrood's justice committee has been holding an inquiry into the role of the Crown Office.
Members will put issues raised by previous witnesses about resources and victim support to the Lord Advocate, James Wolffe QC, on Tuesday morning.
Convener Margaret Mitchell said she hoped Mr Wolffe had listened to the "legitimate concerns" raised so far.
The committee has taken evidence from Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) employees and unions, victims' groups, lawyers and the police so far, across a five-month inquiry.
Conservative MSP Ms Mitchell said: "The justice committee's inquiry has unearthed some serious concerns about the COPFS.
"From the amount of time wasted through trials not proceeding on schedule, to the workload of prosecutors and the support offered to the victims and witnesses who appear at court.
"The justice committee will publish its conclusions in due course, but we hope that the Lord Advocate will have listened to the legitimate concerns raised so far. We are looking for him to address some of the evidence we have heard.
"The professionalism of those working in the COPFS front line is not in question, but we want to ensure that the system around them works just as well as they do and that there is an acceptance by leadership that there are challenges to confront."
Mr Wolffe previously appeared at Holyrood to give evidence about the draft budget, at which point he argued the Crown Office had adequate resources to fulfil its role.
Crown Agent David Harvie, the professional head of the service who is also appearing before the committee, submitted written evidence voicing appreciation for the "keen interest" members had taken.
He said: "The committee's inquiry, and the evidence which it has heard, have provided us with an opportunity to reflect on our current plans, to build on the good work which has been done before, and to take on board the comments and views of those with whom we work and those we serve."
