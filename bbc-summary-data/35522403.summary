The location of the new Cardiff Metropolitan University campus has yet to be decided, but could include a new TV centre and attract 2,000 students.
It is the first venture of its kind with a private firm - Phoenix Education - and a Welsh university.
A memorandum of understanding is due to be signed in Cardiff on Monday.
It is understood the plan has been endorsed by Cardiff council. Its cost and timescale is not yet known.
