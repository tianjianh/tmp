Jean Alexander: Calls for statue to honour Coronation Street legend

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A statue should be built of the actress who played legendary Coronation Street character Hilda Ogden, another former star of the ITV soap has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liverpool-born Jean Alexander, who played the sharp-tongued Ogden from 1964 to 1987, died last week aged 90.
Andrew Lancel, who trod the Street's cobbles between 2010 to 2012, called for a statue to be erected of Ms Alexander in Southport, her home town.
Mr Lancel described her as "the most iconic soap character of all time".
He said the statue would be a fitting tribute and the "perfect way" to remember the "charming" actress.
"I'm very proud that I spent some time with Jean over the years in Southport - she was always charming and unassuming and lovely.
"There's been an incredible outpouring of love and affection. Let's celebrate a local lass who did wonderful things."
After leaving Coronation Street, Ms Alexander went on to star as shopkeeper Auntie Wainwright in BBC comedy Last of the Summer Wine for 22 years.
