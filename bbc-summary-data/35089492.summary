A judge in Mexico City has sentenced two men to 520 years in prison for the kidnap and murder of 13 young people at a bar in the city two years ago.

The victims' bodies were found in a grave outside the city after family members organised large street protests.
Prosecutors said the crime was a reprisal for the murder of a drug trafficker a few days before.
Three other men received similar sentences earlier this year.
The young men and women ranging between 16 and 34 years of age were reported missing in the days after the group went to a bar called Heaven in May 2013.
Surveillance footage showed some of them being led to cars outside the after-hours bar.
Their bodies were discovered in a grave covered with lime, cement and asbestos on the outskirts of Mexico City.
All of them came from the poor Tepito neighbourhood of Mexico City.
The case shocked people in Mexico City, which at the time had appeared to be less exposed to the overt drug violence affecting other areas of the country.
