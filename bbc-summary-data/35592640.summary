Chelsea v PSG Champions League tie 50-50 - Guus Hiddink

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink believes his side have a "50-50" chance of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals after Paris St-Germain beat them 2-1 in the first leg of their last-16 tie.

John Mikel Obi cancelled out Zlatan Ibrahimovic's opener for PSG, but Edinson Cavani gave the hosts victory.
The second leg will take place at Stamford Bridge on 9 March.
"Scoring away is always good," said Hiddink. "I'm never happy with a loss but it's not a dramatic loss."
This is the third season in succession Chelsea have met the French champions in the Champions League. PSG won at this stage last season after the Londoners triumphed in the quarter-finals in 2014.
Uruguay striker Cavani, who joined PSG for Â£55m in 2013, came off the substitutes' bench to give his side a slender lead in the tie.
Chelsea, in contrast, had 20-year-olds Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Bertrand Traore, Kenedy and Matt Miazga among their substitutes.
"I envy a bit the bench of PSG," said Hiddink. "They have a very strong bench.
"If you see what this team can bring on in the second half - world-class players as substitutes. This is a very strong PSG."
Prior to Tuesday, interim boss Hiddink had led Chelsea on a 12-match unbeaten run since taking over from Jose Mourinho in mid-December.
He was forced to reshuffle his back four in Paris after captain John Terry was ruled out with a hamstring injury.
Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic formed a makeshift central defence, while Ghana defender Baba Rahman made a rare start at full-back.
"The players did well, not just the four in defence. We also had a disciplined midfield," said Hiddink.
PSG boss Laurent Blanc was disappointed to concede but said his side would strive to score at least once in London in three weeks' time.
"When you play at home you need to be stronger in defence because, if you concede a goal, it effectively counts double," he said. "Chelsea scored, so we go to Stamford Bridge eager to score ourselves.
"We'll have chances, most likely, so it'll be about defending well but we are an attacking team.
"I don't think Chelsea will change their approach for the second leg. Neither will we. So the return game will probably be open and, hopefully, with some goals."
