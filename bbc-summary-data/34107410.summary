The 38-year-old mother died on Sunday shortly after police found her at a house on Culcheth Lane following reports of an assault.
A post-mortem examination revealed she suffered head and neck injuries.
A 48-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, Greater Manchester Police said.
In a statement, her family said: "Natalia was a talented, beautiful, much loved mother, daughter, sister and friend. She will be greatly missed."
According to her website, Ms Strelchenko, who was of Russian origin, made her debut aged 12 with the St Petersburg Symphony Orchestra.
Also known as Natalia Strelle, she had performed across Europe, Japan and at New York's prestigious Carnegie Hall.
She was educated at St Petersburg State Conservatory and the Norwegian Academy of Music.
Det Supt Phil Reade, from GMP, said: "This is a tragic incident in which a talented young lady has lost her life.
"Natalia's family, many of whom live outside the UK, are understandably beside themselves at their loss and we are doing everything we can at this time to support them."
He appealed for anyone with information to contact police.
