There will be a temporary exhibition of the haul, in the Great Hall next summer, Tamworth Borough Council said.
Key pieces of the hoard, the UK's largest find of Anglo-Saxon treasure, will also be shown in Lichfield and Stafford.
A Mercian Trail is also being developed to allow the treasure to be permanently displayed at several places.
These would include Tamworth, Birmingham, Stoke-on-Trent and Lichfield.
Councillor Steve Claymore, from Tamworth Borough Council, said: "The news that the Staffordshire Hoard is coming to Tamworth is fantastic news.
"Residents and visitors will be able to see the hoard in its rightful place - the ancient capital of Mercia.
"The touring exhibition could lead to tens of thousands of people discovering the fascinating history of Tamworth and its surrounding area."
The 3,500-piece haul was found in a Staffordshire field in July 2009.
It is now jointly owned by the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Potteries Museum after Â£3.3m was raised to keep it in the area.
Cleaned and restored items of the hoard, including a pectoral cross which is one of the signature pieces of the collection, are currently on show at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Hanley.
