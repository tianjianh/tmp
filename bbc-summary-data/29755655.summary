The 25-year-old joined the Clarets from Oldham in the summer of 2013, but has made just two appearances since then.
He has played 87 professional matches in total, having also had spells with Leicester, Oxford and Accrington.
Cisak becomes the first York signing since manager Russ Wilcox was appointed as Nigel Worthington's successor at Bootham Crescent two weeks ago.
