The 35-year-old roared from fourth on the last lap of the 500-mile race to beat Martin Truex Jr, with Toyota Racing team-mate Kyle Busch third.
It was the closest finish since the all-American stock car series NASCAR brought in electronic scoring in 1993.
"You couldn't have written a better ending," Hamlin said.
Hamlin, who won his first Daytona 500 at his 11th attempt, added: "I knew it was close, but I didn't know we had won."
Truex said: "I thought I could keep that foot or so. I lost it in the last second."
