Patients across the UK will be able to have hand transplants on the NHS, health officials have said.

Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust will begin assessing suitable adult candidates and performing the "highly complex procedure" from April.
Hand transplants offer patients the only method of reconstruction that looks and functions like a normal hand.
If transplanted successfully, a new hand will be able to sense its surroundings and heal itself when hurt.
The patient will also be able to move it with dexterity and it will feel warm to the touch.
The centre in Leeds is headed up by consultant plastic surgeon Prof Simon Kay, who successfully performed the UK's first hand transplant in 2012.
"We are delighted to be confirmed as the provider of this new service," he said.
"The team here at Leeds is keen to now assess new patient referrals and benefit patients and their families in a way they may never have thought possible before."
Former pub landlord Mark Cahill from West Yorkshire was the first person in the UK to have the operation.
Mr Cahill had been unable to use his right hand after it was affected by gout. His operation was carried out on the NHS but under different commissioning rules, which were subsequently changed months after his operation.
Since the transplant, he has started regaining almost complete use of his hand - allowing him to carry out tasks such as tying his shoelaces, carrying his granddaughter and driving a car.
He said: "My experience as a patient and my quality of life since the hand transplant has been fantastic. It really has transformed my life."
He also said he wanted to publicly thank his donor.
Dr Jonathan Fielden, NHS England's director of specialised commissioning, described hand transplants as "cutting edge procedure", which had been shown to "significantly improve the quality of life for patients who meet the strict criteria".
He said: "We will be working closely with Prof Kay and his colleagues at Leeds, as well as NHS Blood and Transplant, to ensure that this highly innovative service for the NHS can get up and running as soon as possible."
About 80 hand transplants have been performed worldwide.
Experts say success rates are high provided patients are selected carefully and fully-prepared psychologically.
After the operation, patients need to take lifelong medication to stop limbs being rejected by the body and follow daily physiotherapy routines.
Meanwhile, Corrine Hutton is to become the first person in the UK to have a double hand transplant.
She has been waiting for a suitable match for the past year-and-a-half.
Ms Hutton had her hands and feet amputated last summer after a pneumonia infection led to blood poisoning.
