First Geographer Royal for Scotland in 118 years appointed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Royal Scottish Geographical Society has appointed the first Geographer Royal for Scotland in 118 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prof Charles Withers, Ogilvie chair of Geography at the University of Edinburgh, was conferred the post at a ceremony in Perth.
He will work as a national and international ambassador, promoting the field in research and education.
Prof Withers said he was honoured for himself and the university, but said the real honour "is for geography".
A Fellow of the British Academy and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Mr Withers was awarded the title by the Princess Royal at a ceremony at the Society's headquarters in Perth.
Reviving the historical role in a modernised form, the group's chief executive Mike Robinson said "the need for an informed geographical representation has never been greater".
He said: "Most modern problems are complex and global - they need greater geographical understanding.
"2015 is the perfect year for the reintroduction of the Geographer Royal for Scotland, with various geographical issues from local and international geopolitical change to sustainable development goals to climate negotiations in Paris, to migration issues, transport, digital mapping, health and land reform."
The first Geographer Royal for Scotland, Sir Robert Sibbald, was appointed 333 years ago in September 1682 to give geographic and mapping advice during the reign of Charles II.
Prior to Mr Withers, There have been four incumbents of the role, the last bestowed by Queen Victoria in 1897.
Having been approved by the Scottish government and the Queen, he will hold the title for six years, before the position is reviewed.
Mr Withers said: "I am honoured for myself, of course and for my university. But, and principally, this honour is for geography.
"Now, after a period in which the title of Geographer Royal for Scotland has lain in abeyance, the subject again has this further recognition of its standing."
