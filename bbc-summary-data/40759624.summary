The summer signing from Rotherham made his mark as a second half substitute with two goals in five minutes.
Earlier Junior Hoilett had impressed on his return from Gold Cup duty with Canada by capping a lively 45 minute run-out with a goal after 11 minutes.
Gabon defender Bruno Ecoule Manga completed the victory on 74 minutes.
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock told BBC Wales Sport: "We have a disappointment that Kadeem Harris got a little injury to his ankle, but apart from that, it was just what we wanted.
"The game was just what we needed, a good work out and there were a lot of plusses for me."
