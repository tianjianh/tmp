Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett fears Rhoys Wiggins may face a lengthy spell out after suffering a knee injury in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Aston Villa.

The left-back, 28, was making his first start for Blues since his loan move from Bournemouth and was carried off on a stretcher after colliding with Villa substitute Rudy Gestede late on.
Rowett told BBC Sport: "It does not look good. He felt something snap.
"I just hope it was his lace and not his cruciate ligament."
The Blues boss added: "It doesn't look like we'll be seeing him in a blue shirt any time in the near future."
David Davis scored a second-half equaliser that earned Blues a point which put them seventh in Championship, six points clear of 15th-placed Villa.
