Glenn Murray: Brighton can bounce straight back from Newcastle defeat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton striker Glenn Murray believes the Seagulls can immediately bounce back from their disappointing defeat by Newcastle United.

The 33-year-old scored from the penalty spot in their 2-1 loss at the Amex.
"It was just one of those nights, but it is only three points, there's 12, 13, games left to go and we will be fighting for every point," Murray said.
"We will regroup, we will look towards Nottingham [Forest] at the weekend, and hopefully get three points."
Newcastle are now two points clear of the Seagulls at the top of the Championship table.
Murray, in his second spell with Brighton, gave the home side the lead in their top of the table clash after a controversial penalty award.
The spot-kick was given after United's Ciaran Clark was adjudged to have pulled down the striker, although the two players appeared to be grappling with one another.
"It was a penalty," Murray said of the clash, which ultimately led to his 17th goal of the season.
"It was a coming together in the box. There are lots of comings together in the box, sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't. I think it was a little bit clumsy more than anything."

A fortuitous goal by Mo Diame hauled Newcastle level nine minutes from time, with substitute Ayoze Perez scoring a minute from time to secure an away victory.
"Unfortunately a freakish goal got them back into it, and once they have got the momentum it is quite difficult to stop," Murray continued,
"I think we held our own, we tried to protect what we had, but unfortunately we couldn't do that."
The defeat was only Brighton's second at home this season, but they are still six points ahead of third-placed Huddersfield Town.
And manager Chris Hughton pointed to Diame's equaliser as the turning point.
"I wondered at the time how it had gone in," he said. "But that gives Newcastle momentum going into that last period.
"I didn't think we were at our best, but I still thought we would go on to win."
