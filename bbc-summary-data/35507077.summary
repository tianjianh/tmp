[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three club doormen have been cleared of killing a man when they restrained him outside the nightclub.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Hird, 30, from Epping, died from asphyxia at the entrance of the No.65 bar in Vauxhall in south London on 15 June 2014.
Mark Pantallaresco, 51, Sebastiano Ragusa, 31, and Lewis Thorne, 22, were all cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence at the Old Bailey.
The three doormen had all denied the charges against them.
Mr Pantallaresco, from Tadworth, Surrey, Mr Ragusa, from Lewisham, south London, and Mr Thorne, from Wickford, Essex, were accused of pinning Mr Hird down for "an extremely dangerous" amount of time.
Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC told jurors the men had only released Mr Hird after he realised he was unconscious.
Mr Hird had battled with depression for many years and had been at a social event for fellow patients at the nearby Riverside restaurant.
The 30-year-old was taken to hospital after he passed out but he later died.
