[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 1-3 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shaquile Coulthirst scored on his Mansfield Town debut to help end Cambridge United eight-match unbeaten run in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The U's got off to the perfect start, ending their opponents' streak of four consecutive clean sheets with the opener inside eight minutes through George Maris, who nodded past Jake Kean from close range following Piero Mingoia's fine cross from the right.
Cambridge could have already been behind at that point, with Coulthirst scuffing an effort straight to goalkeeper Will Norris in the fifth minute.
The visitors were level two minutes before half-time in fortuitous circumstances when defender Leon Legge diverted Rhys Bennett's nod down past his own goalkeeper Norris.
Steve Evans' side were ahead moments before the hour-mark when defender Krystian Pearce was allowed a free header from Joel Byrom's corner.
The result was put beyond doubt 17 minutes from the end when Norris saved Hayden White's low effort, only for on-loan Peterborough striker Coulthirst to mark his debut with a goal by turning home the rebound.
