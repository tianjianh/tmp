To commemorate this special day two  limited new coins have been made.
A sterling silver Â£5 coin, featuring a version of the Royal Arms, and a limited number of gold Â£500 coins, known as the sovereign, have been produced.
Jenny went to the Royal Mint to get an exciting behind the scenes look as the gold coins were being made.
