O'Brien, 21, was airlifted to hospital after being injured when her mount Druid's Cross slipped and fell fatally during a race at Killarney.
The jockey, a daughter of star trainer Aidan O'Brien, also fractured cheek bones in the fall.
Druid's Cross was trained by the jockey's brother Joseph.
The injured jockey has a fractured C1 vertebra in her neck and T6 in her back, as well as fractured cheek bones bilaterally, but Dr Adrian McGoldrick, chief medical officer for the Irish Turf Club, was able to issue more positive news on Wednesday.
"She has had her MRI scans and Professor Paul Redmond, the head of department at Cork University Hospital, has looked at them and confirmed that she does not need surgery," said McGoldrick.
"They will continue to review her facial injuries."
McGoldrick added he expected O'Brien to be out for three to four months.
O'Brien secured her first race win in 2013 at 16 and rode for her father in this year's English Derby and Irish Derby.
