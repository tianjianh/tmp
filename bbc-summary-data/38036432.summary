[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solihull Moors 2-0 North Ferriby United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Akwasi Asante bagged a brace as Solihull ended a run of three straight defeats in the National League with victory over lowly North Ferriby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Asante spurned the first real chance of the match when he prodded meekly at visiting goalkeeper Rory Watson while Kyle Wootton fired wide when well placed at the other end.
Dutch striker Asante also missed the target but then made amends shortly afterwards, following up to net the rebound after Jamey Osborne's low drive had been parried into his path.
Solihull were grateful for Daniel Lewis' fine low save to keep out Wootton's drive shortly after half-time while the ever-dangerous Asante's effort came back off the bar.
The hosts survived a few nervy moments before Asante made the result safe, slamming into the roof of the net from the edge of the area before Curtis Bateson was dismissed late on to compound the woes of North Ferriby, who slipped to the foot of the table following the loss.
