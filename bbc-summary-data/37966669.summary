About 30 elderly and vulnerable people had to leave their sheltered accommodation during the blaze in Lonsdale Court, in Pategill, Penrith.
The man, who lived in the flat, had not been seen since the blaze broke out at about 09:40 GMT on Saturday.
The missing man's family has been informed.
Those led to safety were found places at care homes overnight, police said.
Earlier Kevin Johnston, spokesman for Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service, said the flat was on the verge of collapse, but it was made stable enough for a search team to go in and find the body.
Insp Andy Hanson, of Cumbria Police, said: "This has been a distressing incident for all involved, and sadly we are now able to confirm that one person died in the fire.
"We are now working hard to secure the building to allow the other residents to return to their flats - this is expected to take a considerable amount of time."
Many of the residents were taken to Penrith Leisure Centre and an appeal for warm clothes and toiletries was made.
Cumbria Police said they were inundated with donations and now had enough.
Insp Hanson said: "I would like to reiterate our thanks local community.
"We have been so impressed and grateful for the way everyone has come together and donated supplies and help for the residents affected by the fire.
"It is a testament to the community spirit and kindness of people living in Penrith."
