[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World champions Germany lost for the first time in 19 competitive matches as Poland beat them to move top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group.

Arkadiusz Milik's 51st-minute header was added to late on by Sebastian Mila's sweeping finish.
Poland had never before beaten Germany, who had also not lost in 33 previous qualifiers, a run dating back to 2007.
The Poles move above Republic of Ireland on goal difference and next host Scotland on Tuesday.
The leaders have six points, Germany and Scotland have three, with Georgia and Gibraltar each losing both of their opening two qualifiers.
Germany's last qualifying defeat was a 3-0 home defeat by the Czech Republic in October 2007.
But when Lukasz Piszczek angled in a cross that had Manuel Neuer in two minds, Milik rose to divert the ball over the keeper.
The Germans could easily have been five goals to the good before that, with debutant Karim Bellarabi missing a hat-trick of chances, and Thomas Muller and Mats Hummels also wasteful.
Joachim Low's men did everything but score in their quest for an equaliser, Lukas Podolski cracking a volley against the bar in their best effort.
But the hosts resisted and, when Robert Lewandowski powered into the area and squared the ball, Milik's clinical finish sealed a famous Polish victory.
"I can't fault the team, but perhaps we should have made more of our chances," said Low. "After a loss you always need to show a good reaction."
Elsewhere, Albania, who defeated Portugal in the first round of Group I matches, were denied another victory when Denmark came back to earn a 1-1 draw.
Serbia and Armenia also drew 1-1 to leave Portugal bottom of the group.
