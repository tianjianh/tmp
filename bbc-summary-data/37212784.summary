A new railway bridge has been slid into place in Norwich.

The Long John Hill bridge was installed by engineers to replace a crumbling Victorian structure demolished over the weekend.
The rail line to London - closed at 02:00 BST on Saturday to allow for the replacement work - is due to reopen in the early hours of Tuesday.
The road beneath the rail bridge has been closed to traffic since May last year.
Trains crossing the bridge ran at reduced speeds for the past 15 months, but a Network Rail spokesman said a normal service will resume once the work is complete.
The spokesman added: "The Victorian bridge had been damaged at times during its service, but the new structure is robust enough that, if it is hit by a vehicle, normal railway services will not be affected."
