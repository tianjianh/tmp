[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former DFS manager sentenced over stealing money

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former manager of a furniture store in Londonderry, who stole more than £10,000 from the company, has been given a suspended jail sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Craig, 42, from Craigbrack Road in Eglinton, tendered his resignation and confessed to stealing money in an email to the chief operations officer of DFS furniture store.
He confessed to stealing £10,400 while working at the Crescent Link store.
Craig has been given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for three years.
He managed the store for more than 12 months, ending in June 2014.
A defence barrister said an email was sent but "no criminality was suspected".
"However, he was wracked with guilt because of his offending and sent his confessional e-mail to the chief operations officer," said the barrister.
"He had no previous convictions and was due to take up a job as a sales manager with a Belfast firm next Monday.
"Craig admitted abusing his position as the store manager to steal the money by taking some from the petty cash and by altering customers' financial transactions."
The judge said that while Craig's offending passed the custody threshold, the circumstances of the crimes were peculiar.
"Craig started stealing the money and altering the company's financial records to feed his gambling addiction which developed after he'd suffered from work related stress," she said.
The judge also took into consideration Craig's determination to continue his engagement with a counsellor to address his gambling addiction.
She said she would not be imposing a compensation order in the case because she said she did not want to add to the "difficulties" for Craig's family as a result of his offending.
