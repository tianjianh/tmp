But he's the latest in a long line of amazing animal record breakers - Newsround's got your top five.
Jiff smashed the world record for being the fastest dog on two paws.
He took just under 8 seconds to cover five metres on his front paws and was even quicker on his hinds legs, completing the same distance in less than 7 seconds.
Chris the sheep set a Guinness World Record for having the most wool shaved in a single sitting.
Chris' coat was dangerously big and he needed a life-saving shave.
Five shearers volunteered to help and together the team removed 41.1 kilograms of wool.
Chris is now well and has found a new home on a farm.
A French sheepdog called Norman became the fastest canine to travel 30 metres on a scooter.
The three-year-old covered the distance in twenty one seconds - nine seconds under the previous world record.
This hairy cat called Colonel Meow broke the record for having the longest fur.
The Colonel is a Himalayan-Persian cross and at its longest his fur reaches 22.97cm (that's nearly the length of a school ruler).
They're not strictly animal record breakers, but this record wouldn't have been possible without cows and their poo!
This bus powered by cow poo set a new land speed record for a bus after reaching speeds of almost 77mph.
