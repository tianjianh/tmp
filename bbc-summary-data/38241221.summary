Great Tapestry of Scotland site decision faces further delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on the site of a permanent home for the Great Tapestry of Scotland in the Borders faces a further delay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Borders Council is considering locations in Tweedbank and Galashiels.
The local authority was expected to decide in November but pushed that back to 15 December for further details.
However, that meeting has now been put back a week as the council is due to receive notification of its financial settlement from the Scottish government on 15 December.
A number of budget-related reports are due to be considered and the local authority said it was felt "appropriate" to move the meeting to give councillors as much time and information as possible.
The Tweedbank option for the tapestry would see a centre built at the terminus of the Borders Railway while the Galashiels proposal would see the town's Post Office building brought back into use.
It would also see the former Poundstretcher building demolished and a new build erected, with a connection made between the two.
