But after reviewing CCTV, dash-cam footage and eye-witness accounts, there was no evidence of an abduction, Thames Valley Police said.
They are still looking into rape allegations.
According to initial reports from police, the victim alleged she was abducted by two men in a silver car on Marston Ferry Road in Summertown on 28 September.
She was then found knocking on residents' doors in Cavendish Drive.
