Strike cancels first day of school in British Columbia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher's strike in British Columbia has postponed the first day of school for about 500,000 children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The strike of 40,000 teachers in the Canadian province began in June. A last-minute attempt to bring teachers back failed last week.
Key sticking points between the provincial government and the teacher's union include pay and class size.
The British Columbia government says it will not pass a law to force teachers back to work.
Extended summer camps and childcare options were filling up across British Columbia, broadcaster CBC reports.
The province has offered C$40 ($37; Â£22) per day per child under 12 to pay for childcare costs, but it will not be paid out immediately.
