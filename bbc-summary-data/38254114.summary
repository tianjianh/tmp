Prime Minister Theresa May has used pictures drawn by schoolchildren from her Maidenhead constituency for her official Christmas cards.

The three winning designs, all drawn by girls, feature the famous 10 Downing Street black door with various Christmas trappings.
Downing Street said it continued Mrs May's tradition of choosing pictures from children in her constituency.
Former Prime Minister David Cameron usually chose pictures of his family.
Mrs May's decision to use local children to design her card was mirrored by Lib Dem leader Tim Farron - whose card, revealed on Wednesday, featured a cover designed by Lily Parkin, eight, from his Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency.
Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones has also chosen a design by a schoolboy, after running a competition across Wales.
The winning designs for the Downing Street cards were designed by schoolgirls Sophie Brazil, Jade Windsor and Isabelle Milnes - one featuring Larry, the Downing Street cat.
Inside is the message: "Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, Theresa and Philip May."
Meanwhile Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon chose cartoon character Oor Wullie for her card - the character celebrated its 80th anniversary this year - describing him as a "much-loved national treasure adored by both children and adults across Scotland".
The Labour Party said Jeremy Corbyn's Christmas card was due out on Monday.
