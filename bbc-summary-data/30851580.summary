Almost 100 metres of paper were used to create the 3.7m long boat - which can carry one person at a time.
The boat was launched by school children on Southwark Park boating lake. Engineer Morwenna Wilson captained the maiden voyage.
She said: "I really want to show young people that this career can open doors to amazing opportunities and adventures."
The paper boat, designed by a group of engineers, was launched to promote The Big Bang Fair - a celebration of science and technology for young people which takes place at the NEC, Birmingham, from 11-14 March.
