Cardiff Blues agreed the 26-year-old's release from his contract to make the switch.
Knoyle has previously played for Scarlets and Gloucester and will rival Charlie Davies and Sarel Pretorius at Dragons following Luc Jones' move to Harlequins.
"I am delighted to be joining the Dragons," said Knoyle.

He added: "I am also looking forward to working hard, contributing to the ongoing development of the squad and challenging for a place in the starting XV."
Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones said Knoyle "is someone who will certainly make selection for the scrum-half slot even more competitive".
Knoyle made the first of his Wales appearances on tour against New Zealand in 2010 and his last cap came against Japan in 2013.
