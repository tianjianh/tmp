[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Caterham F1 headquarters in Oxfordshire to be sold

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former Oxfordshire headquarters of the collapsed Caterham Formula 1 team is to be sold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The team, based at Leafield, went into administration with the loss of 200 jobs last October following financial problems.
Their former 28-acre site includes 150,000 sq ft (13,900 sq m) of buildings, offices and a racing car testing facility.
Bids in excess of £5.5m are being sought for the site.
Agent Jonjo Lyles, of BNP Paribas Real Estate, said he was confident the facility, which "lends itself to a number of different uses", would be of interest to many people.
Caterham Sports Limited built cars for the Caterham Formula 1 team which was operated by 1 Malaysia Racing Team (1MRT).
Last October administrator Finbarr O'Connell said up to £20m was owed to external suppliers.
Weeks before the company was put into administration, bailiffs visited the Leafield site and seized items, including a 2013 F1 test car.
