[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors' Pro12 play-off push continued to gather pace as Gregor Townsend's side recorded a bonus-point win over Benetton Treviso.

Glasgow had trailed at half-time despite tries from Jonny Gray and Peter Horne, thanks to a lovely score from winger Angelo Esposito.
But Simone Favaro and Stuart Hogg touched down shortly after the break.
Grayson Hart and James Malcolm made the victory - the Warriors' sixth in a row - safe in the final quarter.
Glasgow's thirst for tries - and the extra league point four of them would yield - was immediately evident, as they opted to kick an early penalty for touch, not goal.
Favaro was halted inches short against his former club, but from the next phase captain Gray drove over, Finn Russell converting.
Jayden Hayward kicked two penalties to draw Treviso back within a point.
Then Favaro again, from a maul, went fizzing towards the whitewash, but lost the ball just before grounding.
Scrum-half Henry Pyrgos, though, loped his way to within a metre of the line from a quick tap-penalty, allowing Horne to scoop up possession and plunge over, Russell again slotting from the tee.
Treviso manufactured a fine try of their own four minutes before half-time, Esposito feeding Tommaso Iannone and tracking well to support the centre's inside shoulder. He took Iannone's pass and rounded Hogg to dot down under the posts, Hayward converting.
Pyrgos then appeared to have a pass blocked by the raised boot of number eight Robert Barbieri. Glasgow can raise just questions over the legality of the challenge, and perhaps more legitimately, whether the hulking Barbieri was onside.
The Glasgow scrum-half, though, tugged back the onrushing Italian as he lumbered after the loose ball. That, inevitably, yielded a penalty, and Hayward bisected the posts with the clock almost red to send Treviso down the tunnel two points ahead.
Flanker Favaro finally earned his five points after the break. It was the culmination of patient, accurate phase play that had eluded Glasgow during much of the sluggish first 40 minutes, with a little sprinkling of magic from Hogg.
The Six Nations player of the tournament fielded an ambitious cross-kick in Treviso's 22, and swung the ball beautifully infield, before popping up a few phases later to dance his way beyond a couple of defenders and flip to Favaro.
Russell converted, and Hogg's ruthlessness shone anew as he breezed past lock Marco Fuser and swerved by Luke McLean en route to the bonus-point score.
The conversion attempt struck the post, and Russell missed narrowly again after Hart leapt over from a yard at the corner flag.
Glasgow, utterly dominant by now, breached the Treviso rearguard for the sixth time when Malcolm finished a set of powerful carries, and Russell regained his accuracy from wide on the left.
