Warning as five Thirsk cats 'poisoned' with anti-freeze

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five cats have died in a spate of suspected anti-freeze attacks in a North Yorkshire town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pets are all thought to have been poisoned on the Hambleton estate in Thirsk between February and April.
North Yorkshire Police is jointly investigating the deaths with the RSPCA.
Cat owners in the area are being urged to be vigilant to any changes in their pets' behaviour and to check garages and gardens for any spillages.
PC Clare Mayes said: "If your cat appears to be lethargic or unsteady on their feet, you need to seek urgent veterinary assistance.
"The sooner your pet receives treatment, the better their chances of survival."
