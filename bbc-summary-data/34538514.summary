[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is believed the 16:39 train on Wednesday was travelling at about 75mph when it hit the vehicle which had been abandoned after falling onto the line.
One passenger suffered grazing to her arm caused by one of the windows on the train smashing.
The train's driver was uninjured, although he was left shocked by the incident.
At 17:05 the red Toyota Hilux, which had been stolen from a nearby garage, was seen to be driven erratically on the road beside the railway.
It then went out of control before rolling down an embankment and landing on its roof.
A short time later, the 16:39 Edinburgh to Milngavie service, collided with the vehicle on the Edinburgh to Glasgow (via Bathgate) railway line.
The pick-up was extensively damaged, however the train remained upright and did not derail.
One of the men seen fleeing from the pick-up truck was described as between 18 and 27 years old, about 5ft 9ins in height, of slim to medium build with short dark brown hair.
He was wearing a dark top and jeans.
The other man was 18 to 20 years old, between 5ft 6ins and 5ft 9ins in height and of slim build.
He was wearing a light grey hooded top or zipper and was in possession of a black phone
The vehicle was removed from the railway line at about 02:30 and services have now returned to normal.
Forensic inquiries at the scene are ongoing and officers are carrying out door-to-door inquiries.
CCTV footage is also being looked at.
Supt Kyle Gordon, Head of Operations for BTP in Scotland, said: "I cannot stress enough the seriousness of the incident and the potential circumstances of the two men's actions do not bear thinking about.
"Thankfully no-one was seriously injured. However, many people were inconvenienced and the rail network was disrupted for several hours.
"Anyone who witnessed the incident or who recognises the two men from the descriptions is urged to get in touch."
