[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old was walking in the town's Church Street at about 22:00 when she was attacked from behind.
The attacker then pulled the woman into a doorway before sexually assaulting her.
She managed to fight the man off, before seeking help and contacting the police.
The suspect was described as white, bald, aged between 30 and 40, around 5ft 7in in height, with a medium build and stubble.
He was wearing a royal blue hooded top - with the hood down - which had white tassels attached and blue denim jeans.
Officers reviewed CCTV images, with inquiries revealing a group of four people and a person with a dog walking along King Street at the time of the incident.
The four people were carrying umbrellas and crossed the road at the junction of King Street and Church Street, continuing along King Street.
The dog walker also continued along King Street.
Police believe the five may have significant information.
Det Sgt Stephen Bell said: "A young woman has been left extremely distressed by this ordeal.
"She was very brave and fought her attacker off but it is imperative we trace the man responsible.
"I would appeal, particularly to the five people who were seen in the area at that time, and to anyone else who was in the vicinity to get in touch with us.
"It's possible you saw the suspect and thought nothing of it at the time, but if you were in the area or you have any knowledge of the suspect or crime, please do contact us."
