The stations took four gold, three silver and five bronze awards in total.
The gold awards were won by BBC Radio Ulster presenters Stephen Nolan, Seamus McKee, Ralph McLean and The Nolan Show.
The awards ceremony, which was held in Kilkenny on Friday night, was attended by well-known radio presenters from across the island of Ireland.
A tribute to the late Radio Ulster host Gerry Anderson, who died in August after a long illness, received a standing ovation at the event.
His colleague Walter Love, who was inducted into the PPI Radio Awards Hall of Fame last month, received an PPI plaque to mark the prestigious honour.
The awards cap a very successful few months for BBC Radio Ulster, which was named Station Of The Year (One Million Plus) at the Radio Academy Awards in May.
BBC Northern Ireland's Head of Radio, Fergus Keeling, said: "This has been an incredible year for BBC Radio Ulster/Foyle as we remain the most listened to station in Northern Ireland, but it's also a measure of our success that our efforts have been recognised by our peers in this way, firstly at the Radio Academy Awards and now at the PPI Awards.
"I'm enormously proud of the presenters and teams for their success," he added.
