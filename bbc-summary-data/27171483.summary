Scruton station, on the Wensleydale Heritage Line, closed to passengers on 26 April 1954 before the widespread Beeching closures started in the 1960s.
The Wensleydale Railway Trust reopened the line, which runs through the Yorkshire Dales, in 2003.
The trust said the £180,000 restoration had returned Scruton station to how it looked when it closed.
"Restorations are complex and expensive, but no corners were cut and it has been restored as the Victorians built it - real wood, sash windows, lime plaster and iron rain-ware," said the trust in a statement.
The trust said the work was funded by a £75,000 Railway Heritage Trust grant, plus donations from supporters and the public.
The waiting room's timber screen and some of the building's window frames were built by woodwork students at Darlington College.
Although passengers are able to get off at Scruton station for the first time since 1954, regular trains will not operate from there until a platform extension is built.
Wensleydale Railway runs from Redmire to Leeming Bar.
Part of the line between Bedale and Leyburn reopened in April after a landslip caused by heavy rain in December 2013 cut the track in two.
