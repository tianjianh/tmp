A plan for a not-for-profit firm to run railways in Wales will be ready by the summer, said Transport Minister Edwina Hart.

Ministers have already said they want to see this model take over the Wales and Borders franchise from Arriva Trains when the contract comes under Welsh government control in 2018.
Mrs Hart also said she would like more power over Network Rail.
"I don't think the model we've had previously worked," she added.
In an interview with The Wales Report with Huw Edwards, Mrs Hart says one option would be to place an effective cap on the profits a franchise operator could make.
She added: "I hope to have a roadmap available by the time we go to recess in July/August to show how we're taking this forward".
A spokesman for Arriva Trains Wales said the company is "looking forward to the opportunity of working with the Welsh government to implement their future plans for transport in Wales."
Mrs Hart said Network Rail, which answers to the Department for Transport in London, has been responsible for "massive delays" and "escalating costs".
A Network Rail spokesman said: "As with any investment, we go to the market to deliver all projects in the most timely and cost effective way possible.
"As a national company, we are often able to leverage economies of scale given the number of projects we are delivering across the rail network."
