The 27-year-old was found to have consumed levels of salbutamol from an asthma inhaler above the permitted threshold after a match in August.
The FA initially considered the levels "not to be an intended therapeutic use of the substance", which Judge denied.
And at a hearing he was found to be at no significant fault.
The former Blackburn player, who has been sidelined since April with a serious leg break, will be target tested for the next two years and was also warned of his future conduct.
In a statement Brentford said: "Alan has suffered from exercise-induced asthma since he was a child and was given permission to use the inhaler.
"Following a match last August, Alan's levels of salbutamol from his inhaler were found to be slightly above the threshold. However, in mitigation, he provided a full explanation of the circumstances surrounding this.
"The FA found the case proven due to the level of salbutamol but acknowledged Alan's strong arguments in mitigation by issuing a decision which confirmed that he demonstrated 'no significant fault or negligence'."
