UKIP has no future, says Tory election strategist Crosby

UKIP has no "long-term future" and will always remain a protest group, the man who masterminded the Conservatives' general election victory has claimed.

Lynton Crosby, a Australian strategist who was a key aide to David Cameron, said UKIP was a "voice of discontent" and "too reliant" on Nigel Farage.
UKIP got nearly four million votes in May, more than 12% of the overall vote, but won only one parliamentary seat.
Mr Farage has said the party is well placed to do even better in 2020.
UKIP had been hoping to win a handful of seats in May after coming top in the 2014 European elections and winning two seats in subsequent Westminster by-elections.
However, it was left with only one MP - Douglas Carswell in Clacton - as Mark Reckless lost his seat and Mr Farage failed in his bid to get elected.
Speaking at an event in Sydney organised by the Australian-British Chamber of Commerce, Mr Crosby was dismissive of UKIP's future electoral prospects.
"Despite all the noise about how they were on a march...they ended up with one seat, one seat fewer than they had before the election," he said.
"Ultimately competence and the capacity to deliver is the measure by which people judge political parties and UKIP failed in that fundamental test.
"At one stage, they were talking about 30 to 70 seats and they ended up with one. I don't think they have got a long-term future.
"You should never write anyone off but they will be a voice of discontent. They are very reliant on the performance of their leader Nigel Farage and even he couldn't win a seat."
UKIP, which came second in 120 seats in May's election, has said it will play a major role in the Out campaign in the forthcoming referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.
Mr Farage quit in the aftermath of the election but his resignation was turned down by the party's national executive committee and he has insisted the party is united behind him.
During the event, Mr Crosby cast doubt on suggestions that the election - which opinion polls beforehand suggested was too close to call - was decided by a last minute swing to the Tories, motivated by voters' concerns about the prospect of a Labour government propped up by the SNP.
While voters were clearly worried about such a scenario, he said he had picked up their concerns more than six months before the general election - a fact not reflected in the polls.
"The first time we picked this up was in November 2014 when in discussions in focus groups, people said 'Ed Miliband is a very weak man and if the SNP do very well and if he relies on them to govern, they will push him around'.
"That was from the mouth of voters well before anyone had picked up that sense. We started building on that then. It wasn't something that came late in the campaign. It came late in a lot of people's realisation, perhaps, as an element of the campaign."
The pollster has been a controversial figure in British politics for nearly a decade, with critics accusing him of negative campaigning based on so-called "wedge" issues.
He worked for former Australian prime minister John Howard on a number of successful re-election campaigns before spearheading Boris Johnson' mayoral triumphs in 2008 and 2012.
