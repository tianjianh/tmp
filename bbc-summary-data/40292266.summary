Jonny Hayes: Celtic agree deal to sign Aberdeen winger

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic have agreed to sign Aberdeen winger Jonny Hayes for an undisclosed fee, subject to a medical.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old Republic of Ireland winger scored against Celtic in the 2-1 Scottish Cup final defeat last season.
Hayes, who was under contract at Pittodrie until 2019, had also been linked with English Championship outfit Cardiff City.
The former Leicester City player previously worked with Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers at Reading.
Aberdeen rejected two offers from Cardiff for Hayes in January, and the Championship side resumed their interest at the end of the season.
Cardiff manager Neil Warnock admitted defeat in their pursuit of the winger, though, with the player opting to rejoin Rodgers at Celtic Park.
Hayes has made 206 Aberdeen appearances in all competitions, scoring 29 goals, since arriving from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2012.
He provided 19 assists in the Premiership last season, the highest in the division, and was a member of the Republic of Ireland squad called up for the 1-1 draw with Austria last week, although Hayes did not add to his three international caps.
