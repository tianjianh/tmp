[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people have attended a candelit vigil in Glasgow for murdered student Karen Buckley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old's parents and two of her three brothers were among those who brought candles and flowers.
Miss Buckley's body was found on a farm to the north of Glasgow, four days after she went missing following a night out in the city's west end.
Alexander Pacteau, 21, has appeared in court charged with the Cork woman's murder and was remanded in custody.
Mr Pacteau, from Glasgow, made no plea or declaration during the private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
He is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He will appear in court again next week for a full committal hearing.
Miss Buckley's family, friends and fellow students were among about 300 mourners at the vigil.
A piper played as mourners laid flowers and others sang Scottish and Irish songs before a minute's silence was held. Cards and messages were also left.
Miss Buckley's parents Marian and John, and her brothers arrived towards the end of the vigil and looked at the tributes.
Mr and Mrs Buckley earlier visited Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) where their daughter was studying occupational therapy.
There, they met some of her friends and teaching staff and looked at floral tributes.
Students from the university also attended the vigil, with many wearing GCU tracksuits and jumpers.
Barry Ahearn, who is originally from Cork but now lives in Ayr, sang a local Cork song at the vigil.
He said: "I've been living in Scotland for the last four years and wanted to come today to show solidarity and support for Karen's family.
"I sang On The Banks On My Own Lovely Lee - it's the river that runs through Cork and is the local anthem.
"The whole situation is so sad, particularly when you're living in Scotland and something like this happens to someone from your own country. It just doesn't fit, it's so sad."
Flowers and messages have also been left at the GCU campus and at the entrance to High Craigton Farm where Miss Buckley's body was found.
A separate event, entitled Silent Vigil For Our Neighbour Karen Buckley, has been organised to take place in the Garnethill area of the city, where Miss Buckley lived, on Saturday.
A special prayer service was held near her home in Mallow on Wednesday, and a fundraising page set up by Miss Buckley's former classmates to support her family has raised more than Â£50,000.
