Warwick Castle glamping plans criticised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a permanent glamping site in the grounds of Warwick Castle will turn the landmark into a "theme park", residents have claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Merlin Entertainments Group (MEG), which runs the historical attraction, has filed an application to build lodges and several tree-houses.
But some have described the plans, set to go before Warwick District Council in November, as "wholly inappropriate".
In its application MEG said the site would "benefit the wider economy".
The firm has applied for permission to erect up to 20 permanent lodges, and create room for 41 glamping tents on land known as "Foxes Study".
It was previously granted permission to erect a temporary site during the last two summers.
Owners of neighbouring homes have expressed concerns about the proposals, which they claim will compromise the castle's historic character.
Veronica Hyland submitted an objection which said the move would be the "first step in turning this historic heritage site into a theme park".
"Granting this application would be another nail in the coffin of Warwick as a historic town and of the castle as a place abounding in history," she wrote.
Ms Hyland also said she feared trees surrounding the castle would be under threat if the plans were approved.
Councillor Bob Dhillon said he supported the application, and felt it had been "carefully considered" by MEG.
"I agree it will not affect the key historic features of the area or key views around the site," he said.
