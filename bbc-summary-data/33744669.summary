Leicester City 4-2 Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Claudio Ranieri's tenure as Leicester City manager began with a magnificent opening-day victory against Sunderland.

The hosts scored three goals in the first 30 minutes, with a deft Jamie Vardy header starting the scoring.
Riyad Mahrez then headed home before scoring from the spot after a Lee Cattermole foul on the Algerian.
Jermain Defoe gave the Black Cats hope but, after Marc Albrighton had struck for the Foxes, Steven Fletcher's late header was mere consolation.
The ease with which Leicester scored will worry Sunderland fans, their team seeming to have carried last season's defensive failings into this new campaign.
They began with new recruit Younes Kaboul partnering Sebastian Coates - who made his loan move from Liverpool permanent during the close season - in the centre of defence but the new-look partnership failed on the opening day.
"We clearly weren't at it," said Kaboul. "We were late for every ball. We conceded a lot and we were not sharp enough."
Sunderland conceded two sloppy goals early on, allowing Marc Albrighton's crosses from the left to find two of the smallest players on the pitch. From then on, Leicester gained confidence and Sunderland failed to cope with the home side's quick, crisp movement.
Claudio Ranieri made a winning return to the Premier League, 11 years after being sacked as Chelsea manager by owner Roman Abramovich.

The Leicester boss, known as 'the Tinkerman' for his constant changing of his starting line-ups, was a surprise replacement for Nigel Pearson in the summer but, should his new team continue to perform with such attacking verve, his first season with the Foxes will be trouble free - although the ease in which Sunderland scored twice is a note of caution.
Ranieri described his side's performance as "outstanding" and, indeed, they could have scored more, with Shinji Okazaki missing one glorious chance in the second half. Mahrez, too, hit the woodwork after the break and forced a fine save Costel Pantilimon.
The coach chose to rely on the players who secured top-flight survival last term by winning win seven of their last nine games to finish 14th, with only one summer signing - Okazaki - in his starting line-up,
Of the familiar Leicester faces, it was striker Vardy and winger Mahrez who particularly excelled, their creativity and pace causing Sunderland problems.
Sunderland were fragile on the right side of their defence and 42.2% of Leicester's attacks came from that flank. Marc Albrighton caused damage in the first half with his crosses from the left wing and combined well with Jeff Schlupp and Okazaki for the second goal, which Mahrez scored.
Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri: "It was a very good start and I am very happy with my players in the first match, which is so important in front of our fans. I told my players to be the warriors for them.
"The performance was outstanding from the beginning. Okazaki played very well but I don't like to just say that because the whole team played well."

Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat: "After 10 minutes there were three crosses and three goals. At this level this cannot happen.
"You have to show every minute away from home and we didn't see that in the first half. We have to wait [for new players]. We struggled again. Everybody can see that we need more."
Leicester winger Marc Albrighton: "Claudio Ranieri has come in with fresh ideas to add to the way we were playing. He didn't want to change too much but he has new ideas and we are taking them on board."
Riyad Mahrez's pace and invention posed havoc all afternoon and the Algeria international could have had a hat-trick before receiving a deserved standing ovation from the Leicester fans as he was substituted towards the end of the match.
