Foreign Office cleaners 'disciplined after seeking pay talks'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cleaners who contacted the foreign secretary seeking a meeting to discuss the National Living Wage have been made redundant or face disciplinary action, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A group of 14 cleaners employed by contractors Interserve say they have been "punished" for raising the issue.
A spokeswoman called on Philip Hammond to intervene and stop the process.
The Foreign Office and Interserve denied the claims and said no one had been made redundant.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We have not taken any disciplinary measures against any cleaning staff. Our contractor, Interserve, have assured us that no-one has been made redundant as a result of a letter asking for an increase in pay.
"From April 2016 all Interserve staff will benefit from the new mandatory National Living Wage."
But the group of cleaners said three people had been made redundant and others had been accused of "bringing the contract into disrepute".
Rev Rosemia Brown, a community leader with campaign group Citizens UK, said: "We are calling on Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to intervene, to stop the disciplinary process and ensure no-one in the FCO feels intimidated for signing a letter.
"These cleaners need the London Living Wage and they have the right to let him know."
An Interserve spokeswoman said it was committed to introducing the National Living Wage when it comes into effect in 2016, starting at Â£7.20 and rising to Â£9 an hour by 2020.
The spokeswoman said a Foreign Office building was being closed, meaning a reduction to the number of cleaning staff needed.
"This is now drawing to a close and a number of people will be affected by redundancy, although we are offering opportunities elsewhere in the business wherever possible," she said.
"This process has been undertaken in full cooperation with unions and employee representatives and has no bearing on any other employee issues."
Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said: "It is extraordinary that cleaners working at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office appear to have been called in by their employer because they had had the temerity to write a letter to the foreign secretary about their rates of pay.
"Philip Hammond needs to investigate Interserve's conduct immediately."
