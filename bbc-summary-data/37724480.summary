Josh Clarke opened the scoring, moving past Nedum Onuoha before squeezing a shot under QPR keeper Alex Smithies.
Sawyers met a Maxime Colin pass with a fine first-time effort into the top left-hand corner to add a second.
Idrissa Sylla went closest to a QPR response, only for John Egan to nod his goal-bound header over the bar.
Victory lifted Brentford to within a point of the Championship play-off places after 15 games, but Lewis Macleod was carried off the pitch on a stretcher after suffering a knee injury.
Defeat leaves Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's QPR 13th in the table with only one win from their past seven home league matches.
In a high-tempo start to the west London derby, Brentford carved out several chances with Sawyers forcing Smithies into the first save of the match after 20 minutes.
Scott Hogan twice threatened for the Bees, while Conor Washington was the first to test Brentford keeper Daniel Bentley before Clarke put the visitors ahead.
QPR looked brighter after the interval, with Tjaronn Chery a particular menace, but it was Sawyers' neat side-footed finish that ensured victory for Dean Smith's side and ended a four-match winless run.
QPR boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told BBC Radio London:
"It was frustrating and painful, as I did not see it coming. We made Brentford look very good.
"We made them counter-attack us and that is not what we set out to do. They won the midfield.
"We have taken a step back. It was not the performance I was looking for or the kind of performance we have put in in the last six games.
"I am disappointed for the fans as well. We have to put our hands up, say sorry, and try to put it right."
Brentford boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London:
"In the first half we were outstanding, with the intensity of our pressing and our intensity on the ball. The only disappointment was we weren't out of sight at half-time.
"We played deeper in the second half but our counter-attacking at pace was a joy to watch, and it created a number of chances.
"We had four warriors at the back and we defended our box well. We were the better team in both boxes."
On Lewis Macleod's injury: "I'm not too sure at the moment. He told the medical staff he heard a click in his knee, which doesn't sound nice.
"It didn't look good but I'm hoping it is not too serious."
