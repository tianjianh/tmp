Thomas Wood, 19, died in a car crash on his way to work in Hereford.
But his parents were left "upset and annoyed" when a letter arrived more than 18 months after Thomas's death requesting he attend jury service next February.
HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS) said it deeply regretted any distress caused to the family.

Mr Wood crashed on the A4103 on 1 June.
His parents said police and the coroner's office advised them to contact electoral services locally after his death and his inquest - held in January last year - which they did.
But a letter arrived on 24 December asking Thomas to attend jury service on 15 February, just days after he would have turned 21.
His mother, Diane, said: "I was very upset because Tom loved Christmas and Christmas is very hard for both of us. All we want to do is shut ourselves away."
She said she found it "extremely upsetting and annoying" to receive the letter at the "worst possible time".
His father, Nigel, said he wanted an apology and explanation so the same thing would not happen to anyone else.
HMCTS said jurors are selected from the electoral register which is collated by local authorities, and each authority is only required to submit an updated version of the register to the Jury Central Summoning Bureau once a year.
"In this case, HMCTS used the most up to date register available, which was provided in December 2014.
"We have updated the copy of the register we hold to ensure that Mr and Mrs Wood do not receive any further letters from the Jury Central Summoning Bureau."
