The Queens Walk venue will welcome the Shoot-Out event, organised by World Snooker, in February.
The competition, to be shown by ITV4, will feature 64 leading players in a knockout format.
The Hexagon, described by World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn as a "fabulous venue", previously held the Grand Prix tournament from 1984 to 1993.
The Shoot-Out event is due to run at the council-owned theatre for three years.
