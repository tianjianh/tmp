The Scotland forward, 29, has signed a two-year contract at Loftus Road with the option of a further year.
He established himself as a fans' favourite at Rangers during a three-year spell in which he played a key role in their promotion to the Premier League in 2010-11.
Mackie, who left to join Forest in a Â£1m deal in 2013, spent last season on loan at Reading.
He made 39 appearances for the Royals, scoring six goals, and netted five times in 49 outings as a Forest player.
Mackie returns to QPR with the club looking to rebuild under head coach Chris Ramsey and director of football Les Ferdinand following last season's relegation from the top flight.
"People say never go back, but I feel as though I've got some unfinished business here and under the guidance of Les and Chris, I can only see a bright future for this club," Mackie told the QPR website.
"They know I'll come in and give my absolute maximum and, having played in front of the QPR fans before, I know that's exactly what they love to see. It's great to be back."
