West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called to the site in Ashbourne shortly before 13:00 GMT on Monday after a woman reported feeling ill and it "quickly became apparent" she was suffering from the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Ambulance officials said: "A number of other patients then began coming forward. Ambulance staff worked quickly to assess them all in order to establish the severity of their conditions."
A spokeswoman for Kuehne and Nagel said a "thorough investigation" is under way.
She added: "A number of people were given oxygen at the site and six were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure."
