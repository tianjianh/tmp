The 37-year-old played for Coventry between 2006 and 2010, winning three Elite League titles, the Challenge Cup and the Knockout Cup.
He retired after spending the 2015-16 season with Fife Flyers, where he was also an associate coach.
"I'm sure there will be doubters, it comes with the territory of getting a position of power," he said.
"I think it will be a bit of a mixed bag, I am replacing a former American League and KHL (Kontinental Hockey League) coach, but I also think there will be a lot of people who are excited."
Explaining the appointment, director of hockey James Pease told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: "Danny stood out to us. He is someone that we know as an organisation, somebody who as a person would bring what we needed from a coach.
"He is a really passionate, hard working, gritty individual and that's what we were looking for."
Weber, who joined on a short-term contract mid-way through the 2014-15 season, was part of Great Britain's coaching team that travelled to the World Championships in Zagreb in April.
Having returned for a second spell for this season, the 43-year-old American has said that he is now looking for challenges further afield.
"[James] Pease and I talked before I went off with GB for the World Championship and it was just something that ran it's course.
"I knew the Coventry wasn't going to be the end for my coaching career stand point and I was looking to move on to other leagues and opportunities.
"We decided it was the natural course to do it now then drag it out further in the summer."
