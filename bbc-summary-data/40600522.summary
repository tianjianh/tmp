Five of the seven nominations for best drama series have gone to new shows, including NBC's This Is Us, which is the first show from a major broadcast network to be in that category since 2011.
The new season of HBO's Game of Thrones isn't nominated because it is starting too late to be eligible this year.
Despite that, HBO had the highest overall tally with 110 nominations, followed by Netflix with 91 and NBC with 60.
The winners will be announced at a ceremony hosted by Stephen Colbert on 17 September.
The full nominations are on the Emmys website.
