Incredible facts about the Halley VI research station

A huge crack in the ice near an important scientific research station is forcing it to move to a new location.

The Halley VI is a British Antarctic Survey research station which is based at the Brunt Ice Shelf, in Antarctica.
It's home to a team of scientists, engineers and a colony of penguins!
However, two large cracks have appeared in the ice, which could potentially cut off the research centre if it breaks away from the main island.
So in 2015, the scientists at the station decided to move it 23 kilometres further inland to stop this from happening.
The research station is made up of eight large pods (like giant train carriages) which sit on skis.  These pods can be separated and moved using special heavy vehicles.
The last pod is currently being moved to the new location, and the BAS think it will be completed before March.
