John Pottinger, 21, admitted causing 39-year-old George Armour's death by dangerous driving.
It happened on the B9074 at Hamnavoe in June last year. The victim was thrown up and over the bonnet of the car.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Pottinger was also banned from driving for five years.
The court heard that he had been "pretty drunk" after attending a disco at the Burra Hall.
Pottinger decided to go to a party on a nearby island, and was persuaded to drive his Volkswagen Golf, taking four teenage friends with him.
He drove off  in the direction of Scalloway with "smoke billowing" and bouncing his car over speed bumps.
Two of his friends told him he was going too fast, and shouted at him to slow down as they approached the brow of a hill, immediately before the collision.
When police later approached him, Pottinger asked them: "Just tell me is he dead?"
David Moggach, defending, said Pottinger was "truly sorry" for what happened.
Lord Turnbull described the case as "utterly tragic" resulting in the death of a "man in his prime".
The judge said: "This must serve as a warning to all drivers - particularly young men - of the dangers of drinking and driving.
"This is a crime in rural areas as much as it is anywhere else. The reality of drinking and driving is the same wherever it occurs."
