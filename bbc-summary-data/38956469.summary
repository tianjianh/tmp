The 25-year-old centre-back was injured late on during the League Two draw against Blackpool on 4 February.
He has made 30 appearances for the U's this season, helping them climb to two points off the play-off places.
"He'll be more or less done for the season unless he has a quick recovery, but it doesn't look too hopeful," boss John McGreal told BBC Essex.
