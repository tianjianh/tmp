Brad Howell started racing motorbikes when he was 13 years old and soon noticed all the pressures associated with professional sport.

By his late teens he started suffering from depression and anxiety, but didn't know what was wrong at the time.
Now Brad has openly shared his issues with ex-footballer Clarke Carlisle, who's battled depression himself.
It follows an exclusive report which claims some sport stars are too afraid to talk about mental health issues.
Brad begins: "Towards my late teens I started suffering with both depression and anxiety, but at the time I didn't know what it was, what I was experiencing. It was only until my early twenties when I went to speak to my GP."
Clarke responds: "Having something to put it down to and having something to focus on, has generally made the subsequent three or four years, not easy, but so much more manageable.
"Where I differ from you is mine was brought about a specific trigger, I had a serious injury I thought I might not be able to play football again. I tried to commit suicide at the time; I just couldn't deal with it."
The former footballer asks Brad: "Do you think there was a specific trigger with yours or a general accumulation of things?"
Brad replies: "I had an injury in 2011 that pretty much put an end to my career, I can't ride any more. I can, but I'm not fast enough.
"Things really did start to fall apart for me, especially then because it felt like I was losing my right arm.
"Obviously it's your ego that makes you not want to look bad and talk about things which are bad in your life.
"Once I admitted to myself there was a problem, I found it much easier.
"People don't talk about it and that needs to change, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
"You don't mind telling your buddy that you've got a cold, it needs to be out there and people need to respect it and learn to live with it.
Clarke strongly agrees with that: "In 2014, people are a lot more forward thinking, a lot more aware of mental health.
"There's an appetite now for people to take it on board and give the support that's necessary.
"Just because you want to speak to someone and deal with your mental health issue, doesn't mean you have to go and tell the world. "
