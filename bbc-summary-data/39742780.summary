The draft see the NFL's 32 teams choose the best players from American college football teams across seven rounds.
As the league's worst-performing side last season, Cleveland were given the first pick and chose 21-year-old Garrett from Texas A&M.
British-born Obi Melifonwu is yet to be selected, with six rounds to come.
Melifonwu, 23, who moved to America aged three, was considered a fringe first-round prospect and should be selected on Friday when the second round begins, while fellow Londoner Jermaine Eluemunor could also be a day two pick.
The draft takes place up until Saturday with a total of 253 selections due to be made.
An estimated 70,000 football fans attended Thursday's first round outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
The big surprise of the night came with the second pick of the first round when the Chicago Bears, who were due to have the third pick, traded with the San Francisco 49ers to leapfrog them and select quarterback Mitchell Trubisky from North Carolina.
TJ Onwuanibe, a 14-year-old from Baltimore, who is in remission after battling a rare form of brain cancer, was chosen to announce the Baltimore Ravens' pick of Marlon Humphrey.
UCLA's Takkarist McKinley, who was selected by the Atlanta Falcons, walked on stage with a picture of his grandmother, who he then dedicated his achievements to. McKinley was raised by his grandmother Myrtle who died in 2011.
He said: "I told her, before she passed away, I was going to win my dream. 'I'm going to get out of Oakland, I'm going to go to the NFL.'
"I made that promise to her. Thirty seconds later she passed away. And it's who I do it for, it's who I do it for."
