The 21-year-old Spurs youth product has had five loan spells during his career, including a two-game stint at Wigan earlier this season.
In total, he has scored nine goals in 42 career league appearances.
He joins the League One promotion hopefuls on a three-and-a-half-year deal after the sale of top goalscorer Conor Washington to QPR on Tuesday.
"He is a sought-after player, we are not the only club at the top of our league that have been after him," said Posh boss Graham Westley.
"I am delighted that he has decided that we are the place he wants to join."
"I think he wants to try to become the next Conor Washington, the next Craig Mackail-Smith, the next Britt Assombalonga and he has all the talent and attributes to fulfil that."
Meanwhile, defender Miles Addison, 27, has left Posh at the end of his short-term contract after playing three games for Westley's side.
