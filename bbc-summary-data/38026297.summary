Gareth Southgate: England job interview scheduled for Monday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gareth Southgate will meet the Football Association hierarchy on Monday for what is effectively his interview for the England manager's job.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southgate, 46, has just concluded a four-game stint as interim manager following Sam Allardyce's departure.
He will be interviewed at St George's Park by a panel including FA chairman Greg Clarke, chief executive Martin Glenn, technical director Dan Ashworth, as well as League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson and former England defender Graeme Le Saux.
The FA insists there is no time frame on when an appointment will be made, with England's next game a friendly in Germany in March, and the final decision will be taken by Clarke, Glenn and Ashworth.
The organisation is determined not to be rushed into an appointment and wants to conduct a thorough process, although no other interviews are currently scheduled and Southgate is firm favourite to take over on a full-time basis.
He is ingrained in the FA system through his work as England under-21 coach and has impressed with his demeanour off the pitch as well as the manner in which he has taken big footballing decisions, including dropping captain Wayne Rooney for the World Cup qualifier in Slovenia.
Southgate has left England top of their World Cup qualifying group after victories against Malta and Scotland at Wembley and a goalless draw in Slovenia. He also presided over Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Spain, in which the visitors scored twice in the closing moments.
England next play in March, with a friendly against World Cup winners Germany in Dortmund, followed by a home qualifier against Lithuania.
The FA will want Southgate to deliver his vision for England's future following a series of failures in major tournaments. There is also likely to be a review of his brief stint in control of the national team.
FA chief executive Glenn said after Southgate's final game in interim charge: "Clearly his candidacy has become much stronger. We just need to weigh up the facts and take time to make the right decision."
He added: "His candidacy is not just based on one or two matches, but because of what we've seen over the last couple of years.
"He's got renewed confidence and is a different manager to what he was two years ago. So it is not all about assessing him on a few games."
