Peter Niven-owned Clever Cookie won the Yorkshire Cup at York on Friday.

The Malton trainer had to find another jockey after Danny Tudhope was injured in a fall on Thursday, with PJ McDonald instead partnering the eight-year-old.
Curbyourenthusiasm, who was last for much of the one-mile-six-furlong journey, came home well to beat Second Step to the runner-up spot.
Pre-race favourite Flying Officer was withdrawn after unseating jockey Frankie Dettori before the start.
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght:
"Top jump jockey turned trainer Peter Niven wouldn't have that many horses full stop, and certainly not many that are top-notchers and probable contenders at Royal Ascot.
"But victory for the likeable eight-year-old, who overcame firm-going concerns and whose stamina outlasted that of favourite Second Step, earned a trip south from Niven HQ in Yorkshire with a stirring win that the partisan here crowd enjoyed noisily.
"A wet June would make him a player in the Gold Cup at Ascot."
