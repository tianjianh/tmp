Last BHS store in Scotland closes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The last BHS store in Scotland has closed its doors for the final time, following the collapse of the high street retailer earlier this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BHS ran 16 Scottish branches, employing more than 520 staff, when it went into administration in April.
Before Sunday, 15 had already closed, leaving only one store operating at St Enoch shopping centre in Glasgow.
The branch employed more than 50 staff at the time of the store chain's collapse.
The retail giant traded for almost 90 years on the British high street before going into administration.
Attempts to find a buyer were unsuccessful and BHS was wound up in June with the loss of 11,000 UK jobs.
MPS have been scathing about the collapse of BHS  and the way in which it was run by Sir Philip Green.
In a report, they claimed his failure to resolve BHS's Â£571m pension deficit was a major factor in the firm's demise.
Sir Philip promised MPs in June that he would sort out the pensions "mess".
