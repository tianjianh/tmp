A relative found the bodies of Michael and Marjorie Cawdery, who were both 83, in their Upper Ramone Park home in Portadown on Friday afternoon.
Police said they had been killed in a "very brutal attack". They are reported to have been stabbed.
A 40-year-old man was arrested in the Springfields area of Portadown.
He is still being questioned about the murders.
In a statement the Cawdery family said: "The awful and incomprehensible events of Friday 26 May have deprived our family of two wonderful people, Michael and Marjorie, who were our father, mother, brother, sister and grandparents.
"We thank the police for their prompt response and professional actions. We also thank everyone who has expressed sympathy in whatever way and offered help."
Police have said they received a report of a man breaking into a car in Upper Ramone Park shortly after midday on Friday.
Det Supt Kevin Geddes said: "Police were called to an address in the Upper Ramone Park area of the town at around 3.40pm yesterday afternoon. On arrival, officers found the bodies of Michael and Marjorie.
"Earlier in the day, at around 12.20pm, we had a report of a male breaking into a car in the Upper Ramone Park area.
"We are appealing for anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area between 11am and 5pm yesterday to get in touch with police on the non-emergency number 101.
"The family car belonging to the deceased, a grey Renault Kango van, registration NJZ 6101, was taken from the house and later found at around 5pm in the Edenderry Gardens area.
"We need to know the movements of this car from the time it left Upper Ramone Park until it was recovered in Edenderry Gardens."
He said detectives remain in the area and will have extra patrols in and around Portadown.
