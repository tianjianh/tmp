The role was created in the wake of former head of rugby Josh Lewsey's departure.
Geraint John took Lewsey's title in January, 2016 and ex-Osprey and British and Irish Lions back-rower Jones will work alongside him.
"I will champion at board level the needs, concerns and direction of the community game in Wales," said Jones.
"I want to remain both visible and accessible and I would encourage those with a modern perspective on the game and a desire to innovate to get in touch and share their ideas."
Jones, 34, quit playing in August, 2015 having made 78 Test appearances, three of them for the Lions.
Hefinished his career at Bristol having started at Risca RFC before moving on to Newport, Bridgend and Celtic Warriors and then spending 10 years at Ospreys.
A shoulder injury forced Jones into retirement, bringing to a close a career that included three Six Nations Grand Slams.
