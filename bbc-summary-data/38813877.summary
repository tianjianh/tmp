[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Borders has abandoned Â£1.87m plans to move a mental health rehabilitation unit to a former care home in Hawick.

It had approved the relocation from the East/West Brigs ward in Galashiels to Crumhaugh House in 2015.
It said at the time that the move would address "patient care and safety issues" in the service.
However, NHS Borders said changes in provision at Galashiels had "called into question" the decision to relocate to the vacant Hawick property.
The move would have relocated 28 staff from one town to the other.
Dr Cliff Sharp, associate medical director, said: "After very careful consideration I took the somewhat unusual step of going back to the board and requesting that we did not progress with the relocation to Hawick.
"On the basis of the information presented to them the board approved the request.
"In light of this decision which has been communicated to affected patients, families, carers and our staff, I would like to assure you that the board will restart the process to find a suitable alternative use for the Crumhaugh House property."
