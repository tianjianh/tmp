Ex-Cardiff City striker Jay Bothroyd says Neil Warnock will "shake things up" as new manager of the Bluebirds.

Warnock, 67, has been appointed manager of the Championship strugglers following Paul Trollope's sacking.
Bothroyd played under Warnock at Queens Park Rangers and says his former boss is a good appointment.
"The Cardiff squad need a firework up their backsides because it's terrible the position they're in at the moment," he said.
"Even before I went to Cardiff they were hovering around the play-off spots so to be where they are at the moment is very disappointing.
"It's the right time for Warnock to go in there and shake things up."
Trollope was dismissed on Tuesday after less than five months in charge, with Cardiff second bottom of the table after two wins from 11 games.
Cardiff is Warnock's 15th club as a manger with his last role helping Rotherham avoid relegation from the Championship last season.
He turned down the chance to stay at Rotherham who are the only side currently below Cardiff in the table.
Warnock spent eight seasons in charge of Sheffield United, has twice managed Crystal Palace and QPR and was also boss of Leeds United.
Former England striker Bothroyd, who spent three seasons at Cardiff before Warnock signed him for QPR in 2011, says Warnock has many qualities.
"He brings passion, knows the Championship really well and has been successful in the Championship," Bothroyd told BBC Wales Sport.
"I think he's respected by a lot of the players he's managed.
"He's very honest and doesn't beat around the bush. He'll tell you how it is and players want to know that.
"Footballers want someone to give it to them how it is and that's what Neil does.
"He knows how to get the best out of people."
Warnock will be Cardiff's sixth permanent manager since controversial Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan became club owner in 2010.
But Bothroyd says Warnock has experience of dealing with chairmen and club owners and will manage Cardiff on his own terms.
"Neil Warnock is an experienced manager and I'm sure he knows how to deal with these sort of people," said Bothroyd, who now plays for Japanese side Jubilo Iwata.
"He dealt with Flavio Briatore [former part-owner of QPR] and I don't think anyone's more erratic than him.
"I'm sure he'll get along with the management there and I'm sure he's already said what he wants to do and his plan.
"Neil is successful when he does things his way and not someone else's."
