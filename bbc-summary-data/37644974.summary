[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Australian world number 14 lost 6-3 6-1 to 110th-ranked Mischa Zverev of Germany in the second round.
Kyrgios, 21, patted the ball over the net several times when serving and began walking back to his chair before a serve from Zverev had landed.
He was also fined for abusing a spectator and unsportsmanlike conduct.
Kyrgios received a code violation for swearing during the match and argued with a member of the crowd.
The ATP decided to issue the maximum $10,000 (£8,192) fine for breaching its code of conduct regarding "lack of best efforts".
Having been booed by the crowd, Kyrgios admitted he "took the easy way out" and "tapped out a little bit" against Zverev.
However, the Australian said he did not "owe them anything".
It came a day after Kyrgios said he was "bored" during his first-round victory over Sam Querrey.
