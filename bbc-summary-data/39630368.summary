Inverness Castle Viewpoint allows for 360 degree views of Inverness and surrounding area.
High Life Highland, which runs leisure sites on Highland Council's behalf, said all the free slots were booked by lunchtime on Tuesday.
Entry fees to access to the viewpoint on the North Tower begin on Saturday.
After Easter Monday's opening day, 1,100 slots were available.
High Life Highland said all the slots have been booked.
Highland Council, which owns the tower, said the viewpoint was the first phase in transforming Inverness Castle into a major tourist attraction.
The 175-year-old property is currently the base for the city's courts service, which is to be moved to a new building.
