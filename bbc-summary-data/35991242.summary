#towerlives: Butetown's festival of storytelling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
#towerlives is a week-long festival of storytelling and music, on air and on the ground, around the council estate tower blocks of Butetown in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is Butetown but could be Tottenham or Easterhouse - areas that are often talked about but rarely heard from.
The aim is to give a platform to voices within the community.
BBC Wales, 1XTRA, Radio 2 and News Online are collaborating all week with documentaries, news reports, features, comedy, spoken word and music.
To catch up on any of the coverage you may miss, we will be posting updates as and when they are published and broadcast across the BBC.
You can also get involved on social media #towerlives.
