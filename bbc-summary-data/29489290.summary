Rescued circus lions offered home at Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian

A West Lothian zoo plans to provide a new permanent home for four lions which were confiscated from a French circus.

Five Sisters Zoo, at West Calder, aims to raise Â£150,000 to build a new enclosure for the animals.
The lions were seized by Belgian officials in May because the country's law forbids the use of wild animals in circuses.
The four big cats had previously been confined to a cramped circus trailer.
The circus was performing in the city of Liege, in French-speaking Belgium, when government officials seized the trailer and took the lions to a rescue centre.
The trailer was found to be in poor condition with large pieces of metal jutting out and holes in the floor.
The exact history of the lions is not known, but they are believed to be about six years old.
They are thought to have been born in captivity and sold to the circus at a young age.
They are larger than normal and have no manes as a result of being castrated.
A spokeswoman for Five Sisters Zoo said: "Having identified a suitable two acre site in the zoo, the aim within a six-month period is to have raised Â£150,000, built a suitable enclosure and bring the lions to live permanently at the zoo."
Three years ago the zoo launched an appeal to rehome three former circus bears.
A purpose-built woodland enclosure was completed within six months and the bears arrived early in 2012.
The spokeswoman added: "Eighteen months on, the bears are thriving and it was only a matter of weeks after their arrival that their natural bear behaviours started emerging.
"They are about to successfully hibernate for the third year."
Last summer a fire killed all the animals in the zoo's reptile house and an otter.
Fire investigations were inconclusive although suspicious circumstances were ruled out.
A former soft play area is being converted into a new reptile house.
