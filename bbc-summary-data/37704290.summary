Plans for an aerial obstacle course in Leeds have moved a step closer after councillors gave the scheme the green light.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leeds City Council approved initial proposals for adventure company Go Ape to build a site in Roundhay Park.
A Â£3.1m package to improve other tourist attractions was also approved.
Upgrades will be made to Roundhay's Tropical World, the bird centre at Lotherton Hall and Temple Newsam's Home Farm.
A council survey of 450 people at Roundhay Park found 81% would attend a Go Ape attraction if it opened.
Speaking at the executive committee meeting, Labour councillor Lucinda Yeadon said it was still "early days" and the plans were yet to go through the planning process.
Wildlife attraction Tropical World will see a redesign where the site will be split into different zones, including an Oriental-style butterfly house and a nocturnal 'dark mine'.
The council said Lotherton Hall's bird garden will be upgraded to house a "much more diverse collection of animals, including penguins".
Home Farm will gain a new indoor play facility under the plans.
Go Ape operates 29 sites across the UK, employing 800 staff during its peak months.
