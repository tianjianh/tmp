[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 2-3 Woking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gozie Ugwu's stoppage-time penalty rounded off a stunning late fightback as Woking boosted their National League survival hopes with a 3-2 win at Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chester took the lead with eight minutes left but Connor Hall's equaliser was followed by Ugwu's winner from the spot.
Brian Saah had given the visitors the lead with an opportunist strike after 54 minutes, but a minute later Liam Davies, older brother of rising Everton star Tom Davies, equalised with a bullet header.
Elliott Durrell then nudged the hosts in front after 82 minutes, but substitute Hall fired home with his first touch three minutes later.
The visitors, who started the day outside the drop zone on goal difference, were awarded a penalty in stoppage time and Ugwu scored.
Woking climb to 17th, within a point of 16th-placed Chester, leaving both sides possibly still having to win one of their final two games to be certain of avoiding the drop.
