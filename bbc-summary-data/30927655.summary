In a speech shown on ITV, he said: "She became one of the best-loved and most enduring characters on British TV."
"What we'll remember the most is the vibrant, warm-hearted, loving person who came to work each day, gave us all a hug and brightened up our lives."
EastEnders star Adam Woodyatt later paid tribute to "the Weatherfield One".
See a full list of the nominees and award winners.
The BBC One drama was named best serial and, when the cast went on stage to collect the award, Woodyatt, who plays Ian Beale, dedicated their prize to Coronation Street. He explained that, without the ITV show, "there would be no EastEnders".
He then made special mention of Anne Kirkbride's character Deirdre Barlow - drawing a standing ovation from the Corrie cast.
"If you don't mind, we'd like to accept this for the Weatherfield One," he added.
And this year's winner of the best entertainment presenter was... Ant and Dec. Again.
That's the 14th time the pair have won it - they also got top entertainment programme for I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, beating their other show, Saturday Night Takeaway.
The red carpet attracted some of the biggest names in British and international television.
Kris Jenner, of Keeping Up With the Kardashians fame, was in attendance, as was Maisie Williams, who plays Arya in Game of Thrones.
A highlight of the evening included David Tennant getting the special recognition award.
Colleagues such as Billie Piper, Russell T Davies and Catherine Tate spoke about his skill as an actor
"So much of tonight now makes sense, all those people lying to me," he said of his shock at winning the award, before dedicating it to his dad.
One person whose night didn't go quite to plan was Sheridan Smith.
Despite winning top drama performance, the star couldn't accept her award - because she was stuck in traffic, in the back of a cab.
Backstage she was visibly emotional, saying: "I was crying at the back of the car.
"My mum is livid because she really wanted to be on camera if I won."
If there's one thing the NTAs aren't short of, it's prizes - in fact there are so many, they seem to have had to come up with some pretty elaborate names.
The winner of the best-named prize was Great British Bake Off, which took home top skills challenge show - an award that was introduced this year.
It's been gripping EastEnders viewers for months - and fans were hoping the clue revealed at tonight's NTAs would help them work out who Lucy Beale's killer is.
Dermot O'Leary opened a case containing the sound of a music box playing the song Oh What A Beautiful Morning, which was said to be the last thing she heard.
Are you any closer to figuring it out now?
The pair's reaction to Gogglebox winning top factual programme was priceless.
Sandra seemed alarmed at having to climb the stairs to the stage but host Dermot O'Leary rushed to lend a hand.
Meanwhile the Tapper family were pictured at home, watching the awards in their finest.
"Can Gogglebox win every award?" asked O'Leary and we can sort of see why he said it.
