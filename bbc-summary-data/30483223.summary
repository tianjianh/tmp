The airline said it expects 45,000 passengers will use the year-round service which will operate four times a week from April.
Easyjet already operates services from Ronaldsway to Liverpool and London Gatwick.
A spokeswoman said it would "further strengthen connections for customers travelling to and from the UK".
Ann Reynolds, Director of Ports, said the decision was an "exciting opportunity for residents" which could "bring in potential new tourism" to the Isle of Man.
The service is set to begin on 19 April.
