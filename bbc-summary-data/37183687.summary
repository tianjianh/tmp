Somalia hunts for fake-cash bank teller

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bank teller at Somalia's central bank is on the run after allegedly stealing $530,000 (Â£402,000), the bank's governor Bashir Issa Ali has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Senior cashier Muhidin Mohamed Hassan was behind the scam to exchange US dollar notes with fake bills, he said.
Police and security agencies were hunting for him and several other staff at the bank were being questioned, the governor added.
The Central Bank of Somalia has been hit by financial scandals in the past.
In 2013, a UN Monitoring Group on Somalia said it had become a "slush fund" for political leaders.
Yussur Abrar, who was appointed governor in the wake of the scandal, only stayed in her job for a few weeks, alleging there were corrupt practices at the bank.
The latest embarrassment comes ahead of polls in Somalia, with the president due to be elected by MPs in October.
The UN-backed government is still battling al-Qaeda-affiliated militants to regain control of the whole country.
