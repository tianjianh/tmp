[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of the 44-year-old was discovered at a flat in Rhyl on 8 January, two days after he was last seen.
A 46-year-old man is being held on suspicion of murder, and a woman, 41, on suspicion of assisting an offender. Both are from the Rhyl area.
The arrests follow an emotional appeal for help from family members on Friday.
They told a press conference the death was "a nightmare we can't wake up from".
Mr Hill was found in his West Parade home with significant head, upper and lower body injuries.
Police are continuing to appeal for anyone with information about his death, or who saw him in the days before he was killed, to contact them.
T/Supt Mark Chesters, who is leading the investigation, said: "I am certain the key to this investigation lies within the local community and I continue to appeal to anybody who may have information that could assist our investigation to come forward."
