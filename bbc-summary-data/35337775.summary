Jamie Johnstone was found injured outside a flat in Balbeggie Street, Sandyhills, at about 18:00 on Saturday.
He was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he later died.
Police Scotland said they were gathering CCTV footage from the area and door-to-door inquiries were under way.
A force spokesman said early investigations indicated that several people were at the location at the time of the incident, entering and exiting the high rise flats.
Det Insp Mark Bell, of the major investigation team, said: "We are in the process of piecing together what has happened to this young man.
"Given his injuries we know he has been attacked, but at this stage we don't know why.
"I am appealing to people who live in the area, particularly the high rise flats, to contact us with any information they may have.
"It's possible someone heard or saw a disturbance and the information could prove vital in assisting our inquiries in tracing whoever is responsible for this young man's death."
