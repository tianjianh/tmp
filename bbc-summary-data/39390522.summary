[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 0-1 North Ferriby United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green's automatic National League promotion hopes were dealt another blow as they were beaten by strugglers North Ferriby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jake Gosling was denied from close range by North Ferriby goalkeeper Owen Evans early on in a sign of things to come for the hosts who were beaten last time out by promotion rivals Lincoln.
Christian Doidge was then inches away from opening the scoring before Fabien Robert hit the woodwork with a 25-yard shot in the closing stages of the first half.
The chances continued to come and go for Forest Green and they paid the ultimate price as Reece Thompson finished at the back post to help North Ferriby off the bottom and revive their slim survival chances.
Forest Green sit third and now trail leaders Lincoln and second-placed Tranmere by four points, having played more games than both of their rivals.
