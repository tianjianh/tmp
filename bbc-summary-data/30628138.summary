Blackpool's on-loan midfielder Jacob Murphy has apologised for posting an image on social media that appeared to mock the team's on-field struggles.

The 19-year-old uploaded an image of himself with team-mate Donervon Daniels and the caption "We are going to lose... Again" before their game at Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day.
The game ended 1-0 to Wednesday.
"It was totally unprofessional of me and a foolish thing to do," Murphy said in a statement on the club's website.
"I'd like to offer my sincerest apologies to the manager, my team-mates, the fans and everybody at Blackpool Football Club for the hurt and embarrassment that a recent photo message I sent has caused.
"I have loved my time at Blackpool so far, and I've been really grateful for the support I've received."
Blackpool are bottom of the table with 14 points from 24 games, nine points from safety. Their next match is an FA Cup third round tie at Premier League side Aston Villa on Sunday.
"I know I have let the manager and fans down badly but I aim to repay them by working even harder and helping the team climb up the league table," Murphy added.
"I'd also like to make clear that Donervon Daniels had no part in this and I apologise for implicating him."
Blackpool manager Lee Clark said: "I'm extremely disappointed because I expect nothing but total professionalism from my players.
"We will now investigate this matter internally before deciding upon an outcome."
Murphy has made nine appearances for Blackpool, scoring two goals, since joining them on loan from Norwich in November.
The incident comes a week after Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston apologised for abusive texts he sent to a supporter.
Oyston admitted sending the "unacceptable" texts in response to "a barrage of abuse" he received after his mobile number was placed on a social media website.
