About 2,400 homes across Aberdeen are without power, SSE has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Homes in the Kingswells, Hazlehead, Airyhall and Pitfodels areas of Aberdeen lost electricity on Sunday afternoon.
SSE said it was investigating links to a lightning storm over Aberdeen after some customers reported hearing a "loud bang" before losing power.
Engineers are on site and the company hopes to restore power later on Sunday evening.
