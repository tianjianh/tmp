Annan Athletic members back community ownership move

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of Scottish League Two side Annan Athletic have voted in favour of plans to transfer the club to full community ownership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club said that 74% of its members had supported the move to become a Community Benefit Society (CBS), following consultation.
It is currently run as an "unincorporated members' club".
Annan said the new structure would safeguard the club and protect its assets.
A statement on its website said: "Annan Athletic will now proceed with the legal process to formalise the conversion to a CBS and thereby becoming a true 100% fan-owned club, democratically managed by its fan shareholders, operating a one-member-one-vote system, providing limited liability for the owners and giving greater protection of the club's assets.
"Annan Athletic have long been part of the community and this latest restructure will see the club further develop their links in aspects of the communities of Annan and the surrounding area with the aim of 'inspiring active lives for all'.
"Further announcements about how supporters and the community can join the club on this journey will be made shortly."
