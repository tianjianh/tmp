The man was taken to hospital after being pulled from rubble at the property in Cavell Walk, Stevenage.
Emergency services were called to the house at about 21:20 GMT on Thursday following reports of an explosion.
An investigation is now under way to establish what caused the fire, a police spokesman said.
"A possible gas leak is a current line of inquiry," said the spokesman.
Members of the public are advised to avoid the area.
A spokesman for Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue said: "The first fire pump arrived within five minutes of the call.
"Crews were faced with a serious fire affecting the first and second floor of a semi-detached domestic property, which had also been severely damaged by an explosion."
