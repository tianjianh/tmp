Ryan Giggs 'open' to future Man Utd or Wales management roles

Ryan Giggs says managing Manchester United or Wales would be the "pinnacle" of any future career as a manager.

The Old Trafford and Wales legend would also consider managing a Championship club provided it matches his "ambitions and vision".
"Managing your national team is the pinnacle or the club that you played for. For me Manchester United - that's the pinnacle," he said.
"Whether it happens or not, I don't know, but you'd always be open to it."
The 42-year-old former winger has been on what he called a sabbatical since ending a 29-year association with United in June following the appointment of Jose Mourinho as manager.
He had been interim manager at Old Trafford and was assistant to Louis van Gaal before Mourinho replaced the Dutchman.
Giggs added: "As a player I was a winner and I want to be the same as a manager, whether it be dropping down to the Championship, whether it be in the Premier League - I've got no preference," he told BBC Wales.
"It has to be the right club and have the same ambitions and visions as I do."
He was recently linked with the Swansea City job that American Bob Bradley has filled following Francesco Guidolin's sacking, but said "a few things" prevented him taking over at Liberty Stadium.
Under current manager Chris Coleman, Wales reached their first major championships since 1958 and progressed to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
Coleman signed a fresh deal with the Football Association of Wales in May this year and has said he will move on when their 2018 World Cup campaign concludes.
Giggs believes Coleman could still conceivably stay longer: "That could change [his mind]. He could stay on, we never know.
"Whoever takes over if Chris decides to leave after two years will be inheriting a team that has been the most successful in Wales for the last 50 years."
