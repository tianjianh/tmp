Natasha Probert, 25, had only walked the horse a few yards during a riding lesson at Allt-yr-yn when she fell.
The Newport inquest heard she fractured her skull and suffered a serious brain injury. She was taken to hospital but died the following day.
The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death.
Ms Probert had left her 15-month-old daughter Amelia in the care of stable staff while she took the riding lesson, the inquest heard.
Her cousin Lewis Richards told the inquest he was walking behind Ms Probert as she rode the Welsh cob, named Daisy, slowly up the driveway of the livery yard.
Mr Richards said: "A Land Rover was coming down the drive and Natasha turned the horse onto the grass to let it pass before carrying on up the drive.
"She turned the horse round with a sudden twitch and just slipped off the side of it and I could see blood coming from her nose."
Ms Probert, who was wearing a helmet at the time, had taken horse lessons when she was younger but had only ridden Daisy a few times before she was killed.
Senior Gwent coroner David Bowen said she suffered "a traumatic brain injury".
