Darren Gordon's body was discovered by a dog walker in the woods around Hesslewood Hall, Ferriby Road, Hessle, on Thursday.
Police said Mr Gordon was "identified as a suspect" for the murder of David Rylands, who was stabbed on a footbridge in Hull on Wednesday.
The force added Mr Gordon's death was "not being treated as suspicious".
Det Ch Insp Matt Baldwin who is leading the murder investigation said: "Enquiries into David Rylands' murder and the circumstances leading up to it are continuing, however, Darren Gordon was a significant interest to the case.
"It is clear from the investigation to date that one man was responsible for the stabbing of Mr Rylands, which ultimately led to his death at Hull Royal Infirmary a short time later.
"Forensic work is ongoing in relation to the scene at Selby Street footbridge and the woodland at Hesslewood Hall to obtain further clarity around Darren Gordon's involvement in David Rylands' murder."
