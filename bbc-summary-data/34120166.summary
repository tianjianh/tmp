Care staff did not use hoist to move Iris Teale, inquest hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Care staff did not follow procedure when moving residents at a West Midlands care home, an inquest into the death of a 91-year-old woman has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iris Teale died in hospital 16 days after suffering a fractured thigh bone at Aston Court Nursing Home in 2011.
Three care assistants told a coroner they did not use a hoist to lift her in or out of bed. One said she was aware of other carers mishandling residents.
The leg break "accelerated" Mrs Teale's death, the inquest heard.
Nurse Santhosh Rajan was found not guilty of her manslaughter earlier this year.
He told the hearing he had nothing to do with her injury and denied dropping her and doctoring paperwork from his rounds.
He said when he last checked on Mrs Teale during his night shift she was "fast asleep" and he did not move her.
Former care assistants Kerry Pemberton, of Walsall, and Rachel Foulger, of Little Aston, and current employee Rizwana Kosar, of Walsall, admitted handling Mrs Teale incorrectly at the inquest.
But they all said Mrs Teale, who had heart disease, chronic renal failure and dementia, was fine when they last had contact with her.
Mrs Pemberton told the inquest that she did not use a hoist to move her the day before she was admitted to hospital on 7 October.
She said it was something that happened quite often at the Bupa-run home near Sutton Coldfield but that she did not alert management.
Mrs Teale's family barrister, John Coughlan, asked Mrs Foulger: "There was a culture of manual handling otherwise than in accordance with the care plan, wasn't there?"
She told the hearing at Cannock Coroner's Court that it did happen "quite frequently".
Pathologist Alexander Kolar said Mrs Teale had a 16cm spiral fracture of her left thigh with significant bruising over a 60cm area of her leg.
He said it occurred about 14-21 days before her death.
With her underlying poor health, Dr Kolar said the break was "a significant event, resulting in multiple consequences, essentially acting as a tipping point to her pre-existing conditions".
The hearing continues.
