Kirkby Misperton fracking: Objections to be investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation has been launched into how objections to plans to frack for shale gas in North Yorkshire were sent "unbeknown" to the persons named.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The responses were part of a consultation into Third Energy's application to frack at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in Ryedale.
North Yorkshire County Council said: "The scale of the concern is unknown at this point".
The matter would be referred to the police if needed, it added.
The council is in the "process of verifying the identification of people and organisations that have made representations" about the shale gas application at the KM8 well site.
It had raised concerns "some 'en masse' representations from objectors have included emails and letters unbeknown to the owner of the email address or the named person on the letter and that personal data may have been used without consent".
A council paper said the irregularities were discovered because each consultation response was acknowledged by the council.
The consultation into plans to extract shale gas on land near Kirby Misperton ended on Wednesday.
The council had received 2,465 letters or e-mails by 8 October.
The next meeting of the planning and regulatory functions committee is on 20 October.
