The victors claimed a trio of scores, before Conal Doherty Cunning and Donal McKernan landed points to ensure a 0-10 to 0-3 scoreline after 18 minutes.
Nine points separated the teams in the 23rd minute after Keelan Molloy pointed for Antrim, but the Saffrons were not to score again until the 13th minute of the second half.
The Ulster champions trailed by 1-14 to 0-4 at half-time, with Salmon netting Galway's goal in the final minute of first-half normal time.
Both sides had equal share of possession inside 10 minutes of the restart, but crucially Galway added two points, as Antrim fired three wides.

Antrim pushed hard for goals, with Galway goalkeeper Jack Forde denying both Donal McKernan and Peter McCallion.
At the opposite end Niland cut through for Galway's second goal to ensure a 2-19 to 0-5 lead with six minutes remaining.
Doherty Cunning registered three of the next four points, but it was far too late for Antrim, as late scores from Jack Coyne and Martin McManus ensued a 20-point Galway win.
