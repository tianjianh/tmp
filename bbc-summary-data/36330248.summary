The blaze, which started in a nearby shed, destroyed the roof of the Catholic Church of St Thomas More, in Hartley Wintney, on Tuesday evening.
People rushed to help firefighters carry the heavy wooden pews and bookcases out of the building.
Parish priest Father Simon Thomson said the local Anglican priest has offered to host the congregation in his church while repairs are made.
Alan Fitton was driving past and stopped to help with the salvage operation.
He said: "There were a lot of village people watching, and they came in to lend a hand, taking out everything that could be salvaged."
Father Thomson said he was "optimistic" about the church's future, despite the damage.
"As a priest you deal with all types of things, I was just thinking of the suicides and the abuse situations I've dealt with," he said.
"This is a building - we can replace it, and all will be well. That's what we have insurance for."
Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire started in a shed at the rear of the church which spread, engulfing the church roof.
