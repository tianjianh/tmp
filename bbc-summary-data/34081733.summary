A single malt distillery is set to return to Edinburgh - the first in 90 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Robertson, former master distiller for The Macallan, plans to open the Holyrood Park Distillery.
If plans are approved, the Â£2m distillery will be housed in the Engine Shed building and will be open to visitors.
Glen Sciennes was the last single malt whisky distillery to operate in Edinburgh before its closure in 1925.
Edinburgh councillors have agreed to lease the Engine Shed building to the company.
The proposals are now subject to planning approval.
Mr Robertson said: "We are very excited by the prospect of resurrecting the proud tradition of distilling single malt whisky in Edinburgh.
"We hope to be able to create an immersive and entertaining visitor experience, supporting the local economy through jobs and training opportunities while reinforcing the capital's position as a world-class tourism destination.
"Most importantly, our goal is to create beautiful, hand-crafted single malt whiskies which will stand shoulder to shoulder with the other great single malts that are now being produced in Scotland and elsewhere."
The business aims to start distilling whisky by next summer and release a single malt whisky within four years.
It would initially employ up to 25 staff at varying levels, from trainees up to experienced distillery operators, tourism and production managers.
Former railway building the Engine Shed operated until recently as a cafe and bakery employing adults with learning difficulties.
