Great Britain's women can reinvigorate hockey at home if they emulate the 1988 men's side by winning Olympic gold, captain Kate Richardson-Walsh believes.

Her team face the Netherlands in Friday's final looking to follow Sean Kerly's side, the champions in Seoul.
"You saw what happened to hockey in the country after that - it really picked up," said Richardson-Walsh, part of a team who won bronze at London 2012.
"It picked up after London too, and hopefully the same will happen again."
Britain's women are chasing their first gold, 28 years after the men beat West Germany 3-1 to win their second and most recent Olympic title, with two goals from Imran Sherwani and one from Kerly.
"I remember my parents getting up to watch the 1988 final, but I was only eight - I was a little too young," Richardson-Walsh said.
Friday's final, which starts at 21:00 BST, will be the 36-year-old's final game after playing 374 times for Great Britain and England.
She will also be playing alongside partner Helen - the pair married in 2013.
"It will be really special to be in a final with her," said the captain.
"We have been through ups and downs - some of the best and worst times over the last few years.
"For Helen to come back from back surgery twice, to get over that and play again and reach an Olympic final, it's great."
