Nama deal: McGuinness denies claim he knew of failed Pimco bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The deputy first minister has disputed being "briefed and engaged" with a failed bid by US investment firm Pimco to buy Northern Ireland property loans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin McGuinness has taken issue with former Finance Minister Simon Hamilton.
According to documents, Mr Hamilton told the Republic of Ireland's National Assets Management Agency (Nama) that Mr McGuinness was across the proposal.
Pimco made an unsolicited offer for Nama's Northern Ireland loan portfolio in late 2013.
Minutes of two telephone calls between Nama chairman Frank Daly and Mr Hamilton have been released by Nama.
In December 2013, Mr Hamilton is said to have "confirmed the deputy first minister was aware of the interest with updates provided by the first minister".
In January 2014, Mr Hamilton, according to the Nama minutes, told Mr Daly the first and deputy first ministers were "fully engaged" with the bid.
A Sinn FÃ©in spokesperson said: "Mr McGuinness refutes any claim he was fully briefed and engaged with the proposed saleâ€¦ as suggested by the former Minister Hamilton."
It is not the first time Mr McGuinness has contested claims by the Democratic Unionist Party about his knowledge of events in the run-up to the Nama loan sale.
He said he did not know of a memorandum of understanding agreement with Pimco sent by the first minister's office to Nama.
He has also said he was unaware of meetings Peter Robinson had with Pimco and Cerberus Capital Management, the eventual buyer of the Â£1.3bn portfolio.
