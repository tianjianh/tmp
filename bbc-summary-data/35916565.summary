Oxford United are still on course to reach their points target to win promotion from League Two, says midfielder Liam Sercombe.

The U's have recorded consecutive draws in the league after a goalless stalemate against Cambridge on Monday.
Oxford remain second in the table but could be leapfrogged should Plymouth or Accrington win their games in hand.
"We have a target set for us point-wise and we are still on course for that," Sercombe, 25, told BBC Radio Oxford.
"The manager (Michael Appleton) is always on about getting a quick start but the intensity wasn't there [against Cambridge].
"We keep our focus and, once we hit that target, we are confident that will be enough."
Oxford's management staff have established the mystery points target by utilising points tallies from the past 10 seasons.
Appleton's side, who are unbeaten in their last four matches, now turn their focus to Wembley for the Football League Trophy final against Barnsley on Sunday.
"Everybody in that changing room is desperate for promotion and it's a lot bigger than the one day at Wembley," added Sercombe.
"It's going to be special and a good day for family and friends, but promotion is what we are aiming for."
