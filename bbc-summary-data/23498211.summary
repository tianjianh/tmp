Snowdonia businesses: Tourism message 'is getting lost'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are too many bodies trying to promote the tourism industry in Wales leading to unnecessary duplication, tourist businesses have warned.

They say there are "too many people" promoting Wales, including the Welsh government's Visit Wales, councils, tourism groups and heritage body Cadw.
The businesses in Snowdonia say this means they are "losing their message to potential customers".
The Welsh government has agreed to the businesses' request for a meeting.
Attractions of Snowdonia works with about 30 tourism operators to promote attractions in the area,
Its chair, Jonathan Williams-Ellis, said: "There are too many people - all with their fingers on the buttons.... we're losing our message to potential customers.
"We're unhappy with the way the tourism industry is being governed or being looked after by the [Welsh] government at the moment.
"We're always working with different people and we don't seem to have a single message.
"We see duplication of work, different ideas, different PR [public relations] organisations working and something's got to happen.
"It's not good."
The Welsh government has set a target to increase earnings from tourism by 10% or more by 2020.
However, there are also concerns in north Wales that there has not been sufficient consultation.
Chris Chance, secretary-manager at Conwy Golf Club, said: "We weren't asked for any feedback.
"If you're going to consult then you need to consult the actual attractions, not just the bodies they report to."
Attractions of Snowdonia also thinks marketing should be improved at Liverpool and Manchester airports to attract visitors to Wales.
The businesses have written to Economy Minister Edwina Hart calling for a meeting, which the Welsh government says will be arranged in the near future.
