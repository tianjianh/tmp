Hossain, 29, and his wife have been missing for more than two weeks after allegations they abused and tortured an 11-year-old housemaid, who was found on the street in Dhaka on 6 September.
Police have been criticised for failing to find the pair.
Nazrul Islam, the investigation's senior officer, told the BBC's Bengali Service they were "serious about it".
He added: "We have conducted raids in Shahadat's father's house, and his in-laws' house.
"It doesn't matter if he's a national cricketer or not - he's an accused before the eyes of the law. We will track him down and put him before the court."
Authorities have come under scrutiny for their failure to find Hossain in the 17 days since he disappeared.
Mozammel Haq - who found Hossain's maid and is now the plaintiff in the case - is among those to have expressed their frustration.
"I found the girl in a street near my house - she was severely injured," Mr Haq told the BBC's Bengali Service.
"She alleged that she had been tortured by Shahadat Hossain.
"I took her to the police station and filed a case. It is very frustrating that he has not been arrested."
Hossain has been suspended from all cricket by the Bangladesh Cricket Board while the allegations are investigated.
Hossain is a medium-fast bowler who is arguably Bangladesh's most famous player. He has played for the Tigers since 2005.
He has taken 70 wickets in 36 Tests and 47 wickets in 51 one-day internationals, with best figures of 6-27. Domestically, he plays for Dhaka Division.
Hossain last played for Bangladesh in a Test match against Pakistan in May, when he twisted his right knee and was ruled out action for six months.
He was the first Bangladesh player to have his name added to the Lord's honours board when he took 5-98 against England in May 2010.
