Paul Hurst: Shrewsbury Town boss urges squad to have more fun

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town manager Paul Hurst has urged his squad to have more fun and lighten up, in a bid to help their League One relegation battle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Grimsby boss Hurst was appointed on 24 October, with the Shropshire club at the bottom of the table.
After beating Oxford, losses to Sheffield United and Fleetwood plus a 0-0 draw at home to Port Vale have seen Hurst's side return to bottom spot.
"Sometimes you need a bit of a joker," he told BBC Radio Shropshire.
"I'm a believer you can have fun while working hard still. They're a quiet group. I don't know if they feel they're still getting to know me, but I want a bit more from them.
"Characters - that's what you sometimes need. I don't want them to feel down."
Shrewsbury host fellow third-tier side Fleetwood in the FA Cup second round on Saturday.
