Nathaniel Knight-Percival opened the scoring with a brilliant overhead kick and it was 2-0 when Shaun Whalley took advantage of poor defending to score.
Andy Mangan blasted in a loose ball for a third goal after 29 minutes.
However, Tom Aldred drove in from 15 yards before Danny Philliskirk fired into the bottom corner, but goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler ensured it stayed 3-2.
Leutwiler tipped Brad Potts' shot onto the bar to keep the points and move Shrewsbury up to 19th, level on points with Blackpool in 18th.
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Shropshire:
"It's a great result and terrific performance and we have to be very pleased with the victory today.
"When we lost that second goal from a set-play it did give Blackpool a sense of belief - but we have a number of different qualities to win football matches and that was proven today."
