[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greg Moffat, 22, had previously been found guilty of carrying out the attack on his 23-year-old victim at a flat in Airdrie.
The rape took place in the early hours of 16 March last year.
The victim was part of a group who had gone back to the flat following a night out at a local club. She went to sleep, but was awoken by Moffat raping her.
Moffat, from Airdrie, later said "sorry" to the woman.
After being arrested, he insisted he and his victim were involved in a consensual sex act rather than full intercourse.
However, giving evidence, the woman told the court she wanted her attacker to "tell the truth".
She said: "I don't know why he is just not admitting it. I cannot believe why he would say that. I don't know why this happened."
The court was also told that the rape had shattered the woman's life.
The jury later found Moffat guilty of rape.
