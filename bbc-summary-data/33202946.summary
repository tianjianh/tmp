[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nerijus Gudelevicius, 34, of Westlea, Swindon, enticed fellow Lithuanians to the UK and made them work long hours collecting charity clothing bags.
Police said he confiscated their passports, housed them in substandard conditions and paid them a pittance.
Gudelevicius was convicted of two charges of trafficking and jailed for two years at Salisbury Crown Court.
Judge Tim Mousley QC told Gudelevicius he made two people's lives "a compete misery" and "exploited them by deceiving them".
"They took your promises at face value. You exploited their ambition by a cruel but carefully planned deception," he said.
Det Supt Tom Straker from Wiltshire Police said the force was "extremely pleased" with the sentence, which "sends a clear message to those criminals who trade in human lives".
"Wiltshire Police will always treat human trafficking as a priority and vigorously investigate such incidents, along with our partners," he added.
