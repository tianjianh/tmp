The aircraft, which belong to the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) were due to leave RAF Coningsby at 13:13 BST.
The planes had been expected to fly over Spalding, Gressenhall, Harleston, Blickling Hall and East Kirkby.
Mark Discombe, a BBMF pilot, said it was a "disappointing decision" to have to make.
The aircraft have taken part in a number of events over the summer to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.
Andrew Panton, of the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre in East Kirkby, said the cancellation was a "great shame" but understandable.
He said: "Vintage aircraft are dependent on weather, they can't fly in rain or low cloud.
"The majority of spectators do understand that."
The decision to stop the flights was taken on Monday morning.
Mr Discombe tweeted: "Unfortunately, I've had to take the disappointing decision to cancel today's Spitfire & Hurricane sortie around East Anglia (bad weather)."
