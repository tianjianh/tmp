[SN]TITLE[SN]
Raith Rovers 1-4 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk secured their first win in five matches after coming from behind to defeat promotion rivals Raith Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Johnson had the home side in front early on but Miles Hippolyte, Bob McHugh and Craig Sibbald all struck for the Bairns before the break.
Sibbald notched his second shortly after the restart.
Defeat means Raith are without a win in their last eight games and are now five points off fourth-placed Falkirk, who trail Morton by a point.
Ryan Stevenson made his starting debut for Rovers and his presence up front had an immediate impact. The former Hearts striker played in Johnson, and although Falkirk goalkeeper Danny Rogers got a hand to the shot he could not keep it out.
Stevenson's involvement was short-lived as he had to be replaced after a clash with the Bairns keeper. His loss appeared to rattle the hosts and Falkirk capitalised with a stunning equaliser.
Hippolyte was almost 30 yards out but his curling free-kick ended up in the top corner of Kevin Cuthbert's goal.
McHugh then turned the home defence and slid the ball home from the edge of the box.
Rogers made a magnificent one-handed stop to deny Kyle Benedictus an equaliser and it proved to be a huge turning point, with the visitors extending their advantage within seconds.
Sibbald turned well around 20 yards from goal and his shot took a slight deflection on its way in.
And Sibbald again with a strike off the legs of a home defender wrong-footed Cuthbert to stretch Falkirk's lead.
