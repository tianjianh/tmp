The 27-year-old outpointed Klitschko to win the WBA, IBF and WBO titles last November and will face the Ukrainian again at the Manchester Arena.
He posted on Twitter: "I set off today for what promises to be a very hard eight weeks' training camp.
"This will be my best fight, then I'll retire 100%."
In a recent pre-fight news conference Fury, unbeaten in 25 professional fights, said: "I could beat Wladimir if I was 30st and fat as a pig. I don't need to turn up in shape."
Turning to 40-year-old Klitschko, he said: "Shame on you, you let a fat man beat you."
And on Sunday the Manchester-born fighter, who told BBC Radio 5 live in February that he was considering retirement, posted a picture of his family and wrote that he was missing them.
"This is the reason I'm retiring after my next fight, to spend the my time with these guys," Fury said.
