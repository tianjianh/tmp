Ren took the lead after the third of five dives and a superb inward three-and-a-half somersault with her fourth virtually clinched the title.
China's Si Yajie took the silver, while Canada's Meaghan Benfeito won bronze.
Couch, competing in her third Olympics, ended with a fine reverse two-and-a-half somersault but finished in 12th.
"The last few days I haven't dived my best, I've been a bit flat," the 27-year-old from Plymouth told the BBC.
"But I have made the final here, and that was goal."
