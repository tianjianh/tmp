The button was pushed by eight-year-old Ted McAffrey from Stockton Heath, near Warrington, Cheshire who had raised Â£80,000 for Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool with a fund-raising campaign called Team Ted.
The youngster devised a campaign where people would text a photo of their favourite teddy bear while recuperating from six hour emergency open heart surgery three years ago.
