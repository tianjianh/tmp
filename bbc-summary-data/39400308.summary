Massaro, 33, won the final in Hull 11-8 11-8 6-11 11-6 to reclaim the title she first won in 2013.
"It's just unbelievable," said the fifth seed, a former world champion and world number one.
There was no English double as Nick Matthew lost the men's final 8-11 11-7 11-3 11-3 to France's Gregory Gaultier.
At 36, Matthew was the oldest finalist since Pakistan's Hashim Khan in the 1950s, but he missed out on a fourth British Open title.
Third seed Gaultier, 34, claimed his third victory in the tournament and ensured he will return to the top of the world rankings.
"A year ago I lost in the second round here and my body was just giving in on me," said Matthew.
"This year, I feel like I'm in there every tournament and I genuinely think I've got a few more of these in me.
"Hopefully me and Greg are showing everyone that we're not going away yet. We're loving that rivalry and long may it continue."
History had already been made with two English women in the final for the first time since 1991, but the experience of Massaro told in her fourth final in five years.
It is the first time since Janet Morgan won the second of 10 consecutive titles in 1951 that an English woman has added to a first British Open title.
Perry, 26, was playing her first World Series final and, despite fighting back in game three, could not deny Massaro.
"As much as you tell yourself there isn't an awful amount of pressure on you, it's a British Open final; it doesn't matter who you are playing, you want to win it," Massaro told the PSA World Tour.
"I definitely didn't feel settled on there that's partly due to SJ and how well she's been playing and what she does with the ball, but also just some nervous energy for the final.
"Just happy I managed to tough it out in the end and keep getting balls back and it paid off. It's a little bit different because the first one was so special."
