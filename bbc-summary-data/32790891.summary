Australian inquiry told of abuse at Nauru migrant camp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Australian Senate inquiry has heard allegations of sexual assault and squalid conditions at the offshore migrant detention centre in Nauru.

A Senate committee has begun its first public hearing into the allegations after an independent report found Nauru detainees were being abused.
Australia sends all would-be asylum seekers arriving by boat to Nauru and Papua New Guinea for processing.
The Senate committee will reveal its finding by mid-June.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the government was doing everything it could to help conditions in centres on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.
However, Australia has been widely criticised by rights groups for its immigration policies of resettling asylum seekers elsewhere.
A number of submissions to the committee from asylum seekers spoke of women not being able to sleep at night because of rats running through tents, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
One of the submissions from a doctor who recently visited the Pacific island nation also reports an allegation of rape against a woman.
"She told me that since the rape, one guard had offered her extra shower time in return for sexual favours," Dr David Isaacs wrote in his submission.
Another submission from the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre said one boy began self-harming and talking about suicide. His mother believed he had been sexually assaulted, the submission said.
Australia asylum: Why is it controversial?
On Tuesday, the first witnesses in the public hearing were from Transfield Services, the firm managing the facility on Nauru.
But many questions from senators on specific allegations and operations were taken "on notice" by managers - to be answered later.
Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked for information relating to the sexual assault of a young boy in 2013, according to ABC News.
"Very happy to take that question on notice... and provide you the detailed timeline and reporting chain of that particular incident or allegation," said Derek Osborne, Transfield's executive general manager of logistics and facilities management.
Labor's Alex Gallacher, who chairs the committee, asked whether male guards were allowed in the areas where women and children were showering.
"No - not as far as I'm aware," Mr Osborne said, adding that Transfield had subcontracted out security services to another company called Wilson Security.
