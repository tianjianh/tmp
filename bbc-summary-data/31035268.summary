[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara broke the world record for the most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in one-day internationals on Thursday.

Sangakkara, 37, reached 473 dismissals - 377 catches and 96 stumpings - when he caught Corey Anderson off the bowling of Shaminda Eranga in a 34-run win over New Zealand in Wellington.
He has played in 397 ODIs since his debut against Pakistan in July 2000.
Retired Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist had held the record.
Sangakkara had earlier scored an unbeaten 113 from 105 balls in Sri Lanka's total of 287-6, before they bowled New Zealand out for 253 with just under five overs to spare.
Despite Sri Lanka triumphing in the seventh and final ODI of the series, New Zealand won the series 4-2.
