They were launched on Thursday morning local time (Wednesday evening GMT) from the city of Wonsan on North Korea's east coast, according to a statement from the joint chiefs of staff, carried by Yonhap news agency.
The statement described them as "a salvo of apparent ballistic missiles".
Under Kim Jong-un, there have been increasingly frequent North Korean tests, all of which defy UN sanctions.
South Korea's military said the missiles flew about 200 kilometres (125 miles).
