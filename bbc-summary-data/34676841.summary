The 18-year-old centre-back came through the youth system at Stoke City and impressed during a trial with the Latics.
The contract also includes the option of an extra year that Oldham can take up after this season.
"He is really athletic, only 18 and definitely one for the future," boss David Dunn told the club website.
"He has a lot of very good attributes and we spoke to Mark Bowen at Stoke City about him so we have decided he is a good young signing for us."
