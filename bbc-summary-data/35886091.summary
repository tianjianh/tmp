'Failure' assessing cellmate risk to murdered Darren Thomas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prison authorities in Cardiff failed to properly assess the risk posed by a prisoner who went on to murder his cellmate, a report has found.

Colin Capp, 23, was jailed for life for Darren Thomas's murder in March 2015 - a month after nursing staff referred Capp for a mental health assessment due to suicide and self-harm risk.
An ombudsman found the assessment was not done, despite an appointment.
A Prison Service spokeswoman said lessons would be learned.
"We take our duty to keep prisoners, staff and others safe extremely seriously and we will make sure we learn lessons from the PPO's [Prisons and Probation Ombudsman] recommendations," she added.
"The prime minister has also announced an overhaul of how mental health is treated in prisons, giving governors a much greater say over what services their prisoners need and how the available budget is used."
A spokesman from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said watchdog Healthcare Inspectorate Wales had advised on improvements, which it would take on board.
Capp had returned to prison at the beginning of February to serve the remainder of a 32-month sentence for arson with intent, after his mental condition deteriorated following his release from Parc Prison in Bridgend on licence.
Two previous cellmates at Cardiff had asked to be moved because of Capp's "paranoid behaviour."
The ombudsman, Nigel Newcomen, said this should have triggered a review of whether he should continue sharing a cell.
But the report added despite "frailties" they found in the prison's risk assessment procedures, it would have been "very difficult" for prison staff to have predicted or prevented Mr Thomas' murder.
Mr Thomas's brother, Jeremy Thomas, said: "If you look at the history, there were trigger points all along and that's upsetting, the fact it could have been prevented.
"That guy was a ticking bomb and it should have been picked up."
Mr Thomas's death was the only homicide at Cardiff Prison since the ombudsman began investigating prisoner deaths in 2004.
It recommended the prison should review prisoners' risk for sharing if their behaviour changes, and ensure prompt mental health assessments for anyone at risk of suicide and self-harm.
