Guardiola said he had been "comfortable" at Bayern Munich, but wanted another test in his career.
The Spaniard, 45, also admitted he had "absolutely everything" at Barcelona.
When asked if he could play beautiful football in the tiki-taka style made famous at Barcelona, Guardiola said: "That's why I'm here."
Speaking to the English press for the first time since taking over at City, he added: "I never played on a Boxing Day. I have never been to a stadium where it is windy and freezing and the pitch is not good.
"It's a target for me. I'm here to prove myself and prove I can play [the same way]."
Guardiola, who referenced Sunderland manager "Big Sam" Allardyce as one of the contrasts of the English game to football in Spain and Germany, said what he wants from his players is "simple".
"When we have the ball, we want them to move it as quick as possible and create as many chances as possible," added the former Barcelona player, who denied this will be his toughest managerial test yet.
"I am just focusing on my players and what they have to do on the pitch, which is why I decided to come here.
"In the Champions League with Barcelona and Bayern Munich we came to England a lot and we always thought 'wow'. It's a target for me and a personal ambition of mine to prove myself here."
Guardiola, who began his managerial career with Barcelona B, said he is impressed with City's facilities and is keen to work with the club's young players.
However, he has told the senior squad at the Etihad he is "counting on them all" - including captain Vincent Kompany and former Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure.
"I love to work with young players," he added. "Having worked here one week, I'm really impressed with their quality.
"My dream for Kompany is for him to be fit. He's a magnificent defender, but when I spoke to him I said just focus on your body.
"We're going to try and be more consistent in our game. Maybe we're not going to win every day. But we are going to try."
City start their Premier League campaign at home to Sunderland on 13 August.
