She began an interview on ITV's This Morning with her son Paul covered by a blanket while he breastfed.
Host Holly Willoughby said: "She's only just got her opportunity to feed baby Paul - when it happens, it has to happen."
The National Childbirth Trust said it was delighted to see viewers had reacted positively.
Host Phillip Schofield told viewers: "We've got to point out now - in case you think we're saying 'cover the baby up', this is Sam's choice. It is your choice to do this."
"Yes, of course," said the former The Only Way is Essex star. "I'm so sorry about this."
He replied: "We're perfectly comfortable."
Many viewers took to Twitter to praise the TV star for "normalising breastfeeding".
NCT senior policy adviser Elizabeth Duff said: "We are delighted to see so many positive reactions to Sam breastfeeding her baby son live on air.
"Babies need to be fed whenever and wherever they are hungry, so whichever mode of feeding is chosen, parents should never be embarrassed or discouraged from doing so.
"Great TV moment!"
Justine Roberts, CEO of parenting site Mumsnet, said: "Breastfeeding is a normal part of life: babies need to be fed when they're hungry, and they're not particularly bothered about who's watching.
"It's encouraging to see that the TV viewers weren't particularly bothered either."
Anna Burbidge, from breastfeeding support group, La Leche League, said: "It is to be hoped that when women like Sam show breastfeeding is a natural part of life and not something to be hidden away, the more easily it will be accepted, leading to a change in people's attitudes and a reduction in any criticism."
The Royal College of Midwives said that women "should never be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public".
