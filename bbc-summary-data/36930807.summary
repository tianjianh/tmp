[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead got their National League campaign off to the perfect start, recording a 3-0 victory over Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were chances for both teams in an open but scoreless first half but the hosts flew out of the blocks after the break.
They almost took the lead in the 55th minute when James Bolton headed narrowly wide, before finally breaking the deadlock seven minutes later.
Wes York's effort hit the goalkeeper and ended up in the back of Chester's net and he then doubled their advantage in the 82nd minute, firing in after good work from substitute Ryan Bowman.
The home side, beaten 4-2 at Chester on the final day of last season, added a third five minutes later when Manny Smith nodded in from close range.
