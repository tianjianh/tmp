Week ahead in the European Parliament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MEPs have a pretty busy schedule for their final plenary sitting of the year this week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Wednesday, they will debate this week's EU summit, when leaders are due to discuss migration and co-operation on security and defence.
Theresa May will once again be asked to leave the room at dinnertime, as the 27 EU chiefs discuss their Brexit strategy for after the UK triggers Article 50.
Alongside the usual tying-up of legislative loose ends and debates on annual reports, they will vote on weighty transport legislation relating to railways and ports.
The approval of new powers to suspend visa waivers on Thursday could lay the ground for deals on EU visa-free travel deals for Georgia and Ukraine.
And MEPs will present their annual human rights prize to Yazidi rights activists Nadia Murad Basee and Lamiya Aji Bashar.
Here's a rundown of the week aheadâ€¦
The sitting will open with a debate on new EU rules for the awarding of domestic rail contracts.
The proposals would bring in mandatory competitive tendering for public service contracts - making up the biggest share of passenger services - from 2023.
Directly awarding contracts would require complying with stricter performance criteria on punctuality and customer satisfaction.
MEPs reached a deal on the legislation with EU states in April, which will be put to a final vote on Wednesday.
They will also debate proposals to increase market access in certain port services, including refuelling, berthing and towing operations and waste collection.
Plans to open up competition in the maintenance of port access paths, known as dredging, were dropped during negotiations after opposition from MEPs.
Measures to increase competition in other areas, including cargo handling, were not included in the Commission's plans after years of previous opposition.
A compromise agreement with EU ministers will also be put to a final vote on Wednesday.
After this they will discuss plans to ban the use of fishing nets below 800m in the north-east Atlantic.
The plan is included in legislation imposing stricter controls on fishing in the region in a bid to prevent over-fishing of vulnerable species.
Plans in the original legislation for a total ban on using nets for deep-sea fishing were thrown out after opposition from fishermen in Portugal, France, and Spain.
In the evening they will also debate respect of "fundamental rights" in the EU in 2015 and recommendations to boost the bloc's creative industries.
The morning sitting kicks off with a debate on measures announced by the EU Commission last month to promote clean energy.
The package includes laws to change electricity markets in the hope of meeting the bloc's commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by 2030.
Before the voting session, there will be a short ceremony to award this year's Sakharov human rights prize to Yazidi rights activists Nadia Murad Basee and Lamiya Aji Bashar.
The pair were among were among thousands of Yazidi girls and women abducted and forced into sexual slavery by so-called Islamic State (IS) in Iraq in 2014.
In the afternoon, MEPs will be joined by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico to debate Slovakia's EU presidency, which finishes at the end of this month.
For the past six months, the country has organised meetings of the Council of Ministers, where national governments debate and vote on EU legislation.
The country will pass on the baton to Malta at the start of next month.
After this, the will debate the EU's ongoing probe into the rule of law in Poland.
The probe was launched at the start of this year after Poland's new government made controversial changes to the set-up of the country's constitutional court.
In July, the Commission said the changes presented a "systemic threat" to the rule of law and asked Poland to take measures to remedy the situation.
The country has questioned the legitimacy of the review.
As well as debating a report into human rights around the world and the future of the EU's common security policy, MEPs will discuss plans to liberalise trade in textiles with Uzbekistan.
The proposal was initially rejected by MEPs five years ago over concerns about forced and child labour in the Uzbek cotton-picking industry.
A vote on whether to approve the new trade measures will be held on Wednesday, along with a ratification vote on an EU trade agreement with Ecuador.
The deal with Ecuador was signed last month but must be approved by MEPs before it can fully come into effect.
It would eliminate EU tariffs on Ecuadorian fish and industrial products, and increase market access for certain agricultural products.
However lower tariffs on bananas would still be subject to annual import limits.
The morning sitting will be entirely devoted to a debate on the European Council summit at the end of this week.
EU leaders will be discussing EU measures relating to migration, common EU defence policy, and how to deal with the Dutch rejection of an EU partnership deal with Ukraine.
The leaders of 27 EU states will also hold an informal meeting to discuss how to handle the Brexit process once the UK eventually triggers formal exit negotiations.
Before the voting session at 11.00 GMT, Martin Schulz will make a statement about his decision not to seek a third term as the Parliament's president.
He announced at the end of last month that he would instead be standing for election as an MP in the German Parliament.
In the afternoon, MEPs will discuss latest negotiations to unlock further funds from Greece's EU/IMF bailout.
Under the programme, Greece will receive loans of up to â‚¬86bn over the next three years in return for commitments to loosen labour laws and cut public spending.
Eurozone countries are reportedly at odds with the IMF over the size of the budget surplus they should demand from the country after the bailout deal ends.
After this they will discuss new emergency powers to suspend visa-free travel rights with countries that have signed visa liberalisation deals with the EU.
The new legislation would allow either the Commission or a majority of EU states to suspend a country's visa exemptions if there is a large increase in asylum requests.
Agreement on the suspension mechanism among national ministers was reached last week, and will go to a final vote on Thursday.
The new powers have been seen as a crucial pre-condition for finalising arrangements to grant visa-free travel to Ukraine and Georgia.
In the evening MEPs will debate the leak of information relating to terrorism investigations from Europol, the EU police co-operation agency.
Dutch media recently reported that a former Europol employee had inadvertently published information relating to 54 cases online.
They will also debate action by the EU Commission to get the US and Canada to reciprocate visa waivers with a number of eastern European states.
The day's short sitting will begin with a debate on an annual report into the activities of the Parliament's petitions committee during 2015.
The report says that during 2015, the committee received 1,431 petitions, of which 943 were admitted and 483 were declared admissible.
After this, they will debate the month's three motions on human rights cases.
This month they will be debating the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy in Tibet, the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and mass graves in Iraq.
After the voting session the afternoon sitting will comprise a single debate, on changes to the EU's customs code.
Please note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon.
