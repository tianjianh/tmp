Signs and lines to be fitted in Edinburgh city centre 20mph zone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Signs and lines for the new 20mph speed limit are being installed in parts of Edinburgh's city centre and rural west area.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phase 1 of the rollout of a 20mph speed limit on all residential, shopping and city centre streets in the capital will begin on 31 July 2016.
The Traffic Regulation Order comes into force for the first zone on 31 July.
Large 20mph signs will mark the entrance and exit of a 20mph area where the speed limit is changing.
These will be supplemented by smaller signs or road markings with speed limit roundels.
The 20mph network will be introduced over six phases.
Phase one of the Â£2.2m project covers much of the city centre, from Queen Street to the Meadows.
Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh's transport convener, said: "Edinburgh's taking a hugely positive step in embracing slower speeds across so much of our city and we know that other cities in Scotland are keen to learn from our example.
"People will start to spot new 20mph signs around the city centre and rural west Edinburgh over the coming weeks as we get ready for the first phase of the 20mph roll-out to go live on 31 July.
"We'll also be widely publicising the move to 20mph so that residents and visitors to the city will know where it applies."
