[SN]TITLE[SN]

MPs are to receive a 1.3% pay rise from April, taking their salary to Â£74,962.

This is on top of a 10% rise decided in August and backdated to the general election.
The latest increase is an annual adjustment decided by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which takes into account average public sector pay rises.
It is slightly higher than the 1% public sector pay cap introduced by Chancellor George Osborne.
Ipsa says this is due to the fact it uses Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures as its benchmark.
An Ipsa spokesman said: "The ONS index takes account of promotions and bonuses which may explain why the figure is higher than the 1% wider public sector pay policy."
