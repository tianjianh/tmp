Mexico judge clears 'El Chapo' Guzman extradition to US

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A federal judge in Mexico has ruled that drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman can be extradited to the US.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guzman is wanted there on charges of smuggling vast amounts of drugs into the country.
The Mexican foreign ministry now has 30 days to decide whether or not to approve the extradition.
Guzman's lawyers have already appealed against the judge's ruling. Two days ago the authorities transferred him to a prison near the US border.
But they denied the move to Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas, was a precursor to extradition.
The National Security Commission said the transfer was due to work being done to boost security at the Altiplano maximum security prison near Mexico City, where he was being held.
Guzman was the head of the Sinaloa drug cartel.
He was captured in January, six months after escaping through a 1.6km (one-mile) tunnel from his maximum-security prison cell.
