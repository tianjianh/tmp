Mexico missing students: Investigators concerned by delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Regional investigators say Mexico has still not responded to a request to interview soldiers over the disappearance last year of 43 students, three months after it was made.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The students clashed with police who then handed them over to a drugs gang, police officers told investigators.
Relatives of the missing think the soldiers, who were at the scene of the clash, may have played a role, too.
But the government insists the army had no involvement in the disappearance.
The students, from a teachers' college in the state of Guerrero, travelled to the town of Iguala on 26 September and, as part of a protest, commandeered a number of buses.
On their way back to their college they were intercepted by police, who handed them over to members of the Guerreros Unidos gang.
Investigations conducted since have revealed the local police force had been infiltrated by members of the gang.
Gang members confessed to killing the students and burning their bodies after they were mistakenly told they belonged to a rival gang.
The badly burnt remains of one student were found at a nearby dump, but the families of the remaining 42 missing refuse to believe the students are dead.
Investigators from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights want to question soldiers from the battalion in Iguala that responded to events at the time the students clashed with police.
Relatives believe the soldiers may have failed to act as the police opened fire on the students and later bundled them onto a bus.
Three students and three people in nearby vehicles died on that day.
The investigators said they wanted to interview several dozen soldiers to see if they could shed further light on what happened on 26 September.
"More than three months after having made the request to the authorities to directly interview soldiers of the 27th Battalion (...) the group of experts notes with concern the delay" in getting access, a statement read.
The commission said it had been told by the government that it was still studying their request to talk to the soldiers.
Chilean lawyer and commission member Francisco Cox said that "everything becomes more complicated" as the investigators wait to speak to the soldiers, and that the delay "limits the possibilities for searches and possible investigations".
A final report from the commission is due in September.
