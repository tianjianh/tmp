It is the third time that the 22-year-old, who was released by Yeovil at the end of last season, has signed for the Shrimpers after two spells in 2014.
"The short-term deal we've put him on will hopefully keep him focused on the field of play so we get the Jakub of old," boss Phil Brown said.
"If we get the Jakub of old, he's one of the best in the league."
