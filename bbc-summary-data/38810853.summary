Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and the Scottish government stepped in with aid for call centre firm Kura after it won a contract previously held by Capita in the Forres Business Park.
It was feared jobs could have been lost.
Business minister Paul Wheelhouse said it was "fantastic" news.
Kura's chief executive Brian Bannatyne said the Moray operation offered a platform for expansion which could create a further 150 jobs over the next two to three years.
David Oxley, acting director of business and sector development at HIE, said: "This is excellent news for Forres and for Capita employees, who will now have the opportunity to transfer to Kura."
