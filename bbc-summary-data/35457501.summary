The duo were among 13 players who had to finish their final rounds on Monday after Sunday's play at Sentosa Golf Club was curtailed by thunderstorms.
American Spieth sank a five-foot birdie putt on the last hole for a five-under-par 66 to finish 11 under.
Song, resuming on 12 under, parred his remaining three holes for a one-under 70 and victory by one shot.
The world number 204 began the day with a testing 12-foot putt at the 16th, but a simple tap-in at the last secured his first professional victory after two second-place finishes on the Japan Tour.
Song, 24, led from the second round and was five in front of Spieth heading into the final round.
