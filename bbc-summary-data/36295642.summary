The pair, aged 12 and 14, were held after the 30-year-old was attacked by a group of youths in Grosvenor Street, Cheltenham, on Friday, police said.
The victim remains in hospital, police said, with serious but non life-threatening injuries.
A third boy, aged 12, has been released without charge.
All three boys were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH), Gloucestershire Police said.
The force said it was keen to point out the attack was an isolated incident and those involved were known to each other.
