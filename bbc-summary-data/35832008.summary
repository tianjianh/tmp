A 17-year-old has been jailed for seven years for attempted murder after luring brothers from Aberdeen to Edinburgh for a drug deal.

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, knifed Peter Stewart, 44, through the heart and also stabbed his brother James Stewart, 46.
The pair had tried to buy cannabis and a car but were ambushed by the youth on 8 April 2015 in Wardieburn Street West.
Ryan Ellis, 31, was earlier cleared of the attempted murder of Peter Stewart.
Mr Ellis had also denied stabbing James Stewart during the incident.
Lord Glennie said to the 17-year-old: "On the evidence which the jury must have accepted this was a vicious attack with a knife which you were carrying.
"I accept it was a single blow from you, but Mr Stewart could well have died.
"I take account, particularly, of the fact you are still only 17 and have no relevant criminal record."
Last month the 17-year-old was unanimously found guilty of robbing Peter Stewart of his mobile phone and attempting to murder him by stabbing him to the danger of his life.
He was also found guilty of assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement of James Stewart by striking him on the body with a knife.
The High Court in Livingston heard how the brothers had travelled from Aberdeen and received a series of calls directing them to a rendezvous point.
There, they met the teenager who got into their car and said he would direct them to their final destination.
However, in a tenement close, the two brothers were attacked by the 17-year-old, along with others who have yet to be identified.
Although severely injured the brothers managed to escape and get help from passers-by who called an ambulance.
The 17-year-old was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Kenny Donnelly, high court procurator fiscal for the east of Scotland, said: "This man had no intention of going through with any sort of deal.
"Motivated by greed, his sole aim was to rob his victims using whatever violent means he deemed necessary.
"There is simply no excuse for such behaviour in any circumstances, but particularly when it involves the use of a knife as a weapon.
"It is only through good fortune that this violent attack did not result in a fatality.
"As prosecutors we will continue to do all in our power to ensure that those who use knives will be brought before the courts to face justice."
