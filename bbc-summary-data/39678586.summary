East Fife climbed three places to third after a 1-0 win over Albion Rovers.
Brechin City sit fourth following their goalless draw with Stranraer.
Bottom side Stenhousemuir stayed in the hunt for a relegation play-off, beating ninth-placed Peterhead to close the gap on their opponents to two points, while Alloa Athletic beat Airdrieonians 1-0.
In Livingston, Nikolay Todorov latched on to Danny Mullen's fine ball to hand the home side their opener, poking it beyond the goalkeeper.
Mullen doubled their lead midway through the second half, while provider for the second - Declan Gallagher - claimed another assist as he set up Josh Mullin with 10 minutes remaining. Nicky Cadden completed the scoring at the death.
Alloa, who sealed their spot in this season's play-offs with last weekend's 6-1 mauling of Brechin, only needed one goal to claim maximum points from their victory at Excelsior Stadium.
After a goalless first half, the visitors broke the deadlock when Jordan Kirkpatrick found the top corner for his 14th goal of the season.
East Fife are level on 46 points with three other teams - Brechin, Airdrieonians and Queen's Park - but strengthened their play-off hopes by beating Albion Rovers.
Chris Duggan set up Jason Kerr just after the hour mark and he fired into the bottom-left corner, but Duggan then saw red as he was shown his second yellow card for allegedly diving with seven minutes remaining.
Oli Shaw's 12th-minute winner kept Stenhousemuir in with a chance of avoiding automatic relegation, while a point for Brechin at Glebe Park was sufficient to propel them into the final play-off spot with two games remaining.
