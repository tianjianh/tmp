The 33-year-old midfielder has left West Ham United by mutual consent after four years at the Premier League club.
Slade says any potential signings have to "fit in" with their philosophy.
"I think Kevin Nolan is a very good player," said Slade. "But there are lots of very good players that have been put our way as possibilities but they have to fit in."
"They have to fit in with what we're trying to do both financially and from a playing side."
When directly asked if the former Bolton Wanderers and Newcastle United midfielder was close to a move to the Bluebirds, Slade responded: "Not that I know of."
The manager did confirm though that he is chasing one more signing before Tuesday's transfer deadline.
But Slade added that they have yet to receive any formal offers for goalkeeper David Marshall, who has been linked with a move to West Bromwich Albion.
The Scottish international will travel with the team to face Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on Saturday, but Slade admits they have fitness doubts over three or four players.
"We'll see how they train. They'll do some part one or two of them and see how they come through that," Slade added.
Slade would not disclose the identity of all the players in question, but he did reveal striker Kenywne Jones is one of them and that his chances of playing "will go right to the wire."
