The London-born, USA-raised 21-year-old will count as a foreign import because of his overseas junior development.
"My dad loves it," he said. "It's different from soccer, but he loves the intensity of it.
"He's only an hour and a half away, so he'll be able to get to watch me play more than he's ever done."
Asked whether his football-mad dad, a former Brentford trialist and passionate Celtic and Scotland fan, understands the game, Stewart added: "I've told him that, whenever we score, or the opposition score, he's just got to make sure he cheers for the right team."
"Liam is a very important signing for us," said Blaze head coach Danny Stewart. "He adds to our depth which will be crucial next season."
Blaze, who won the Elite League five times in eight seasons between 2003 and 2010, finished sixth last season.
Liam Stewart first developed an interest in ice hockey after moving to America to live with his mother in Southern California at the age of three.
He played at a junior level with the Spokane Chiefs, before making two play-off appearances for the Quad City Mallards, and then making 13 appearances last season for the Alaska Aces.
"I was there for a couple of months before I got injured," he said. "The injury is fully recovered now and I am itching to get back on the ice to start the season."
