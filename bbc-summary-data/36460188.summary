Crewe Alexandra target Devitt, 25, has signed a two-year deal, having spent 18 months at the Globe Arena.
Lambe, also 25, turned down a new contract with Mansfield to move to Brunton Park on a one-year deal.
He joined the Stags in September 2014 following spells in Canada and Sweden, making 73 appearances for the club.
"Reggie had more financially lucrative offers, but he's chosen to come here," head of recruitment Lee Dykes told Carlisle's website.
"People like Reggie can unlock doors for you in difficult situations. We'll be able to play him in a number of positions. He's a wide player who can come in off the line, or go down it, and he's good with both feet."
Former Hull City young player of the year Devitt made 98 appearances for Morecambe, scoring 12 goals, seven of which came last season, his best in any campaign since 2009.
The Irishman held talks with Alex boss Steve Davis, who had hoped to make him his second signing of the summer, but he opted for Cumbria instead.
"Jamie played a big part in three of the four goals we conceded against Morecambe," said Dykes. "He was one of the most effective players we faced."
