[SN]TITLE[SN]
Three-weekly waste collections to start in Powys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Waste collections once every three weeks will begin in Powys in a bid to save Â£500,000 a year and increase recycling rates.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Powys council said the move would help it meet the Welsh government's 58% recycling target by 2015/16, which rises to 70% by 2024/25.
The new collection cycles will start from the week beginning 23 November.
Weekly recycling collections, including food waste, will be unaffected.
