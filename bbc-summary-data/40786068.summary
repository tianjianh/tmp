Jake Cassidy's second-half equaliser earned Hartlepool their first point in the Vanarama National League as they drew against Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pools, who were relegated from the English Football League last season, lost their opening game at home to Dover on Saturday but started well at Moss Rose, with Cassidy and Jack Munns both firing inches wide.
Macclesfield hit back, with Danny Whitaker's volleyed effort superbly tipped away by goalkeeper Scott Loach.
The home side took the lead in the 38th minute when Elliott Durrell's ball into the box was headed home by Whitaker.
There was a let-off for Hartlepool at the start of the second half when a mistake from defender Scott Harrison set Tyrone Marsh clear but he shot straight at Loach.
Pools levelled after 58 minutes when Cassidy nodded in a cross from Ryan Donaldson and came closest to winning it when the striker's flicked header was saved.
