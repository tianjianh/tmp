According to TMZ, which claims it's seen the pictures, the images have been uploaded to several porn sites.
The entertainment website alleges they were originally sent by the DJ to a number of women.
Newsbeat hasn't seen any naked photos of the 31-year-old and Calvin's people told us they aren't commenting.
The DJ, who's the new face of Armani underwear, recently posed for a photo shoot wearing nothing except a pair of tight pants.
Newsbeat has seen black and white pixelated pictures posted online, in which it is claimed the star is naked.
But it's not clear if these are genuine or if they are professional pictures edited to suggest he's not wearing underwear.
Last year, Forbes magazine estimated the DJ, who is the richest in the world, earned around Â£40m.
In January he signed a three-year deal to hold residencies at three of their Las Vegas venues and become their music consultant.
