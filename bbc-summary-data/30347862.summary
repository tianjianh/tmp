A planning application has been made to build 650 homes on land in Wellington, Somerset.

Taunton Deane Borough Council said the outline Jurston Farm plans include a community centre and woodland as well as a new primary school.
A new roundabout is also suggested for the A38 at West Buckland Road.
Campaigners against the plans have said the town already has enough development and its current infrastructure could not cope with any more.
Russell Loarridge from the Save Wellington group said: "The Wellington community has effectively sleep-walked through 1,200 houses that have already got planning permission and are in the process of being physically delivered.
"So we're already going to have 4,000 new people in the town and there's nothing we can do about that.
"What we're saying is enough is enough. An additional 650... is unacceptable."
People have until 8 January to comment on the application, submitted on behalf of Dorset-based builders CG Fry and Son Limited.
The council said the statutory 21-day consultation had been extended as the application has been submitted so close to Christmas.
It added that 2,500 homes are needed in Wellington and a government planning inspector had agreed that Jurston Farm is an "appropriate site" to be part of that.
The planning committee has not yet set a date to consider the application.
In a statement, developer CG Fry said: "Throughout the various consultation events we have held in the town to discuss our proposals, we have been grateful that objectors have engaged with us and made their views and feelings known in a firm but respectful manner and we hope that we have reciprocated.
"The reality is that our outline planning application is simply delivering on strategic decisions already made by Taunton Deane Borough Council."
