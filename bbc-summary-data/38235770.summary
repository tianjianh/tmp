Nigel Clough: Burton Albion boss hopes for improved transfer window

Burton Albion's better-than-expected start to life in the Championship should make it easier to sign players, says manager Nigel Clough.

The 19th-placed Brewers, one of the favourites to go straight back down to League One, are three points clear of the relegation zone after 19 games.
Clough told BBC Radio Derby he has mixed feeling about their progress.
"We would have taken it at the start of the season but we think we have played better than that," he said.
"For the chances we have created we haven't scored enough goals."
This week the 50-year-old passed 12 months as Brewers manager in his second spell in charge and said it had been a "good year".
He added getting to the stage they are at is no mean achievement given their budget and standing in their first season in the second tier of English football.
"We knew we would not be first choice on a lot of players' lists for where they wanted to play in the Championship," Clough added.
"Hopefully come January, and if we manage to stay up in the summer, that [signing players] will become an easier task.
"In the first 19 games people have seen us play and I think we have played a little bit better than people anticipated.
"If we can replicate the first 19 games and have 44 points after 38 games that would be a very good target and would gives us eight games to get to 50 points."
Clough had just over 10 years at the Brewers during his first stint, but left to take over as Derby County manager in January 2009.
