A previously-unreleased David Bowie album is to be included in a new box set, his estate has announced.

The Gouster has never been put out as a complete album before, though a spokesman said tracks from it "morphed" into the 1975 release, Young Americans.
The seven-track work includes that subsequent album's title track, along with a re-recording of Bowie's 1972 single, John, I'm Only Dancing.
Bowie's producer Tony Visconti said it was "40 minutes of glorious funk".
The work, which Visconti said came about because he and Bowie wanted to make "a killer soul album", will be released as part of the David Bowie - Who Can I Be Now? (1974-1976) box set.
A post on Bowie's Facebook page said the release date would be announced next week.
Bowie released three albums between 1974 and 1976 - Diamond Dogs, Young Americans and Station To Station - and took on a new persona, known as the Thin White Duke.

Writing in the sleeve notes, Visconti said Gouster was "a word unfamiliar to me, but David knew it as a type of dress code worn by African American teens in the '60s in Chicago".
"In the context of the album, its meaning was attitude, an attitude of pride and hipness.
"Of all the songs we cut, we were enamoured of the ones we chose for the album that portrayed this attitude."
He said the pair had had "a long infatuation with soul" and were fans of the American TV show Soul Train.
"We weren't 'young, gifted and black', but we sure as hell wanted to make a killer soul album, which was quite insane, but pioneers like the Righteous Brothers were there before us."
He added that John, I'm Only Dancing (Again) was an "outrageous brand new, funkafied version" of the original.
The box set is a follow-up to Five Years (1969 - 1973), which was released in September 2015.
