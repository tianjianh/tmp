[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lancashire water parasite alert enters fourth week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents in more than 300,000 homes are entering a fourth week of boiling drinking water after a parasite discovery at a treatment works.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Water firm United Utilities will assess hundreds of test results later, in discussions with Public Health England.
Action was taken after the microbial parasite cryptosporidium was found on 6 August, near Preston in Lancashire.
Water is being treated with ultra violet (UV) light to kill the parasite, which can cause diarrhoea and cramps.
United Utilities previously said it would have an idea of when restrictions could be lifted once UV light treated the water.
A petition calling for a parliamentary inquiry into how the bug entered the water supply has been signed by about 12,000 people.
Affected areas include Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble, Wyre and the Mellor area of Blackburn.
Levels of cryptosporidium are "very low" but United Utilities urged people to continue boiling water.
