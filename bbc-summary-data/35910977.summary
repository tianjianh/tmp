Afcon 2017: Nigeria qualification hopes on the line against Egypt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigeria will be eliminated from qualifying for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations if they lose away to Egypt in their Group G tie on Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Results against group rivals Chad have been erased after their withdrawal on Sunday, meaning only the group winners will make it to next year's finals.
Nigeria have two points and Egypt have four, while Tanzania have one.
A win for Egypt would put them in a strong position to qualify but they could still be caught by Tanzania.
Mathematically the countries could both finish on seven points, although Egypt have a far superior goal difference and a 3-0 win over Tanzania from their match last June.
Each country in Group G now plays a maximum of four qualifiers.
Home success at the Borg El Arab will lift Egypt to seven points and put the Pharaohs out of the reach of Nigeria, who will have just one game (at home against Tanzania) left.
If the Super Eagles win, then they would hold the upper hand but would still need to win their last group game to make sure of qualification.
Nigeria missed out on the last Nations Cup finals in Equatorial Guinea despite winning the 2013 edition in South Africa. Egypt have remarkably not competed at the finals since winning the last of three back-to-back titles in 2010.
Previews of Tuesday's other matches to follow.
