Janma Joshi, 40, also died in the blaze at their flat on Moscow Drive the day before she was due to hand Moksha Jai Joshi, known as Jai, to his father.
Coroner Andre Rebello ruled Ms Joshi "died by her own hand" and unlawfully killed her son.
The hearing was told she was angered by a court ruling she must allow her son to live with his father Paresh Patel.
CCTV footage showed Ms Joshi buying petrol and putting it in a container from a garage 17 days before the fatal fire in May.
Det Ch Insp Andy O'Connor, from Merseyside Police, told the court it showed "some planning" for the fire.
Coroner Mr Rebello who described their deaths as "shocking and distressing", said Ms Joshi "intended her death by her own actions and died by her own hand".
He told the court "neither family nor professionals could have foreseen the tragedy".
He urged both of their families to "let the memory of their lives overshadow the tragedy of their deaths".
Jai's father took his son's school bag and wore his school badge to the inquest, saying after the ruling it was "all he had left of him".
Lancashire Safeguarding Children Board is conducting a serious case review.
