Northern Ireland economics and business review 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland economy passed an important milestone in 2016 - the number of people in work finally returned to pre-crisis levels.

That it has taken almost a decade to achieve this shows just how scarring the great financial crisis has been.
People in work were also being paid more - official data suggests wages rose in real terms for the second year in a row.
The introduction of the National Living Wage - a higher minimum wage for the over 25s - will have helped, particularly as Northern Ireland has a large number of low-paid workers.
But those positive headlines conceal some deep structural problems.
A speech in July by Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, examined how different parts of the UK have experienced recovery.
It showed that on one key measure, GDP per head, Northern Ireland has essentially flat-lined since 2009.
And the outlook for 2017 is one of slow growth - most forecasters think we can expect economic expansion of no more than 1% compared to 2% in 2016.
Male unemployment is already on the rise, probably linked to continued challenges for manufacturing.
The year began with Bombardier, Northern Ireland's biggest manufacturing employer, announcing more than 1,000 job losses.
In September, Caterpillar said it plans to cut about 200 jobs and close its plant in Newtownabbey.
However, the sharp depreciation of the pound, following the Brexit vote, means that manufacturing exporters experienced a better end to the year.
There were also some big deals in the manufacturing sector, most notably the first major investments by Chinese companies.
CIMC Vehicles of Shenzhen paid £92m for SDC Trailers and then Thompson Aero Seating was bought by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China.
The biggest deal of the year was Wireless Group selling its radio assets to News Corp for £220m, the final stage in the break-up of what was UTV.
The controversy over another deal - the sale of Nama's Northern Ireland property loan portfolio - rumbled on throughout 2016.
The main development was the judgment of the Republic of Ireland's spending watchdog, the Comptroller and Auditor General, that Nama could have got £190m more for portfolio than it did.
That has been hotly contested by Nama officials during appearances at Dublin's public accounts committee. A full statutory inquiry is due to follow.
The biggest business story of the year in the Republic of Ireland was the European Commission ruling that the tax authorities should recover up to £11bn from Apple in back taxes.
The commission said the Irish government had enabled the company to pay substantially less tax than other businesses, in effect paying a corporate tax rate of no more than 1%.
The Irish government and Apple both disagree with the record penalty and are appealing against it.
It is another European matter which is preoccupying economic policy makers across Ireland - what will Brexit mean?
So far, the UK's vote to leave the EU has been something of an economic non-event, aside from the weakening of the pound.
But decisions will soon have to be made on issues like the Single Market and the Customs Union which will have significant implications across the island.
Dublin clearly wants the softest possible Brexit while the Northern Ireland Executive's one substantive statement on the issue suggests it takes a similar position.
The executive's finance minister, Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, was all set to deliver a straightforward first budget, in contrast to the wrangling over welfare reform in recent years.
However, the controversy over the botched renewable heat incentive scheme pushed his big day back to January.
When Mr Ó Muilleoir finally gets to deliver his speech, the key issue will be how he plans to use the extra capital spending made available in the chancellor's Autumn Statement.
But the era of austerity is not over - Stormont's day-to-day spending power will continue to fall over the next few years.
