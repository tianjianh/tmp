Tony Kurt, 19, has contacted Metropolitan Police after seeing video appeals in English and Albanian for him to come forward, Sussex Police said.
Mr Kurt is in Sussex being interviewed by police about his "ordeal". An appeal was launched after CCTV showed him being bundled into a car on 12 April.
Three men have been charged as part of the investigation.
Police said the car, a Vauxhall Astra, was found parked in Benett Avenue, Hove, on 16 April and is being forensically examined.
Det Supt Jason Taylor said: "The investigation is continuing to move rapidly and we are making good progress."
He appealed for anyone with information to contact police.
At least two other men are still being sought, a police spokesman said.
A 34-year-old man from Hove, arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to kidnap on 14 April was released on bail.
