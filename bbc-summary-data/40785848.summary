[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 0-1 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Callum Camps' spectacular goal sealed an EFL Cup first-round win for Rochdale at League Two Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But it took a penalty save by Josh Lillis eight minutes from time to deny Danny Rose and prevent extra-time.
Paul Anderson forced Lillis to save a tame near post effort with his feet three minutes before League One Rochdale stole a spectacular 17th-minute lead.
A corner was cleared to Camps 25 yards from goal and he picked out the top right-hand corner with a spectacular curling finish.
But Mansfield stepped up a gear and in the 29th minute Anderson saw his powerful volley crash back off the far post, while Jimmy Spencer drilled a low shot inches wide a minute later.
The Stags survived as a 65th minute Kgosi Ntlhe cross struck the home bar.
Mansfield, who have not got past the first round in 11 years, had a lifeline near the end as Niall Canavan tripped Rose in the box only to see Lillis' legs keep the ball out as he dived to his left.
