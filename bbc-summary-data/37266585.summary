Shipping containers could be turned into accommodation to help people facing homelessness in Newport.

The Amazing Grace Spaces project has fitted out a donated 40ft (12m) container to create a one-bedroom flat.
The scheme, run by husband and wife Stuart and Caroline Johnson, hopes to raise money for 10 containers.
As well as providing accommodation, it is hoped the project could support people to get a job and eventually a more permanent place to live.
The couple, who helped set up the Church Night Shelter project in Newport, said the project could also help people facing eviction, mortgage repossession, relationship breakdowns or those unable to find affordable housing.
"We believe that everyone deserves a home that is suitable to their needs. Without a secure home no-one can prosper and plan for a future," Mr Johnson said.
"It's not an answer to homelessness or affordable housing but it's an opportunity that's very cost effective. It's a little bit different, and people are interested," he added.
The project, which is in the process of seeking charitable status, aims to work with councils, churches, universities and other organisations to support people in need.
Once completed, Mr Johnson said the containers could be sited at car parks or on land undergoing redevelopment in agreement with site owners.
