The actor was struck by a hydraulic metal door on the Pinewood set of the Millennium Falcon in June 2014.
The Health And Safety Executive has brought four criminal charges against Foodles Production (UK) Ltd - a subsidiary of Disney.
Foodles Production said it was "disappointed" by the HSE's decision.
Following the incident, Ford was airlifted to hospital for surgery.
Following an investigation, the HSE said it believed there was sufficient evidence about the incident which left Ford with serious injuries, to bring four charges relating to alleged health and safety breaches.
A spokesperson added: "By law, employers must take reasonable steps to protect workers - this is as true on a film set as a factory floor."
Foodles Production is the company responsible for producing Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens, and as such is culpable under health and safety law.
Representatives of the production company will appear at High Wycombe Magistrates Court on 12 May.
A spokesman for Foodles Production said: "Cast and crew safety is always a top priority. We provided full co-operation during HSE's investigation into the on-set accident that occurred in June 2014 and are disappointed in HSE's decision."
Star Wars: The Force Awakens was filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The eagerly anticipated movie is the most successful film ever at the UK Box Office. And has taken more than $2bn worldwide.
Production of Star Wars: Episode VIII has already got under way at Pinewood, and is due for release in December 2017.
