Lemou Ange Lauric Lebato, known to family and friends as Lauric Lebato, was found stabbed in Albion Street at about 04:00 GMT on Saturday.
Police said they think the 22-year-old from London had been at a flat party in the street before the attack.
His father Tagbeu Lebato, urged anyone who knew anything about his death to tell police and not "hold it back".
In a statement released through Leicestershire Police, Tagbeu Lebato from Finsbury Park, London, said: "Lauric was the first person in my life, the centre of it, and was so very, very, important to me.
"I don't want anyone else to go through what I have and I don't want this to happen to someone else's relative.
"You must pass on information to police. No matter what it is. Don't hold it back."
Detectives investigating Mr Lebato's death urged students who were at the party or who may have heard what happened to get in touch with any information.
