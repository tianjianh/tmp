[SN]TITLE[SN]
Is Newport out of the shadows of its neighbours?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport is one of the UK's newest cities but it has also been in the shadows, squeezed by its bigger neighbours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It's less than half the size of Cardiff and a fifth of the size of Bristol.
But is Newport finally emerging economically with something distinctive to its two Severnside rivals?
The city centre has been struggling for years with locals complaining of high business rates, empty shops on the high street and with manufacturing waning.
The 2010 Ryder Cup and last year's Nato summit at the Celtic Manor helped put Newport on the map.
Building on that, the city has beaten Cardiff to the punch backing plans for a Wales international convention centre, with capacity for 4,000 delegates.
Analysis by the Centre for Cities think-tank suggests optimism that the tide has turned but there are still obstacles to overcome.
A YOUNG CITY
Newport is young: awarded city status in 2002 and more than a quarter of its population is under 19, a higher proportion than either Cardiff or Bristol.
The University of South Wales' £35m campus has helped in the riverside regeneration and 4,000 students give a youthful vibe.
But there is also relatively high level of youth unemployment - 14.89% in 2011, above Cardiff at 10.87% and Bristol at 9.81% .
The proportion of all working adults who are unemployed and claiming Jobs Seekers Allowance in Newport is also greater than its two neighbouring cities.
Despite that, the rate of people in employment in Newport is higher than Cardiff but lower than in Bristol.
MORE THAN STEEL AND THE DOCKS?
Steel may not be as dominant in Newport as it used to be but it is still important.
As well as mixed fortunes for Llanwern steelworks, there's Cogent, or the Orb Works making specialist high-value steels for the electrical industry. The former Alphasteel works was re-opened by the Liberty group only last month.
Newport's main docks are 150 years old and last week I saw Associated British Ports investing £2.6m in new warehousing. to handle the increase in trade of steel, animal feeds, fertiliser and timber. There has been a 20% increase in turnover overall.
Then there is the high-tech sector including electronics company STPS and Airbus's cyber security division.
Manufacturing accounts for 11.7% of the work in Newport, well ahead of Cardiff on just 4.4%. The city is ranked in the top third in a list of 63 UK cities.
Private firms in the services sector such as Lloyds TSB and Gocompare have also been important, while Admiral has helped boost the city centre's regeneration with new offices opposite the railway station.
But public services have dominated the Newport employment map for decades. The Passport Office may be smaller these days, but the Office for National Statistics and the Patent Office are significant employers, with the Ministry of Justice a more recent addition.
It means one in three of the Newport workforce is in public services; this is slightly more than Cardiff despite the capital being the centre for the Welsh government, Wales Audit Office and Companies House.
DO WAGES GO FURTHER?
Putting all the sectors together the value of the work carried out by people in Cardiff and Newport is the same - and the highest in Wales - but significantly lower than Bristol.
That gross value added figure stands at £3.25bn for Newport.
However, average weekly wages in Newport are lower. Workers earn on average £45 a week less than the average for Cardiff and £60 a week less than the average for Bristol.
In terms of what wages can buy, lower house prices in Newport will compensate. The average house price in Cardiff is £30,000 more than in Newport while in Bristol houses are on average £70,000 more.
75%

62.9%

64% drive to work in Bristol
1.45% cycle to work in Newport
3.7% cycle to work in Cardiff
6.2% cycle to work in Bristol
COMMUTING
More than 40% of the 73,000 working in the city travel in from outside.
The planned M4 relief road around the city  will have an impact. However, its route is contentious.
Three quarters of people drive to work in Newport, that's more than Bristol and Cardiff.
Very few go to work by bike - half the proportion who cycle to work in Cardiff and a quarter of the number in Bristol.
STILL GROWING
The city is clearly changing and you can't help fail to notice the new housing developments, especially around the River Usk and docks.
Figures suggest that the numbers working in Cardiff and Bristol but living in Newport is likely to rise.
The number of new house builds started in Newport in the three months from April is already more than for the city in whole of 2010/11.
And for the last two years at least it has continued to outstrip Cardiff.
Its biggest social landlord Newport City Homes estimates 550 new homes are needed each year for the next five years to keep up with demand.
The city is predicted to continue growing - its 149,000 population is set to increase at double the rate of the Wales average and hit 171,000 by 2036.
But Cardiff is still the UK's fastest growing city and its population is set to grow even faster - by a quarter within 20 years.
WHAT NEXT FOR NEWPORT?
For many there's still an emotional and economic attachment to Newport, the steel city.
To truly thrive, it needs to build on its success in a range of different industries - like digital and software sectors - without losing its important traditional manufacturing industries.
Regeneration consultant Hamish Munro knows Newport well and believes it has to forget about competing with Cardiff and Bristol, which it has tried to do historically.
"It has to create its own niche, it's got a different feel about it and it can be a great alternative," he said.
In the short term, Newport council is spending money from Welsh government to encourage people into the city centre again - to live, eat and work.
Friars Walk shopping development is an important milestone but if you look at Newport council's interactive development map there are other signs the city is progressing - not only in building urban homes but a £5m revamp to the old market.
Council leader Bob Bright said Newport's steel industry and docks were "alive and kicking" but the city had reinvented itself.
He is also conscious there is still work to do to spread wealth to the poorer parts of the city but believes the private sector is the key to drive it.
"We need to create the wealth to mitigate those factors - it will take time but we've started the journey," he said.
