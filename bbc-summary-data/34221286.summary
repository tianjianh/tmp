Soprano Danielle de Niese lead audiences around the UK in song, from the event at the Royal Albert Hall.
The event also saw tenor Jonas Kaufmann become the first German to sing Rule Britannia at the Proms.
Marin Alsop, who was the first woman to conduct the Last Night of the Proms in 2013, presided over the finale.
She conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, starting with the world premiere of Arise, Athena! by Eleanor Alberga.
Kaufmann told The Guardian being asked to perform Rule Britannia! made him "feel like an ambassador".
He also performed Recondita Armonia from Tosca, Turandot's Nessun Dorma and Donna Non Vidi Mai from Manon Lescaut.
Danielle de Niese performed at the Proms in the Park in Hyde Park before travelling to the Royal Albert Hall to lead the sing-along - with contributions from singers at Proms in the Park events in Swansea, Glasgow and Belfast.
A film of budding singers from around the country performing Do-Re-Mi from the Sound of Music was also broadcasted in a video montage across all the venues.
Pianist Benjamin Grosvenor played Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No 2, Love Walked In by George Gershwin, and Boogie Woogie Etude.
Across the road from the Royal Albert Hall in London's Hyde Park, The Jacksons headlined the Proms in the Park, hosted by Sir Terry Wogan.
The BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Richard Balcombe, was joined by trumpeter Alison Balsom, tenor Russell Watson and singer Caro Emerald.
Proms in the Park have also taken place in Singleton Park in Swansea, Glasgow Green and Titanic Slipways, Belfast.
