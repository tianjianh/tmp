The pair got stuck in a pond while walking around Oldbury Court Estate and are believed to have been there for an hour before being aided.
Avon Fire and Rescue Service said the man, thought to be in his 40s, and his daughter, aged about 11, were unharmed.
An inflatable walkway was used to reach the pair who had to be dug out before being taken to safety.
Oldbury Court Estate, which is owned by Bristol City Council, covers 300 acres (121 hectares) of parkland including woods, riverside paths and children's play areas.
