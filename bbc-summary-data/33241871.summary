Art dealer David Carter admits selling fake famous Cornwall paintings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An art dealer has admitted intentionally selling fakes of paintings by a famous Cornish artist for tens of thousands of pounds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Carter, 58, of Prospect Close, Hayle, pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud at Truro Crown Court.
He dishonestly claimed the works, which sold for up to £50,000, had been created by celebrated painters such as Alfred Wallis.
An investigation was launched after a complaint to trading standards.
Carter bought the works from websites called "any old tat" and "credit crunch my ass"  for hundreds of pounds between 2009 and 2011, the court was told.
Alex Greenwood, prosecuting, said: "Nothing compatible with acceptable provenance was obtained by the defendant, he knew that. The paintings were bought for a fraction of the sale price.
"The valuing of those works are multiples of their true value, which he knew. It was dishonest, false and misleading."
Carter ran Hayle Art Gallery in Cornwall and claimed to have "expertise in the field in particular Cornish artists"
An investigation by Cornwall Trading Standards found Carter bought six paintings advertised as by artist Alfred Wallis from the websites.
He put the paintings up for sale despite questioning the seller about their authenticity saying "they seem genuine but if they are I'd be very surprised".
Carter bought one painted glass fishing float, allegedly by Wallis and described by an expert as "maritime bric-a-brac" for £316.77 and tried to sell it for £60,000.
The court heard in 2011 he took part in a BBC programme called "Hidden paintings of the South West" where he was made aware reputable experts believed some of his Wallis paintings were fake.
Speaking outside court, Carol Gasser, who bought the painting "Boats leaving Newlyn harbour" for £5,000 said: "I was bitterly disappointed. I loved it when I bought it but I was thoroughly disappointed when I found out it was a fake."
