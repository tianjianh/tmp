The 22-year-old, who began his career as a trainee with Arsenal, most recently played for Boreham Wood on a one-year deal during 2016-17.
He scored three times in 26 appearances for Wood last term, including the winner against Sutton in November.
"After seeing the whole set up and a great group of players, it became an easy decision to make," Jeffrey said.
"I had many offers but this feels right on all levels and I can't wait to get going."
