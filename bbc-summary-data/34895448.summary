[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman called 999 to complain her nail varnish had chipped despite being told they had a three-day guarantee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Avon and Somerset Police has been publishing details of inappropriate 999 calls to highlight misuse of the emergency number.
In another call, a man dialled 999 because staff on Weston-super-Mare pier would not let him on the rides.
And a woman told told call handlers she had no money to buy bread because her benefits had not arrived.
In a fourth call 999 made on Sunday a man told emergency operators a cash machine "had swallowed his card".
Police later took to Twitter to say people should only use the emergency number if offenders were nearby, life was at risk, an injury had been caused or threatened, or if a crime was in progress.
"For everything else call the non-emergency number 101. Although these are real calls and may generate humour [they] stop people getting the help they need."
