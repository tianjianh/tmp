Manager Russell Slade says it is highly unlikely Cardiff City will sign Dutch striker Wout Weghorst during the January transfer window,

The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club.
Slade insisted there was no truth to the reports but admitted he did have some interest in the player "some time ago".
"To my knowledge that's not something we're going to pursue," he said.
Netherlands Under-21 international Weghorst began his career with FC Emmen before joining Heracles in 2014.
Heracles chairman Jam Smit believed a fee had been agreed with Cardiff for Weghorst, who has also been linked with Celtic.
"I think all the forcing and all the speculation surrounding the player appears to be have come from the Netherlands," added Slade.
"There was an initial inquiry some time ago. That's all I can say."
Slade would like to make up to three signings during the window to aid Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, with the club currently four points off the top six.
One is likely to be a striker after the departure of last season's top scorer Kenwyne Jones to Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates.
The Trinidad and Tobago international claimed on social media that the club had offered him no fresh deal to stay, but Slade believes that was not the case,
"I'm pretty sure there was a dialogue going on between Kenwyne's people, Kenwyne himself and [chief executive] Ken Choo and the board of directors," Slade added.
He also denied claims from Rotherham Manager Neil Redfearn that the two clubs are in talks over a potential transfer for Alex Revell.
Revell, 32, joined Cardiff from Rotherham  in January 2015 and has scored twice in 15 league games for the Bluebirds.
"We've already lost a target type centre forward," said Slade.
"We need to be mindful that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot and that we have enough players in every position and every area of the pitch."
Cardiff host League One Shrewsbury Town on Sunday in the third round of the FA Cup with defender Lee Peltier a major doubt because of illness.
