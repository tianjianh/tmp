[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new Conservative MP for Angus said she would be "a public servant, not a party servant" after achieving a surprise victory in the Tayside seat.
Kirstene Hair, 27 took the seat with 18,148 votes in a shock turn of events, removing the SNP from the seat for the first time since it was formed in 1997.
Incumbent SNP MP Mike Weir, who served for 16 years, lost out with 15,503 votes.
Ms Hair, 27, who has previously stood unsuccessfully for the Scottish Parliament , said: "I will be a strong voice for everyone that has voted for me and for everybody that didn't align with me I will be a public servant, not a party servant.
"The hard work starts now but with the greatest honour and integrity I will represent the people of Angus in Westminster. It will be the greatest honour of my life and I can't wait to get started."
In Banff and Buchan, which includes the fishing towns of Fraserburgh and Peterhead, Conservative David Duguid smashed the SNP majority of 14, 339 to take what had become an SNP stronghold.
However, about 54% of those in the constituency supported Brexit in last year's EU referendum and the Scottish Conservative's made the seat their fifth target in Scotland.
The Conservatives overturned a substantial SNP majority by a margin of nearly 3,700 votes.
The 57-year-old was born in Dundee and runs his own sales business.
He has been married to wife Yvonne for 22 years and has four children
The new MP for Stirling says he is passionate about the need for a more honest approach to politics and he believes that principle-centred leadership would do much to restore popular trust in the political process.
Luke Graham is a seasoned campaigner for the Scottish Conservatives and stood for the seat in the 2015 election - losing out to the candidate he beat this time, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh of the SNP.
A strong advocate of the Union, he has also campaigned with MSPs and councillors across Ochil & South Perthshire on the issues of improved transport links, broadband and the regeneration of town and village centres.
Conservative Douglas Ross was elected as a Highlands and Islands regional list MSP in last year's Holyrood election.
But it was third time lucky for the 34-year-old from Forres as he ousted SNP incumbent Angus Robertson in Moray having been beaten by the nationalists in 2010 and 2015.
A dairy farmer before entering politics, Mr Ross previously served as a councillor on the Fochabers/Lhanbryde ward in Moray for 10 years.
At Holyrood, he has run into controversy after his work as a professional assistant football referee clashed with his political duties.
He faced calls to resign his frontbench position as justice spokesman after missing a justice committee meeting to referee a Champions League match in Portugal in 2016
Colin Clark will forever be known as the man who unseated former first minister and long standing MP Alex Salmond from his Gordon constituerncy.
Mr Salmond, the former leader of the SNP and its foreign affairs spokesman, had swept to power in the seat with a 8,687 majority in 2015, overturning decades of Liberal Democrat rule.
But Mr Salmond, who was first elected as an MP 30 years ago in 1987, was defeated byMr Clark, who said in his victory speech: "The silent majority have spoken. We're proud to be part of the United Kingdom."
Miner's son Bill Grant is the first Conservative MP to represent an Ayrshire seat in almost 20 years.
The DIY, gardening and motorcycling enthusiast was first elected at the South Ayrshire Council elections of May 2007 and serves the area of Ayr West.
Originally from Rankinston, the 65-year-old was educated in Cumnock and has lived in Ayr for the last 47 years with his wife, Agnes. He spent his working life as a fire fighter, retiring after 31 years' service and served a further ten years as a local councillor.
Lesley Laird was elected to Fife Council in May 2012.
She was born and educated in Greenock and went on to study at James Watt College, Caledonian University & Napier University. Lesley is also a qualified management coach.
She is a member of the trade union Unison.
The daughter of Scottish Labour's deputy leader Alex Rowley, she oversaw the defeat of sitting SNP MP Owen Thompson, overturning a majority of 9,859 and returning a majority of 885 for Labour.
Previously, the 27-year-old was Gordon Brown 's constituency media manager and a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament.
Gerard "Ged" Killen is the newly elected  MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, having taken the seat from the SNP with a narrow 265 majority.
Mr Killen joined the Labour Party in 2007 and was elected a councillor for Rutherglen South in 2013 at the age of just 26.
After being elected as MP, Mr Killen said: "This result is a rejection of austerity and a rejection of a divisive second independence referendum.
Mr Gaffney, who was only elected to North Lanarkshire Council just last month, said at his declaration: "We're fed up, we've divided our families over independence in Scotland. No more - let's finish it, let's get on with the day job."
He added: "Labour is the party that will offer prosperity, not austerity, and will speak for the many, not the privileged few."
The SNP won the seat in 2015 with a majority of 11,501 - unseating veteran Labour MP Tom Clarke, who had previously represented the area for 33 years.
Labour now has a majority of 1,586 to defend.
Mr Sweeney, who works for Scottish Enterprise, originally comes from the area he now represents and also comes from a family of ship builders.
Mr Sweeney defeated Ann McLaughlin as the SNP vote fell.  He said: "What Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party were offering in this campaign has been a relentless vision of hope, a positive vision.
"A vision that speaks and resonates with people in North East Glasgow, people who need to see tangible improvements in their lives and all they saw was the Labour Party offering that."
Already a familiar face for many in Scottish politics, John Lamont served as the MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire for a decade.
He has finally captured the corresponding Westminster seat of Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk at the fourth time of asking, having fallen short in 2005, 2010 and 2015.
Born and raised in Kilwinning, Mr Lamont trained and then worked as a solicitor in London and Edinburgh before going into politics.
At Holyrood, he acted as the Scottish Conservatives' chief whip and parliamentary business manager. The constituency seat he quit to stand in the general election was retained by his Tory colleague Rachael Hamilton in a by-election on the same day.
Jo Swinson is not really a "new" MP, as she previously represented East Dunbartonshire for the Lib Dems for a decade, from 2005 to 2015. She lost her seat to the SNP's John Nicolson that year amid the SNP's post-independence referendum surge, but has now won it back.
Born in Glasgow, Ms Swinson studied at the London School of Economics and was elected at the age of 25, the youngest MP in the 2005 UK parliament.
She was an equalities minister in the coalition government, and has been tipped by some as a potential future Lib Dem leader. She was deputy leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats under Tavish Scott and then Willie Rennie between 2010 and 2012.
Glasgow East is technically an SNP hold, but the area has a new MP in David Linden after former representative Natalie McGarry lost the party ticket.
Mr Linden describes himself as "an East End lad", and has been an SNP activist for 16 years.
He worked in the finance sector before taking up a job as a caseworker in the SNP's Glasgow East constituency office. He has also worked for the party in Holyrood, Westminster and Brussels.
Before the election he ran the office of Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central.
Alister Jack took Dumfries and Galloway for the Tories from the SNP's Richard Arkless.
He has deep local roots, having been born in Dumfries and raised in Dalbeattie and Kippford. He lives in Courance with his wife, and has three grown-up children.
Mr Jack works as a farmer and businessman and is also involved in forestry and fishing, chairing the River Annan Fishery Board and Trust and Galloway Woodlands.
He campaigned, like many Scottish Tories, centrally on a platform of opposing a second independence referendum, but also for local issues such as the upgrade of the A75 road.
Christine Jardine took Edinburgh West from the SNP, mirroring the result in the corresponding Holyrood race in 2016.
A former BBC and Press Association journalist, Ms Jardine has been a Lib Dem candidate in Holyrood and Westminster contests across the country, including a 2015 attempt to unseat Alex Salmond in Gordon.
She moved to Edinburgh in 2016 and secured the Lib Dem ticket for the key target seat of Edinburgh West. Outside of politics, she has worked as a journalism lecturer and media consultant.
Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he would be particularly pleased if the party won Edinburgh West from the SNP, who he said had "gone very low" in a "vicious" local campaign.
Paul Masterton took East Renfrewshire in one of the few three-horse races in the election in Scotland, a seat fiercely contested by the SNP and Labour.
He faced a three-way contest between SNP incumbent Kirsten Oswald and Labour's Blair McDougall, the head of the 2014 Better Together campaign, but triumphed with 40% of the vote.
He attended the University of Dundee, studying law, and works as a solicitor in Glasgow specialising in pensions law.
Mr Masterton heads his local Conservative association branch, and ran unsuccessfully in the Holyrood elections in 2016.
Ross Thomson will be moving from Holyrood to Westminster, having taken Aberdeen South for the Tories.
Born and raised in the city, and a former vice-chairman of the Aberdeen University Conservative association, Mr Thomson cut his teeth in politics as a city councillor. His move to Westminster comes at the expense of the SNP's Callum McCaig, who was at one point the leader of the city council.
After a series of candidacies for Holyrood and Westminster, Mr Thomson became an MSP via the North East list in 2016. He was also one of the leading voices in the Leave campaign in Scotland in the EU referendum.
His Holyrood list seat will remain with the Conservatives, although it is not yet clear who will take up that position as the next candidate on the North East Tory list is no longer a member of the party.
Andrew Bowie captured the seat of West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine for the Tories, a gain from the SNP's Stuart Donaldson.
Raised in the North East and educated at Inverurie Academy and Aberdeen University, he attended the Britannia Royal Naval College and served as an officer in the Navy.
He then worked as an assistant to Tory MEP Ian Duncan in Brussels, before moving to Holyrood to work for MSP Liam Kerr.
Theresa May's first trip north of the border during the election campaign featured her knocking on doors and handing out leaflets alongside Mr Bowie.
Jamie Stone is a familiar figure in Highland politics, having served both as an MSP and as a local councillor before capturing the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat from the SNP's Paul Monaghan.
Hailing from Tain, he first took public office in 1986 on Ross and Cromarty District Council. He was elected MSP for the corresponding Holyrood constituency in 1999 and remained in office for 12 years, with the Lib Dems in coalition government with Labour for much of this time.
He resigned from Holyrood in 2011 to attend to family matters. He attempted a comeback in 2016, but was beaten by the SNP's Gail Ross.
Mr Stone returned to local politics in 2012, being elected to Highland Council, and was re-elected to represent Tain and Easter Ross in May's local authority elections.
Martin Whitfield has won back the seat of East Lothian for Labour, after the SNP's George Kerevan took it in 2015.
Mr Whitfield worked as a lawyer before switching to teaching, working at Prestonpans Primary School and serving as a council member of the General Teaching Council of Scotland.
He was born in Newcastle, but trained in law in Edinburgh and moved with his family to Prestonpans, where he is chairman of the local community council.
The corresponding Holyrood seat was held by former Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray in 2016, making the area one of the party's last remaining electoral strongholds, alongside Edinburgh South.
