Emma Crossman case: Friend knew of suicide plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman on trial for assisting the suicide of her best friend has said she "was the only one who knew what she was planning", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amelia Caller, 22, is accused of buying gas that her friend, Emma Crossman, used to take her own life.
The 21-year-old was found dead at her home in Sleaford, Lincolnshire in January 2014.
Miss Caller denies the murder on the basis she did not think Miss Crossman would kill herself.
In a recording of her police interview, which was played at Lincoln Crown Court on Thursday, Miss Caller said: "I was the only one who knew what she was planning.
"I was trying everything to stop her...I didn't want her to do it."
The court has previously heard Miss Caller, of Great Hale, Lincolnshire, was "obsessed and infatuated" with Miss Crossman, who had a history of depression, self-harm and overdoses.
A series of Facebook and text messages exchanged between the two women, discussing how Miss Crossman would take her own life, were also read out in court.
One message from Miss Caller suggested the pair have "one fun final day out" while another said "I keep thinking what kind of mate murders their best mate".
Earlier in the trial, Miss Crossman's ex-partner, Adrian Kemp, 56, said she had sent messages about ending her life after they had split up.
He said the two friends drank heavily together and he had confiscated gas bought for Miss Crossman by Miss Caller.
The trial continues.
