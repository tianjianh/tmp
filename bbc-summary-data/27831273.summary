Pamela Shimwell-Mayo, receives an MBE for services to Parkinson's and said she was "incredibly emotional".
Financial expert Tim Cullen, 70, also receives an MBE for services to International Financial Management.
Meanwhile, Judy Arnold, 67, has been awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to Cruse Bereavement Care.
Mrs Shimwell-Mayo, whose late husband suffered with the disease for 30 years, has campaigned to raise awareness since 1989.
The Isle of Man Parkinson's Disease Society Chairman said: "I am in shock. My husband Derek and my mother would have been so proud.
"I can't wait to tell my daughters the news."
Mr Cullen conceived and established the Small Countries' Financial Management Centre (SCFMC) in 2009.
The initiative helps equip government officials from smaller developing countries with skills in financial regulation, public sector management, leadership and negotiation.
The 70-year-old, who spent 21 years with the World Bank, said: "It has been enormously satisfying and we have achieved remarkable things on a shoestring budget.
"I am absolutely delighted to be honoured, this programme has made a real difference."
Since its formation the SCFMC has helped more than 100 people from about 30 countries.
Mrs Arnold founded Cruse Bereavement Care in a friend's front room and has gone on to help hundreds of people.
She said: "It is wonderful and completely out of the blue. This is testament to the organisation itself and all the people we have helped."
