Pictures showed the bus split in half by the force of the crash, in the town of Anahuac in Tamaulipas state.
Local reports said the driver of the bus may have ignored the stop light at the crossing.
The bus was reported to have been carrying about 60 passengers although it only had seating for 40.
A statement by the train's operator, Kansas City Southern de Mexico, confirmed there had been "a lamentable accident" at about 17:25 (23:25 GMT) on Friday.
A Mexican official quoted by AP news agency said investigators were looking into whether the bus driver had tried to beat the train to the crossing.
Local Mayor Desiderio Urteaga said two children were among the dead. The bus driver was reported to have survived.
The bus had been travelling north from the city of Nuevo Laredo in Tamaulipas to the state of Coahuila.
