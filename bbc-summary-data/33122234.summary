US Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has vowed to help "everyday Americans" in the first major rally in her presidential campaign.

Mrs Clinton outlined her key policies in a speech to thousands of supporters on New York City's Roosevelt Island.
She pledged to support working families, saying: "America can't succeed unless you succeed."
Her campaign team hopes to boost approval ratings, which have flagged since her soft-launch in April.
Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and daughter Chelsea appeared alongside her.
She promised to "make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top" if elected president next year.
"Prosperity can't be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers; democracy can't be just for billionaires and corporations," Mrs Clinton, 67, said during the rally.
"It's America's basic bargain... if you do your part, you ought to be able to get ahead, and when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too," she said.

The men and women eyeing the White House
Until now, the former US secretary of state has held small events with selected audiences in early voting states such as Iowa. Saturday's outdoor rally marked a change in gear for her campaign.
Mrs Clinton hopes to make history as the first female US president. If successful she would also keep the White House within the same party for a third term.
She did not detail specific policy proposals on Saturday. Her aides say that will happen over the next few weeks on issues including the economy, jobs and college affordability.
Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign's communications director, said Mrs Clinton plans to give a policy address almost every week in the coming months.
