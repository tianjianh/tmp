Michael Sheill, who runs private clinics across the south east, had his registration erased nine years ago.
An undercover BBC investigation found him breaking medical rules by performing consultations without a registered practitioner being present.
A director of his clinics maintained they were "fully compliant with legal requirements".
Mr Sheill runs clinics in Ashford, Tunbridge Wells, Crawley and Hastings.
The botox drug can only be prescribed by a registered doctor, dentist or nurse - which Mr Sheill is not.
Prescribers must also "undertake a physical examination of patients" before any treatment. But when a BBC reporter met Mr Sheill he was the only person holding the consultations.
When the BBC tried to contact him, the director of the Wells Clinic in Ashford - Paul Sheill - said they are not regulated by the GMC, but their "prescriptions are prescribed according to the law".
The BBC understands at least two doctors - currently registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) - are prescribing the Botox to Mr Sheill without examination. The GMC confirmed if it can establish their identities, it would be their "lawful duty to investigate" and they could also be struck off.
Ashton Collins set up a government approved company, Save Face, to inspect and register cosmetic clinics.
She said the consultations allow the prescriber to determine dosage and check the person's medical history does not put them at risk, adding, "those things are essential to making sure the patients have a safe procedure and what Michael is doing is actually removing those safeguards".
The GMC were shown footage of a consultation between Mr Sheill and a BBC reporter, in which he recommended treatments and bragged "I did 11 people's botox yesterday".
The reported, who visited the clinic after a tip-off, questioned him about his registration and medical licence. He was filmed saying "yes, no problem", despite not having either.
James Ruby-Wicks, a former botox patient of Michael Sheill, said he was also never told a registered prescriber should carry out a face-to-face examinations and added: "I probably went to him about four to five times, I never did see anybody else just Dr Michael. I was definitely naÃ¯ve."
A GMC spokesman confirmed by misleading patients in this way Mr Sheill has "potentially breached Section 49 of the Medical Act", which is a criminal offence.
The GMC is now urging all patients to check the medical register to ensure that their doctor has a licence.
