[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Championship: St Mirren 0-0 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk missed a chance to leapfrog Hibernian into second place in the Scottish Championship after a goalless draw away to St Mirren.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a game of few chances, Jordan Stewart dragged an effort wide for St Mirren as the hosts enjoyed the better of the game early on.
Stephen Mallan and Calum Gallagher both went close without testing goalkeeper Danny Rogers in the Falkirk goal.
Falkirk's Blair Alston had a right-footed effort come back off the bar.
However, the Bairns had to settle for a draw that takes them to within a point of a Hibs side who suffered a third straight defeat after a 1-0 loss away to Queen of the South.
