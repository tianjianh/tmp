Ajax midfielder Abdelhak Nouri has come out of intensive care nearly three weeks after he collapsed during a pre-season friendly, leaving him with "serious and permanent brain damage".

Nouri is no longer in an induced coma and is breathing unaided, his club said in a statement on behalf of his family.
It added the 20-year-old's overall situation was unchanged - stable, but with severe and lasting brain damage.
Nouri had "cardiac arrhythmias" during the game with Werder Bremen on 8 July.
An earlier club statement said there was no prospect of Nouri recovering from the brain damage, which was "probably" caused by a lack of oxygen supply.
Nouri played 15 league and cup games for Ajax in 2016-17, scoring one goal in a Dutch Cup tie.
