The Manx mother of Leo Keefe, who lives in Spain, said her son has been bravely battling SPNET - an aggressive type of brain cancer - for the last 17 months.
"Proton beam therapy (PBT) treatment is his only remaining option," said Karen Keefe, who wants to take him to the US.
A number of fundraising events will be held on the Isle of Man this weekend.
Ms Keefe said Leo, who has had five tumours, has been an "inspiration throughout his battle".
He has endured four operations as well as a gruelling programme of chemotherapy.
What is SPNET?
"I am doing what any mother would do," she said. "Oklahoma is the best possible place for this treatment so I have to do everything I can to get him there."
While Ms Keefe acknowledged that proton beam therapy was not guaranteed to work, she said it was their best option.
She said: "I couldn't live with any 'what ifs?'
"He smiles every day and has captured the hearts of thousands. He is my cheeky, gorgeous boy and it is heart-breaking how money comes into this.
"I would give my heart and soul to take [the cancer] away from him."
Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a type of radiation treatment that uses protons rather than x-rays to treat cancer.
It is not available in the UK or Isle of Man.
In the UK not all cases of children get approved and need to go in front of a committee on an individual basis.
Mrs Keefe said the process could take weeks, which Leo does not have.
It is not offered in Spain.
The radiologist at their local hospital in Pamplona said PBT was Leo's only option to still be able to have a normal life as conventional radiotherapy, which is available in Spain, would be guaranteed to lead to health issues including organ damage and severe growth issues.
Despite having a British passport, Karen said Leo has not qualified for help towards the treatment on the NHS as they live in Spain.
Their crowd-funding social media campaign has 5,000 followers and has already raised more than £40,000.
Events include a promenade run in Douglas on Saturday.
The UK government has committed £250m towards developing high-energy proton beam therapy services in the UK.
