Ten people have been arrested over a series of burglaries targeting the homes of Asian families in Wiltshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the houses in Swindon were chosen because the thieves hoped to find high-value gold jewellery.
Two stolen vehicles believed to have been used in the break-ins have been recovered, with one located in Sweden.
Six people have been released on bail and police enquiries are ongoing with Interpol over four others arrested in Sweden.
The six bailed men were from Wiltshire, Wrexham, Oxfordshire and the West Midlands and a man and youth from Bedfordshire.
A Wiltshire Police spokeswoman said: "Research is ongoing to ascertain how Asian families are being identified.
"In the past, families were able to keep their gold in a bank security box, however this service is on the decline and due to this many now keep their gold at home."
