Bristol Academy crashed out of the Women's Champions League as Frankfurt completed a resounding 12-0 aggregate win to reach the semi-finals.

The tie was effectively over after Frankfurt's first-leg win, but first-half Kozue Ando and Dzsenifer Marozsan goals emphasised their dominance.
A Mandy Islacker hat-trick, Laura Storzel's effort and a late Jana Lober penalty completed the 7-0 victory.
The win keeps Frankfurt coach Colin Bell's hopes of winning a treble alive.
Bell, the former Leicester City defender, has already guided his side to the semi-final of their DFB Cup defence, with Frankfurt also sitting third in the league table, just two points off the summit.
For a Bristol side that is yet to start their Women's Super League campaign, defeat sees them exit their second competition inside a week, having been beaten by WSL 2 side Everton in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Tuesday.
The Vixens were the last British side to be knocked out of Europe's top club competition, following Glasgow City's 7-0 aggregate loss to Paris St-Germain on Saturday.
Bristol boss Dave Edmondson admitted before the match that all his side has left to play for Europe was pride against the the three-time Champions League winners and seven-time German Bundesliga champions.
However, their hopes of rescuing anything from their quarter-final took a heavy blow early on as Ando met a neat low pass across goal from captain Kerstin Garefrekes with a sliding finish into an empty net.
Marozsan coolly doubled the German side's lead, punishing Bristol for failing deal with danger in the box before taking the ball away from keeper Mary Earps and beating her at the near post.
Veronica Boquete and Jessica Fishlock hit the woodwork after the break, but it was only a momentary reprieve as Islacker added a treble to make it 5-0.
Storzel fired home another on 87 minutes, but there was still time for Lober to net their seventh from the spot after Bristol captain Grace McCatty brought Ana Maria Crnogorcevic down in the box.
