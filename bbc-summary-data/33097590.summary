Sir Roger Moore, who appeared with him in The Man with the Golden Gun and had known him since 1948, was among those sharing their thoughts on Twitter.
"It's terribly [sad] when you lose an old friend, and Christopher Lee was one of my oldest," said Moore.
Director Tim Burton called him "the last of his kind - a true legend - who I'm fortunate to have called a friend."
Burton said it had been "an honour and pleasure" to work with Sir Christopher on five films - Sleepy Hollow, Corpse Bride, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Alice In Wonderland and Dark Shadows.
"Christopher has been an enormous inspiration to me my entire life... He will continue to inspire me and I'm sure countless others for generations to come," said Burton.
Prime Minister David Cameron said: "Saddened to hear of Sir Christopher Lee's death, a titan of Golden Age of Cinema & distinguished WW2 veteran who'll be greatly missed."
Singer and photographer Bryan Adams shared a portrait he took of the star, with the words, "What a sad day for the world to lose this incredible actor and human being."
The actor's Lord Of The Rings co-stars also paid tribute - Dominic Monaghan said on Twitter: "So so sorry to hear that Christopher Lee has passed away. He was a fascinating person. Threw a Bic pen into a tree in front of me."
Elijah Wood, who played Frodo Baggins in the film trilogy, wrote: "An extraordinary man and life lead, Sir Christopher Lee. You were an icon, and a towering human being with stories for days. We'll miss you."
In honour of another of Sir Christopher's famous roles, Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, Mayor of London Boris Johnson posted a picture of himself brandishing a light sabre alongside the actor.
Johnson wrote: "Really sad to hear about the death of Christopher Lee, one of the greatest British actors and a master of the macabre."
Star Wars director George Lucas said: "Christopher was a great British actor of the old school. A true link to cinema's past and a real gentleman. We will miss him."
Film buff Jonathan Ross said: "So sad to hear that Sir Christopher Lee has died. A great actor, a great star, a surprisingly good singer and a lovely, lovely man."
Bafta's chief executive Amanda Berry was Sir Christopher's agent for six years during her first job as a theatrical agent.
She told BBC 5 Live the actor had "incredibly high standards and always wanted to be the best he could be."
"He always played a brilliant baddie," she added, "I would never want to pigeon hole him as he was a genuinely brilliant actor."
Berry said the actor and music fan, who recorded several heavy metal albums, "was like an honorary grandfather to me, and offered to sing at my wedding. "
Many who had grown up watching Sir Christopher on screen also paid tribute, including Reece Shearsmith, who wrote: "Very upset to learn that Sir Christopher Lee has passed away. An amazing gentleman who brought us so many iconic roles. He will be missed."
Paddy Considine called him "a true legend", while Mark Gatiss tweeted a link to a portrait he had once commissioned of the actor.
"The great, always criminally underrated Sir Christopher Lee has left us," wrote Gatiss. "A Titan of cinema and a huge part of my youth. Farewell."
