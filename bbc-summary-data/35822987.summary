The 29-year-old England international has made 13 appearances for the Tigers this campaign.
"He had surgery to correct a problem he has with a disc so he won't play again this season," director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
"It's pretty minor surgery and he'll make a full recovery, but the timing of it is pretty average."
Youngs has not featured at international level for England since the 2015 World Cup after being left out of their squad for the Six Nations by new head coach Eddie Jones.
