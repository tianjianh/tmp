Asked if he would travel to Doha for this year's World Championships, Sagan said: "We will see."
The Slovakian, speaking after finishing third overall in the Eneco Tour, added: "I still have to think about it. It's been a long season."
His absence could help British 2011 world champion Mark Cavendish, who would be suited to the flat course.
Sagan, who rides for Saxo-Tinkoff, added: "I'm tired. I have a lot of things to do. I'm happy the season is almost finished."
The UCI Road World Championships take place between 9 and 16 October in Doha.
