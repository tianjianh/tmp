[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from John Egan and Harlee Dean helped Brentford beat Championship play-off hopefuls Sheffield Wednesday.

Egan gave the Bees a deserved lead, heading in past Owls keeper Kieren Westwood from Ryan Woods' free-kick.
Dean then doubled the advantage from another set-piece before the break, heading home from Jota's corner.
Fernando Forestieri curled in for the hosts from 25 yards out in second-half added time, but the Owls could not find an equaliser.
Bees keeper Dan Bentley had twice denied Forestieri earlier on, diving low to keep out the Italian's shot after Sam Winnall had seen an effort blocked, before making an acrobatic save to keep out a free-kick.
Forestieri had a penalty appeal turned away, while Jordan Rhodes also had an effort cleared off the line and Steven Fletcher headed against the post as Wednesday's run of four successive wins came to an end.
The Owls stay sixth despite the result, while Brentford climb to 14th after a first win in four matches, 10 points clear of relegation with 14 games to play.
One negative for Dean Smith's side was the loss of midfielder Josh McEachran to injury just before half-time.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"The referee in the first half was a disaster. A very poor performance, he made everybody nervous, he made the fans nervous, he made my players nervous and he made me nervous.
"He didn't see a clear penalty, he didn't see a block on (Vincent) Sasso for their second goal and there were a lot of faults and little things that made everyone nervous.
"We can achieve a very good position, but the referee was very poor, these are the facts.
"I hope in the future we can achieve a good position, but I hope we have more luck. The referee was very, very poor, I am not judging, I am just talking facts."
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"We knew it would be tough here but I thought first half we controlled it. We deserved to go in at the break in front.
"We had a number of chances in the second half to break and create better opportunities and when you don't get that third goal, it leaves them thinking they can get something.
"They have missed some chances that they would expect to score and we have defended wilfully and in the end it took a piece of magic from Forestieri to get past us."
