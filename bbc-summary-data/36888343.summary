Coventry Bees: Speedway team offered new lease on stadium

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry Bees will continue to race at Brandon Stadium for another year after being offered a new lease from 2017.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Elite League speedway side previously feared their future relied on ground share deal.
After talks with the new landowner, who plans to develop the site for housing, there is the possibility of a further two-year extension to the new lease.
Bees owner Mick Horton, however, admits the club's long-term future remains "a concern".
"There can be no doubt that this offer has given the speedway team some security in the short-term," Horton told the club website.
