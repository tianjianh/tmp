Van driver acquitted of Lockerbie death crash charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A van driver has been acquitted in court of causing the death of a workmate by careless driving on the A74(M) near Lockerbie.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Brown, 52, of Motherwell, died in an accident on the motorway in August 2015.
Graeme Brett, 35, of Glasgow, had maintained a not guilty plea throughout a four-day trial at Dumfries Sheriff Court.
A jury returned a verdict of not proven on the charge.
Mr Brett had denied driving carelessly, failing to maintain a proper lookout ahead and crashing into the back of a lorry.
The court was told that the two men had been window fitting in Carlisle and had been heading north to Motherwell where Mr Brown lived when the accident occurred.
Mr Brett had told the police: "Paul wanted to get home that day and we had left early."
