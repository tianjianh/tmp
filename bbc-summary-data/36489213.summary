The Queen at 91: Why does she have two birthdays?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Queen is officially celebrating her 91st birthday today - even though she was actually born in April...

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It's not that she's taken months to figure out what to do for her birthday, but it's because she has two - a real one and an official one.
Queen Elizabeth II was born on 21 April 1926 but has an official birthday usually celebrated on the second Saturday of June.
So why two birthdays for the Queen and how does she celebrate them?
Official celebrations to mark a King or Queen's birthday in the UK have often been held on a day that isn't their actual birthday.
Usually the official birthday happens in summer because there is a better chance of good weather in the UK during the summer months.
The two birthday tradition was started more than 250 years ago by King George II in 1748.
How does she mark her birthdays?
The Queen usually spends her actual birthday privately, but the day is marked publicly by gun salutes in central London.
On her official birthday, Her Majesty is joined by other members of the Royal Family at the Trooping the Colour parade.
Hundreds of officers, horses and musicians take part in the event in London.
The parade starts at the Queen's official residence, Buckingham Palace, along The Mall to Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall, near to Downing Street, and back again.
