Support workers will be on hand in some of Glasgow's busiest nightclubs over the festive period to help revellers who have had too much to drink.

The Club Crews will also help those who have lost friends, received unwanted attention or are feeling emotional.
The pilot project is being run by Best Bar None, the national scheme to raise standards on licensed premises, and the alcohol education charity Drinkaware.
It will run at three Glasgow venues - SWG3, The Garage and The Cathouse.
Crew members will work in pairs at these large venues, which cater for more than 500 customers.
They will introduce themselves to people who are queuing to enter and let them know that they are on hand to help.
As each club fills up, crew members will work with management, security and bar teams to ensure customers have a good time.
They will also routinely check areas such as toilets and stairwells and offer practical support such as tissues, water or first aid to anyone who has had too much to drink.
Elaine Hindal, chief executive of Drinkaware, said the Club Crew initiative would help young people have a good time safely over the festive period.
"We know this scheme can work well to help reduce the number of young adults experiencing vulnerability through alcohol on a night out," she said.
"The trained Drinkaware Crew can bring a new dynamic to venues, which means people in vulnerable situations have someone who is there to spend as much time as is needed, to make sure they are looked after and that they can either enjoy the rest of their night or get home safely."
Jonathan Dawson, operations manager at SWG3, said he was delighted to be part of the pilot scheme.
He said: "It is vital for me to put the welfare of our customers at the centre of our operation and I feel that the crew adds to and augments what we already have in place.
"It gives me an extra layer of service and safety. We want our customers to come and have a good time and, most importantly, to get home safely."
Glasgow City Council leader Frank McAveety added: "The new Club Crews are another Scottish first for our thriving night-time economy, which is so successful due to the high quality of venues.
"This festive season will be exceptionally busy and the new Drinkaware Crews will complement existing safety measures over that period and going forward."
As well as the Club Crews, Glasgow also runs Nitezones over the festive period where wardens ensure taxi rank queues are orderly and move quickly.
Glasgow's Street Pastors also offer help to anyone who is lost or vulnerable in the city centre at night.
