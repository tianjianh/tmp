Melanie Hall: 'Significant' appeal leads

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives investigating the murder of Melanie Hall have received "potentially significant information" following a television appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The clerical worker went missing 20 years ago after a night out in Bath.
Her remains were found in 2009 on a slip road at the side of the M5 near Bristol.
Det Sup Andy Bevan said police received 20 calls after he revealed on Wednesday they had found DNA on an item found close to where her body was discovered.
Miss Hall, 25, who worked at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, had been on a night out at Cadillacs nightclub when she was last seen on 9 June 1996.
A black bin liner containing her bones and skull was found by a workman clearing vegetation next to a slip-road at junction 14 of the M5, near Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, on 5 October 2009.
Nine people have been arrested in connection with the case since the investigation began, but no-one has been charged.
"We have officers and staff following up on information we've received following the Crimewatch Roadshow appeal," Mr Bevan said.
"Some of the calls provided names of potential suspects, some related to the outstanding items of Melanie's property which have never been found and others were reporting suspicious activity around the motorway slipway where Melanie's remains were found.
"We're extremely grateful to everyone who has responded so far but we still need more information from the public.
"I firmly believe someone out there knows who killed Melanie and now is the time for them to come forward to bring some relief to her family, who've been through 20 years of heartache."
