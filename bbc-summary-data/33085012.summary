Two prison guards have been charged over the death of a black inmate in New York City, prosecutors in Manhattan have announced.

The charges stem from the beating death of Ronald Spear, 52, in 2012 who was at Rikers Island awaiting trial for burglary.
New York medical officials ruled the death a homicide, but Bronx prosecutors had refused to pursue charges.
Spear had been complaining of medical issues when he was kicked repeatedly.
A verbal argument broke out in the jail's infirmary between Spear and a guard when he requested a doctor's visit.
Brian Coll, a former guard, forced Spear to the ground, placed him in handcuffs, and then repeatedly kicked him in the chest and head, causing his death, according to medical officials.
He is charged with depriving Spear of his civil rights, obstruction of justice, and other counts.
Byron Taylor, a current guard, helped to restrain Spear and lied about his role to investigators, say court documents filed on Wednesday.
He is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice through his efforts to cover up the assault.
Anthony Torres, a former office, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Spears' family said they hope today's charges "will bring justice for the officers who killed Ronald and covered up his death and also shine a window of accountability into the violence and corruption that pervades Rikers Island".
Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara said when announcing the charges that "Rikers inmates, although walled off from the rest of society, are not walled off from the protections of our constitution".
