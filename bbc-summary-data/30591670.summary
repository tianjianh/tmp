Ex-soldier escapes Operation Elveden misconduct trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former soldier who agreed to obtain information from an army barracks for a newspaper will not face a trial, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former private, who is in her 20s, has accepted a conditional caution for misconduct in a public office.
The woman has agreed to make a payment of Â£40 to an armed forces charity.
She was arrested at her Nottinghamshire home under the Metropolitan Police's Operation Elveden inquiry into alleged corrupt payments to public officials.
In a statement, the CPS outlined details of the offence but did not name the newspaper or the barracks.
CPS lawyer Gregor McGill said: ''The evidence in this case was considered very carefully and although there was sufficient evidence to prosecute this offence, when considering the public interest it was decided that a conditional caution was an appropriate course of action.
''In accepting a conditional caution, an individual accepts responsibility for the offending set out.''
The former soldier was arrested in September. She was the 87th person to be held as part of Operation Elveden, which was launched after the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World newspaper.
The operation was established to investigate allegations of inappropriate payments to police but was widened in January 2012 to include other public officials. It is being overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
