Rangers: Midfielder Dean Shiels leaves Ibrox

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Midfielder Dean Shiels has been released by Rangers at the end of his four-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old Northern Irishman joined the Glasgow club in 2012 after leaving Kilmarnock.
Shiels made 43 appearances last season as Rangers won the Scottish Championship and promotion, as well as the Petrofac Training Cup.
The former Arsenal, Hibernian and Doncaster Rovers midfielder previously helped Rangers win Leagues Two and One.
Shiels has been capped by his country 14 times but has not been chosen since joining Rangers and failed to make their squad for the Euro 2016 finals.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton has already recruited four midfielders this summer - Joey Barton from Burnley, Jordan Rossiter from Liverpool and Josh Windass and Matt Crooks from Accrington Stanley.
Nicky Law and David Templeton have been released by Rangers along with forward Nicky Clark.
