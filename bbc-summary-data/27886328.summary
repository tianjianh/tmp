New corners were added to lengthen the Norfolk circuit in 2011, and Australian Josh Brookes produced a record 99.07mph Superbike lap last weekend.
"The new Snetterton 300 layout provides for great racing," series director Stuart Higgs told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"We're now just under a 100mph lap record. It makes us even more eager to come back and smash that barrier."
More than 40,000 spectators watched Shane Byrne extend his championship lead to 45 points with a double victory in the round-three event at Snetterton.
The track revamp cost Â£2.5m and Higgs believes it has resulted in more exciting racing.
"There were three changes to the lead in just one lap at the weekend, such is the nature of the circuit," he said.
"We love coming there. We get a great reception from a hugely knowledgeable crowd. I'm sure many will be back for the British Touring Cars round later this year."
