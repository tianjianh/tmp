The Chinese lantern festival was held in the UK for the first time in London in 2015 but has been taken to Yorkshire and Birmingham for the second year.
The displays in Roundhay Park feature more than 30 large handmade lanterns using more than 40,000 light bulbs.
The event, which will also raise funds for the Jane Tomlinson Appeal, runs until 2 January.

Ian Xiang, the festival's co-founder and creative director, said: "Lantern festivals have been running for more than 2,000 years across Asia, but they are still new to the West.
"After the success of our first in London last year we had to come to Yorkshire.
"Roundhay Park is an amazing place for us to illuminate and celebrate both Christmas and the upcoming Chinese New Year."
The company is also running a lantern festival in Birmingham Botanical Gardens and an event in London's Chiswick House Gardens in 2017.
