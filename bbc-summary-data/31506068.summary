Fukushima PM's anti-Wylfa campaign during Anglesey visit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The prime minister of Japan at the time of the Fukushima nuclear disaster is visiting Anglesey to campaign against the new Wylfa power plant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Naoto Kan resigned after Fukushima was hit by a tsunami in 2011, causing radiation leaks.
He has since become an anti-nuclear campaigner and will arrive in Wales next Wednesday to speak in the Senedd.
He will then travel to Anglesey to urge residents to fight the planned Â£8bn Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant.
An Anglesey council spokesman said that as well as hosting a public meeting on Thursday, Mr Kan will be addressing members of the authority.
"During the meeting we will also be informing him about our energy island programme and its aims," the spokesman added.
It is hoped the nuclear project will boost the island's economy.
