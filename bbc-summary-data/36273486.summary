The Richard Burnett collection of instruments from the 17th to 19th Century went under the hammer on Wednesday.
The auction in Newbury saw strong bidding with some items more than doubling their estimated guide price.
The instruments were bought by collectors in the UK, China, USA and Germany.
Proceeds from the auction, which topped £835,462, will go to the Finchcocks Charity, which works to keep historical instruments in playing condition.
Dr Graham Wells, specialist at Dreweatts and Bloomsbury Auctions, said: "This has stood out as one of the most exciting auctions that I have worked on."
The collection was put up for sale after Finchcocks Museum in Goudhurst, Kent - owned by Mr Burnett - closed in December following his retirement.
