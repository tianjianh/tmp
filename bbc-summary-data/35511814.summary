The victim, aged in his 40s, was hit in the leg after two men forced their way into his home in Sible Hedingham, Essex, in the early hours of Saturday.
They threatened their victim before shooting him through a door after he locked himself in the bedroom, said police.
The men then fled the house without taking anything.
Police found the wounded man after being called just before 04:40 GMT.
"He locked himself in a bedroom and it is believed a gun was then fired through the door injuring him," said Det Sgt Mark Cadd, of Essex Police.
"This was an extremely distressing incident for the victim and he has suffered life-changing injuries which have left him in great pain.
"I urgently need to find the men responsible."
Any witnesses who spotted anything suspicious in the village should contact police, he said.
The two suspects are white, in their 20s, of slim build and wore dark clothing. One is described as bald.
Officers are carrying out a forensic search at the scene and house-to-house inquiries are under way.
