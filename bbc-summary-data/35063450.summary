Police have been called to incidents in six secondary schools in Aberdeenshire and Moray recently where knives have been recovered, it has been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said seven secondary pupils had been reported after the incidents in Turriff, Alford, Inverurie, Elgin, Buckie and Keith in the past month.
No-one was injured.
Directors of education at Moray and Aberdeenshire councils have written to parents about what is being done.
All the incidents have happened since the death of 16-year-old Bailey Gwynne who was stabbed at Cults Academy in Aberdeen in October.
A 16-year-old boy has been charged with his murder.
Maria Walker, Aberdeenshire Council's director of education and children's services, said: "Our aim is to work with partners and parents to ensure we all keep our young people, as well as our staff, as safe as possible.
"It is in all of our interests to keep people safe from harm and education authorities will continue to review current practices and procedures to ensure our combined actions help to reduce incidents.
"Extensive work has taken place across the area to roll out anti-bullying measures and we also work closely with Police Scotland on campaigns to tackle anti-social behaviour and mitigate offensive actions.
"We have around 38,000 pupils in Aberdeenshire and the majority of our pupils are well-behaved.  These incidents are rare and please be assured that when they do occur, action is taken to deal with them swiftly and appropriately."
Laurence Findlay, Moray Council's corporate director of education and social care, said: "We must work together to keep young people and staff safe from harm."
Ch Supt Campbell Thomson, the Police Scotland divisional commander for Aberdeenshire and Moray, said: "I can confirm we have very recently been called to six incidents within secondary schools in Turriff, Alford, Inverurie, Elgin, Buckie and Keith where knives have been recovered and seven secondary school pupils have been reported.
"Thankfully no one has been injured and all incidents were brought to our attention by school staff.
"We have very positive relationships with all schools in our area and will continue to work with them and our partners to ensure we promote a safe learning environment and raise awareness of the dangers of such behaviour.
"Let me make it absolutely clear carrying a knife or any other potential weapon into a school is against the law and anyone caught doing this will face serious consequences.  The safety and well-being of all in our communities is absolutely paramount.
"Anyone with any information regarding instances of this kind should contact the school in the first instance or in an emergency the police."
