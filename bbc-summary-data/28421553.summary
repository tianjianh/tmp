Borders workmen take home unexploded bomb

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A controlled explosion has been carried out on a World War Two bomb which two workmen took home after finding it on a remote Borders hillside.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair made the discovery while erecting fences above Westruther on Monday.
They put the device in the back of their van, which they left outside a colleague's house in Earlston.
The man's father noticed it and a bomb disposal unit later carried out a controlled explosion in a nearby field.
Police said there was no danger to the public at any time.
