Roosters coach Trent Robinson described Pearce's behaviour as "unacceptable".
The club are investigating and have informed the NRL.
In the video, Pearce, 26, appears to try to kiss a woman, who accuses him of wetting himself after rejecting his advances, before allegedly simulating a sex act on a dog.
"At the Roosters, we can't accept that and we won't," said Robinson. "Over the next couple of days we will come to a conclusion with the NRL."
The incident is said to have happened at a house party on Australia Day.
An NRL spokesman said the league's integrity unit "will work with the Roosters to ensure the matter is dealt with appropriately".
Half-back Pearce, the son of rugby league legend and NRL commissioner Wayne Pearce, looks certain to miss the trip to England for the World Club Series clash with St Helens at Langtree Park on 19 February.
In a statement, the Roosters said Pearce, who has played State of Origin rugby for New South Wales, will not train until the club "concludes its internal investigation".
In 2014, Pearce was fined Â£9,800 and suspended after an incident in which he was arrested and ejected from a Sydney nightclub.
England coach Steve McNamara is assistant coach at the Roosters.
