Manager Bob Bradley says December will be "critical" to his aim of saving Swansea City from relegation.

Bradley picked up his first win last Saturday as Swansea beat Crystal Palace in dramatic fashion to climb off the bottom of the Premier League.
After this weekend's trip to face Tottenham, the Swans play five of the bottom 12 teams.
"I think it's a critical period between now and the beginning of the new year. There's a lot of work to do," he said.

"They're all important matches. The opportunity to turn things around.
"To put a bad start behind us and really give us a bit more belief that we're ready to finish the season in a strong way."
Bradley confirmed that the returning Brian Flynn, now appointed club scout, will have a say in January's transfer dealings.
"Recruitment starts with people who can spot talent," Bradley said.  "Brian's track record in that regard is special.
"Having that kind of football man (back) is fantastic for all of us."
Bradley said the club is looking at bringing in "some smart additions" when the January transfer window opens.
He added: "I would not think we're talking about that many moves. We feel there is a nucleus here that is strong. We want to add to that."
Bradley revealed the players have been working hard on their defensive play after conceding 14 goals in the American's six games in charge.
"It's an important part of us becoming a complete team, the ability to win games 1-0," he said.
"You can dissect all the goals, but in the end there's a mentality of being a team that's hard to play against and about being a team that knows how to keep clean sheets.
"We've got to find a way of making that part of who we are."
