Wind damaged sign closes M4 motorway in Newport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The M4 has been closed westbound near Newport after an overhead sign became loose in high winds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The carriageway was shut from junction 24 Coldra to 28 at Tredegar Park.
Officials said it led to very slow traffic as motorists were forced to come off the motorway on Friday night.
A diversion using the A48 through Newport was put in place and the fire service tweeted that the M4 would stay closed until further notice while emergency repairs were carried out.
