Acclaimed artists from all over the world are exhibiting films at night time screenings in the Southside district of the city until Sunday.
They include a study of stray cats drinking from bowls of milk left outdoors by the artist in Berlin's Mitte district, and a screen projecting two alternating sentences which are interspersed with everyday images captured from Birmingham streets - to  "emphasise the randomness of fate".
Called About Town, exhibits include contributions from from Cornelia Parker, Santiago Sierra, Beat Streuli, Gillian Wearing and Yang Zhenzhong.
