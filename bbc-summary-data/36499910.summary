Mike Ashley loses legal challenge to SFA 'dual interest' fine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mike Ashley has lost a legal challenge to the Scottish Football Association (SFA) over a fine relating to a breach of rules on dual ownership of clubs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sports Direct owner has shares in Rangers and also wholly owns Newcastle United. The SFA fined him £1,000 over this dual interest.
Mr Ashley launched a judicial review in a bid to have the fine overturned.
After hearing the case at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, judge Lord Brodie ruled the SFA was correct to fine him.
The SFA had originally fined Mr Ashley £7,500 but reduced this to £1,000 after he appealed.
Mr Ashley later launched a judicial review in a bid to have the fine revoked.
His legal team claimed the SFA had not applied the principles of "natural justice" when dealing with him.
In his judgement, Lord Brodie wrote: "I shall uphold the second plea in law for the respondent. The petition is dismissed."
