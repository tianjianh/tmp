Mr Richards, 19, from Wednesbury, was among 38 killed when a Tunisian student linked to Islamic State extremists opened fire on a beach in Sousse on Friday.
He was a Walsall FC fan, football referee and student at the University of Worcester.
Chief executive of the Birmingham County Football Association, Chad Ehlertsen, said "it just makes you smile every time you think about Joel."
"He was just a leader of young people; a good organiser, a good communicator and an extremely talented young referee," Mr Ehlertsen said.
