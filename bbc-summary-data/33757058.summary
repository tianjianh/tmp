[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Timothy Malone, 67, from Hampshire, was on holiday with his wife Yvonne when their Rover car and a Kia Proceed crashed  near Reynoldston on Friday night.
Mrs Malone, 62, remains stable at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. A 19-year-old man arrested in connection with the crash has been released on bail.
Mr Malone was described as an "outstanding" father and husband.
The couple's son Joe Malone, 32, said his father "would do everything with mum", enjoyed going on walks and was a keen mountain biker.
"We are just devastated," he said.
"He was about to retire and enjoy the rest of his life pretty soon, and they were going to buy a motor home and go see the world."
Two men who were passengers in the Kia car were treated for minor injuries in hospital and have since been discharged.
