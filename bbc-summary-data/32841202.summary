Swansea council's free faith school bus cut overruled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council's decision to cut free school transport for some faith school pupils in Swansea has been quashed by the high court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea council wanted to end free travel if a mainstream school was closer to a pupil's home.
But a legal challenge was raised by Bishop Vaughan Catholic School, a prospective student at the secondary school and the Diocese of Menevia.
On Friday in Cardiff, Mr Justice Wyn Williams overruled the council.
Bishop Vaughan Catholic School, which is the only faith secondary in the area, argued some students travelled for an hour and 50 minutes to reach school.
School Bursar Laura Howden Evans said: "The court's decision has brought tears of joy and relief to the eyes of parents, staff at the school and the wider faith community.
"Throughout the consultation process, we repeatedly warned the council that its actions would have unintended, but very serious, racially discriminatory consequences.
"Our concerns were simply brushed aside.
"Had the new policy stood, children from some of the poorest families in Wales would have been denied a faith-based education for the very worst of reasons.
"It will now remain open to them. We feel truly vindicated."
Bernard Stuart, Director of Education at the Diocese of Menevia said: "The judgement recognises and upholds the legitimate needs of those in the community for whom the suitable school is a church school."
The council has 21 days to lodge an appeal against the decision.
The authority is now considering its implications.
A spokesperson said: "We believed it was important to defend a democratic decision taken by councillors to no longer continue with this area of discretionary free transport.
"The original decision contributed to savings in one of the few discretionary areas of spending within the overall education budget so resources could be prioritised on classrooms, teaching and facilities."
They added: "Owing to the legal process there has been a period of uncertainty for young people and the schools involved and we'd like to apologise for that."
