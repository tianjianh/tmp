Police believe the 17-year-old boy may have been held in a silver van during the ordeal.
The assault happened in Selbourne Square just before 14:30 BST on Saturday. Police do not believe it was a random attack.
A woman in her 30s and a 14-year-old boy also sustained minor injuries during the incident.
Following the attack, the three victims made their way to the Shell petrol station on Godstone Hill where they called the ambulance service, police said.
Det Con Tom Gilbert, said: "Due to the seriousness of the injuries the victim sustained, we have yet to establish some vital parts of the investigation."
Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
