HIA inquiry: Good Shepherd Sisters face abuse allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A congregation of nuns faces allegations of child abuse, a public inquiry has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ten people have made claims to the Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) inquiry about the Good Shepherd Sisters.
Between 1922 and 1995, the nuns cared for 4,287 children and adults at homes in Belfast, Londonderry and Newry in County Down.
The inquiry is examining child abuse in residential homes in Northern Ireland.
The number of complaints has been described as "very small".
Five people who have made the complaints against the nuns have also alleged abuse in care homes run by other organisations.
The claims against the Good Shepherd Sisters centre on alleged emotional abuse, slapping and the quality of food provided in homes during spells in the 1960s and 1970s.
There is one allegation of sexual abuse, but the inquiry heard this was against a priest, not a nun.
The Good Shepherd Sisters are challenging the allegations.
Joseph Aiken, counsel to the inquiry, said that in stark contrast to claims against other institutions, the HIA inquiry had received a "very limited" volume of police material linked to the complaints against the Good Shepherd Sisters.
He added that there had been no complaints made to police against the nuns before the inquiry was established.
The Good Shepherd Sisters have said the allegations have caused "considerable sadness and stress" to the entire congregation.
But they have said they will to listen "with respect" to those who come before the inquiry.
Mr Aiken said a number of former residents are due to appear before the inquiry to "speak warmly" about the nuns and the care received from them.
The HIA inquiry is investigating the extent of abuse in religious and state-run institutions over a spell of more than 70 years.
Its chairman, the retired senior High Court judge Sir Anthony Hart, is due to submit his report to the Northern Ireland Executive by 17 January 2017.
