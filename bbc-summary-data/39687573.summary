Wenger, 67, has come under more scrutiny this term than at any other point in his 21-year reign at Arsenal.
The Gunners beat Manchester City 2-1 to reach a third FA Cup final in four years and Wales international Ramsey wants to win the trophy for Wenger.
"We've let him down at times this season," Ramsey said.
"But he's kept believing in us and the quality we have and we wanted to get to the final and now hopefully we can go on and win it for him and for ourselves.
"I absolutely love this competition we've been quite successful in recent years and you can see the passion that the players play with."
Some sections of Arsenal fans have protested against Wenger in recent months with the Gunners lying in seventh place in the Premier League and after an early Champions League exit.
The Frenchman is out of contract at the end of the season and has been offered a new two-year deal, although he is yet to announce whether he will continue.
Ramsey's mistake led to Manchester City taking the lead in the semi-final but Nacho Monreal and Alexis Sanchez's extra-time winner secured Arsenal an FA Cup final against Chelsea.
"I made the mistake for their goal, that was painful for myself," Ramsey said.
"But I know in these situations that you have to respond to it and you can't let these things get to you.
"I carried on going and trying to work my socks off, get into position and tackle and you know, ultimately, it paid off.
"It was important to win to have something to look forward to at the end of the season but now we have another seven cup finals to try and finish off and get into that top four.
"We know we're more than capable of doing that and winning every single game but we're going to have to be so focussed in every single minute."
