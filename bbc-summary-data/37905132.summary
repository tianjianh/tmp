New Robins director of football Tim Sherwood oversaw a 3-0 win over Charlton on Saturday but shifted to the dugout as the visitors seized control.
Jai Reason's deflected strike set the Spitfires on their way and Andy Drury's classy dinked finish doubled the lead.
Mikael Mandron's penalty made it 3-0 and, although Nathan Delfouneso netted late on, the visitors held on.
Eastleigh, who are ninth in the National League, will host FC Halifax from National League North in the second round.
The Spitfires, managed by former Rotherham and Tranmere boss Ronnie Moore, have now reached the second round for the third year in a row, having never reached that stage beforehand.
They notched their second win against a Football League side in emphatic fashion defying the two division gap between the two sides.
Eastleigh manager Ronnie Moore told BBC Radio Solent:
"Not only have we won, we've played them off the park.
"It was just unbelievable when you consider they're a League One club. For us to come and perform the way we did today, if we can believe in ourselves, we've got a hell of a team here.
"It's a fantastic night for Eastleigh Football Club, no doubt about it."
