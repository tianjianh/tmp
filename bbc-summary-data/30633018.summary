A woman who set up a charity to help children in Dorset cope with the loss of a loved one has been appointed MBE in the New Year's Honours.

Margaret Hannibal founded Mosaic with a colleague seven-and-a-half years ago to provide counselling and support to bereaved children under 18.
Elsewhere, chemist Dr Simon Campbell, from Poole, has been knighted.
He led a team in Kent which started and oversaw research on Viagra while with drug company Pfizer.
Mother-of-four Mrs Hannibal said the Mosaic charity, based in Milborne St Andrew, was established after recognising a gap in services for young people.
She had previously worked in a hospice where support was available for grieving families but in other circumstances children had few options.
She said: "For a lot of them the big issue is anger, why has this happened to me? It can come out at school where children are at risk of getting excluded.
"Some of our work is based around training schools. We accept referrals from them as well as from doctors and health professionals."
Counsellors from Mosaic use therapeutic and creative techniques to help children express their emotions.
"It's amazing to see that when children are creating something they will start talking to you," Mrs Hannibal added.
She said the charity suffered a "rocky patch" about 18 months ago but thanks to local authority funding and successful applications for Lottery and Children in Need money it is now doing well.
Other honours in Dorset included foster carers Michael and Valerie Andrews, from Shaftesbury, who were appointed MBE for services to children and families.
Volunteer and RNLI staff association chairman Capt Hugh Fogarty, from Poole, receives an MBE for services to flood rescue and maritime safety.
Sara Jacson was appointed MBE for services to young people in Shaftesbury.
