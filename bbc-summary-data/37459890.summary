[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 3-0 Braintree Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Braintree manager Hakan Hayrettin saw his side get thrashed by Lincoln City at Sincil Bank.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side struck inside three minutes, as Matt Rhead fed Nathan Arnold to net under Will Puddy with confidence.
Hayrettin's men showed some resolve by keeping the back door shut for the rest of the half.
However old flaws resurfaced in the second half, as the Imps' Terry Hawkridge swung in a corner for Luke Waterfall to head in via the post.
Late on, Arnold found substitute Jack Muldoon with a clever free-kick, and the striker drove the ball into the corner.
