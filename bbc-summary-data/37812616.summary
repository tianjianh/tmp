The match was referee Bobby Madden's first since undergoing treatment for thyroid cancer.
Brechin's loss meant Alloa could have moved second, but they were only able to draw at home to Albion Rovers.
Airdrieonians went fourth by beating East Fife, Peterhead overcame Stranraer and bottom side Stenhousemuir defeated Queen's Park.
After a goalless first half at Glebe Park, Livi took control with strikes in quick succession by Liam Buchanan and Jackson Longridge, while Shaun Byrne added a late third.
In Clackmannanshire, there were no goals between Alloa and Rovers, who dropped to fifth.
Airdrie needed only one goal against the Fifers, Andy Ryan's early header, but both sides ended with 10 men.
East Fife's Jonathan Page received two bookings, while visiting substitute Sean McIntosh was dismissed late on for a challenge on Kevin Smith.
Stranraer also lost a man to two yellow cards, Willie Gibson sent off before Rory McAllister and Scott Brown fired in goals for Peterhead.
The gap at the bottom is down to one point after Stenny won 3-0 at Hampden.
Mark Gilhaney's shot put them ahead in the first half before Queen's Park's Gregor Fotheringham was sent off after fouling Ally Roy in the box.
Colin McMenamin converted the resulting penalty before Roy struck the visitors' third.
