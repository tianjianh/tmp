[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lloyds Bank to close 10 branches in Wales by April 2017

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten Lloyds Bank branches in Wales will close, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The firm cited the "changing ways" customers do their banking, saying more now use internet or telephone services.
Branches are at Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, Crickhowell, Powys, Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, Canton, Cardiff, Pontarddulais, Swansea and Tregaron in Ceredigion.
Newport, Milford Haven and Fishguard banks in Pembrokeshire and Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taff, are also hit.
Lloyds announced in July that it planned to close 200 branches UK-wide by the end of next year.
The latest move follows anger from residents in Hawarden, Flintshire, when their branch was shut in July.
Closures will take place between March and April 2017, with a mobile service being launched to help users in eight of the areas pay bills, deposit money and withdraw cash.
However, this will not be available in Mountain Ash and Canton as the nearest alternative bank is less than four miles (6.4km) away.
