Adam Amin, who learnt to surf at Sidmouth in Devon, said it was like riding a "liquid mountain".
With only five years' experience, he surfed alongside professionals competing in 50ft (15m) waves in Maui, Hawaii.
Only a handful of UK surfers have taken on "Jaws", said surfing magazine Carve.
"I was totally surprised to see a British guy out there," said editor Steve England.
"The swell was peaking that day so to go out, paddle in and surf it is amazing."
Surf forecasting site Magic Seaweed describes "Jaws", where waves can top 60ft (18m), as "the most notorious spot on Maui" and "a wave most surfers are extremely unlikely to ride".
It adds: "As big wave surfing has developed, Jaws has maintained the biggest and baddest tag."
Mr Amin, said he had dreamt of taking on the giant wave since he started surfing.
After saving up enough money working as a life guard and repairing boards, he set off for Maui where he stayed with friends.

Mr Amin tried to get on some boats heading to the Pe'ahi Challenge contest site, but was turned back by security.
So he decided to paddle out on his own and was given a lift by US big wave surfer Greg Long and waited for his moment with about five other pro surfers.
"I saw a huge wave in the distance and I saw my opportunity to prove that I can surf Jaws so I turned around while all the others were paddling over the wave and caught this monster," he said.
"I caught it and rode down what seemed like riding down a liquid mountain. I got to the bottom and looked up. It was the size of two houses above me."
He said he was in "heaven" for the rest of the day and wants to return.
