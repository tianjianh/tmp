[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People in Stanford near Folkestone have been sent letters telling them Asian tiger mosquito eggs had been discovered nearby.
Public Health England said no further evidence of the insect had been detected.
It said there was "currently no risk to public health in the UK".
Jolyon Medlock, head of medical entomology at Public Health England (PHE), said: "We regularly monitor mosquito species and look for any which are new to the UK.
"Enhanced monitoring of the area was implemented and no further evidence of this mosquito has so far been found.
"As a precaution we advised the local authority to use insecticide as a means of control."
PHE confirmed the spraying of insecticide had been fully completed at the site.
The Zika infection has been linked to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains.
Public Health England said it would continue to monitor the situation closely.
Two years ago Public Health England set up traps at motorway service stations to monitor this species of mosquito over fears the insects could enter the UK on lorries from Europe. None was found.
