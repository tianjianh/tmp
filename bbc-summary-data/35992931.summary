[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morgan James Francis Hehir, 20, died after an attack at Pool Bank Recreational Park in Nuneaton on Halloween.
Miroslav Holan, 23, of Oak Lane, Bradford, previously pleaded guilty to theft at Warwickshire Magistrates Court.
He was given a 12 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months on 31 March.
Morgan's possessions were never found and his phone contained irreplaceable photographs and memories, said police.
The theft "caused further distress to Morgan's family", added Det Sgt Andy Denny of Warwickshire Police.
Three men have been charged with Mr Hehir's murder and will go on trial next month.
