Stoke City 1-1 West Bromwich Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salomon Rondon's injury-time equaliser earned West Brom a point at Stoke to deny the Potters their first league win of the season.

Stoke took the lead through Joe Allen when he poked home after West Brom's Jonny Evans nodded the ball down.
But Rondon headed a corner beyond keeper Lee Grant to thwart Stoke, who still move off the foot of the table.
In Tony Pulis' 1,000th game as a manager, his West Brom side created few chances before Rondon rescued them.
Erik Pieters had a penalty claim denied for Stoke in the second half, while Grant saved superbly from a header from the Baggies' James McClean.
Substitute Peter Crouch had gone close for the hosts before Allen's goal, but the dramatic finish means more frustration for boss Mark Hughes, whose side were knocked out of the EFL Cup by Hull in injury time on Wednesday.
Having just one point before kick-off and languishing at the foot of the table, it was hardly surprising Stoke looked tentative to begin with.
West Brom are a side who appear content to sit back away from home, and a lack of concerted threat from Stoke in the final third of the pitch added to the hosts' worries.
But Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri, Stoke's main creative forces, gradually asserted themselves as the game wore on.
The replacement of the mostly ineffective Wilfried Bony by Crouch went down well with the home fans, and brought greater urgency from Stoke, culminating in Allen's prodded finish from the six-yard line.
The Potters were much improved on their display in last week's 4-1 defeat at Crystal Palace, making Rondon's dramatic leveller from substitute Jonathan Leko's corner all the more galling.
West Brom's display in their manager's landmark game bore many of the hallmarks the Welshman, 58, has instilled in his sides in 24 years of management.
Defensive discipline, tenacity and the willingness to take what few chances fall their way are all traits of Pulis teams, and resulted here in what will be a satisfying point.
Crouch's arrival threatened to shake Evans' solid partnership with Gareth McAuley, but the way West Brom responded to that and Allen's goal will have delighted their boss.
Illness meant he did not have Saido Berahino to throw on from the bench, so Rondon's third goal of the season means Pulis can look forward to game 1,001 from a solid, mid-table position.
Stoke City manager Mark Hughes: "We feel deflated but it was a good performance from us.

"We're trying to be progressive and we fully deserved the three points. We got one and we have to take it.
"I was encouraged by the performance and we asked questions of them. It's another point on the board. We didn't do too much wrong. I can't complain about our play, they put everything into it.
"Points are like gold dust, so we've got something for our efforts."
West Brom manager Tony Pulis: "That was a deserved point. We conceded a scrappy goal but the reaction of the players was absolutely first class. In the last 20 minutes we really pressed and we got the point we deserved.

"I'm pleased because if we had lost I'd have been disappointed. We haven't got the array of talent like they have but the work-rate they put in was fantastic.
"We've got a fit group who never give up. We had to respond from going a goal down. I was so pleased with the attitude."
West Brom play the bottom-of-the-table side for the second week in a row when they visit Sunderland on Saturday, 1 October at 15:00 BST. And Hughes will be the manager revisiting old haunts when Stoke play Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, 2 October at 12:00 BST.
