[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were called to the school in South Lanarkshire on 21 December. It is understood parents were notified about the incident before the end of term.
South Lanarkshire Council said it was aware of the incident.
Police said a decision had still to be made on whether to refer the matter to a social work-led team or the Scottish Children's Reporter Administrator.
A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: "An 11-year-old male pupil at a primary school in South Lanarkshire has been referred to the Youth Justice Co-ordinator (a police officer within the Restorative Justice Department) for alleged drugs offences.
"A decision has still to be made as to disposal - whether a referral to the Early and Effective Intervention Co-ordinator - a multi-agency team with a social work lead - or a police report to the Scottish Children's Reporter Administrator."
