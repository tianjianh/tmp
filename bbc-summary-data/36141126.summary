Health manifestos - Welsh Liberal Democrats dissected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health is arguably the most important issue for many voters at next week's Welsh Assembly election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BBC Wales has asked some of the main medical and health organisations to give an examination to the parties' manifestos and give their critique of their policies.
Here is the dissection of the Welsh Liberal Democrats' manifesto:
The Royal College of Physicians welcomed commitments to:
However, it was concerned:
The RCN, which represents 25,000 nurses in Wales,  said the manifesto matches its own Time To Care campaign priorities in the following:
â€ƒ
The BMA represents 8,000 doctors in Wales.
Like
We will require health impact assessments (HIA) on policy decisions taken at all levels.
Legislating for mandatory HIAs would provide a significant contribution to improving the health and well-being of communities throughout Wales, at the same time as positioning Wales as a world leader in the application of public health policy.
When they have been undertaken, HIAs have helped to structure a systematic and objective approach to the development of certain plans, policies and projects in Wales. They have been successfully used to identify ways in which health benefits can be maximised and health risks minimised as schemes or policies have been taken forward.
HIAs have been successfully used to identify health inequalities, specifically in vulnerable groups, producing evidence-based recommendations for health improvement as well as identifying any gaps in service provision or delivery.
Their use has already proved that HIAs need not be overly burdensome. The first stage in the process can be a simple screening tool which determines whether an HIA would both be valuable and feasible within a particular decision-making context.
Dislike
We will abolish Public Health Wales and transfer responsibility and funding for public health to local government.
The transfer of public health to local authorities in England has led to considerable anxiety and chaos, both in terms of the immediate disruptive effects of the overhaul and in terms of concerns about the future of public health.
Considerable uncertainty remains over the present and future state of the workforce. Medical professionals are much less likely to want to work for local authorities. There are two main reasons for this: doctors perceive a lack of support for their skill set; they believe local authorities are likely to want to employ non-medical professionals for budgetary reasons.
BMA members in England report that several local authorities are reducing public health teams or implementing unfavourable terms and conditions for medical staff, making working in councils less attractive.
RCPCH is responsible for training and examining paediatricians and has more than 600 members in Wales.
