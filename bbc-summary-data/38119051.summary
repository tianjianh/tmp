But the Championship Sons and League One Stenny will have home advantage after 0-0 and 2-2 draws respectively.
Plucky Highland League leaders Buckie Thistle gave Dunfermline Athletic a fright before losing 5-3.
Shane Sutherland scored four as Elgin City thrashed Hawick Royal Albert 8-1 and Alloa and Livingston also won.
Only six of Saturday's ties survived freezing temperatures, with nine postponed.
Dumbarton had goalkeeper Alan Martin to thank for keeping them in the tie against Rose, who sit second in the East Superleague, in front of a crowd of 1,552 at New Dundas Park.
Rose manager Robbie Horn told BBC Scotland: "I thought we maybe just deserved to win the game.
"You couldn't tell who was the Championship team and who was the junior team there and that's not being disrespectful to Dumbarton. Our players played to a really high level.
"We've got a lot of guys who have played senior before and, in my opinion, should be senior again.
"People will say that's our opportunity gone, but we'll go through there with a positive attitude and a belief that we can win the game."
Dumbarton manager Stevie Aitken was relieved to still be in Monday's draw.
"We had to defend a lot, but going forward we didn't do enough and that's the most disappointing thing," he said.
"The fact we are still in the tie - we have to take that as a bonus.
"Alan Martin was terrific and kept us in it. I told the players after the game that they owe him one."
Simon Allan fired Forres, who are eighth in the Highland League, into the lead against Stenhousemuir after 27 minutes.
Strikes from Fraser Kerr and Willis Furtado within three minutes either side of the break swung the game in favour of the visitors, but Lee Fraser equalised midway through the second half.
Game of the day was at Victoria Park, Buckie, where Championship visitors Dunfermline were handed a fine start when Hamish Munro put through his own net after 12 minutes.
However, John McLeod fired an equaliser almost immediately - the striker's 33rd of the season - only for the Pars to go back in front four minutes later through Michael Paton's penalty following a Ross Salmon foul.
Buckie struck back again through Chris Angus, but Dunfermline looked to be in control after two quick strikes from substitute Kallum Higginbotham and Paul McMullan, with a solo run, after the break.
Angus was on target again with a header as Buckie threatened to take the game to a replay, but the foot of McMullan settled the game in stoppage time.
Sutherland was Elgin's star man as the League Two side overwhelmed visitors who sit 12th in the Lowland League.
The striker fired twice past goalkeeper Kyle Ranking twice before Kris Mitchell raised Albert's hopes by reducing the deficit after 32 minutes.
However, Sutherland completed his hat-trick before the break and contributed to a five-goal spree after half-time, with Brian Cameron grabbing a double of his own and Chris McLeish and Craig Gunn also getting in on the scoring act.
As the top two in League One met at Excelsior Stadium, it was second-top Airdrieonians who struck first as Andy Ryan fired them into an 18th-minute lead.
However, Nicky Cadden's strike equalised for Livingston, with Daniel Mullen securing a win for the visitors from close range after the break.
The other all-League One tie was also tight, with Alloa Athletic coming out on top against Peterhead thanks to Jamie Longworth's 74th-minute strike.
