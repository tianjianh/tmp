The blaze broke out at the Earth's Crust Bakery in Laurieston, near Castle Douglas, in the early hours of Monday morning.
Owners said an "unexplained electric fault" had caused the fire which ripped through the building.
The business - which started three years ago and is estimated to have produced 12,000 loaves - has been forced to close for the time being.
A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said it had receive a call shortly after 06:00 reporting the fire and had sent crews from Dalbeattie and Kirkcudbright.
"They arrived to find a fire within a brick building approximately four by six metres in size and a team of four firefighters in breathing apparatus used two high pressure jets to extinguish the flames," he said.
"Our crews then conducted dampening down operations and cleared debris that would have posed a danger to the public had it been left in place.
"Both our appliances left the scene around 8:15am."
