[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hundreds of people attended the funeral in Camborne of Cpl James Walters, who was from Leedstown. He died on 26 April.
Friends described him as a "beautiful bloke" who would be massively missed by anyone who knew him.
On Sunday, a special rugby match between two teams he had played for, was staged in his honour.
Reverend Simon Cade, the Rector of Redruth who led part of the service, said: "Many people will remember James as a little boy riding his pony down these lanes.
"It is right that today's service was a mix of army and civilian."
Cpt Lee Woodhouse, who served with Cpl Walters in the Army Air Corps, said: "He had a great sense of humour.
"He was a wonderful guy to be around."
At Sunday's rugby match between the Redruth Colts and the Army Air Corps, the Royal British Legion led the teams out on to the pitch and held a minute's silence.
Olly Pryor, a childhood friend, said: "He never talked down to anyone. He was a beautiful bloke, a legend who will be massively missed."
Earlier, his family paid tribute saying: "We cannot begin to comprehend the tragic loss of a beautiful and loving husband, daddy, son and brother. James has left a huge hole in all our hearts."
The others killed in the helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan were Cpt Thomas Clarke, Warrant Officer Class 2 Spencer Faulkner, RAF intelligence officer Flt Lt Rakesh Chauhan and L/Cpl Oliver Thomas of the Intelligence Corps.
