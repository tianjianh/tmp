Marseille: Rudi Garcia named new coach of Ligue 1 club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rudi Garcia has signed a three-year deal to be Marseille's new coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 52-year-old's first game in charge of the French side will be against arch-rivals Paris St-Germain at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.
The Frenchman was sacked by Roma in January with the Italian club fifth in Serie A having been top in October.
He was Lille boss from 2008 to 2013, guiding them to a league and cup double in 2011, and has also managed Saint Etienne, Dijon and Le Mans.
He succeeds interim coach Franck Passi who had been in the role since Michel's sacking in April.
