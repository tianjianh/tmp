[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesex hit back strongly on a rain-interrupted second day at Merchant Taylor's School, with Somerset 185-8 at close of play, 98 runs in arrears.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors began their reply to Middlesex's 283 all out solidly, with Marcus Trescothick and Tom Abell sharing an opening partnership of 76.
Abell was eventually caught behind off England's Steven Finn, who bowled impressively for figures of 4-41.
Trescothick top scored with 52 before he was lbw to Toby Roland-Jones.
Having lost only one of their last six Championship matches, Somerset had every reason for optimism when they began their innings after dismissing the home side for 283 on day one.
Trescothick and Abell went about their business in a composed fashion at the start of play.
The Middlesex attack, however, offered only occasional loose deliveries, with Finn producing both consistency and occasional menace with his extra pace.
Following Abell's dismissal, Somerset slumped from 76-1 to 86-3, and then 117-4 when Trescothick departed after hitting six fours in his three-hour innings.
Jim Allenby contributed 43, but edged to second slip off Finn and Abdur Rehman followed in the next over with Middlesex looking set for a first-innings lead before another rain shower ended play in the 71st over.
