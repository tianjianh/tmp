Scotland 2-2 England: Two-goal Leigh Griffiths says Scots let victory slip

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leigh Griffiths says Scotland should be savouring a first win over England since 1999, rather than rueing a 2-2 World Cup qualifying draw.

Griffiths netted two stunning free-kicks in quick succession to put the Scots ahead at Hampden Park.
But Harry Kane's injury-time leveller denied Scotland a famous triumph.
"I'm gutted. I should be absolutely delighted, getting two goals, man of the match, and walking in here with three points," Celtic's Griffiths said.

"But one lapse of concentration has cost us in the end, and instead of getting three points, we got one.
"They put a ball in, it's very deep, and nine times out of 10 it probably runs out of play, but Harry Kane's there, does what he does best and puts it away to give them a valuable point.
"I'm not going to talk about being low. I think we got a great point against a very good England side who will no doubt be going to the World Cup."
Scotland remain fourth in Group F, with eight points, six shy of leaders England, who opened the scoring at Hampden through substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
Gordon Strachan's men have four fixtures remaining, beginning with a trip to Lithuania, and the visit to Hampden of Malta in September.
Saturday's set-piece double yielded Griffiths' first goals for his country in his 13th appearance, and the Celtic striker, 26, insists Scotland can still qualify for next year's finals in Russia.
"We've still got a great chance," he said. "We've still got four very winnable games left. As long as we take the performances from the last two games, we've got a great chance.
"I would say we probably need to win three out of four to give ourselves a great chance.
"The last two home games, we got four points where nobody really expected us to get anything."
Griffiths revealed he spoke with England goalkeeper Joe Hart, the man he beat twice in three minutes from 25 yards, after the final whistle.
"He remembered my free-kick at Wembley [in Scotland's 3-0 defeat last year] when I put my laces through it and he thought I was going to do the same," the striker said.
"He said I caught him a bit off-guard with the first one and the second one he said he couldn't get near. So it's nice to put a free-kick past a guy of Joe Hart's stature.
"I try and hit them in training afterwards when I can. It's one of those ones where nine times out of 10 they go in the back of the net or over the bar."
