Concerns over Jersey women missing smear tests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concerns have been raised that a quarter of women in Jersey do not have regular smear tests.

Jersey's health department said only 75% of eligible women had tests every three years and some women did not know about the island's screening programme.
There is no central database the health department can use to contact patients so it is reliant on women making their own appointments.
A spokesperson said women were being asked to remind friends to have a test.
Dr Fiona Nelson, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: "Women encouraging other women they know to have screening works, particularly through sharing of their own experiences.
"Sometimes women may feel anxious about cervical screening, but the test is very simple and only takes five minutes.
"Women can ask to see a female doctor or nurse for the procedure if they feel embarrassed."
The tests detect cell changes in the cervix that could lead to cancer.
