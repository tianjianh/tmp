[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil Lennon has held talks with Hibernian with a view to becoming the club's new manager, the BBC has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Celtic boss, 44, has been out of a job since parting company with Bolton Wanderers in March.
It is believed Lennon is open to the possibility of succeeding Alan Stubbs, who left for Rotherham this week.
Hibs missed out on promotion from the Scottish Championship but ended the season as Scottish Cup winners.
Former Northern Ireland midfielder Lennon, who won the League Cup twice as a player with Leicester City, served Celtic as a player for six-and-a-half years, winning five Scottish titles and six domestic cups.
After a spell back in English football, Lennon rejoined Celtic as a coach in 2008 and eventually became manager in 2010.
He enjoyed further success in the dugout at Celtic Park with three successive top-flight titles and two Scottish Cup triumphs before leaving in 2014.
A move to Bolton followed later that year and, although Wanderers initially improved under Lennon, they were bottom of the Championship by the time he left, with the side eventually relegated.
Hibs have spent the last two seasons in Scotland's second tier having lost out in the promotion play-offs to Rangers and then Falkirk.
