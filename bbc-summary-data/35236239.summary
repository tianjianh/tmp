Martin Adams has targeted 25 successive appearances at the BDO World Championships after his 23rd outing at Lakeside ended in a first-round defeat.

The three-time champion lost 3-0 to Canada's Jeff Smith on Tuesday.
But the 59-year-old Englishman plans to be back at Frimley Green in 2017.
"The one milestone I want to achieve is my 25th consecutive year here, so I've got to be here next year for number 24," Adams told BBC Sport. "I'm looking forward to it already."
Adams currently holds the record for the most consecutive appearances at the BDO World Championships, having made his debut in 1994.
He won the title in 2007, 2010 and 2011 but Smith, a semi-finalist last year, produced a clinical display to end hopes of a fourth Lakeside crown.
Lincolnshire-based Adams, who was the number two seed, said: "Jeff could go on and win it. If he carries on playing like that, he's going to be in the mix at the end.
"From what I've seen, he's played the best darts on that stage so far.
"I'm a little bit disappointed for the fans who would have loved to have seen me win, but every so often you get one of these first-round games where you go out. Never mind - it's not the first time it's happened."
