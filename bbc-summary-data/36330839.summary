Road racer Ryan Farquhar has praised North West 200 medical staff as he recovers from injuries sustained in a crash on the circuit.

The 40-year-old from Dungannon suffered six broken ribs and a lacerated liver after colliding with Dan Cooper.
"I remember crashing and the marshals telling me not to move until Dr Fred MacSorley got there," said Farquhar.
"When I got to hospital they told me that whoever prepared me for the journey had saved my life."
It was a race meeting marred by the death of Malachi Mitchell-Thomas following a crash in the second Supertwins race on Saturday.
Farquhar and English rider Cooper were among five competitors injured at the event.
Farquhar - who has won the NW 200 five times - was airlifted to Belfast after being treated at the roadside by Dr MacSorley and the medical team.
"I lost the front end and I went down hard," added Farquhar as he recalled the crash.
"I hit the Recticel bale and bounced back out into the road but everything happened so fast that I don't really remember being hit by the other bike.
"I can't thank the doctors enough who saved my life - money couldn't pay them for what they have done for me.
"I was taken straight into surgery when I arrived at the Royal Victoria Hospital and I was lucky that the top liver surgeon in the country was available to operate on me.
"I am looking forward now to getting myself sorted and getting home with my wife Karen, my girls Keeley and Mya and our two donkeys."
He also paid tribute to Mitchell-Thomas. The 20-year-old from Lancashire died two days earlier following a crash at almost the same spot as Farquhar's accident.
"Having raced against Malachi it was obvious to me that he was a huge talent." said Farquhar.
"What has happened to the young fella is very sad. Malachi didn't do anything more wrong than I did but I am still here to tell the tale and he is not."
