John Swinney, who is Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary for Scotland, reassured students in a joint statement.
He said there was no change in funding just now and anyone eligible would remain so during their course.
He also called for clarity on the status of EU nationals after Britain leaves the EU.
Universities Scotland, the representative body of Scotland's 19 higher education institutions, said it also wanted more guidance and reassurance for students who are coming to study next year.
And the statement also said Scotland would continue to support research collaboration with partners in Europe
Mr Swinney said: "EU students are welcome in Scotland and their contribution is valued.
"We are proud that Scotland is a destination of choice for students and staff from overseas and I am firmly committed to ensuring this remains the case.
He added: "That is why, in addition to confirming funding arrangements for our EU students today, we have renewed our call for the reintroduction of a post study work visa.
"This would boost the international appeal of Scotland's universities and help retain talent from across the world.
"The UK Government must also clarify as soon as possible, the immigration status of EU nationals who will be living, working and studying in Scotland when the UK formally leaves the EU."
Prof Sir Pete Downes, Convener of Universities Scotland and Principal of the University of Dundee said: "Our student community is incredibly diverse, with students from 180 countries studying here. This adds so much to the quality of higher education and the student experience we offer in Scotland.
"We are determined that this will continue to be the case."
