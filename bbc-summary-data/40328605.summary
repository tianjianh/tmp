Ryan Smyth, 29, from Windsor Gardens in Bangor, was also charged with possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life.
He applied for bail but was refused during a hearing at Downpatrick Magistrates Court.
A detective told the court: "We believe the murder was part of ongoing mounting tensions within South East Antrim UDA."
He said the police had carried out a number of searches, but had yet to find the murder weapon.
Mr Horner, 35, was shot in front of his three-year-old son outside Sainsbury's on the outskirts of Bangor three weeks ago.
Ten days ago, a 28-year-old man from Newtownards, Alan Wilson, was also charged with the murder.
