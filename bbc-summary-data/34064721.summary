[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Neville died in Australia, after being taken ill on a visit to support his daughter Tracey, who is England netball head coach, during the World Cup.
The 65-year-old was a former commercial director of Bury Football Club.
His funeral service will be held in Bury, followed by a private burial.
Mr Neville was involved in the fans' group Save Our Shakers, which was formed when the side faced bankruptcy in 2002.
His sons both started their lengthy football careers with Manchester United in the early 1990s. Gary won 85 England caps, while Phil won 59.
An emotional Tracey Neville led her England side out on court hours after it emerged her father had been taken ill.
She said it was the right decision to stay, as her father would not have expected her to "bail out" of a  tournament.
