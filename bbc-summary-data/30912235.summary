Wireless charging is coming, but how will it work?

Coffee drinkers and panini eaters will be able to charge mobiles wirelessly in 10 Starbucks cafes in London by the end of the month, the chain has announced.

The free service follows a roll out across 2,000 branches in the US.
Newsbeat's social media survey last October suggested one in four 15 to 18-year-olds felt happier online than in real life, but it's tricky to stay online if your phone dies when you're on the go.
So how will you be able to use wireless charging?
Wireless charging, as the name suggests, means you can charge up your phone without using a plug socket.
Of the two wireless charging standards currently available, Starbucks has chosen to use Powermat, requiring users to plug in an adapter to their phone.
This means customers will be supplied with a ring-shaped device which is set up with adapters for Apple devices and phones using the micro USB standard.
To charge efficiently, phones must be placed on specially-equipped tables that Starbuck is installing in the initial 10 branches across London.
Ian Cranna, vice president of marketing and category at Starbucks, said: "We have always tried to anticipate our customers' needs and innovate with technology to provide even more convenience.
"We're delighted to be the first to launch Powermat wireless charging in 10 London stores and look forward to customers being able to charge their phones wirelessly in many more stores soon."
If you live or work in London, the branches will be; Princes Street, Kingsway, Wardour Street, Pentonville Road, Harewood Place, Berkeley Street, Great Portland Street, Moorgate, Fleet Street, and Euston Tower.
