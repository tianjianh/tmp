[SN]TITLE[SN]
Worcester Warriors v Newcastle Falcons (Sun)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester make one change against Newcastle as they again look for their first home win of the 2016-17 season after successive draws at Sixways.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Heathcote returns at stand-off in place of Ryan Lamb following last weekend's 34-34 draw with Sale, which followed a 23-23 draw with Gloucester.
Newcastle name an unchanged starting line-up following last weekend's 18-13 win over Gloucester at Kingsholm.
Prop David Wilson is on the bench after his return to his home-town club.
The 44-times-capped England prop, who rejoined the Falcons from Bath, has recovered from a minor calf strain.
Newcastle, who only narrowly stayed up last season, have won two of their four Premiership games this season, the victory at Kingsholm being their first Premiership away triumph in two years.
Warriors have five points from their two home games this season, having picked up a try-scoring bonus point against Sale, but they remain without a Premiership win since 26 March.
The hosts are still without both skipper GJ Van Velze and rugby league convert Ben Te'o, who has been named in Eddie Jones' 45-man England squad.
Warriors head coach Carl Hogg told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"Newcastle have evolved as a rugby side. They're well coached with a good defensive system but they look ambitious with ball in hand.
"We have a strong framework we play to and, if we stick to it, we're very successful. We've caused a lot of problems for the teams we've faced.
"It's about sticking to what we know and staying resilient under periods of pressure. It's about making decisions in the right areas of the field."
Newcastle head coach John Wells:
"We're going to have to score tries because this Worcester team can score against anyone. They've got a set-piece starting attack as good as any in the league and they've got outside backs who can score for fun.
"They do have some guys that are not necessarily bad tacklers, but are probably not the best defenders. We've got to try to exploit that. When those opportunities come along we've got to be ruthless, like we were last week.
"There are a number of differences from last year. Part of it is rugby education, part of it is guys growing up individually and collectively. Largely it's the same group of players but they've perhaps learnt how to handle situations better."
