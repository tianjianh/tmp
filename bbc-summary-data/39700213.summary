Tommy Breslin back at Cliftonville as interim boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tommy Breslin is returning to Cliftonville as interim manager until the end of the season after Gerard Lyttle quit as boss on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Breslin resigned as Reds manager in September 2015 after winning eight trophies in four years.
He will be in charge along with assistant Peter Murray for Saturday's final league game against Linfield and the Europa League play-offs.
Lyttle left Cliftonville to become manager at Sligo Rovers.
"We are very grateful to Tommy and Peter for entering into this short-term agreement and trust they will help guide the team through the rest of the season," said club chairman Gerard Lawlor.
"We still have plenty to play for in this campaign and, though myself and the Management Committee will be working  hard to determine our next manager, we must not lose sight of our remaining targets on the pitch and believe that Tommy and Peter can help us achieve those."
The interim manager has made clear that the arrangement is until the end of the season and that he will not be taking the job on a permanent basis.
Breslin won two league titles during a successful reign at Solitude and he could help prevent Linfield lifting the Gibson Cup on Saturday.
The table-topping Blues are two points clear of Crusaders going into the last game.
Cliftonville have lost their last four league games and sit fourth in the Premiership standings.
