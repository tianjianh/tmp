[SN]TITLE[SN]
Judicial review begins into Clocaenog Forest power cables

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A High Court hearing has begun into plans to erect a 17km line of pylons along the Denbighshire and Conwy border.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
SP Manweb was granted permission to run 10.5 miles of overhead cables between two wind farms in Clocaenog Forest to a substation near St Asaph last year.
But local action group Pylon the Pressure won the right to a judicial review.
It claims the double wooden poles would be a blight on the countryside.
Part of the cables would pass near the 16th Century Berain Farm, Llannefydd, which was home to Catrin o Ferain, the granddaughter of Henry VII and a prominent member of the Tudor gentry in Wales.
At Monday's hearing in Llangefni, Peter Dickson, the barrister representing the appellant, argued that the cables should be placed underground near the farm.
He said the option was not considered by SP Manweb and that the Secretary of State, Greg Clark, should not have granted permission.
Counsels on behalf of SP Manweb will present their submissions later on.
The judge has said he will reserve judgment.
