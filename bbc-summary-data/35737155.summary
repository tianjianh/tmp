[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said they received a report of a 35-year-old man injured in Baldragon Road at about 13:10 on Saturday.
He had suffered stab wounds and was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where his condition is described as stable.
The taxi driver had picked up two men - aged 18 or 19 - from Dunpahil Road and was due to drop them off in Lochend Road, where they attacked him.
Following the assault, the two suspects ran off towards the Bishop Loch area.
The two men are described as white with local accents with dark hair and wearing blue jackets. One of them is described as having bushy eyebrows.
Det Con Alan Watt said: "This despicable attack took place just yards from local shops in Lochend Road.  It's imperative we trace the two men responsible.
"I am appealing to local people in the area who may have seen something to contact us. Were you in one of the shops, did you see the two men running off?
"If you have any information or knowledge regarding the suspects or the crime then please do get in touch."
Anyone with information is asked to contact officers at the robbery unit in Pollok on 101.
