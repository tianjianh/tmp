The 28-year-old becomes the Gloucestershire club's first signing since winning promotion to the English Football League at Wembley on Sunday.
A former Wolves trainee, he previously played for Port Vale and Northampton.
"The manager really sold the club to me. It didn't take me long to realise I want to come here," Collins told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"I want to get promoted. I've seen an article saying the chairman wants this club in the Championship some day. Hopefully I can help them get to League One."
Meanwhile, midfielder Sam Wedgbury has released a statement on social media revealing that he is to leave the promoted club.
