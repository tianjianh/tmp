Go to the BBC's Scotland's Future page for analysis, background and the latest news on the Scottish independence referendum.
But the debate isn't just for the audience facing the panel - you let us know what you thought think through social media, using the '#bbcindyref' hashtag.
Here are some of the highlights from the on-air discussion, and the pick of what you said about our debate, from Kirkwall.
Name: Kirkwall
Where: The biggest town and capital of the Orkney Islands, off the coast of northern mainland Scotland.
Something interesting: The hard-drinking, hard-fighting Simpsons cartoon character William Willie MacDougal III - aka Groundskeeper Willie - is said to be from Kirkwall. Asked about the independence referendum for Channel 4 News, he responded: "No matter which way the vote goes, I'll be angry."
Alistair Carmichael: Secretary of state for Scotland and Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland
Angela Constance: Scottish youth employment minister and SNP MSP for Almond Valley
Brian Wilson: Former Labour MP and UK energy minister
Lesley Riddoch: Broadcaster and independence supporter
1. Leslie Burgher asked: "Would Scottish independence be cataclysmic for the Western world?"
2. Meg Telfer, a retired art teacher, asked: "Will Nicola Sturgeon's call to the Scottish Labour Party to 'reclaim' their socialist roots by voting 'Yes' fall on deaf ears?"
3. Sally Inkster, chief executive of Orkney Housing Association, asked: "A recent poll shows less than a third of women support independence. Does the panel have any theories on why this might be?"
4. Amy Liptrot, a writer asked: "Would the future for the renewable energy industry be more secure in an independent Scotland?"
BBC data journalist Marc Ellison said: "There was a total of 1,164 tweets posted during last night's debate in Kirkwall - a continuation of the slight decline in engagement by the Twitterati."
"The total number of tweets for the previous two debates were 1,187 (Kirkcaldy, 18 March) and 1,228 (Kelso, 18 February).
"There were three distinct surges in tweets during the Kirkwall debate, but online chatter peaked following a question asking why less than a third of women support independence.
"The other issue which caused the second largest spike in Twitter activity was Nicola Sturgeon's call to the Scottish Labour Party to 'reclaim' their socialist roots by voting 'Yes'."

"I've started stockpiling tinned food for when the cataclysm happens. #bbcindyref"
mjaei on Lord Robertson's warning over a referendum "Yes" vote.
"I love the way the Left keep citing the Nordic nations, especially when they all have centre-right governments."
Andrew Morrison on the debate over what an independent Scotland might look like.
"Could it be that less women want independence because they are the more intelligent sex? #bbcindyref #agnostic"
Caz Dodds on the issue of female voters.
"Wonder what Wilson and Carmichael would cut to pay for childcare reform under the Union. #bbcindyref"
Liam Donnelly on one of the key issues in the referendum debate.
How the panel responded to Sally Inkster's question on support for independence among women
Alistair Carmichael: "I think that women are more drawn to arguments of the head rather than the heart."
Angela Constance: "Irrespective of whether you're a woman who stays at home to look after your children or whether you're a working mother, quite often you've got quite a lot on your plate as it is in terms of childcare."
Brian Wilson: "I think women are better at recognising bluff, bluster and bad patter."
Lesley Riddoch: "The utter game-changer that surely must come, whichever vote, 'Yes' or 'No', wins and whichever party wins the next election: we have to get childcare, affordable childcare as an absolute benchmark of society in Scotland because we're lagging so far behind."
