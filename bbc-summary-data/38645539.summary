The 24-year-old spent time at nine different clubs in the Football League after starting his career at Blackburn.
"Tom knows he needs come in, work hard and do well to get his career kick started again," boss Luke Gerrard told the club website.
Meanwhile, Boreham Wood midfielder Conor Clifford has joined Dundalk.
The Dublin-born 25-year-old made 21 appearances for Wood this season, but returned home for personal reasons after his most recent game on 3 December.
