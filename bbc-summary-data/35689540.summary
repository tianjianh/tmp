Dolton Powell: Murder charges remain following joint enterprise ruling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charges against eight people accused of murdering a man in Gloucester last year will be pursued, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dolton Powell, 21, died after a party at the All Nations Community Centre in Gloucester on 23 August last year.
But prosecutors said they would review the murder charges earlier this month, following a recent Supreme Court ruling on the joint enterprise law.
It was confirmed at Bristol Crown Court on Monday that the murder charges will remain.
Supreme Court judges had ruled joint enterprise - which has allowed people to be convicted of murder even if they did not inflict the fatal blow - had been wrongly interpreted for more than 30 years.
