Watson, 56, will work alongside Mark McGhee as assistant to Scotland manager Gordon Strachan.
McCall left his role with Scotland after more than three years to take over as manager of Bradford City.
"It is an honour and a privilege to have been asked to help my country and, it goes without saying, I had no hesitation in doing so," said Watson.
It is a second spell as part of the of the coaching set-up for the former Birmingham City, Hibernian, Motherwell and Rangers coach, having worked under Alex McLeish during the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign.
Watson knows his new colleagues well, having played alongside Strachan and McGhee at Aberdeen in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
He added: "I actually missed Gordon's call when he phoned and, when I called him back, I thought it would be to organise scouting, so I was humbled when he asked if I would be willing to help out for the World Cup qualifiers.
"It was a great experience to work with the national team set-up before, under Alex, and we came really close to qualifying then.
"I am confident that we can go a step closer this time and I am really excited about getting started and helping Gordon and Mark in any way I can."
