[SN]TITLE[SN]
Isle of Man Steam Railway announces service cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Isle of Man Steam Railway will operate a revised timetable until the end of the 2016 season because of a "high level of operational issues".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isle of Man Railways said the move was necessary because only one of their trains is currently working.
Director of Transport Services Ian Longworth apologised to passengers.
He said: "We operate Victorian locomotives and we have experienced a high level of failures that require substantial repairs."
The revised schedule will start immediately and run until 6 November.
Isle of Man Railways said their No.8 locomotive Fennela is their only train in service.
The narrow gauge steam-operated railway runs 15.3 miles (24.6 km) between Douglas and Port Erin.
