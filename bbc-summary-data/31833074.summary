Fans told to stop copying Breaking Bad's Walter White and throwing pizza on roof

It would probably be fair to say the main characters from Breaking Bad aren't the best role models, and it's probably unwise to copy them.

But it's not drug dealing or violent crime that the creator of the show has been warning fans about.
Vince Gilligan says they have to stop throwing pizza on to a house in Albuquerque in New Mexico.
In series three, Walt hurls a giant pizza on to the roof, and Vince says too many fans are doing the same.
Walter's a drug dealer and throws the pizza up there after a fight with his wife Skyler.
Speaking on a podcast about the spin-off series, Better Call Saul, Vince Gilligan said lots of fans have been visiting the house in the north-east of Albuquerque where the scene was filmed and copying it.
"The lady who lives in that house - she and her husband - are the two nicest people in the world and they deserve to be treated well," says Vince.
"There is nothing funny or original or cool about throwing pizza on this woman's roof.
"It is just not funny. It's been done before. You're not the first."
He said that when the couple asked fans to leave their property they were verbally abused.
There's a final warning from Jonathan Banks, who plays Mike Ehrmantraut in Breaking Bad, a character responsible for multiple murders.
"I catch you doing it, I will hunt you down."
You've been warned.
