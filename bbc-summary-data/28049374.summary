Ministers ban suspected aliases of banned extremist group

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has banned three groups it suspects of being aliases for the extremist organisation al-Muhajiroun.

The group was first banned in 2010, when it also used the name Islam4UK.
It had planned to protest in the Wiltshire town of Wootton Bassett, then known for ceremonies honouring military personnel killed in Afghanistan.
The security minister said: "Terrorist organisations should not be allowed to escape proscription simply by acting under a different name."
James Brokenshire continued: "That is why we have today laid an order which will, from tomorrow, recognise the Need4Khilafah, the Shariah Project and the Islamic Dawah Association as aliases of the group already proscribed as both al-Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect.
"The group is also known as Al Muhajiroun. This means being a member of or supporting the organisation is a criminal offence.
"Al-Muhajiroun remains of significant concern to the UK and the international community, and this order will ensure that it cannot operate in the UK as Need4Khilafah, the Shariah Project and the Islamic Dawah Association."
Under the Terrorism Act 2000, a group can be banned if it "commits or participates in acts of terrorism, prepares for, promotes or encourages terrorism or is otherwise concerned in terrorism".
Groups can also be outlawed if they "unlawfully glorify the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism".
