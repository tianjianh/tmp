A cosmetics company has given £20,000 to charities after money raised for a homeless woman who claimed to have foiled a burglary was returned.

Lush donated the money to homeless charities in Oxford due to "current uncertainty" over the burglary.
Lottie Pauling-Chamberlain said she challenged a thief on 10 February outside Lush in Oxford.
A £9,000-fund from public donations was suspended after Thames Valley Police arrested the 29-year-old.
Ms Pauling-Chamberlain denies any wrongdoing.

Staff at the shop in Cornmarket Street said a laptop and large box of cosmetics had disappeared when they opened the shop earlier this month.
The next day Ms Pauling-Chamberlain, who sleeps rough in the area, returned the stolen items, saying she had thwarted a thief.
A donation fund set up by the store to thank her has raised £9,245, donated by 537 people, this was later suspended and the money has now been returned.
In a statement on the fund website, Lush said: "Due to the current uncertainty surrounding the recent burglary in our Lush Oxford shop, Lush have decided to return all of the money that has been kindly donated by the public and replace it with £20,000 of our own money."
The money is to be shared among Oxford Homeless Pathways, the Icolyn Smith Foundation and Oxford Community Soup Kitchen, Oxford Homeless Project and Aspire Oxford.
Lush said Ms Pauling-Chamberlain could access the fund through the charities.
Thames Valley Police said at the time of the arrest the 29-year-old woman was also being questioned on suspicion of possessing Class A drugs.
A man, 42, also of no fixed abode, has been arrested on suspicion of burglary. Both suspects have been released on police bail until 14 May.
