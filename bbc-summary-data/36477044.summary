Seven-year-old Nanga gave birth to a healthy male cub on 6 June, named Milo, but died after being taken ill on Tuesday.
Zookeepers said the cub will be hand-reared and monitored 24 hours a day for the next 14 weeks.
Director Derek Grove said everyone at the zoo was "devastated" over Nanga's death.
He added: "We're thankful that Nanga was alive long enough to provide the first important feeds for the cub, which has put it in great stead."

A post-mortem on Nanga is due to be carried out later.
The zoo confirmed Milo is not set to be on show "for the next few weeks".
Dudley Zoo has two other male snow leopards, Makalu and Margaash, with the latter set to move to a zoo in Darjeeling, India, within a fortnight.
