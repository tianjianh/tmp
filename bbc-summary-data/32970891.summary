The Scottish ex-MP's death was not believed to be suspicious and the cause has yet to be confirmed.
Leader of the Welsh Lib Dems Kirsty Williams called him "a giant in our party" who was "robust and sincere".
Ex-leader of the party in Wales Lord German called Mr Kennedy's death a "hammer blow".
Mr Kennedy, who led his party from 1999 to 2006, lost his seat in the Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency at the general election in May.
After his death was announced on Tuesday, Ms Williams said: "We are all immensely sad to hear of this devastating news.
"You would struggle to meet a kinder man than Charles. He was a man who had time for everybody; a real people person and that made him stand out from all the rest. He will always be remembered for his warm personality and brilliant quick wit.
"Charles was a giant in our party. He was robust, sincere and passionate. Never will I be more proud of our party than when Charles led us from the front in our opposition to the Iraq war. This wasn't a decision taken lightly, yet Charles was a man of principle and did what he knew was right.
"The party owes him a great gratitude for the position he took and the bravery he showed.
"Above all else, our thoughts go out to Charles's family at this very difficult time."
Former Lib Dem MP for Montgomeryshire Lord Carlile told BBC Radio Wales: "For me today, there is an overwhelming sense of sadness and sympathy for Charles and for his family.
"He'd had an awful few weeks. His father, to whom he was extremely close, died recently, and of course he lost his seat."
Another former Lib Dem MP for Montgomeryshire Lembit Opik said Mr Kennedy was "one of a kind".
"A gentle soul who never really coped with the pressures of an abrasive career. Heartbreaking news," he said.
Lord German, who is also a former Lib Dem leader in Wales, said: "Charles was such a mainstay of the party... He was a towering figure in the party.
"There was a brilliant mind who knew and sensed a political direction and who knew where the party had to go.
"This must be devastating for his family."
Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts of Llandudno told BBC Radio Cymru Mr Kennedy was a "natural, warm and humorous politician".
BBC Wales parliamentary correspondent David Cornock said Mr Kennedy was a man who had "an unusual gift" for speaking about politics "with humour and humility".
He said Mr Kennedy was the sort of person who showed a "genuine interest in people".
BBC Wales Welsh Affairs editor Vaughan Roderick tweeted: "Sad to hear about Charles Kennedy's death - a fine man who could have been so much more."
His family said they felt an "enormous sense of shock" and paid tribute to a fine man and talented politician.
They said Mr Kennedy died at home in Fort William on Monday and that they were "devastated".
