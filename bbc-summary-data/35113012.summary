Bio-scientist Samantha Ho, 39, was found dead at a house in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, in August.

Her husband, Timothy Allen, 40, of Curlew Place, St Neots, gave his plea via video link from Cambridge Crown Court to a judge at the Old Bailey.
Mr Allen spoke only to confirm his name and enter a not guilty plea to Judge Mark Lucraft QC.
The defendant is due to go on trial on 22 February at Cambridge Crown Court and was remanded in custody.
The case is expected to last up to 10 days and will be heard by a high court judge.
