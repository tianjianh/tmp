The United States Grand Prix is shrouded in uncertainty as a result of heavy thunderstorms in Texas on the periphery of Hurricane Patricia.

With up to 30cm of rain forecasted to fall on Saturday, qualifying could be postponed until Sunday.
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel said: "If it's like this, we can't run. It does not look good."
Lewis Hamilton's team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg set the pace in a rain-affected first practice.
The German, needing to beat team-mate Lewis Hamilton to retain his slim title hopes, headed Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat. Hamilton was an unrepresentative fifth.
The Briton needs to beat Vettel by nine points and Rosberg by two to win the title this weekend.
Officials have not yet made specific contingency plans because the weather forecast is changing so frequently.
However, governing body the FIA is open to the possibility of changing the weekend timetable to try to ensure qualifying can take place if there is a window of dry weather.
The worst of the weather is expected to subside by Sunday, when the race is scheduled for 1400 local time (1900 GMT).
If it is not possible to run qualifying on Saturday, officials have the choice of running it on Sunday morning before the race, or deciding the grid by another method.
Hurricane Patricia, which is on its way to Mexico, is one of the strongest tropical storms on record.
The storm is even raising concerns about the forthcoming race in Mexico next weekend.
If it causes extensive damage in the capital Mexico City, there could be a knock-on effect for the race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez track, which is hosting a grand prix for the first time since 1992.
Any country considering a model for a new Formula 1 race could do far, far worse than look at what Austin, Texas, has achieved with the US Grand Prix.
For a start, there's the track. In marked contrast to many of the so-called Tilke-dromes that have proliferated in recent years, the Circuit of the Americas has real character.
Elevation change, a good selection of challenging corners of differing speeds, the real possibility of creating proper racing and decent viewing.
Beyond that, Austin itself is a superlative host city - vibrant, cosmopolitan, friendly and blessed with great nightlife.
In just three short years, the race has already become a modern classic.
It really is the standard to which all new races must aspire - but from which, sadly, so many fall short.
