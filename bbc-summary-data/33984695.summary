Pioneering US spine surgery girl Charlotte Speddy dies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager who travelled to the United States as a child for pioneering spine surgery, has died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlotte Speddy, 17, from Bethesda, Gwynedd, was born with malformed ribs and a severely curved spine which left her struggling to breathe.
In 2001, she flew to Texas with her parents, Angela and Stephen, where doctors fitted metal ribs and carried out operations to straighten her spine.
But Charlotte died on Tuesday after falling ill with pneumonia.
Her aunt, Helen Speddy, paid tribute to the teenager, adding the care she received at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor was "amazing".
Charlotte was born weighing just 1lb 4oz and missing a kidney, a lung, several ribs and endured about 30 operations.
