[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicestershire reached 420 before Dieter Klein took four wickets to leave Kent 193-5 on day three at Grace Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beginning the day on 129-2, Colin Ackermann (89) and Mark Cosgrove (39) got Leicestershire going after rain had stalled progress on the opening days.
Tom Wells (46) and Clint McKay (66) hit lower-order runs before Kent's Matt Hunn (3-110) closed the innings.
Klein then dismissed Sean Dickson, Joe Denly, Sam Northeast and Will Gidman to leave Kent 227 runs behind.
With only one day left to play, a first win of the County Championship season seems unlikely for Leicestershire, but it was a heartening day nonetheless for the ninth-placed Division Two side.
After their batsmen had piled on the runs, Klein's left-arm swing bowling impressed, with the South African claiming figures of 4-48 before veteran Darren Stevens (54 not out) steadied the innings with his 75th first-class half-century.
