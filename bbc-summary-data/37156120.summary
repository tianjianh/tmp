Brexit 'integral' to role of Wales' top civil servant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' next top civil servant will play an "integral role" in getting the best deal for the nation as the UK leaves the European Union, a job advert says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Derek Jones is stepping down as permanent secretary to the Welsh Government after four years.
An advert for the Â£160,000-a-year job said it was a "pivotal role" supporting ministers as they "work through the critical implications" of Brexit.
"Solid commercial abilities" are also stressed as an advantage.
Sir Derek announced his decision to leave in April, before the assembly election in May, saying he would go after ensuring "a new first minister and cabinet hit the ground running".
The advert for his replacement reflects the change in the political landscape following the referendum vote in June for Brexit and the concerns of Welsh businesses over trade deals.
"It is an exciting time to join the Welsh Government as it prepares to launch a new programme for government and work through the critical implications of withdrawal from the EU," it says.
"As permanent secretary, you will play an integral role in ensuring that the Welsh Government represents Wales' interest in emerging UK trade negotiations and in positioning Welsh business to exploit new markets and opportunities as they arise.
"If you have the energy and resilience to lead through the challenges ahead and deliver change in a complex organisation, if you have solid commercial abilities, and if you are, or have the potential to be, a highly confident and inspiring operator in the complex devolved and Whitehall environs, then we very much hope you will consider this role."
The post is advertised as being for five years, with a closing date in September and final interviews due to take place in October.
