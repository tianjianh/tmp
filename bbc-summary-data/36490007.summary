Germany's top two divisions have sold their domestic media rights for 4.6bn euros (£3.6bn), almost double their previous deal.

The deal covers four seasons from 2017-18 and is an 85% increase on the amount raised by the same rights in 2013.
Terrestrial broadcasters ARD and ZDF will show highlights and a small number of live games.
The Premier League's sale of domestic rights for three seasons from 2016-17 raised £5.14bn in February 2015.
