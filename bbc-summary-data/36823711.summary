Nine people were injured when five gondolas from the Tsunami ride derailed at M&D's amusement park on 26 June.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has now issued a prohibition notice banning the inspector from carrying out inspections of fairground rides.
The HSE has also recommended new checks on rides the man had certified as safe.
The inspector is reported to have issued a Declaration of Operational Compliance (DoC) for the Tsunami ride on 10 June.
In an interim update on its investigation, the HSE confirmed it had taken enforcement action banning him from carrying out inspections of fairground attractions until he can demonstrate "due dilligence" in his work.
It said: "They have been served with a prohibition notice, which prevents them from undertaking any inspection of fairground rides until the condition of the prohibition notice is fulfilled.
"HSE is working with industry bodies to ensure all fairground owners are aware of the prohibition notice.
"Ride owners directly affected by this individual's work are being contacted through industry bodies to ensure they are able take any appropriate action that is necessary."
Nine passengers, most of them children, were on board the Tsunami inverted rollercoaster when five gondolas detached from their rails at a bend and fell to the ground.
A total of 10 people were taken to hospitals in Glasgow and Wishaw in the aftermath of the crash, although a 25-year-old woman was found not to be injured.
The inspector has 21 days in which he can appeal against the prohibition order issued by the HSE.
The M&D's theme park remains closed until further notice although indoor attractions have reopened.
A spokesperson for M&D's said: "We're unable to comment on any decisions taken by HSE."
