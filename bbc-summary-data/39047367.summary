Omoregie will compete in the 60m hurdles after his inclusion in the 32-strong Great Britain squad for the trip to Belgrade, Serbia.
The 21-year-old made the Championships semi-finals two years ago on his senior international debut.
"I have come a long way in two years and hope I can now produce what I feel I am capable of," said Omoregie.
The Welshman has been included alongside training partner and world leader Andrew Pozzi, with David King completing a strong Great British trio.
"I train with Andrew and he has been doing very well," said Omoregie.
"Everyone around British Athletics knows how talented he is. He has had these times in him over the last couple of years but with his injury record he has not had that chance to do it.
"We have trained together well this winter and have pushed each other.
"David King also ran a personal best last weekend so he is also going well.
"There is no reason why all of us can make the final and then in hurdles anything can happen.
"The event is definitely on the up in this country."
Omoregie believes a strong French team will provide the main competition.
"It is a very competitive event," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"Poz [Andrew Pozzi] is a little bit ahead of everyone else but the French will be very strong and there are other strong athletes.
"But I feel pretty confident I can produce and am looking forward to it.
"I did the European Indoors a couple of years ago and it was the first time I was selected for a Great British vest and had a really good experience.
"I have started the season well and run personal bests.
"I feel if I can piece it all together, I can produce a good time. Hopefully that will be in Belgrade."
