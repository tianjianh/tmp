The 29-year-old, who had only joined from AC Milan three days earlier, was accidentally caught on the right side of his head by Lorient midfielder Didier Ndong 15 minutes into the match.
"Jeremy was operated on under local anaesthesia on Wednesday night to sew up his ear," Bordeaux said.
"We wish a speedy recovery to our player and hope to see him back soon."
Gabon international Ndong said: "I apologise to Jeremy Menez, and to Bordeaux, and hope to see him back in Ligue 1 action soon.
"It was completely involuntary but had unfortunate consequences for him."
