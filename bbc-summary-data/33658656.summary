The family of a man who died in police custody has backed calls for a Scottish government review of all such deaths.

Sheku Bayoh, 31, died after being detained following an incident in Kirkcaldy in Fife on 3 May.
His death is being investigated by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc).
Speaking at the launch of the "Justice for Sheku Bayoh" campaign in Glasgow, his family said there were still many unanswered questions over his death.
The campaign got underway at an event organised by the Scotland Against Criminalising Communities' organisation which was also attended by other people who have lost loved ones through deaths in police custody elsewhere in the UK.
The call for a Scotland-wide probe into deaths in custody came after the UK government announced an independent review of the issue in England and Wales.
Aamer Anwar, solicitor for the Bayoh family, said: "The family wants the truth because they know that without the truth they are never going to get justice.
"The Home Secretary announced, some two days ago, that there would be an independent review in England and Wales into deaths in custody.
"Sheku Bayoh's family are saying they are not willing to wait 10 years for Scotland to catch up.
"It is essential that no family has to go through again what the Bayoh family has gone through and it's imperative that lessons are learned as soon as possible."
Mr Bayoh's sister, Kadi Johnson, has previously claimed that police officers' use of "excess force" was to blame for his death.
Speaking at the campaign launch, she said: "At the moment were are grieving but it's difficult when you don't know the truth surrounding his death - that still hurts.
"We want to know the truth and that could help us move on a bit."
Mr Anwar also called for answers about why Mr Bayoh was apparently viewed as a "terrorist threat" by some police officers.
He said: "The family of Sheku Bayoh want Chief Constable Stephen House to explain why his police officers believed that they were dealing with a terrorist threat and whether that had any role in Sheku Bayoh's subsequent treatment."
A spokesman for the Pirc said its report on Mr Bayoh's death would be submitted to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in due course.
He added: "We fully empathise with the deceased's family at this very difficult time and their need for answers in relation to the circumstances surrounding the death of Sheku Bayoh.
"Our investigators are carrying out an extensive enquiry, which has many different facets that require to be thoroughly investigated.
"For that reason, it is only right that such serious matters are given careful consideration and the Lord Advocate is aware of progress made by the enquiry."
A Scottish government spokeswoman said responsibility for the investigation of deaths in custody in Scotland was a matter for the Pirc.
She added: "The Pirc is currently conducting an independent investigation, it is important we all await the findings of this robust and thorough investigation.
"The Scottish government believes that the investigative powers the Pirc has are sufficient, and the Pirc has not indicated they require any additional powers in order to undertake their role effectively."
The Scottish government also said a review of police custody arrangements in August 2014 found they had "improved significantly".
Previous criticisms of the police by Mr Anwar have been dismissed as "completely inaccurate and misleading" by the Scottish Police Federation (SPF), which represents rank and file officers.
The federation has said that police were responding to reports of a man armed with a knife at the time, with a female officer suffering "significant" injuries during a struggle.
Calum Steele, general secretary of the SPF said: "The SPF is as eager as anyone for the outcome of the circumstances surrounding the death of Sheku Bayou to be made known.
"Reacting to snippets of information that may or may not be true whilst an investigation is underway is not in anyone's best interests."
Others attending the event in Glasgow included Janet Alder, the sister of Christopher Alder, 37, who choked to death on the floor of a Hull police station in April 1998, and Marcia Rigg, sister of Sean Rigg, who died after being restrained at Brixton police station, south London, in August 2008.
