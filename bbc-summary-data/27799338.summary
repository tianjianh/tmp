Firefighters end 24-hour strike in pensions row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Firefighters across Wales have ended a 24-hour strike in a dispute with the UK government over pensions.

Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) object to plans to raise their retirement age from 55 to 60 and increase pension contributions.
The 24-hour walkout, begun at 09:00 BST on Thursday across England and Wales is the longest in the three-year campaign.
Senior fire officers said contingency plans were in place but urged the public to be careful.
The UK government said firefighters had one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector.
The strike followed the last series of walkouts over three days at the start of May.
The three Welsh fire services said contingency plans would be in place but added that resources would be stretched.
South Wales assistant chief fire officer Rod Hammerton urged people to be "extra vigilant" saying fire cover would not be "anywhere near the normal levels".
North Wales chief fire officer Simon Smith warned that the start of the football World Cup posed an increased risk to people's safety if they were out socialising or entertaining friends and family at home.
In Mid and West Wales, assistant chief fire officer Rob Quin said they would have non-FBU staff on duty throughout the strike but warned that cover would still be reduced.
