Huw Jones enjoyed his Scotland debut in the second-Test win over Japan but is unsure if he will be available for the autumn series of fixtures.

The Edinburgh-born 22-year-old centre plays for the Cape Town-based Stormers in Super Rugby.
"The seasons are different and it's always tough with time off," he said. "I've got another year on my contract and I'll concentrate on that.
"If I get another call-up then I'll be very happy."
Jones appeared as a second-half replacement in Scotland's 21-16 success.
The visitors were under pressure for long spells and did not score a try but prevailed thanks to ill-discipline from Japan and the unerring kicking of Greig Laidlaw.
Scotland's captain came off the bench and knocked over four penalties in the final quarter of the match.
"It's a nice way to finish the season," Jones told BBC Scotland. "It's a massive day for me.
"It's a brilliant feeling to be able to get on the field and contribute to a win.
"We put ourselves under a lot of pressure with a couple of poor exits, but a win is a win and we'll take it."
Jones was a late addition to Vern Cotter's squad following the withdrawal of Glasgow Warriors fly-half Finn Russell.
He was not involved in the opening Test victory in Japan but replaced Ruaridh Jackson after 58 minutes in Tokyo, with Scotland trailing 16-12.
Peter Horne switched to fly-half, allowing Jones to form a centre partnership with Gloucester-bound Matt Scott.
"It's been very hot, with a sweaty, greasy ball," he explained.
"Different to Scotland, more similar to South Africa I suppose, but the conditions have been tough and tough games as well. Japan are a good rugby side."
