Wing Alex Cuthbert has been ruled out of the second Test of Wales' summer tour against Samoa on Friday, 23 June.

Cuthbert scored the opening try in the 24-6 win over Tonga at Eden Park, but suffered a shoulder ligament injury.
The 27-year-old Cardiff Blues player is set to be sidelined for up to six weeks.
"Alex has been in excellent form leading into this tour, so it's a shame he's had to leave us at this juncture," says Wales coach Robin McBryde.
"He's also been a great influence off the field with the younger players in the squad. I know he'll work hard now to be back in action for Cardiff Blues' pre-season."
Cuthbert's withdrawal and the departure of Kristian Dacey, Tomas Francis, Cory Hill and Gareth Davies to join the British and Irish Lions squad leaves Wales short-handed.
But at this point Wales will be making no additional call-ups as they prepare to face Samoa in Apia.
McBryde's captain Jamie Roberts believes Wales can cope after seeing their squad depleted.
"We have a big squad. Some players missed out against Tonga and now others will get an opportunity," said the Harlequins centre.
"We have to develop our strength in depth across the senior playing group in Wales.
"We're doing that well at the moment with the young players in this squad and we have the artillery to come in."
