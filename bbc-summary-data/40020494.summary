[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal defender Gabriel will miss Saturday's FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley after being ruled out for up to eight weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old, carried off on a stretcher during Sunday's win over Everton, has knee-ligament damage.
Fellow defender Laurent Koscielny is also out after the Football Association dismissed an appeal against his red card against Everton.
A third Gunners centre-back, Shkodran Mustafi, is a doubt.
Mustafi is suffering from suspected concussion having developed symptoms following a blow to the head against Sunderland last week.
At a news conference on Wednesday, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger confirmed Gabriel would be out until August.
He added he was waiting to hear from medical staff before deciding if Mustafi, 25, could play.
France international Koscielny, meanwhile, was dismissed for a tackle on Enner Valencia on the final day of the Premier League season.
The 31-year-old has been banned for three games, starting with Saturday's final.
