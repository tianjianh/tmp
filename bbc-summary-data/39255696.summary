Mohammed Humza, 25, from Watford, told the DVLA he was the new owner of Sheikh Mohammed Alibrahim's Phantom Coupe after seeing it parked in London.
He ordered new keys and sold the car for cash and part-exchange.
Humza admitted theft and five counts of fraud and was jailed for four years and two months at Southwark Crown Court.
The court heard the sheikh's Rolls Royce was checked "every couple of weeks" by his chauffeur.

However, on 21 April 2015 he noticed it was missing from its parking place in Mayfair and reported the matter to police.
Humza had filled in a V62 form informing the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) he was the new owner.
The court heard that after receiving this form, the DVLA contacts the owner about the change of ownership, and if there is no reply, a new logbook is issued.
Hamza sold the car to a dealer for £27,500 and a part exchange for a BMW car and a Mercedes-Benz.
He tried the same scam with the DVLA in attempts to obtain ownership of a £127,000 Ferrari, a £75,000 Porsche and a £21,000 Aston Martin, prosecutor Margia Mostafa said.
However, each of the owners responded to the DVLA to confirm they were still the registered keepers of their cars.
Jailing Humza, Judge Martin Griffiths told him: "You have been involved in what to my view is a professional and highly selective car theft business.
Humza, he added, had played the lead role in a "high culpability sophisticated fraud".
