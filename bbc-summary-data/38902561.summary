Stuart Beavon put League One's bottom club in front after being played through by Callum Reilly, before George Thomas made it 2-0 inside 19 minutes.
Adebayo Akinfenwa pulled one back on 55 minutes, but City held on defiantly.
Meanwhile, Luton Town beat League Two rivals Yeovil Town 5-2 in their rearranged quarter-final.
The Hatters will now face Oxford United in the second semi-final at Kenilworth Road on 1 March for a chance to face Coventry in the final on 2 April.
Coventry's victory over League Two side Wycombe sets up only their third-ever visit to Wembley - and their first to the rebuilt stadium since it reopened in 2007.
The Sky Blues' last two visits were both in 1987, when they famously beat Spurs in the FA Cup final in May, before losing 1-0 to Everton in the Charity Shield in the August.
