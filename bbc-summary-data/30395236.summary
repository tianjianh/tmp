[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crown rejects father killer Peter McDermott's plea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted killing his 65-year-old father but will face a murder trial after prosecutors rejected his plea of guilty to culpable homicide.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter McDermott 41, admitted killing Bernard McDermott at a flat in Lynedoch Street, Greenock, on 23 April.
The Crown alleges he murdered his father by repeatedly stabbing him on the head, neck and body.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Turnbull set a further hearing to take place next year.
The accused also faces a charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice, which includes claims that he hid a bloodstained knife and washed blood from his hands.
Mr McDermott is further accused of having a knife in a public place and a separate charge of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner.
