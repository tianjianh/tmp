She was walking her dog on a path beside the River Leven in Alexandria when a man grabbed her from behind and pushed her to the ground.
The attack took place at about 00:10 on Tuesday.
The man ran off, leaving his victim injured on the ground. She was taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley and treated for minor injuries before being released.
Det Insp Scott Hamilton said: "This was a very traumatic experience for the woman which has left her with both mental and physical injuries.
"Our inquiries have revealed that there were a group of teenagers, both male and female, nearby who may have witnessed the attack or may have seen the suspect hanging about the area either before or after it took place.
"This pathway is used by many dog walkers and I appeal to any of them who has information to contact police immediately."
