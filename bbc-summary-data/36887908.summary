Paul Massey murder: Fresh appeal on 'Mr Big' killing anniversary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have issued a fresh appeal for information a year after the murder of a criminal once branded "Mr Big".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Massey was shot five times outside his Salford home on 26 July 2015 in what police believe to be a gang feud.
No-one has been arrested over the killing of the 55-year-old security boss, who was jailed for 14 years in 1999 for stabbing a man outside a club.
Police said a Â£50,000 reward was still on offer. In 2015, Mr Massey's brother called the death an "assassination".
So far 18 arrests have been made in connection with "linked attacks and the wider feud" among organised crime in Salford, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.
Detectives said the gunman, who was described as white, slim and wearing a face covering, came from the direction of the community centre in the Clifton area of Salford before firing shots and then walking towards an alleyway by St Anne's Church.
They also re-appealed for a white man, about 5ft 10in tall (1.78m), to come forward after he was seen two days before the shooting in a white Renault Kangoo van in Clifton Country Park, carrying a torch and a gun described as being the same style as an Uzi sub-machine gun.
Following Mr Massey's release from prison, he was involved in the security business and is believed to have invested in property.
He was arrested with five others in 2011 as part of a GMP inquiry into a Salford-based security firm. He claimed officers were conducting a "witch-hunt" against him and denied any wrongdoing.
The following year, Mr Massey unsuccessfully stood to be Salford mayor after renouncing his gangster past.
But he was still under police investigation last year in connection with money laundering allegations.
Det Ch Insp Howard Millington said: "It has been an extremely difficult year for Paul's friends and family and we are continuing to offer them support.
"Salford is a strong community and I am appealing to people to come forward if they have any information that could help us bring the offender to justice."
