Paul Gallagher gave the visitors the lead with a neat chipped shot that had keeper Carl Ikeme well beaten.
Adam Reach doubled their advantage after the break when he collected a loose ball and fired low past Ikeme.
Joe Mason scored his second goal in two appearances since signing for Wolves in January but Preston held on.
The result sees North End move up three places from 14th to 11th and leapfrog Wolves in the Championship table, while the hosts slip a place to 12th.
Kenny Jackett's side, whose last Championship win came in their 3-2 victory against Fulham on 12 January, were booed off the pitch at the final whistle.
A bad afternoon for the hosts was made worse soon after Gallagher's opening goal as midfielder James Henry was forced off with a hamstring injury.

"All of us are looking for good performances and wins, and the wins haven't come here at home this year.
"It is our job to produce results and we didn't do that today. It was a disappointing day and a disappointing result.
"I understand the frustration and accept it. We need to produce. I need to produce results.
"I was looking for us to up the tempo but we couldn't create the chances that we needed and it was the key moments in the game that cost us because at home the goals against total is too high."
Preston manager Simon Grayson:
"We obviously had a bit of pressure on us when they scored but overall it was a very pleasing and professional performance.
"To go 2-0 up was just what we deserved. We got a little bit sloppy just after that but you can't fault the players for what they have done.
"We have to keep working and doing the right things. It is an honest group who are getting the rewards for what they have put in all season.
"The sole purpose is to be in the Championship next season and we will keep working hard and see where it takes us."
