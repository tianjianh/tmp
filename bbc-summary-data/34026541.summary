New Jet Age aircraft exhibit officially opened

A new exhibit has been revealed to the public at Gloucestershire's Jet Age Museum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Volunteers have been working to restore the HS Trident airliner cockpit and fuselage for the past six months.
Retired airline pilot Peter Lewis, from Hatherley, who co-piloted the British-built airliner in 1973 officially unveiled the aircraft at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Saturday.
Mr Lewis said "the museum's restorers have done a wonderful job".
"I started flying Tridents when 21 years old in 1969 and never expected to sit again in the one of 'my' aircraft again after all this time.
"The museum's restorers have done a wonderful job of bringing the cockpit back to life and I thoroughly recommend the public to visit the museum and experience what flying was like in the 70s".
The trident was the first jet airliner to use Autoland, or the Blind Flying System, which allows aircraft to land in poor weather conditions and is standard on aircraft today.
It was originally developed by Smiths Industries, now GE Aviation, at Bishops Cleeve.
The HS Trident was used as a fire trainer at Stansted Airport before it was scrapped. The cockpit, galley and first few rows of seats were rescued for the restoration.
