Samantha Kerr came closest to scoring for Australia in the first half, hitting a volley into the side netting.
Formiga almost gave Brazil the lead in the second half, heading onto the post, before substitute Kyah Simon grabbed the winner from close range after goalkeeper Luciana spilled the ball.
Australia face the winners of Tuesday's game between Japan and Netherlands.

Earlier in the tournament, striker Marta, 29, became the World Cup's leading scorer with 15 goals, but she was unable to inspire her team to a positive result.
"We controlled the game, the statistics show that, the chances showed that but we lost the game and we are out," said Brazil coach Vadao.
"Australia were very efficient and clinical when it counted with the goal, congratulations to them."
