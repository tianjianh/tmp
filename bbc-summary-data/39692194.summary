The incident happened near the Hand Hotel, Llangollen, on Saturday.
The Welsh Ambulance Service said an assessment was made over the telephone before the taxi was arranged.
Sonia Thompson, head of operations in north Wales, said the use of taxis in "appropriate cases" allowed ambulances to be deployed elsewhere.
"We are sorry for the wait this patient experienced and for any discomfort it may have caused him," she said.
The wait for ambulance assistance prompted criticisms from people on the Facebook group, Llangollen notice board.
It is understood the man had been on holiday with a group of off-road bikers when the incident happened as he was loading his bike on to a van.
