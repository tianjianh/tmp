[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 1-2 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-man Notts County picked up their first win in four matches after an impressive 2-1 win over promotion-chasing Portsmouth at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a strong start from the home side, it was County that found themselves ahead after 21 minutes.
A good ball from Richard Duffy allowed Adam Campbell to go one-on-one with goalkeeper David Forde, who watched as the striker coolly lofted the ball into the far corner of the net.
Six minutes later, though, and Portsmouth were level when Conor Chaplin latched onto a neat cut-back from Gary Roberts and confidently guided the ball home.
Kyle Bennett then had the chance to give Portsmouth the lead five minutes into the second half but his header from a Carl Baker cross was nodded agonisingly wide.
Campbell then restored Notts County's advantage after 71 minutes when he capitalised on some sloppy defending and neatly slotted past the helpless Forde.
The away side were reduced to 10 men with fifteen minutes remaining after Aaron Collins was shown a straight red for a late challenge on Forde, but despite a strong Portsmouth onslaught the scores remained the same.
