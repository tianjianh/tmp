The New Zealand-born back made himself available for England in March after completing three years of residency.
Solomona represented Samoa in rugby league last year before his controversial cross-code switch to Sale that will be settled in the High Court.
"The main thing is I need to come in and learn," the 23-year-old said.
"Obviously I'm still new to the game as it has changed since I played in school.
"There is Eddie Jones and the experienced players there like Mike Brown and everyone, I'm just going to keep learning."
Solomona, who scored 42 tries for Super League side Castleford last season, has continued his try-scoring feats since his switch to Sale in November with 11 in his first 13 games.
"I think my biggest buzz is contributing to a win," Solomona said. "I prefer wins than tries, they're the most important to me. If I'm contributing to that then I'm doing my job."
He has received a call from England captain Dylan Hartley about what to expect going into camp but got his news from an unexpected source.
"I was with my partner at the time and they announced it on Twitter and it just went from there - I was quite excited actually," he added.
"My mum texted me first and said congratulations and I didn't know what she was talking about, so I checked my Twitter and found out."
Four Sale players in total were called up as well as Solomona, including centre Sam James and identical twins and flankers Ben and Tom Curry.
The 18-year-old twins only both made their professional debuts this season and helped the England Under-20 side win a Six Nations Grand Slam earlier in the year.
"I was scrolling through some of the names and I was lost for words really when I first saw it," Ben told BBC Radio Manchester.
Tom added: "It was the first time I felt like I couldn't speak, I didn't know what to say. I still don't think it has really settled in much.
"I still think it's a massive shock to be playing for Sale so to go further than that is absolutely amazing."
