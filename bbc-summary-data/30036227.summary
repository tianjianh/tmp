[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cyclists in Glasgow are being urged to share their routes via a new mobile phone app in a bid to improve the city's bike network.

The Glasgow Cycling app allows cyclists to submit routes, distances travelled, times taken and average speeds.
The anonymous information will be available for free on Future City Glasgow's open data website.
It is hoped the data will inform future investment decisions and improvements to the city's cycling network.
Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: "Cycling has huge mental and physical health benefits for individuals as well as environmental advantages for the city.
"The number of cyclists coming into the city has increased drastically but Glasgow City Council is keen to encourage even more people to cycle both for leisure and commuting.
"This new app will provide accurate information which will be extremely helpful when decisions are being made on where and how to upgrade or extend cycling facilities. I hope bikers will seize this chance to contribute directly to work to make Glasgow more bike friendly."
The free app is currently available from the Apple store. An android version will be available soon on Google Play.
Current information about how cyclists travel around Glasgow is limited.
There is an electronic counter on the Anderston footbridge and a manual cordon count takes place every year.
Victoria Leiper of the Glasgow Bike Station urged cyclists to try the app.
She said: "This is our opportunity, as cycle commuters to shape decision-making.
"It is perhaps the most pro-active thing we can do and I certainly plan to use the app every day to submit my own journeys and to encourage our customers at the Glasgow Bike Station to use it as well."
Keith Irving, Chief Executive Cycling Scotland, urged other cities to follow Glasgow's example.
"All councils should be increasing monitoring of cycling levels," he said.
"This initiative by Future City Glasgow combines technology with data to develop information about cycling conditions in Glasgow.
"We hope it will be successful and could feature in a future Cycling Scotland conference as best practice to be copied across the country."
