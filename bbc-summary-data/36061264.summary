Keith Lowe rose highest to nod in top scorer Ben Whitfield's corner and give the already-relegated Harriers a lead.
They could not hold to it until the break as Ricky Miller reacted quickest to a speculative punt upfield, and lobbed goalkeeper Dean Snedker.
Harriers' Arthur Gnahoua and Zaine Francis-Angol both shot wide as the game petered out to a stale finish.
Colin Gordon's Harriers, who appointed John Eustace on Thursday as their new manager for next season,  have now lost just once in eight matches.
Harriers boss Colin Gordon told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"I was really pleased with the performance.  I only wish we could have had this run earlier in the season. But we've missed some good chances.
"We work on a league table for the last 20 games, since when we came in, and Dover are second only to Cheltenham.
"It shows you the level we've got to. Dover are the form team since January. So we've got to be proud, because we can compete. We have to take this positivity into next season."
