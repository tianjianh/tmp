The owner of Panda's Palace has submitted plans for the attraction, which it says would "give Skegness the place on the map that it deserves".
East Lindsey District Council has welcomed the proposal, saying it would extend the visitor season for the Lincolnshire resort.
The creation of the aquarium is expected to create about 25 jobs.
Katrina Graham, financial director for owner Teen Spirit Ltd, said: "We hope to give the town another destination attraction that will draw visitors to the resort.
"Skegness is a strong seaside location with good existing operations and we are fortunate to have excellent local business people that see the potential to keep reinvesting."
Teen Spirit Ltd also owns the town's Tower Cinema.
Councillor John Upsall, portfolio holder for property, said: "An aquarium would prove a huge draw for Skegness and the district as a whole, providing an additional all-year-round attraction for both local people and visitors."
Teen Spirit Ltd hopes to open the aquarium by April, if planning permission is granted.
