The bull, named Billy by crews, was freed within 90 minutes from the tree in a field off Barnaby Road, Rugby.
Two fire engines and the Large Animal Rescue Unit from Rugby were deployed after being alerted at about 10:55 GMT.
The animal "seems none the worse for wear for the ordeal," the fire service said.
It said "a winch, strop and riot shield" were used to remove the bull.
