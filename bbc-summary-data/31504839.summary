[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was detained by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit at his home in Stoke-on-Trent, a spokesman said.
West Midlands Police said the arrest related to suspected online postings referencing Islamic State.
He has since been released on conditional bail.
A police spokesman said the arrest was pre-planned and intelligence led and was not made because there was any immediate risk to public safety.
