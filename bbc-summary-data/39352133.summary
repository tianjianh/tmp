Easyjet has become the first UK airline to confirm how the government's cabin baggage ban on laptops and tablets will affect its customers.

From Wednesday, passengers on Easyjet flights from Turkey and Egypt to the UK must put large electronic devices, including e-readers, in the hold.
The airline said passengers would face extra security checks and advised them to arrive early at their airport.
The government is set to face an urgent question on the issue in the Commons.
The ban, announced by the UK government on Tuesday, applies to certain direct flights to the UK from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.
The ban applies to any device larger than 16cm long, 9.3cm wide or 1.5cm deep. It includes smart phones, but most fall inside these limits.
The government has not given a start-date for the ban, but says affected airlines are "in the process of implementing it".
Other UK carriers affected include British Airways, Jet2.com, Monarch, Thomas Cook and Thomson.
Overseas airlines affected are Turkish Airlines, Pegasus Airways, Atlas-Global Airlines, Middle East Airlines, EgyptAir, Royal Jordanian, Tunis Air and Saudia.
The ban follows a similar move in the US, where officials say bombs could be hidden in a series of devices.
