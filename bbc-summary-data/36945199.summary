The undisclosed fee for the 20-year-old, who has 10 caps for his country, is more than the Â£175,000 paid for Birmingham City's Alan Buckley in 1979.
"From the moment I walked into the stadium I felt comfortable I know this will further my career," Makris said.
"I will always give my best here and I can't wait to score goals and celebrate with the fans."
