Ryan Farquhar: Injured rider unlikely to race again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Farquhar has conceded it is unlikely he will ever be fit enough to return to top-level road racing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 41-year-old from Dungannon was seriously injured in a crash at last year's North-West 200.
Farquhar said the quick response of medics had saved his life and that he was fortunate to be able to look back on his successful racing career.
He plans to remain involved with the sport but also started competing in skeet shooting.
Farquhar will continue to run his KMR team and plans to have riders at the North West 200 in May and the Isle of Man TT races the following month.

The successful racer said skeet shooting provided him with an alternative outlet for his competitiveness.
"I would love to be able to represent my country in a second sport," he said.
"I am 41 years old now and my days of winning races at the North West and TT are long gone.
"Sheeting shooting gives me the adrenalin rush, the competitive thing I need to get out of my system and makes it easier for me as I'll probably never be fit enough again to compete in road racing.
"I can just look back on the career I've had, the wins I've had, and it makes it a bit easier.
"I'm one of the very lucky ones to have a great road racing career and still be here to tell the tale."
