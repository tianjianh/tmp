Albion would have regained a four-point lead over second-placed Wigan Athletic with a victory but, despite a bright start, they trailed when Aiden O'Brien crashed the ball into the top corner.
Lee Gregory made it 2-0 when he scored after rounding keeper Jon McLaughlin.
Clear chances were scarce after the break and the Lions held on.

"We had two or three situations and a great chance to score, and then we just got caught out with two balls over the top.
"It's because we were attacking. If you're attacking it's very difficult for the back four to be on the edge of our own penalty area."
