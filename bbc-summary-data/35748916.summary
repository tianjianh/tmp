[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mobile phone of a man accused of the shotgun murder of a takeaway boss was "tracked" to the scene of the crime, a court has heard.

Tipu Sultan, 32, was gunned down at close range behind the Herbs & Spice Kitchen in Lake Avenue, South Shields, in April, Newcastle Crown Court heard.
Michael McDougall and Michael Mullen, both from South Shields, deny murder.
The trial heard Mr McDougall's phone had been "tracked" to the scene.
It also heard that someone in biker leathers was caught on CCTV footage on a motorbike armed with a sawn-off shotgun near Mr McDougall's address in Hylton Avenue, South Shields, on the evening of the shooting.
Mr McDougall's blood was also found on a sawn-off shotgun discovered by children on waste ground near an address he had visited after the killing, the jury was told.
But the 24-old-year told the court the CCTV footage of the motorbike near his home was a "coincidence" and that it was his co-accused, Mr Mullen, who had taken his phone to the scene then brought it back.
He also said the gun found was probably one that was used during a robbery at his home in 2011, when he was the victim and during which he wrestled with two masked men and was injured.
But defence barrister Toby Hedworth put to him that he was "weaving a tissue of lies" to which Mr McDougall replied: "I had no involvement in this incident."
Prosecutor Richard Wright QC has alleged Mr McDougall, 47, wielded the weapon, while Mr Mullen drove him to and from the murder scene on the bike.
The pair also deny charges relating to possession of a firearm, while Mr Mullen has additionally pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
The trial continues.
