Dan Biggar: No Northampton bid for Wales fly-half, say Ospreys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ospreys say they have received no contact from Northampton about the potential transfer of Wales fly-half Dan Biggar.

The 27-year-old is on a national dual contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).
Biggar's deal expires at the end of next season, and has been linked with a move to the Saints in 2018.
"Northampton have not been in touch," Ospreys managing director Andrew Millward told BBC Wales Sport.
"Being on an NDC [national dual contract], I'm not aware that Northampton have gone to the WRU.
"I picked it [the speculation] up on Twitter last week and apparently the signing was imminent. The reality of the situation is Dan's not come to us and said he's signed."
Biggar signed his current dual contract in December 2015, with the WRU saying the deal included an option which could see him stay until the 2019 World Cup.
The Swansea-born player is expected to be involved when Ospreys face Stade Francais in Sunday's European Challenge Cup quarter-final, having returned from Six Nations duty with Wales.
"There's usually a six-month clause before they're [players] allowed to be in contact with any other club about signing," Millward added.
"I'd be really disappointed if there hadn't been some communication [to the Ospreys] on that from the agent or club, or both."
