Mixed fortunes in new bridge work in Highlands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new footbridge has been installed over the River Nevis in Lochaber to provide thousands of visitors to Glen Nevis with an improved crossing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-tonne, 42m structure was lifted into place by a crane last week. The bridge it replaces will be removed.
Meanwhile, work on another crossing in the Highlands has been suspended due to high winds.
The road bridge is being constructed on the River Ness as part of the new Inverness West Link road scheme.
High winds, which are forecast to continue on Wednesday and Thursday, have affected the operation of a large crane.
The project to deliver the new River Nevis crossing involved Highland Council and Nevis Landscape Partnership.
It was funded by the council, Heritage Lottery Fund, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Scottish Rural Development Programme and Sport Scotland.
The area around the Glen Nevis Visitor Centre has about 65,000 visitors a year.
