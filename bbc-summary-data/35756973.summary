The former Wigan winger's hat-trick was his first in Super League since September 2014, while leading try-scorer Thompson took his tally for the season to 10.
Hull FC had three tries overturned by the video referee as they controlled the game early on, but they lacked creativity inside the final 10 metres.
Lee Radford's side were undone by their inability to cope with Widnes' kicking game, as Kevin Brown and Joe Mellor combined to create three tries with the boot, while Jamie Shaul spilled a high kick to set up Brown's second-half try.
Vikings dominated after half-time to wrap up a convincing victory and move on to 10 points in the table, two ahead of Warrington and Wigan in second and third respectively.
Hull FC slipped below Salford to seventh thanks to a third consecutive defeat.
Widnes coach Denis Betts:
"Kevin Brown was on a drip yesterday because he was ill, he was massively dehydrated and his blood count was down.
"He's the leader of this group and he was fantastic for us. I say it every week: he's never under-performed since he's been here.
"I wasn't expecting to score that many points. We rode our luck early.
"The players were excited by the team Hull put out. They were excited by the challenge and they rose to it."
Hull FC coach Lee Radford:
"We simply capitulated and it's my responsibility as a coach.
"As a rugby player, you're told to compete and that stopped being a competition after 20 minutes.
"To have no fightback was embarrassing and the staff have just been kicked out of the changing room by the players.
"I've no idea why they asked us to leave. They just asked us to. It's never happened in my career before."
