Amnon Weinstein collects and restores violins and cellos from that time - among them, a violin that was played by an orchestra of prisoners at Auschwitz death camp.
To mark international Holocaust Day and the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, Mr Weinstein talks about bringing the violins back to life.
Interview with Amnon Weinstein recorded by Gidi Kleiman, with music performed by Professor Tzvi Plesser of the Jerusalem Music Academy.
