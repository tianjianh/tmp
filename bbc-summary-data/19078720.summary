Daniel Thomas, 28, will be the subject of an internal investigation into a tweet sent to Daley, Welsh Premier League Port Talbot Town FC says.
It has been reported a homophobic message was sent to Daley's Twitter page.
Club officials said their player had been the victim of a "misguided prank" after leaving his phone unattended.
The tweet came from the player's account, which has since been deleted.
In a separate incident earlier this week, a 17-year-old was arrested over a malicious tweet relating to Daley's late father and was given a warning.
Police said the teenager was given a harassment warning before being bailed pending an investigation into other communications on his Twitter account.
Daley and his diving partner Pete Waterfield came fourth in the 10m synchronised dive on Monday.
Port Talbot chairman Andrew Edwards confirmed midfielder Thomas had been suspended while officials investigated the incident.
Mr Edwards said he was due to meet the player on Thursday and a further statement would be issued then.
A club spokesman said: "Port Talbot Town Football Club can confirm Daniel Thomas has been suspended from all involvement with the club until we have carried out a full internal investigation.
"We were made aware to an offensive comment appearing on the Twitter feed of one of our players.
"Upon being informed of the matter, we immediately distanced ourselves from any offensive messages whilst investigating the matter further.
"Having spoken at length to the player in question, we believe he regrettably left his phone unattended and was the victim of a very misguided 'prank'."
The club said it and Thomas apologised "unreservedly" and in no way condoned the views in the tweet.
"All footballers at Port Talbot Town will also be briefed on the appropriate use of social media and ensuring it is used securely and responsibly," the spokesman added.
