[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 3-0 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shaquile Coulthirst grabbed his first goal of the season to set Peterborough on the way to derby glory as they thumped rivals Northampton 3-0 in the clubs' first match for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The frontman was left free to head in a Marcus Maddison corner in the 14th minute at the ABAX Stadium to provide the hosts with the perfect start.
And the same supply line was responsible for Posh doubling their lead eight minutes before the break as another Maddison corner was converted by Ryan Tafazolli.
Paul Taylor was denied further Posh goals by a fine Adam Smith save and a terrific Brendan Moloney goal-line block in the early stages of the second half.
But the home side then had to soak up Cobblers pressure before sealing victory with a late breakaway goal involving two substitutes.
Gwion Edwards burst into the box and clipped the ball perfectly into the path of Tom Nichols, who had replaced the injured Coulthirst just before the break, to volley past Smith.
It was Nichols' sixth goal of the season and snapped a 13-game drought while ensuring Posh leapfrogged Northampton in the League One table.
