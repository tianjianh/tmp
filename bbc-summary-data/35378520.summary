Wayan Mirna Solihin, 27, met with two friends in a Jakarta cafe on January 6.
She collapsed after complaining about her coffee's taste and died a short time later.
Traces of cyanide were found in her coffee and tests confirmed she had been poisoned, but Indonesian officials have not named a suspect.
Ms Solihin's best friend Jessica Kumala ordered the coffee, but has denied any knowledge of the cyanide.
Ms Kumala's lawyer and uncle Yudi Wibowo said a third friend, Hani, had also tried the coffee.
"That means Mirna did not die because of the coffee. Two people drank the same coffee but Hani is alive and well," Mr Wibowo was quoted as saying in the Jakarta Post.
The friends had reportedly studied together in at design colleges and university in Australia.
Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed in a statement that they had been asked to investigate the women's links from their time in Sydney and Melbourne.
The statement said the AFP would consider the request but did not make further comment on the case.
