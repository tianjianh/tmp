The 37-year-old has agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal with the Major League Soccer outfit, bringing to an end 10 seasons at Goodison Park.
The United States international will be available for the Rapids from 4 July, when the MLS transfer window opens.
"I will remain an Evertonian for life," said Howard, who joined the Toffees from Manchester United in 2006. "This will always be my team, my club."
Howard signed for United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season at Old Trafford before losing his place to Roy Carroll and, later, Edwin van der Sar.
Since joining Everton, he has, until recently, been the Toffees' first-choice goalkeeper, making 412 appearances for the club in all competitions.
A knee injury and loss of form led to his replacement by Spaniard Joel Robles at the end of January.
Paul Bravo, Colorado's technical director and VP of soccer operations, believes Howard will prove a "pivotal signing".
He added: "Tim is exceptional, both as a player and a person.
"He proved it at the last World Cup for the US national team and he has been proving it for the last decade in the English Premier League.
"He has experience at the very pinnacle of the sport and we feel he has much still to offer on the pitch."
