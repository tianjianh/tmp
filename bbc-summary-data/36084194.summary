Inspector rules Wellington homes plan should go ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A planning inspector has ruled a plan to build hundreds of homes should go ahead despite objections from the council and nearby residents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposal north of Haygate Road, Wellington, now has outline permission, but the maximum number of homes allowed has been reduced from 330 to 290.
An appeal by Gladman Developments Ltd against Telford & Wrekin Council has been allowed.
The council said it was considering its options.
Government-appointed planning inspector David Wildsmith concluded the development would bring "significant" economic and social benefits.
Other benefits include the creation of new footpaths, public open space and recreation areas, he said.
A council spokesman said he was "disappointed" the government inspector had "not accepted the arguments put to him by local residents and the council".
The spokesman said: "This inspector came to a very different conclusion to that reached by another inspector in similar circumstances very recently.
"Consequently we are carefully reviewing this planning appeal decision."
