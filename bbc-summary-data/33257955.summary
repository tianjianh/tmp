Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has launched his bid for the US presidency, joining a large field of Republican candidates vying for the White House.

The Oxford-educated son of Indian immigrants, Mr Jindal is known for his policy credentials.
As governor, he overhauled his state's health and education systems.
However, in recent months Mr Jindal has sought to appeal to conservative voters, taking hard lines on gay rights and Islamic extremism.
He has stood by controversial statements in which he said in January that parts of Europe were "no-go zones" for non-Muslims.
Mr Jindal is the 13th Republican candidate to join race. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker are also expected to run.
Many in the crowd gathered in a convention hall near New Orleans acknowledged their governor, Bobby Jindal, has a long road ahead in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination.
He's far back in the polls - disliked by a majority even in Louisiana - without the fundraising might that could give him a boost.
A lot of the statements here are prefaced with "I hope", "if only" and "with a little luck" - noting the toll that battles against teachers' unions and attempts to reform a corrupt state government have taken on his popularity.
"I just want him to get in the top 10 to debate," says Phil Luchsinger, referring to a poll-based debate participation rule that currently has Mr Jindal on the outside looking in.
The consensus among political commentators is even more pessimistic, including implications that the governor should aim a bit lower.
As Allahpundit of the HotAir blog put it: "Bobby Jindal to announce he's running for (vice) president".
In his video announcement on Wednesday, the 44-year-old played up his extensive experience in public service, saying he was "the youngest candidate with the longest resume".
He said he plans to appeal to Christian conservatives, a group of voters already being aggressively courted by rival candidates such as Texas Senator Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.
Unpopular in his home state after a budget shortfall, Mr Jindal faces an uphill battle for the nomination. Recent polls put him at the bottom of the pack.
