Alan Stubbs: Hibernian coming back into form after slump

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Alan Stubbs says Hibernian's win over Livingston on Tuesday was "a step in the right direction" after an alarming sequence of poor results.

Hibs had gathered just one point from a possible 15 prior to the 2-1 victory to fall third in the Championship.
"It looks like we are coming back into form again," Stubbs told BBC Scotland.
"You always have belief when you have good players because you know it's just a matter of time before they turn it around."
With Rangers having clinched the title, Hibs are three points behind Falkirk in the race for play-off places, with two games in hand on the Bairns, who visit Easter Road next week.
Hibs go to relegated Alloa on Saturday, with Falkirk at home to St Mirren.
"We've had a disappointing March but I'd rather be having those results in March than in April and May," added Stubbs, who faces a congested run-in, with a Scottish Cup semi-final against Dundee United to come later this month.
"We're aware of what's ahead of us but, as always, the most important game is the one coming up.
"There's no point in looking forward to Falkirk next Tuesday if we don't take care of Saturday."
Hibs were trailing at home to Livingston until Anthony Stokes and Martin Boyle scored on 75 and 78 minutes.
"Livingston are fighting for their lives and they came with a plan to get behind the ball and hit on the counter," said Stubbs.
"When a team does that, it's always important to get that first goal. Unfortunately, we didn't and Livingston had something to hold on to.
"But the lads showed great character and we created a lot of chances and scored two good goals."

The winning goal from substitute Boyle was a ferocious shot from distance and his manager was hugely impressed.
"I don't think I've seen a better strike this season," said Stubbs.
"He's just done everything right. There could have been a couple of keepers in and they wouldn't have been able to do anything about it!"
