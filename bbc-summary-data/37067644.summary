[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 1-2 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two second-half goals were enough for Leyton Orient to consign Grimsby to their third straight defeat in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam Kelly - after a mistake from Town keeper James McKeown - and Ollie Palmer, against his former club, ensured Andy Hessenthaler's men took all three points having been second-best for much of the first half.
Grimsby's Omar Bogle went the closest to breaking the deadlock with a fine strike that Alex Cisak tipped away while Craig Disley had a penalty shout turned down.
But Town could not make the most of their first-half dominance and they were made to pay a minute short of the hour mark when McKeown spilled a low cross at the feet of Kelly, who duly prodded home.
The opener rocked the hosts and they fell further behind when a slip from the otherwise excellent Shaun Pearson allowed substitute Palmer to race through and slot home.
Second-half replacement Dominic Vose did pull one back in stoppage time when his deflected strike looped over Cisak, but Orient saw the game out to take all three points.
