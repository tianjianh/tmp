Wladimir Klitschko says he will take Tyson Fury to court to ensure their world heavyweight title rematch still takes place.

The pair are due to fight on 29 October at Manchester Arena.
"Unfortunately, Team Fury is trying to change the terms of already signed contract multiple times, and it is going on endlessly," Klitschko said.
"To protect my own rights, and eventually see the rematch, I am forced to go to court".
Fury, 28, won the WBO, WBA and IBF belts from the 40-year-old in November 2015, but was forced to pull out of the initial rematch in July after injuring his ankle in training.
Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente told Boxing News that Fury's team were trying to change "many parts of the contract", including "financial conditions".
Fury recently threatened to sue the UK's anti-doping body over claims that he had taken a banned substance, but Ukad later charged Fury with a doping offence.
He was initially suspended on 24 June but this was lifted on appeal until a hearing in front of the National Anti-Doping Panel - with a new date not yet confirmed.
