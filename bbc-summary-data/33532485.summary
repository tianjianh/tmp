Greek bailout: Tory Eurosceptics fears over UK contribution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative Eurosceptics say they fear the UK may have to contribute to a fund as part of the Greek bailout, despite a 2010 political agreement ruling it out.

A source close to Chancellor George Osborne has said the government is "immovable" on the issue and will not contribute to eurozone bailouts.
But Tory MP Steve Baker said Westminster may be unable to stop UK taxpayers' money being spent.
The final decision may be made by EU states under a qualified majority.
Using the EU-wide European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) to pay for a transitional loan to Greece  could be approved if 15 countries representing 65% of the EU's population vote in favour.
So the UK and the Czech Republic, which also objected, could be outvoted by the likes of France, which is in favour, says BBC political correspondent Chris Mason.
Mr Baker, co-chair of the Conservatives for Britain group, said: "UK taxpayers' money could be spent, and there'll be nothing Westminster can do to stop it."
The EFSM is an emergency fund to support any of the 28 EU member states in financial difficulty.
It is funded by borrowing against the EU budget, to which the UK contributes.
EU officials have said the commission has the legal right to use the fund for loans of 12bn euros which could be given to Greece in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron said in 2010 he had won a "clear and unanimous agreement" that the EFSM would not be used for further eurozone bailouts, after it was used to assist Ireland and Portugal.
Instead, responsibility was meant to fall on member states using the single currency.
Those close to Mr Osborne had said he was "immovable on the key principle that British taxpayers won't contribute to eurozone bailouts".
The BBC's Chris Mason said: "Downing Street points to the conclusions of a European Summit in late 2010 which spelt out that propping up countries in the eurozone was the responsibility of fellow users of the euro.
"But EU sources suggest this agreement can be overridden.
"So what happens if the government's 'key principle' collides with democracy? 'We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,' a Whitehall source said."
