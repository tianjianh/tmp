[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln City have signed Brighton & Hove Albion winger Joe Ward on a one-month loan deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ward, 21, has played four games this season for Albion's under-21 side in the EFL Trophy.

He would also be ineligible should Lincoln progress to meet Albion in the fourth round.
