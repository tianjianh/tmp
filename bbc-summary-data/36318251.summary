The 35-year-old, who joined the region in 2013, made 18 appearances during the 2015-16 season as the Blues finished seventh in the Pro12.
The Blues have not disclosed the length of the new deal for Rees, who won the most recent of his 60 Wales caps against South Africa in June 2014.
"I feel I still have a lot to offer both on and off the field," said Rees.
"With the way we finished the season and the players we have brought in, hopefully we can really push on.
"As the capital region it is important that we get back to making the top six [in the Pro12] and Champions Cup rugby."
Rees arrived at the Arms Park from Scarlets in the summer of 2013 but was diagnosed with testicular cancer that October.
He underwent treatment and returned to playing, making Wales' squad to tour South Africa in June 2014.
