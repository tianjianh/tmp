"Sadly, despite being well aware of the risks, she thought she was invincible and she rolled the dice and has paid the ultimate price", the statement said.
A statement given to Devon and Cornwall Police on behalf of the family said: "Leah lit up any room she walked into with her incredible personality, sense of humour, striking looks and demeanour.
"Those who know her will ache to hear the words 'You allriiight' one last time."
The family warned other people against taking "dangerous NPS (new psychoactive substances) tablets" and urged "the government to place the dangers of psychoactive substances at the top of their agenda for discussion on the back of their Drugs Strategy for 2017."
Jacob Khanlarian, 20, from Newton Abbot, who was charged with intent to supply drugs in connection with the incident, will appear before Exeter Crown Court on 10 August.
