[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A German court has handed down a four-year jail term to a former militant in the far-left Red Army Faction (RAF) over the murder of a top prosecutor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Verena Becker was an accessory to the 1977 murder of West Germany's chief federal prosecutor, Siegfried Buback, the court ruled. His driver and a bodyguard also died in the ambush.
Becker, 59, denied any involvement. Two-and-a-half years already served in jail will be cut from her sentence.
The killer has not yet been uncovered.
The ambush happened in the south-western city of Karlsruhe. At the time the RAF was waging a violent campaign against the West German state, targeting prominent establishment figures and US military bases.
Mr Buback and his two aides were shot dead by a passenger on a motorcycle as their car was waiting at traffic lights.
Becker went on trial in Stuttgart in 2010, accused of playing a crucial role in planning and carrying out the murder. She was arrested the month after the murders.
The RAF, also called the Baader-Meinhof gang, killed more than 30 people. The group broke up more than 10 years ago.
