Gog the Yorkshire terrier became well known in Leicester because her owner Monti Shortt dresses her in clothes and pushes her around in the buggy.
But the pooch was taken when the owner, who has cancer, quickly popped into the Haymarket Shopping Centre on Friday.
She left Gog in her buggy outside and CCTV shows a woman wheeling it away.
Ms Shortt, 69, said she needs to get her pet back urgently because Gog needs surgery on her knees costing over Â£1,000.
"I haven't been without her since I've had her," said Ms Shortt.

"We come into town regularly and she lights everybody's day up.
"People say they love seeing her and hundreds of people have taken pictures of her."
Gog was wearing a jumper, spotty baby vest and ribbons in her hair when she was stolen.
She is five years old and Ms Shortt has owned her since just before she was seven weeks old.
Ms Shortt uses the buggy to help her carry things and Gog sometimes sits inside.
Leicestershire Police is examining CCTV of the theft, which happened in Humberstone Gate at about 14:50 GMT on Friday.
Ms Shortt's coat, bag and inhalers were also in the stolen buggy but she is only concerned about getting Gog back.
