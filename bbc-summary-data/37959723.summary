[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 2-1 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tahvon Campbell scored the winner as Yeovil Town came from behind to beat Colchester United with two goals in the final five minutes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Campbell's last-minute deflected effort beat Sam Walker as the Glovers secured a deserved victory.
Kurtis Guthrie had given Colchester the lead against the run of play early in the second half before Francois Zoko pulled Yeovil level with a fierce shot from a tight angle.
But Yeovil, knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Solihull in midweek, would have been wondering how they were ever behind in a match they had dominated.
The hosts spurned three golden chances in the first half, none more so than when Tom Eaves somehow put the ball over the bar from two yards out after being found by Liam Shephard,
They were made to pay for their wastefulness when Artur Krysiak dropped a Brennan Dickenson cross, sparking a goalmouth scramble in which Denny Johnstone hit the bar before Guthrie tapped home.
The goal left the Us on course for a possible first win in 10 matches, but Zoko and Campbell turned the game on its head as Yeovil's superiority eventually told.
