The 62-year-old has most recently been academy director at Leeds United, a position he left last month.
Hatters boss Nathan Jones has previously described Hart as a "mentor" during the Welshman's time as Charlton Athletic under-21 manager.
"I've been looking forward to this and I feel very lucky," ex-Leeds and Nottingham Forest defender Hart said.
"I've had 45 years in football and to come to a prestigious club like Luton, especially in this position as assistant manager is great, I'm very lucky."
Hart watched from the stands as the Hatters lost 2-0 at League Two champions Northampton on Saturday, a result which left Jones' side 14th in the table.
