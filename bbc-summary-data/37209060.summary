The 40-year-old made his first-class debut in 1993 and has made more than 800 appearances for the county.
Trescothick played 76 Tests, 123 one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches for England.
"I'm really enjoying my cricket and I still have the hunger to succeed," Trescothick told the club website.
"I have made no secret of my desire to carry on playing for Somerset for as long as I can.
"It's a really exciting time for the county at the moment with the talent that we have coming through and I can't wait to see what happens in the next 12 months."
The 2017 season will be the 25th that Trescothick has been involved with the first team.
