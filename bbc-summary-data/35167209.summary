BBC One show Countryfile is to get a new spin-off programme after achieving its highest ever ratings.

The Sunday night programme was watched by an average of six million viewers in 2015, with one episode in November reaching 7.8 million.
Countryfile beat The X Factor's Sunday results show in the ratings on two occasions last month.
The new five-part daytime series, named Countryfile Diaries, will start in the spring on BBC One.
Running across a week, the spin-off will feature country life through the changing of the seasons and will coincide with Countryfile's seasonal specials.
BBC daytime controller Dan McGolpin said the new programme would allow viewers "to further enjoy the full splendour and sheer variety of life in the British countryside during key moments of the year".
Countryfile's presenters include Matt Baker and Anita Rani and the show achieved its highest audiences in the autumn when it was scheduled before Strictly Come Dancing.
More than 7.2 million households tuned in on average between 8 November and 13 December.
Countryfile executive producer Bill Lyons said the "huge audience" had made the programme the most popular weekly factual series on TV - which he put down to "the enduring love-affair between the British people and their countryside".
The locations and presenters for Countryfile Diaries have not yet been announced.
