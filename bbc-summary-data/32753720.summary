University students from the poorest backgrounds are to be given more financial support, Education Secretary Angela Constance has said.

She said bursaries for students from a household with an income of up to £24,000 would increase by £125 a year.
Ms Constance added that the threshold for receiving the maximum bursary of £7,625 would be raised to £19,000 next year. It was previously £17,000.
She said widening access had long been a priority.
The education secretary said: "The Scottish government is committed to creating a fairer, more equal Scotland and as part of that we want every child in Scotland to have the same chance of going to university, irrespective of their background.
"Education should be based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay."
Vonnie Sandlan, NUS Scotland president-elect, said: "Today's announcement is a strong recognition of the importance of student support to improving fair access and a step forward in boosting the amount of money the poorest students have.
"Crucially, it delivers the increases in grants, further reducing student poverty without adding any worries of increased debt."
