Phenix, 25, signed by Telford from Skelmersdale United in June 2013, has scored six goals in 14 appearances for the Conference strugglers this season.
"My manager told me about the interest and it was a no-brainer," said Phenix.
A club statement revealed that said Barnsley's approach came only hours after they had received one from Conference rivals Halifax.
"The offer was put to the player and his wishes, to make the progression into the full time game, were fully taken into account," it said.
Last season Phenix was out for a month with ulcerative colitis, the same condition that Manchester United and Scotland midfielder Darren Fletcher has suffered.
Tykes forward Rhys Oates, 19, who had a loan spell with Grimsby Town earlier in the season, was expected to go the other way on a one-month loan, but the deal did not go through.
