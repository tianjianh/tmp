Terrance Clark, 50, was jailed for life and Lewis, 28, was given a 16-year-term for the raid at Tattenham Corner, Surrey, following a trial in June.
The pair, originally from Battersea, south London, were each ordered to pay £22,500 during a confiscation hearing at Guildford Crown Court.
They had previous convictions for violent offences including robberies.
Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz, said: "Obtaining the two conviction orders and the fact the pair now have to pay back the money they stole in compensation is an additional benefit to the already lengthy prison sentences handed to them."
The van driver James Smith, was left with significant injuries to his face and hands after the armed robbery on 30 January 2013.
Surrey Police published a Twitter reconstruction a month after the raid to gather information from people in the area at the time and eliminate suspects from inquiries.
The force said the tweets reached 53,000 people and generated 40 calls.
