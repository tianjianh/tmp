New Zealand's Steve Hansen was also named the coach of the year award.
England's Owen Farrell was on the four-man shortlist for the player of the year award along with New Zealand's three-time winner Richie McCaw and France's Frederic Michalak.
Carter, 30, has 94 caps for New Zealand but missed the All Blacks' triumphant World Cup victory in 2011 with a serious groin injury.
IRB Chairman Bernard Lapasset said: "Dan Carter has bounced back from the disappointment of missing the majority of the World Cup through injury to show what a truly magnificent player he is and a wonderful ambassador for our sport.
"New Zealand have again been the stand out team of the year with their 20-match unbeaten run and thoroughly deserve the IRB team of the year award along with Steve Hansen as IRB coach of the year for his feats in keeping a rugby World Cup winning-team winning."
The winner was announced at the Rugby World Cup 2015 pool allocation draw in London.
The IRB awards panel was made up of former players Will Greenwood, Gavin Hastings, Raphael Ibanez, Francois Pienaar, Agustin Pichot, Scott Quinnell, Tana Umaga, Paul Wallace and John Eales.
