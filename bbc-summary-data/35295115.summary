Paramjit Randhawa, of Honor Avenue in Wolverhampton, was filmed by undercover inspectors from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) in July 2013.
The 72-year-old was granted benefits in 1995, but failed to inform the DWP after his health improved in 2011.
At Wolverhampton Crown Court, he got an eight-month suspended jail term.
The video, recorded at Wolverhampton Swimming and Fitness Centre in Wednesfield, shows the defendant walking on a treadmill and lifting weights.
Judge John Wait ordered Randhawa - who has stepped down as a treasurer of Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wolverhampton as a result of the case - to pay back £19,782.
"You have lost your good character because you are a dishonest man," he told the defendant.
Randhawa's lawyer said his client "bitterly regrets" what he did and feels "ashamed".
A spokesman for DWP said the footage showed how investigators are "rooting out the unscrupulous minority" exploiting the system.
