[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tariq Javed absconded while the jury at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court was considering its verdicts on Monday.
The 37-year-old, of Aspinall Street, Rusholme, was later convicted in his absence of eight counts of sexual activity with a child under 13.
Police said Javed was a "flight risk" and that ports were on alert.
An arrest warrant has been issued while a sentencing date of 21 March has also been fixed.
Javed is known to have links to the Stockport and Manchester areas.
Det Insp Ian Cottrell, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "Javed has been convicted of incredibly serious offences committed against children.
"He is thought to be a flight risk and warnings have been put in place at ports and airports to ensure he does not escape the country but faces punishment for his atrocious crimes.
"I would like to make very clear that anyone found to be sheltering Javed will face arrest and prosecution."
Anyone with information of Javed's whereabouts should contact police.
