[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Vincent Hall, 22, is alleged to have flown to Oregon in April where he hired a car and then took the schoolgirl to a hotel.
Hall, a lifeguard at Arfon Leisure Centre, was suspended in October following a separate criminal investigation by North Wales Police.
He is due to appear in court in the US on 10 June. Bail has been set at $1.5m.
It is believed he met the girl on an internet chat site before flying to meet her, returning home four days later.
He was arrested trying to re-enter the US on 2 May at Chicago's O'Hare Airport and charged with rape, kidnap and other serious sexual offences.
North Wales Police confirmed a man in his early twenties from Talysarn was arrested in October 2014 "on suspicion of offences committed online and remains on police bail".
A Gwynedd council spokesman said: "Whilst it would not be appropriate for us to comment on the details of the on-going North Wales Police investigation at this stage, we can confirm that all relevant child protection procedures have been followed by the council in the management of this case."
The spokesman confirmed they are "aware of separate allegations" about Hall in the US media but said it was "not appropriate" to comment at this stage.
