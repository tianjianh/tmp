Subject to validation, the jackpot winner could receive the money when the banks open on Monday.
No details have been released about the winner, or where the ticket was bought.
The ticket is the second biggest National Lottery win, behind Colin and Chris Weir from Ayrshire, who scooped £161m in July 2011.
The winner will decide whether or not to reveal their identity.
It is not known whether the £148,656,000 prize was won by an individual, or will be shared by a syndicate.
The winning numbers were 11, 17, 21, 48 and 50. The lucky stars were 9 and 10.
A National Lottery spokeswoman said: "We are looking forward to welcoming the ticket-holder into our millionaires club, joining the 2,900 millionaires created by the National Lottery to date".
It is the seventh Euromillions jackpot to be won in the UK so far in 2012.
Mr and Mrs Weir have given large donations to several causes, including £1m to the SNP's Scottish independence campaign, since they landed their fortune.
Speaking last month on the anniversary of their win, they pledged to continue sharing their good luck.
The spokeswoman added after Friday's draw: "To date, our players have raised an amazing £28bn and counting for National Lottery Good Causes."
Another UK millionaire was created in the Millionaire Raffle Selection game, with the winning code JDW 016965.
