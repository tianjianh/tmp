[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colombia's government and Farc rebels have agreed measures to find people who disappeared during the country's decades-long civil war.

The government estimates more than 50,000 people are still missing.
The two sides will work together in a specialised unit to recover remains of those killed from unmarked mass graves and locate those still alive.
The issue was a key sticking point in negotiations to agree a broader peace deal.
The International Committee of the Red Cross will also help in the search for the disappeared.
It is set to be a harrowing process for the victims' families, and for Colombia as a whole, the BBC's Will Grant reports.
Last month, the Farc and the government agreed a deadline of six months for a peace agreement to be signed, a moment which was marked by the first public handshake between the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, and the leader of the Farc, Rodrigo Londono, alias Timochenko.
On 1 October the Farc announced a halt to the rebels' military training.
•An estimated 220,000 killed
•More than five million internally displaced
•More than seven million registered victims
•About 8,000 Farc rebels continue fighting
