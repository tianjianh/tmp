Colin Shields has signed a deal to return for a third spell with the Belfast Giants.

Shields, 36, quit the Sheffield Steelers earlier this month despite having scored 14 goals for the club this season.
The Scottish native helped the Giants clinch the league title in 2006.
In his second spell in Belfast, Shields was part of two Challenge Cup-winning teams and also helped the club win the play-offs competition.
Shields is likely to be available for Thursday evening's league clash against Braehead at the Odyssey Arena (19:00 GMT).
The Giants go into Thursday's round of fixtures six points behind leaders Nottingham although Belfast have two games in hand on the Panthers.
Nottingham defeated Sheffield in a shoot-out on Wednesday evening and the same teams meet again on Thursday evening.
