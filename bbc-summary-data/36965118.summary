Highland Hospice hoping to sell 19% stake in Inverness Caley Thistle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A charity that offers care to people dying from incurable disease has made a fresh appeal to find a buyer for its stake in Inverness Caledonian Thistle football club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Highland Hospice was gifted half a million shares - a 19% holding worth hundreds of thousands of pounds - by an anonymous donor earlier this year.
The hospice does not want to be involved in the running of the team.
It needs to raise funds for a Â£7.5m redevelopment of its Inverness centre.
The donation made the Highland Hospice the second biggest shareholder in ICTFC.
