Michael Hogan: New Glamorgan captain Hogan says 'structure' is key

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Glamorgan captain Michael Hogan says he is trying to bring more "structure" to his team after winning his first two games as official Championship captain.

Previous captain Jacques Rudolph stood down from the four-day leader's role.
Glamorgan have defeated Durham and Worcestershire following two opening defeats and two draws in their Division Two campaign.
"It's a method in how we approach the game," said Hogan.
"We had a bit of freedom in the past to go out and play how we feel. We're asking for more of a structured innings or bowling performance."
South African batsman Rudolph, 36, who will retire at the end of the 2017 season, hit his first Championship century since 2015 to help spark Glamorgan's comeback at Worcester.
But fast bowler Hogan is not ready to discuss a push for the top of the division, with four sides having already notched up four victories.
"So far we've had two good games but it's a work in progress" Hogan added.
"It was a slow start to the season, we're looking for improvement and we can assess in August where we're at."
Croft calls for 'resilience'
Coach Robert Croft says the handover of the captaincy has worked smoothly with both men influential in the Worcestershire victory.
"It's the right time because it's fitted into people's lives, they're both performing and working as a team of captain and senior player with advice" he told BBC Wales Sport.
The former England spinner believes "resilience" is the key word in the Welsh county's recovery.
"It comes down to the word resilience, it's about making sure that when you do bat you understand your role in the team," he said.
"Part of that is resilience, particularly against the new ball when things are more in the bowler's favour, and playing each ball on its merit.
"Earlier in the season we weren't playing the ball on its merit, whereas now we have done in the last few games, though there were a couple of slack shots (in the first innings at Worcester)."
Dutch duties
Fast bowler Timm van der Gugten will miss Glamorgan's match against Durham starting on Monday, 19 June because of commitments with the Netherlands.
South African paceman Marchant de Lange, who was rested at Worcester, is expected to replace him.
