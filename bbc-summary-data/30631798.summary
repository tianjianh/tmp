Speaking for the first time about the claims, playwright Jon Conway says: "The press have run away with that story."
Conway says Truth, Lies, Diana uncovers "secrets about Diana and her death the establishment have tried to hide".
Diana died in a car crash in 1997.
She left behind her two young sons, Princes William and Harry, aged 15 and 12 at the time of her death.
In the play it's revealed James Hewitt knew her before Prince Harry was born.
He has always said Prince Harry was a toddler when he first met Diana.
Jon Conway says when researching and writing the play he found evidence suggesting Hewitt knew the Princess of Wales before 1984, when the prince was born.
He says he presented this to Hewitt who responded with "Yes, that is the inconvenient truth".
In Princess Diana's controversial 1995 Panorama interview she admitted to having an affair with James Hewitt.
She said: "Yes, I adored him. Yes, I was in love with him. But I was very let down."
Jon Conway said: "Neither James nor the play makes any claim he is the father of Prince Harry. It's one of many examples where the public hasn't been told the whole truth [surrounding Diana].
"At no point did he or does he claim he's the father [of Prince Harry], the press have chosen to misrepresent that. The point we're making is that it would appear that the palace and certain sections of the media have conspired to not tell the whole truth."
James Hewitt has previously said there is "no possibility whatsoever" he is Prince Harry's father, the fourth in line to the throne.
The new play, which opens in London next week, says it reveals "sensational new information" about the death of Princess Diana.
Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the new play or any personal friendships of the royal family.
