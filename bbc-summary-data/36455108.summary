Adam Wheater (90) and Tom Alsop put on 169 for the home side's second wicket before the latter retired ill on 83.
Liam Dawson then made an unbeaten 70 off 52 balls as they finished on 310-4.
Westley and Jesse Ryder (71) shared 143 in reply, James Foster then hitting an unbeaten 36 off 19 balls to steer them to 314-7 with three balls to spare.
The odds seemed to be against Essex as they went from 195-1 to 211-5 in the space of four overs.
They needed 100 from the final 13 overs and Westley's innings, which included a six and nine fours, came to an end with the total on 251, when he was caught off Gareth Andrew.
But Ashar Zaidi made a vital 41 off 35 balls and Foster ended the match with a boundary off Andrew.
Earlier, the partnership between Wheater and Alsop was a List 'A' second-wicket record for Hampshire against Essex, beating the 135 between Gordon Greenidge and David Turner at Southampton in 1979.
