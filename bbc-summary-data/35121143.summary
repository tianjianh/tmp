The 26-year-old has scored 27 tries in 128 appearances for Quins, despite spending over a year out with a serious neck injury he suffered in 2013.
"My decision to stay was a quick and easy one," he told the club website.
"The club and its supporters really helped me during my long-term injury and it's something I'm truly grateful for. I want to repay the faith."
Harlequins have not disclosed the length of Lowe's new deal at the Twickenham Stoop.
