The 33-year-old has made 41 appearances since joining in October 2015, scoring 10 tries in 23 games this season.
Warriors director of rugby Gary Gold said: "Wynand is an experienced international who has been fantastic during his first couple of seasons. He adds vital know-how to the backline."
Olivier has won 38 international caps and was a part of the Springboks' World Cup-winning squad in 2007.
"I've felt at home since moving to Worcester where I've made some great friends inside and outside of the club," Olivier added.
"Hopefully I can help us push up the table towards our goal of becoming a top-end side."
The length of the deal has not been revealed.
