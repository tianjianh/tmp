Officers released images of the man's face, helmet, cycling shoes and the bike he was riding when he was hit on the A61 in Dronfield on Thursday.
The man, thought to be aged between 55 and 65, was airlifted to hospital when he died in hospital from head injuries.
Police said they were investigating new leads since releasing the photos.
His clothing indicated he might have taken part in triathlons, police said.
He was white, about 5ft 7in with short, light brown hair and a small scar on his abdomen.
He was wearing black Lycra shorts, red cycling shoes and a white T-shirt with the slogan "Barnsley Metrodome Triathlon 1990".
There was a sticker on the back of his helmet that said "Friar Tuck Triathlon 2002" with a race number 100.
His bike was a black and yellow Carrera TDF model.
The man died at Sheffield's Northern General Hospital after the crash, which involved a Citroen C3 car.
Police said they had been contacted by members of the public with information and possible names since releasing the photos on Wednesday morning.
A spokesman said they were following up a number of names and "making every effort" to identify the man.
