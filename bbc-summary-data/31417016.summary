Scottish Championship ins and outs - January 2015

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers continue to teeter on the brink of another financial implosion, but the Glasgow club still managed to make waves in the transfer market on deadline day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five players, including Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson and Slovenia midfielder Haris Vuckic, arrived on loan from Newcastle United thanks to Ibrox shareholder and Magpies owner Mike Ashley.
It looks likely that they will be involved in an attempt to win promotion via the play-offs with Rangers currently sitting second top but 19 points behind Scottish Championship leaders Hearts.
The high-flying Tynecastle outfit, meanwhile, went Dutch as they recruited strapping striker Genero Zeefuik on loan from Groningen and bought winger Kenny Anderson from RKC Waalwijk.
Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs will be hoping to help Fraser Fyvie recapture the form that led to his move from Aberdeen to Wigan Athletic in the same way as he has done with fellow midfielder Scott Allan.
Along with their four other senior additions, the third-top side are gearing up to give Rangers a run for their money in the chase for the runners-up spot assuming Hearts do not squander their lead.
