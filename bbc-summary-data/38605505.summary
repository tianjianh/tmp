[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday striker Sergiu Bus has left the club to join Romanian champions Astra Giurgiu.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bus, 24, moved to Hillsborough on a three-and-a-half-year deal from CSKA Sofia in February 2015.
But he struggled to make an impression on the Owls' first-team, making just nine Championship appearances.
Bus returns to his native Romania on an 18-month deal after his Wednesday contract was terminated by mutual consent.
