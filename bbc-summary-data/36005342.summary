Workers at Big Pit, in Blaenavon and St Fagans, in Cardiff are the first to walk out in this latest run of strikes.
The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union has said the strikes will run every weekend from 9 April to 1 May.
National Museum Wales said it is facing a cut in its budget and needs to make savings.
The action follows a strike over Easter after talks about a pay row broke down.
National Museum Wales said it was facing a 4.7% cut in its annual grant in aid from the Welsh Government and weekend payments cost about Â£750,000 a year.
PCS members are protesting against plans to stop extra payments to weekend and bank holiday staff.
