UUP to leave NI Executive: Reaction from politicians and key figures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has announced the party intends to leave the Northern Ireland Executive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He said his recommendation was "unanimously" endorsed during a meeting with senior party members.
The party's ruling body will make a final decision on Saturday, and if supported, he said the party would then form an opposition.
Politicians and key figures have been reacting to the announcement.
"We are sympathetic to the Ulster Unionists.
"We are sympathetic to the concerns they've got in relation to the overall crisis, but we don't think this is the right way of dealing with it.
"There are ongoing investigations by the PSNI and the Garda (Irish police) and various government agencies, and until they are completed it would be premature to make a decision of this sort."
"The DUP has a choice to make. Are they going to be the only unionist party, for the sake of office, turning a blind eye to murder?
"Today is a step in the right direction and I look to others to follow and complete that exercise to rid of us of this failed administration."
"Alliance has consistently said since the Kevin McGuigan murder that calm was needed from all quarters to prevent Northern Ireland moving deeper into crisis.
"However, the UUP appears to have used it as an opportunity to move into opposition in the run-up to an assembly election.
"They cannot credibly argue they did not know the Provisional IRA did not cease to exist, showing today's decision is political opportunism rather than anything done out of principle."
"I would like to welcome the UUP to the opposition benches in the assembly, increasing the number of opposition MLAs.
"Questions need to be answered, not least whether or not the Provisional IRA remains active, which appears likely, and if it continues to engage in criminality.
"We also need to know if the Provisional IRA is still inextricably linked to Sinn FÃ©in.
"If it proves to be the case that a party of government is tied to a criminal organisation, this would be untenable."
"There can be no doubt that Northern Ireland's already fragile political institutions are once again hanging by a thread.
"We support the UK government's efforts to engage with all parties to find a way forward in the aftermath of the disturbing circumstances surrounding the murder of Kevin McGuigan.
"We urge the UK government to work with the Irish government and US administration to identify confidence-building measures which can support dialogue and prevent the collapse of the institutions."
"I firmly believe the interests and welfare of the people of Northern Ireland are best served by an inclusive power-sharing executive, as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.
"I remain in close touch with developments and my officials are actively monitoring the situation in Northern Ireland.
"I will meet with Secretary of State Villiers early next week to discuss the serious situation in Northern Ireland."
"In two or three weeks' time the assembly could be running on and the executive could run on and people will say it was a premature move that didn't work.
"Or it could trigger off one of the big parties - the DUP specifically - rethinking their position and saying there is merit in this and then the whole thing comes down.
"I think that's what is really worrying the secretary of state and a lot of people in Northern Ireland."
