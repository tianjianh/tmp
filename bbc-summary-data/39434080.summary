The 35-year old, who previously announced his retirement, penned a short-term deal to return to the Welsh capital with Cardiff Blues in November.
Robinson says helping on the training paddock with the Blues has opened his eyes to future opportunities.
"It is working well for me and is a nice opportunity working here," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport. "But I am not retired yet, I am still going."
Robinson, who won 13 Wales caps, said he has not necessarily considered a career in coaching before rejoining the Blues, actually deciding it probably was not for him.
"I am helping out a bit with the coaching side; it has opened up a little bit of an opportunity for me to help out with kicking stuff," he explained.
"Especially with Jarrod Evans and Gareth [Anscombe] to see if they want/need my input.
"And if there are any injuries like there were earlier in the season. I am there and raring to go. '
"I thought about it previously and felt I didn't want to do it.
"I felt my experiences of working with coaches and how stressful that can be and obviously when you're a fly-half you have quite a bit of input both on and off the pitch.
"But it wasn't something I really wanted to pursue as I haven't done a huge amount of coaching.
"This just worked nicely as a nice opportunity to gain experience and see if it was something that I wanted to pursue long-term or not."
