The charity Mudiad Meithrin said he was left on the bus outside Camau Bach in Aberystwyth for more than two hours on Tuesday without staff knowing.
The incident was referred to the Care and Social Services Inspectorate (CSSIW) and the council's safeguarding board.
The CSSIW described it as "terrible".
A spokesman said: "We were notified last night of the incident regarding a child at Meithrinfa Camau Bach nursery in Aberystwyth.
"We are in close contact with the provider and the local authority safeguarding team to ensure all steps are being followed to avoid this terrible incident happening again."
It is believed the boy was meant to spend half the day at the local Welsh-speaking primary school, Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth, and the other half at the nursery.
But he was left unattended on the journey between the two places.
Parents of children from the nursery said the boy was "distressed" and taken to hospital.
The member of staff responsible for the child was immediately suspended from her work, Mudiad Meithrin said.
Camau Bach will be closed for a week to allow the investigation to take place.
Tuesday was the hottest day of the year so far with temperatures in parts of Ceredigion reaching 31.8C (89.2F).
A spokesman for NSPCC Wales said: "When left alone in a vehicle, young children can very quickly start to get anxious and distressed and there are clear added dangers when temperatures are extremely hot - as has been the case this week.
"We always advise parents and carers never to leave babies, toddlers and very young children alone - whether in a vehicle or at home."
