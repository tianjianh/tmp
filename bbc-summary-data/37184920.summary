Rykiel, nicknamed the Queen of Knitwear, had been suffering from Parkinson's disease for some time before her death on Thursday.
Nathalie Rykiel, managing artistic director of the Sonia Rykiel fashion label, said: "My mother died at 05:00 this morning at her home in Paris from the effects of Parkinson's."
In 2012, Rykiel revealed she had been diagnosed 15 years earlier.
She had initially kept the condition private but wrote about her diagnosis in a book when her symptoms became too difficult to disguise, fashion site WWD said.
