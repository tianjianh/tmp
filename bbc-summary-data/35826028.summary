[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A south Belfast man has admitted offences linked to the death of a County Tyrone student who died after being struck by a van.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Ross Casement is the second man to appear in court in connection with the death of Enda Dolan.
Mr Dolan was a first year architecture student at Queen's University from Killyclougher.
The 18-year-old died after being struck by a van as he was walking along the Malone Road in Belfast in 2014.
He was returning to his student accommodation at Queen's Elms.
On Tuesday, 31-year old David Lee Stewart, from Grays Park Avenue in Belfast, admitted five charges arising from the death of Mr Dolan, including causing his death by dangerous driving.
Casement, 21, from Belvoir Drive in Belfast, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday.
He admitted two charges - aiding and abetting dangerous driving, and aiding and abetting the failure to remain at the scene of an accident where an injury had occurred.
When both of the charges were put to Casement, he replied "guilty".
Casement was informed by Judge Gordon Kerr QC that he will be sentenced for the two charges on 22 April - the same day as his co-accused, David Stewart.
