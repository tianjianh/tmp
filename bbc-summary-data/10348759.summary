Anupam Kher wrote on micro-blogging site Twitter that he was not going to play the German dictator in Dear Friend Hitler.
"Sometimes human emotions are more important than cinema," Mr Kher wrote explaining his decision to withdraw.
The project drew protests from Jewish groups in India and outside and was condemned by historians.

"Thanks for your varied reactions to my opting out of Hitler.  After 400 films in 26 years I have the right to be wrong and still be happy," the actor wrote on Twitter.
In a statement to news agency Reuters, Mr Kher said: "Considering the ill-will that the project is generating among my fans, I wish to withdraw from it as I respect their sentiments."
The project was criticised after director Rakesh Ranjan Kumar said the film would show Hitler's "love" for India.
Mr Kher said he chose Dear Friend Hitler as the film's title because that is how Mahatma Gandhi had referred to Hitler in his letters.
But several historians questioned the claim saying that the German dictator had no respect for Indians and that he regarded them as racially inferior.
