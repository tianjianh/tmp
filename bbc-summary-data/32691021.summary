Many people fly them for fun, but there are already lots of new ideas about how drones could be used in the future.
Companies have suggested drones could deliver shopping to your home, or get medicines to places that are difficult to reach.
At the moment there are strict rules about flying drones, to make sure everybody is kept safe.
The Civil Aviation Authority says:
Some of those rules mean, at least for now, drones won't be able to deliver our shopping.
But as technology improves, it's hoped that drones will get better at detecting other objects in the sky, so they can automatically dodge any collisions.
