[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Africa have included Dale Steyn in their squad for the two remaining Tests against England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fast bowler missed the second Test in Cape Town with a shoulder injury as England survived a dramatic final day to draw and retain their 1-0 lead.
Fellow paceman Vernon Philander misses out on the next Test, which starts on 14 January, with an ankle injury.
The hosts will be led by AB de Villiers after Hashim Amla resigned the captaincy following the second Test.
If England win in Cape Town, they will take an unassailable lead in the four-Test series after a 241-run victory in the first Test in Durban.
South Africa have also named a 14-man squad for the five-match one-day international series starting on 3 February.
Slow left-armer Aaron Phangiso drops out of the squad that won their most recent ODI series in India but batsman Rilee Rossouw is fit again.
"We were highly encouraged by the performance put up by the Proteas at Newlands," said selection convener Linda Zondi.
"The very fact they were nearly able to force a win after conceding 600 runs on the first innings speaks volumes for the character of this group.
"We feel we have all our bases covered and also the options that will enable the team to exploit whatever conditions they encounter at the Bidvest Wanderers Stadium and at SuperSport Park."
South Africa Test squad: AB de Villiers (capt), Kyle Abbott, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Dean Elgar, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Dale Steyn, Stiaan van Zyl, Hardus Viljoen.
South Africa ODI squad: AB de Villiers (capt), Kyle Abbott, Hashim Amla, Farhaan Behardien, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Dale Steyn.
