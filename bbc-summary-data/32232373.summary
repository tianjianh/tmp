[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ednane Mahmood, from Blackburn, is also alleged to have provided internet links to others with speeches and propaganda that encouraged acts of terrorism.
He was stopped by police at Manchester Airport after returning from Turkey on 21 September and charged on Wednesday.
Mr Mahmood was released on conditional bail when he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
The conditions include sleeping at his family home, reporting to a police station in Blackburn twice a week, not applying for travel documents and a ban from using the internet.
During the brief hearing before magistrates, the 18-year-old spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address.
Mr Mahmood will next appear at the Old Bailey on 24 April.
His arrest followed an investigation by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and Lancashire Constabulary.
