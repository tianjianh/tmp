Cronulla rally: Supreme Court bans Sydney race riot 'memorial'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The New South Wales Supreme Court has ruled a rally to mark 10 years since race riots in Sydney's Cronulla suburb cannot go ahead.

Police had sought an injunction against Saturday's planned gathering, arguing that it could stir tensions.
The far-right organisers of the rally were billing it as a "memorial".
Organiser Nick Folkes, leader of the anti-Islam Party for Freedom, said the decision was an attack on free speech but that he would not stage the event.
Mr Folkes told the court he would submit to the "unjust request" to cancel the event and use the party's Facebook page to say it was not taking place. He also agreed not to address any public gathering that did occur.
The court said he could face jail or seizure of his property if he disobeyed the order.
Mr Folkes said instead, he would hold a "halal-free" barbecue. The party's Facebook page is advertising the event as taking place in the same site as the cancelled rally.
Police have said there will be an operation in place on Saturday around Cronulla in case of unrest.
In November, a series of protests were held across the country by anti-Islam groups. In some places protesters clashed with anti-racism groups.
