[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Terry Taylor, 59, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, was found at the Globe Hotel in Main Street, Cockermouth, early on 31 May. He was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.
Michael Sanderson, 31, of Arkleby Hall Cottages, Arkleby, Aspatria, previously denied murder at Carlisle Crown Court.
He was jailed at Manchester Crown Court and must serve at least 14 years.
Cumbria Det Ch Insp Roy Ledingham, said: "Terry died as a result of severe trauma to the head caused by a serious and sustained assault, and today Sanderson has been brought before the courts to answer for this terrible crime.
"Nothing will ever bring Terry back to life, however I hope today's result will provide his family with some closure. Our thoughts remain with them during this difficult time."
