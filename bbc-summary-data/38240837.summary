At least three-quarters of MPs in the West Midlands have been abused or threatened while doing their job, a BBC investigation has found.

While one MP revealed a knife had been pulled on him, others had received death threats and one MP was so concerned she had a panic room fitted to her constituency office.
The research was carried out following the murder of the Batley and Spen MP, Jo Cox, in June.
A total of 55 out of 63 MPs responded.

Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips has had a panic room fitted to her constituency office, while Gisela Stuart, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said she had received death threats on Twitter and verbal abuse at a railway station.
"Whilst I have chosen to be in public life, and therefore I have made a choice to take some risks, I feel an even greater responsibility towards my staff," she said.
She added: "We have to make it absolutely clear that this is unacceptable and work with others to stop it."
The MP who said he had a knife pulled on him did not want to be identified.
Staffordshire security expert Kenn Griffiths said MPs and public figures should "take stock" and "start to put together some sort of plans of action that they can take".
