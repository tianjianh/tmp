He was speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme ahead of the minister's appearance before the Scottish Parliament's education and culture committee.
Mr Rowley said: "The advise we are getting from government officials was this was a profitable festival and as such under normal circumstances there was limited scope to put public finances into this.
"It is not clear what the money was for.
"We need openness, we need transparency, we need accountability when public money is being spent."
