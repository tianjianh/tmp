Tipu Sultan, 32, was found with a single gunshot wound outside the town's Herbs n Spice Kitchen on 7 April.
Two men were captured on CCTV leaving the scene on a motorbike after what police have said was a planned attack.
The detective leading the investigation said he hoped the reconstruction would encourage witnesses to come forward.
Det Ch Insp John Bent of Northumbria Police said: "To shoot someone in the throat from half a metre away is a cold-blooded killing.
"This is a man who was very much a pillar of society, well known, well respected, polite, considerate and a young father.
"Those who did this are particularly dangerous people and people that we need to catch."
The victim's brother Mahsum Sultan said: "He was an amazing person.
"You have that one person in your life who is always smiling and you never see them sad. He was that person."
Since the murder investigation was launched, more than 1,000 homes have been visited by officers carrying out house-to-house enquiries and 225 statements taken.
Officers have also received more than 100 phone calls, emails and letters from members of the public.
A 35-year-old Newcastle man has been arrested and bailed in connection with the death.
Crimewatch is on BBC One at 21:00 BST
