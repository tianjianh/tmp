Plans for a multimillion-pound revamp of a Hampshire leisure centre have been given the go-ahead.

The £28m scheme, which will include a larger pool and expanded gym facilities at Fleming Park leisure centre, was approved by Eastleigh Borough Council on Wednesday.
It is hoped the replacement centre will open near Passfield Avenue, Eastleigh in 2017.
The current centre - built in the 1970s - will be demolished.
Grant funding of up to £2m from Sport England and New Homes Bonus funding of £3.8m will support the project with the remainder coming from Eastleigh Borough Council.
Keith House, Liberal Democrat leader of the authority, said the new centre "would underpin our ambitions for a healthy Eastleigh Borough and will allow us to develop our young talent while delivering sports and leisure opportunities for people of all abilities".
