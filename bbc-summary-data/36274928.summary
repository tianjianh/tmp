[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission will review allegations Alison Hernandez failed to declare expenses as election agent in Torbay in the 2015 General Election.
It comes on the first day of office for Ms Hernandez as Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall.
She has denied any wrongdoing.

The referral to the IPCC was made by the chief executive of the office of the police and crime commissioner, Andrew White.
The watchdog will decide whether to investigate, or refer the matter to another police force.
Ms Hernandez faced criticism for taking the oath on Tuesday and failing to stand aside amid a wider probe into Conservative MPs expense.
On Thursday she said she wanted to get on with her job "without distraction".
"Today I take up that post determined to serve every single person that lives in this police area and determined that the priorities I want to implement in the next four years are heard."
A spokesman for the IPPC said: "An assessment is under way to determine the appropriate level of IPCC involvement, if any."
