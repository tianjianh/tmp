USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann says it is "fantastic" that the Premier League has its first American coach after Bob Bradley was appointed Swansea manager.

The Swans, who are 17th in the table and without a win since the opening day of the season, replaced Francesco Guidolin with Bradley, 58, on Monday.
"Bob deserves this chance," said German Klinsmann, 52, an ex-Tottenham striker.
"It is fantastic that there is an ownership group in the Premier League giving trust into an American coach."
Klinsmann, part of the West Germany side who won the 1990 World Cup, added: "There are plenty of very, very good American coaches that can coach overseas."
Bradley was in charge of the United States from 2006 until 2011 before spells in Egypt, Norway and France.
He spent last season at French second-tier side Le Havre, missing out on promotion to Ligue 1 by a single goal.
Bradley beat ex-Manchester United assistant manager Ryan Giggs, former Derby boss Paul Clement and ex-Villarreal manager Marcelino to the Swansea job.
"Bob went the tough route," Klinsmann added.
"The places he went after he coached the USA national team have been impressive.
"He did not shy away from different cultures, languages or approaches. He deserves that chance and I hope they give him all the support in the world."
