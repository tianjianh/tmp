Deputy PCC Yvonne Mosquito suspension 'heavy-handed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The suspension of the West Midlands Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner was "heavy-handed", a meeting heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yvonne Mosquito was suspended last month over allegations she visited a murder victim's family without informing officers.
But Maxie Hayles said Ms Mosquito was "an ordained minister giving condolences to a grieving family"â€Ž and a councillor for the area.
He chaired a meeting of more than 100 people to discuss the suspension.
Monday's public meeting at the Afro-Caribbean Millennium Centre in Winson Green, Birmingham, discussed community concerns over the suspension.
Kenichi Phillips, 18, was killed as he sat in a car in St Mark's Crescent, Birmingham, on 17 March.
Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson previously said he took the "very difficult decision to suspend the deputy PCC" with immediate effect, pending an internal investigation into potential gross misconduct.
Allegations against Ms Mosquito were reported by a "senior officer from the force" and if proven "could have potentially hindered and jeopardised a complex, sensitive and ongoing murder investigation", he said.
The union Unite said it was "appalled" more detail about the allegations "that should be private and confidential" had been put into the public domain by the PCC.
The BBC later revealed Ms Mosquito had complained about the PCC four weeks before her suspension.
There was "no connection between the decision [to suspend] and any other issues," the PCC's office has said.
Peter Pennant, local pastor from the Council of Black Majority Churches, told Monday's meeting Ms Mosquito's visit was not in her capacity as deputy PCC, but in a "church pastoral capacity".
Ms Mosquito has not yet commented.
