Goulding, 27, was at Hull KR when he was forced to quit the game on medical advice after suffering a series of concussion injuries.
He came through the academy at the Warriors and won a Super League and Challenge Cup double in 2013.
"This club will always feel like home and I'm glad to be back," he said.
Goulding, who made two appearances for England in 2010, replaces Jordan James who will leave the Super League side.
