Aston Villa's Joleon Lescott is in talks with Rangers over a possible move to the Scottish Premiership.

Rangers boss Mark Warburton travelled south to meet the 34-year-old former Everton and Manchester City defender, who signed a two-year deal with Villa last year after leaving West Brom.
The Ibrox club currently have free agent and ex-Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos, 31, training with them.
And Preston North End say striker Joe Garner, 28, is free to join Rangers.
Garner was the subject of a bid from the Scottish Premiership outfit and Preston manager Simon Grayson revealed it is now up to the player whether he wishes to move.
England international Lescott won 26 caps between 2007 and 2013 and has made over 600 senior club appearances.
However, following Villa's relegation from the Premier League, the defender has not featured for Roberto Di Matteo's Championship side so far this season.
