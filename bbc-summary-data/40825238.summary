Cardiff Devils have re-signed forwards Patrick Asselin and Luke Piggott, and recruited centre Paul Crowder.

Asselin, 30, joined the Devils last season after taking a year off and finished with 21 goals and 38 assists.
Crowder, 32, is a former team-mate of Devils player-coach Andrew Lord and joins after also having a season off.
Piggott, 31, will feature for the Elite League champions for a seventh successive season after agreeing to return ahead of the new campaign.
Crowder and Lord played together for the Wheeling Nailers in the ECHL during the 2010/11 season, along with another current Devil, Joey Haddad.
"I know Paul very well and I know what type of guy he is, the way he plays and what he brings to a team," said Lord.
"He has always produced offensively and is another big body up front and a solid two-way centreman."
Crowder split the 2015/16 season between Amiens in the top French league and Fort Wayne in the ECHL.  In total, he played 53 games that season, scoring 15 goals and 39 assists.
Asselin, along with linemates Joey Haddad and Layne Ulmer, formed an impressive trio that solidified the Devils with two top lines last season.
"Patrick is a great two-way forward and as good as he is offensively, he is responsible on the back check and in his own end," said Lord.
"He is a big-game player and can make those game-changing plays that have you just in awe.  It wasn't just important for us to get him back, it was vital."
On the signing of Piggott, Lord said: "Luke Piggott epitomises what the Cardiff Devils are all about.  He is a great team-mate, he is unselfish, works hard every day and will do anything for the team.
"The bottom line is, we wanted him around and we want him part of this team, which is exactly what he wants as well."
