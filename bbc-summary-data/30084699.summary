The lead actor is Sean Bean, who also starred in the Northern Ireland-shot Game of Thrones.
The series will be produced by Rainmark Films, whose director Frank Doelger is one of the Game of Thrones showrunners.
The production will be part financed by NI Screen, the Northern Ireland state film agency.
Set in 1827, the series is a reworking of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein that combines a detective drama with a horror thriller.
Bean will play Inspector John Marlott in the show, which begins filming in January
One of the series' creators, Benjamin Ross, said: "Marlott's investigation takes him into the dark corners of Regency London.
"He discovers an underworld of prostitution, drug smuggling, bodysnatching and murder for profit."
The series has been commissioned for ITV Encore, its subscription drama channel.
ITV director of drama Steve November said it was "an epic re-working of one of literature and cinema's most iconic stories".
