Accrington Stanley 2-0 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Loan players Harvey Rodgers and Noor Husin secured Accrington a home win over Notts County in their League Two relegation battle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Rodgers, on loan from Hull, headed home on 45 minutes, while substitute Husin, who signed from Crystal Palace on Tuesday, had an easy tap-in to secure a vital three points for Stanley and plunge Kevin Nolan's side deeper into trouble.
The first chance fell to County striker Jon Stead when he raced free onto a ball forward, beat keeper Marek Rodak and fired goalwards only for Mark Hughes to scramble the ball out for a corner.
Stanley then had two good chances but were denied both times by the fingertips of goalkeeper Adam Collin.
He spectacularly kept out a long-range Sean Clare strike and minutes later he prevented an own goal as Richard Duffy got to the ball first in a challenge with Billy Kee.
The Reds took the lead just before the break when Sean McConville got the ball on the left and floated in a cross which Rodgers headed home from close range for his first Stanley goal.
County pressed at the start of the second half with Adam Campbell's low drive blocked from their best chance.
Rommy Boco could have increased Stanley's lead but was once again denied by Collin at the near post, while Kee's fierce strike was well held by the goalkeeper.
Former Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi came on for the Magpies on 69 minutes after signing a short-term deal, but it was Stanley who had the final say on 80 minutes.
Substitute Jonny Edwards charged forward, forcing a good save out of Collin but he could only push it out to Husin who tapped home on debut to give Stanley their first home league win since October.
