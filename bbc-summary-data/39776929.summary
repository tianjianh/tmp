France election: Le Pen accused of plagiarising Fillon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has been accused of plagiarising defeated rival François Fillon in a speech she delivered on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Several sections of her speech in Villepinte, north of Paris, appear to repeat almost word-for-word comments Mr Fillon made in an address on 15 April.
An official of her National Front party said she had made a "nod" to Mr Fillon and it showed she was "not sectarian".
Ms Le Pen faces centrist Emmanuel Macron in the final round on Sunday.
The similarity in the speeches was pointed out by the Ridicule TV YouTube channel, initially set up by François Fillon's supporters to attack Mr Macron before the first round of voting that saw Mr Fillon eliminated from the contest.
Ridicule TV said the far right presidential candidate had plagiarised Mr Fillon's speech "word for word" and set the two speeches side by side, inviting viewers to make up their own minds.
The videos were also posted on Twitter.
Several passages imitated Mr Fillon's address word-for-word:
The Liberation newspaper said that what was supposed to have been a key speech for the second phase of voting in the election became instead a focus of ridicule for social media users.
But Florian Philippot, deputy chairman of the National Front, told Radio Classique the party had owned up to the similarities and that Ms Le Pen's speech was "nod-and-a-wink" to Mr Fillon's speech to "launch a real debate" on French identity.
He earlier told Agence France-Presse that the speech showed "she is not sectarian".
Ms Le Pen's campaign manager, David Rachline, also played down the accusations of plagiarism, saying the speech was a form of tribute to Mr Fillon, which "was appreciated" by his supporters.

The polling average line  looks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower.
RTL said there was a fairly simple explanation for the similarities, in that one of those who helped with the Le Pen speech, Paul-Marie Coûteaux, had written the speech for Mr Fillon.
However, Le journal du dimanche quoted Mr Coûteaux as saying that, although he had provided material for Mr Fillon, he had not done so for the National Front.
How politicians created a sense of déjà-vu
Mr Fillon was a leading candidate for the presidency, representing the establishment conservative Republicans, but his campaign foundered after a funding scandal and he did not get through the first round of voting.
Recent opinion polls suggest Mr Macron is heading for victory on Sunday, carrying around 60% of the vote.
In a speech on Monday he said he would fight "until the last second" against Ms Le Pen's ideas "of what constitutes democracy".
The two candidates will go head-to-head in a TV debate on Wednesday evening.
