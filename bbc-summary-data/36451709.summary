[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The children were taken to hospital after the attack in their home in Blainroe on Friday at 19:30 local time.
Two of them had to be airlifted to Tallaght Hospital in south west Dublin but all four have now been discharged.
Stephen Hartnett, from Kilpoole, Wicklow, was charged with four counts of assault causing harm to the victims.
He was brought before a special sitting of Bray District Court in County Wicklow on Saturday evening.
A police officer told the judge that Mr Hartnett made no reply when officers put the charges to him.
The accused did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody until next Thursday.
The judge requested that Mr Hartnett receive the appropriate psychiatric and medical assistance, according to Irish state broadcaster, RTÃ‰.
It is understood the children - two boys and two girls - are aged three, seven, nine and 11.
Earlier, a local priest said all four were able to leave hospital on Saturday afternoon.
Reverend Donal Roche said: "They are physically going to be OK - obviously they are traumatised about what has happened and there is a lot of healing to be done but they have been discharged," he said.
