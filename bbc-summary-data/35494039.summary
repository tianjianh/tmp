Lee Wilson suffered a gaping wound to his head after Kyle Jenkins and Joseph Townhill forced their way into his home in Lincoln.
Lincoln Crown Court heard both men kicked and punched Mr Wilson and struck him with a Playstation console and the karaoke machine.
They were each handed a 20 month sentence.
The court heard the pair had gone to Mr Wilson's home in Ripon Street on 28 June to confront him for allegedly assaulting Jenkins' sister.
Gurdial Singh, prosecuting, said Mr Wilson was pushed into an armchair and set about by both.
"He describes being kicked and punched to the back, face and anywhere they could get to," he said.
Mr Wilson heard Jenkins swear and shout "you hit my sister".
Mr Singh added: "Jenkins used a PlayStation console to hit his head and back.
"Townhill picked up a karaoke machine with both hands and thrust it towards the right side of his forehead."
Mr Wilson eventually escaped and locked himself in the hall, but the disturbance woke his partner, their two children and one of their friends who was staying over.
He was later treated in hospital for a "gaping wound" caused by being struck by the karaoke machine.
Jenkins, 24, of Broughton Gardens, Lincoln, and Townhill, 23, of Renfrew Road, Lincoln, both admitted a charge of burglary.
David Eager, defending Jenkins, said he could start a new job on Monday and pay compensation to his victim.
Giles Beddloe, for Townhill, told the court he was also a hard working family man.
Sentencing the pair, Judge Simon Hirst said he accepted both men were unlikely to reoffend, but told them they had "acted as a team."
