West Ham win Cheikhou Kouyate appeal as one-match ban lifted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham have won their appeal against Cheikhou Kouyate's red card in their FA Cup fifth-round win at Blackburn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kouyate, 26, was sent off by referee Jonathan Moss for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity when bringing down Rovers defender Adam Henley during West Ham's 5-1 win at Ewood Park.
The decision and one-match ban was overturned by an independent FA regulatory commission.
The midfielder can now play against Sunderland on Saturday (12:45 GMT).
