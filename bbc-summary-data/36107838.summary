The 38-year-old Tongan has been one of Blues' star performers in 2015-16.
He joined the Blues from Bath in May 2006 and has since made a record 215 appearances and scored eight tries.
Filise made his Tonga debut against Fiji in 2001 and played for New Zealand' Bay of Plenty and Super Rugby side Chiefs before joining Bath in 2006.
He said: "I am delighted to sign a new contract at Cardiff Blues and was very happy when (coach) Danny Wilson approached me to talk about a new contract.
"I have loved the last decade here, this is my home and I'm excited about the strength of the squad we are building."
Wilson said: "He has been an outstanding servant to Cardiff Blues for more than a decade and is still playing some of the best rugby of his career."
