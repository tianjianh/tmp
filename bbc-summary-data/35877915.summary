Thousands of protesters have blockaded Australia's embassy in Dili calling for a new border in the oil-rich Timor Sea.

A treaty signed by Australia and East Timor in 2006 outlined the allotment of billions of dollar in revenue from oil and gas fields in the sea between the neighbours.
Dili says Canberra was spying during these negotiations giving Australia an unfair commercial advantage.
It wants the treaty torn up and a new  maritime border negotiated.
Claims were made before a tribunal in The Hague that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (Asis) used listening devices, planted in East Timor's cabinet office under the guise of refurbishment, to obtain information about a Timor Sea gas treaty in 2004.
More than 10,000 activists gathered in Dili on Tuesday with schools across the capital closed for the day, organisers say.
"This is possibly the biggest demonstration we've seen since we declared independence," protest coordinator Juvinal Dias told the AFP news agency.
Timorese supporters in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines are expected to stage protests in solidarity.
