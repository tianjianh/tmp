Alexander Enoch built his robot, called Marty, as a low-cost tool to inspire interest in programming and robotics while studying at Edinburgh University.
XpoNorth takes place on 7 and 8 June in Inverness and will bring together designers, writers and musicians.
The festival will include talks, workshops and performances.
XpoNorth is funded by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the European Regional Development Fund and is free to attend.
Mr Enoch and Marty will be a feature of the festival's Gaming and Technology Playground, which will also have video games played at 48-hour-long Moray Game Jam, which takes place in March in Elgin.
Speakers at XpoNorth will include Matteo Alessi of Italian design house Alessi and Halla HelgadÃ³ttir, managing director of the Iceland Design Centre.
Sarah Bridge, music supervisor in charge of the multi-Oscar-winning Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory of Everything, and commercials such as Nike NFL: Fast is Faster, is also to appear at the festival.
