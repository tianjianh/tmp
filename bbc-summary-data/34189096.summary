[SN]TITLE[SN]
Les Miserables actor Fra Fee back at St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He has acted alongside Hollywood A-listers like Russell Crowe and Eddie Redmayne and starred in several West End productions in London, but for one day only, actor Fra Fee is back where it all began.

Fra returned to his old school, St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone, where he first began to tread the boards in school productions, to teach the next generation of performers there.
I arrived to find him already hard at work in one of the school's mobile classrooms, playing the piano, while singing along with some of the cast of the school musical as they rehearse their parts.
That musical is Les Miserables, the West End production that put Fra in the big time.
After completing a music degree in Manchester, and postgraduate study in London, he appeared on stage in the musical Dirty Dancing, before being spotted playing Marius in the stage version of Les Miserables.
That led to his role as Courfeyrac, one of the revolutionary students, in the big screen musical version of Victor Hugo's tale of Paris in the early 19th century.
As well as Crowe and Redmayne, the cast also included Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway.
"It was a wonderful experience, but you're there to do a job," Fra said.
"They were out of their comfort zone too, because while they're movie actors and they do that extremely well, they don't sing regularly and musical theatre is a very different art form.
"So there was a lovely equilibrium between the majority of the cast who had come from London's musical theatre and these Hollywood A-listers."
So how does it feel to go from that world back to the classroom?
"I feel like I've regressed 10 years, but I have extremely fond memories of being here," he said.
"I really discovered my singing voice here, so it's really lovely to be back, particularly as the students are about to do Les Miserables.
"It's an opportunity for them to explore and take chances and figure out what works and what doesn't."
I watched as he then patiently coached the young cast through several of the show's big numbers, encouraging them to really get into character as they sang, and imagine a time and place far removed from a school lunchtime.
Many of them later admitted to a few nerves performing in front of a real expert, but said they were all eager to listen and learn.
Lucy Walton, 17, and who plays Madame Thernardier, said: "It's a wee bit nerve-wracking as you really want to impress him, but it's a really good opportunity. We've learned a lot."
Thirteen-year-old Jack Carberry is one of the youngest cast members, and watched the film to help him prepare for his role.
"It makes you feel really good knowing that Fra is here to see you perform," he said.
"He's been telling us how to stand, and how to act out our roles, as well as singing the role properly."
St Patrick's Academy's head of music Mairead Duffy was able to bring Fra in to help out, as she had guided him through his own burgeoning career as a pupil.
"He was in some shows we did here, and in the school choir, and he was an A-Level music student, so we've played a lot of music together and it was wonderful to accompany him on the early part of his journey," she said.
"From the word go, every musical opportunity he had, he grabbed it with both hands.
"It's not every day that you can phone up a past pupil and invite them back to give first hand experience of the roles they've played in the West End and the phenomenally successful movie with such huge stars.
"He brings all of that experience of stage and screen to our students."
Since the film was released in 2013, Fra has returned to the stage, appearing in a string of successful productions.
As I left, however, he seemed happy to be back for a day in his old school's assembly hall with the full cast of pupils.
Their production of Les Miserables runs from 14 - 18 October, and it may well be the first step in Fra's footsteps for some of the cast members.
