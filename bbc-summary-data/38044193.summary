Asisat Oshoala scored four goals as Nigeria began the defence of their women's Africa Cup of Nations title with a 6-0 drubbing of Mali in Limbe on Sunday.

The Player of the Tournament at the 2014 edition was in a class of her own as she terrorised the hapless Malian defence.
USA-based Francisca Ordega and Uchechi Sunday also scored as the Super Falcons sent out a chilling warning to their rivals.
The Group B game produced a slow start as both sides struggled to find their rhythm.
But the complexion of the match changed after 22 minutes when Ordega - the Washington Spirit midfielder - struck to give Nigeria the lead.
The Super Falcons grew in confidence after that and were in complete control for the rest of the game.
Poor defending contributed to the second goal as the Malians failed to clear their lines and the ball fell to Oshoala.
The Arsenal Ladies forward kept her cool and rounded the goalkeeper Goundo Samake before slotting the ball into an empty net.
Just after the break, the Nigerians were awarded a penalty following a foul on Osarenoma Igbinovia.
Sunday made no mistake from the spot and sent the goalkeeper the wrong way.
The game was effectively over as a contest.
Three more goals from Oshoala gave the Nigerians a dream start as they bid for an eighth African title.
Nigeria's next game is against regional rivals Ghana on Wednesday.
Black Queens make winning start
In Sunday's other game in the group Ghana beat Kenya 3-1.
It was Kenya who opened the scoring through Esse Akida in the 23rd minute when she found herself in space inside the area after a neat build up and made the most of her chance to beat the keeper.
But Ghana fought back and, after having an early goal ruled out for offside, they equalised on 50 minutes when Samira Suleman scored with a diving header.
The Black Queens then went ahead through a controversial penalty for handball - skipper Elizabeth Addo keeping cool to convert the spot-kick.
And Ghana sealed victory with their third goal when Portia Boakye glanced home a header from free-kick swung in from the left.
Next up for Ghana is Nigeria while the losers Kenya and Mali also meet on Wednesday in Limbe.
