Jamie Carragher football camp: GAA club to appeal fine for hosting event

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Gaelic games club in the Republic of Ireland is to appeal a fine for hosting a football camp attended by former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dromard, based in County Longford, was found to have breached a Gaelic Athletic Association (GA) rule banning any games apart from those it controls from being played on its property.
The GAA, Gaelic games' ruling body, imposed a 2,000 euro (Â£1,540) fine.
Dromard said it "decided to exercise their right to appeal" the ruling.
The children's football camp, run by the Jamie Carragher Soccer School, was held over three days at Dromard's PÃ¡irc na nGael ground in August last year.
It had been organised by the UCL Harps football club and Carragher, who was capped by England, made an appearance.
But the GAA's rule 5.1 says all property it owns or controls must only be used "for the purpose of, or in connection with, the playing of games controlled by the association".
The GAA's central hearings committee said Dromard admitted the breach of its rules.
But a spokesman added that because the disciplinary process was continuing there would be no further comment.
Dromard said on Twitter: "Following on from the statement released by the Central Hearings Committee, Dromard GAA have decided to exercise their right to appeal the sanction to the CAC.
"The club will be making no further comment on this matter."
The BBC has attempted to contact the Jamie Carragher Soccer School but has yet to receive a response.
