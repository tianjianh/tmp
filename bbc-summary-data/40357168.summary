Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych came through a tight contest against 18-year-old Canadian Denis Shapovalov.
Berdych, 31, earned his first break point of the match after two hours and 14 minutes, converting it to win 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (4-7) 7-5.
"It was a really great match," said Berdych, who was a beaten Wimbledon finalist in 2010.
"Denis put up some great tennis and made me work really hard."
Muller, ranked 26th, is through to the quarter-finals for the third straight year and is now on a six-match winning run on grass.
The 34-year-old, who won the s-Hertogenbosch title in the Netherlands last week, did not face a break point against Tsonga. He will play Australian Jordan Thompson, who beat Murray, or American Sam Querrey in the third round.
"My serve is working great. It's good at this time of the year on the grass - you need a good serve so I'm happy with that," said Muller.
Tsonga, runner-up at Queen's in 2011, said: "He just played good tennis. Sometimes you cannot do anything because the guy in front of you is playing well.

"It doesn't affect anything for me. Sometimes you play well; sometimes it's difficult. It's part of the game.
"I will stay here playing on grass and try to do better next week."
Dimitrov, 26, fought back to beat France's Julien Benneteau 4-6 6-3 6-4 as the temperature exceeded 30C for the third day in a row.
"I like the heat a lot," said Dimitrov, the 2014 champion. "I love it. The warmer it is, the better it is - I don't shy away from that."
