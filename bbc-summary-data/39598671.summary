Dylan Crawford, aged 20, from Dromore in Killygordon, was found at Spear Street in the city's northern quarter, shortly before 01:40 BST on Wednesday.
Detectives have arrested two men on suspicion of theft and supplying drugs.
A post-mortem examination has proved inconclusive.  In a statement, Mr Crawford's family said they are "devastated" by their loss.
"Our Dylan was a loving, kind and a very trustworthy individual. He saw the good in everyone and that was his downfall," the statement said.
"He loved to travel and would give the world to anyone. He was the heart of our family and words can't describe how devastated we are."
Greater Manchester Police said they are trying to determine the circumstances surrounding Mr Crawford's death.
They also are trying to trace another man in connection with the investigation.
"Our investigation into Dylan's death continues and we have now released an image of a man we want to speak to. If you recognise him or the clothes he is wearing, please get in touch," said Det Insp Rebecca Boyce said.
"We are also looking for anyone who was around the Spear Street, Back Piccadilly Street and Oldham Street area between 11.30pm on Tuesday and 12.30am on Wednesday to come forward.
"Even at this time of night, the area would be fairly busy so it is possible that somebody may have seen something. No piece of information is too small," she added.
