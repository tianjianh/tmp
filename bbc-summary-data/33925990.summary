Islip villagers call for 20mph speed limit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners are calling for a 20mph (32km/h) speed limit through an Oxfordshire village which they say is being used as a rat-run by motorists.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some Islip residents say problems have been made worse since a major overhaul of the A40's Cutteslowe and Wolvercote roundabouts began last month.
Islip Traffic Group described the situation as "dangerous".
The county council said it would support the move, but said it was unable to provide funding.
As well as a reduction to the current 30mph (48km/h) speed limit, campaigners want temporary traffic lights on the River Ray bridge during the A40 works.
Dennis Price, from Islip Traffic Group, said there had been a "very noticeable" increase in traffic though the village, with people finding it difficult to cross the bridge and the B4027.
Oxfordshire County Council said it had "fully engaged" with the parish council and understood its views.
It said it had "not reached a conclusion" on providing temporary signals on the bridge, but said traffic flows were likely to change in September.
"The council needs to be confident that any expenditure in these areas will bring about the desired results."
