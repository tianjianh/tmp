Scunthorpe came closest in a quiet first half, as Paddy Madden's close-range header crashed off the bar.
Daniel Lafferty put Oldham in front when he fired low into the far corner from Carl Winchester's pass.
Kyle Wootton came to the rescue for Scunthorpe, steering his shot in from a tight angle past Joel Coleman just two minutes from full-time.
Scunthorpe have now picked up 13 points from their last six games, while Oldham are one point from safety in 22nd.
Scunthorpe United manager Nick Daws told BBC Radio Humberside:

"I thought the end result didn't reflect the number of chances we created. It probably reflected the fact we didn't take those chances.
"To go 1-0 down when you're expected to win the game, and feeling like you should win the game, and then come back into the game and the three substitutes are all involved in the goal is great.
"For Kyle Wooten to come on and score is fantastic. He deserves it because he's worked really hard."
Oldham Athletic manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I think if I'm being honest Scunthorpe deserved something out of the game with their performance.
"It's a crying shame because we were so close to winning the game.
"To get so close, it feels like you've lost the game."
