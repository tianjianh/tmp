The match against Italians - who finished 10th in Serie A - is to take place at the Aviva Stadium on 2 August.
Jose Mourinho's side play Ajax of the Netherlands in the Europa League final on Wednesday, having finished sixth in the Premier League.
Victory in Stockholm would see United secure a place in next season's Champions League.
United will come to Ireland after a five-match tour in the United States, and 10 days before the start of the Premier League season.
They last played in Dublin in 2010.
Former Republic of Ireland star Liam Brady, who played for Sampdoria from 1982 to 1984, predicted a capacity crowd at the 51,000-seater stadium.
"This will be a full house. It is going to be great for Sampdoria to come here," he said.
"There is a lot of history to Sampdoria - they are one of Italy's favourite teams."
