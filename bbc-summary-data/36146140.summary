Syrian refugees: 14 families and 20 children to arrive in NI

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifty-seven Syrian refugees, including 14 families and 20 children, are due to arrive in Northern Ireland on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One family will be housed in Belfast, while the remaining families will be housed in Londonderry.
When they arrive, the families will spend their first few days in a special welcome centre in Belfast to help them adapt to their new surroundings.
This is the second group of Syrian refugees to be given shelter in Northern Ireland.
Those arriving on Thursday range in age from two years old to late 50s, and several of the adults are believed to have university-level education.
The UK is due to accept 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years as part of the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme.
Stormont's Department of Social Development (DSD) and the Red Cross have said that the reaction to the arrival of refugees in Derry has been wholly positive and that many people have volunteered to help.
The DSD has direct responsibility for overseeing the operation of bringing the refugees into Northern Ireland.
The refugees are expected to live in Northern Ireland for five years, after which time they can choose whether to go back to Syria or apply for UK citizenship as long as they do not have a criminal record.
The families will be able to move freely across the UK, but will not be able to travel to the Republic of Ireland as laws regarding refugees in both jurisdictions are different.
Failure to adhere to this regulation could result in a criminal record.
