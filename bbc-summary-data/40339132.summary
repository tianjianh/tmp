[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lyme Regis Regent Cinema fire insurance claim agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "large and complex" insurance claim for a 1930s Art Deco cinema that was wrecked by fire has been concluded, its owners have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Regent Cinema in Lyme Regis, Dorset, was engulfed by the blaze which caused the roof to collapse in March 2016.
Scott Cinemas said it had concluded its dealings with the insurer after more than a year but it had been a "much longer process than hoped".
It said architects and surveyors were now working on the rebuilding plans.
The Grade II listed building was extensively damaged in the fire which began following an electrical fault.
The auditorium was gutted, although the Art Deco frontage and the foyer were left largely intact.
Lyme town councillor Jeff Scowen said: "It's been sorely missed by the community and visitors. It's a beautiful iconic structure and it seems it's taken forever.
"Finally things are moving and it can't be a day too soon."
Scott Cinemas previously vowed to rebuild the cinema and said it hoped to begin work by the end of the year.
