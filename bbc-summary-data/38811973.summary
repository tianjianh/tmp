The 19-year-old spent last season on loan at Griffin Park from Liverpool, and scored seven goals in 39 appearances for the Bees.
Canos joined Norwich in July 2016, but has only made three league appearances for the Canaries this season.
The Spain Under-19 international has signed until 2021, with a year's option in the club's favour.
"Sergi, is a player and character that fits naturally into our dressing room," said Brentford boss Dean Smith.
"After working with him last season, you can see what he brings to the group, and an infectious attitude to match."
Meanwhile, Slovenian striker Jan Novak has joined Brentford's B team on an 18-month deal.
