The large gender imbalance among crash casualties has been revealed by the investigative news website, The Detail.
It analysed statistics it obtained from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, under the Freedom of Information Act.
The figures also showed that the police area with the highest crash death toll in 2013-14 was County Fermanagh.
Sixteen people were killed on Fermanagh's roads over the last two years.
The second highest death toll was recorded in Newry and Mourne PSNI area, where there were 12 deaths.
The highest number of crashes took place in the PSNI's Lisburn district, where there were 100 collisions and 99 people seriously injured on the roads.
The Lisburn crash rate was five times higher that area with the lowest number of reported collisions, Cookstown, County Tyrone, where there were 20 collisions.
In a detailed breakdown of the statistics, the website found out that of the 136 people who were killed on the roads over the two-year period, 106 were male and 30 were female.
There was also a significant gender imbalance in the injury statistics, with 938 males being seriously injured compared to 492 female casualties.
The figures showed alcohol and speed were the biggest cause of crashes.
