Zhang Shupeng jumped from a helicopter 2,000 meters above the ground, before opening his wingsuit to fly along the 50-meter-long bridge.
He zigzagged to swoop over the bridge for about 30 seconds before opening his parachute to land safely.
The wingsuit has fabric under the arms and between the legs so that the flier glides through the air, as if he has wings.
