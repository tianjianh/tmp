County Championship: Sam Curran takes six wickets as Durham build 247-run lead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey paceman Sam Curran's career-best 6-51 limited Durham to a 247-run lead, setting up the chance of a final-day run chase at Chester-le-Street.

Resuming on 299-7, Stuart Meaker's unbeaten 35 helped Surrey post 367, a first-innings deficit of 34.
Surrey-bound opener Mark Stoneman then hit 92, but only four other Durham batsmen made double figures as Curran took three wickets in four balls.
Graham Clark was the best of the rest with 54 as Durham closed on 213-8.
Having played under lights all day, mist began to move in with 22 overs remaining, forcing umpires Neil Mallender and David Millns to take the players off - before then abandoning play for the day shortly after.
Stoneman and the also Surrey-bound Scott Borthwick both began the day within range of 1,000 runs for the season for the fourth year in a row.
Stoneman got to the milestone in a sixth-wicket stand of 109 with Clark, who improved on his career-best score.
But Borthwick failed, his dismissal for 12 leaving him on 957, sparking the collapse in which Durham lost four wickets to 18-year-old Curran in seven deliveries.
Former England paceman Graham Onions had earlier completed the 25th five-wicket haul in first-class cricket in the morning session, his first this season.
Victory for Durham would ensure survival, while a draw would leave them 19 points ahead of eighth-placed Hampshire, who they meet next week in the final game at Southampton.
Saturday's One-Day Cup finalists Surrey, playing their final Championship match of the summer, are now guaranteed to finish fourth regardless of the outcome.
