Hall, 29, enjoyed including three top ten finishes on the 2016 Ladies European Tour after spending most of 2015 out with a knee injury.
"I know deep down that my game is strong enough to be in that team." the Southerndown-based golfer said.
"It's just getting the results under my belt early on in the year to secure a place on the team."
This 2017 Solheim Cup will be hosted at Des Moines Golf and Country Club in Iowa USA between 14 and 20 August.
The Solheim Cup, the female version of the Ryder Cup, is a biennial tournament contested by teams of 12 players representing Europe and the United States.
The last Welsh golfer to make the team was Becky Brewerton back in 2009.
"I'm 14th in the rankings, but things can move around quite rapidly," Hall added.
"If I can get off to a good start in the early part of the season and maybe perform well in the British Open, you never know."
Hall was speaking at the Golf Union of Wales awards at the Celtic Manor where she was named Welsh Tour Player of the Year.
As well as her performances on the Tour, she also became the first female to win the Welsh National PGA Championship.
