The 42-year-old race leader reached the South African coast in 17 days, 22 hours and 58 minutes on Thursday as he broke the record by over five days.
Thomson also set a record-breaking time from the equator to the Cape of Good Hope in a time of eight days, 15 hours and 56 minutes.
Averaging 20 knots since setting off, he has led the fleet since 12 November.
With 18 days passed since the race began, the skippers still have to reach Cape Leewin and Cape Horn before turning north and sailing through the Atlantic on the way to the finsih line in Les Sables d'Olonne.
Gosport-based Thomson says he is "going strong" in the journey, as he aims to be the first British skipper to win the solo non-stop round-the-world race.
The Vendee Globe is renowned for being one of the most gruelling sporting challenges, with only 71 of 138 sailors to date have finished since the first race in 1989.
