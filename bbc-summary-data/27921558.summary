Paralysed jockey JT McNamara has returned home to Ireland after being discharged from a specialist spinal injuries unit in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McNamara, 37, fractured two vertebrae when his horse fell in a race at the Cheltenham Festival on 14 March, 2013.
McNamara underwent rehabilitation at the North West Regional Spinal Injuries Centre in Southport, Merseyside.
"JT and [McNamara's wife] Caroline wish to thank the doctors, nurses and all the staff," a family statement read.
The amateur jockey injured the C3 and C4 vertebrae in his neck after being thrown from his horse Galaxy Rock, in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup.
He had surgery in Bristol and was taken to the National Spinal Unit at Mater Hospital in Dublin, before continuing his rehabilitation in Southport.
McNamara's family also praised Irish racing's regulatory body, the Turf Club, and those who supported the Limerick jockey in his rehabilitation.
"We are truly thankful to all the visitors who came to see JT while he was in hospital, for all the cards, well wishes and the continued support from everybody," the family statement continued.
"It has been so overwhelming and again a sincere thank you to all from the both of us."
