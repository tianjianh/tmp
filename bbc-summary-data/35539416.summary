Shoppers 'fail to spot cheapest deals'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most grocery shoppers are unable to identify the cheapest deals when faced with a blizzard of "special offers" in stores, financial experts say.

The Money Advice Service asked just over 2,000 consumers to select the best value deals from four sets of offers.
Only 2% of those asked answered all four questions correctly.
In the survey, 76% of those asked said they spent more than they intended, after being enticed by special offers, paying an average £11 extra per shop.
Later on Thursday, Sainsbury's announced that it would phase out multi-buy promotions by August 2016.
It said that because people were shopping more frequently, it would replace multi-buy offers with lower regular prices that allowed customers to buy in the quantities they wanted.
Sainsbury's Marketing Director, Sarah Warby said customers had told them they found multi-buy promotions "confusing" and created "logistical challenges at home in terms of storage and waste."
The government-backed Money Advice Service said shoppers should look at the price per unit to compare costs. It also suggested making, and sticking to a shopping list.
John Penberthy-Smith, customer director for the Money Advice Service, said: "The problem is that quite often we see a special offer at the supermarket and we don't want to miss out - so we throw it into our trolley without really thinking about whether it is a good deal or whether we actually need it. Often deals can be difficult to understand and compare with other prices."
Competition authorities have previously accused stores of misleading tactics.
In July, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had found evidence during a three-month investigation that supermarkets were misleading customers with confusing pricing promotions.
The investigation came after a complaint by the consumer group Which?, but the supermarket industry said the vast majority of offers represented a good deal for customers.
