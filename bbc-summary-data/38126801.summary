The Imps, who have not lost since 24 September, took the lead through Theo Robinson's close-range header.
Terry Hawkridge slotted in the second shortly after, and Robinson chipped in to make it 3-0 after the break.
Peter Clarke and Billy McKay scored to give Oldham hope, but they could not find a late equaliser.
Cameron Burgess came closest to levelling the scores, planting a free header wide of the target.
Lincoln, who are second in the National League, will now face a trip to Championship side Ipswich in the third round, which takes place on 6-9 January 2017.
They last made it to the last 64 in the 2009-10 season, losing 4-0 to Bolton, then of the Premier League.
Two-goal hero Robinson, released by Port Vale at the end of last season, had been a free agent until 8 October, when Lincoln boss Danny Cowley signed him on a short-term contract.
Oldham, who are 23rd in League One, have now failed to win in five matches in all competitions.

Lincoln manager Danny Cowley paid tribute to the club's fans after the game, saying the 7,012 supporters in the ground "carried" his side to the win after conceding two quick goals.
"For us to have over 7,000, it's beyond all of our wildest expectations," he told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.
"I think credit goes to the players, because they've got people in the city believing again
"We said it in the dressing room that they might have League One players, but we've got Premier League people.
"We've got proper people, proper characters and they dug in when it really mattered."
