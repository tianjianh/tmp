The approach to Cardiff City Stadium will be called Ffordd Fred Keenor - after the cup-winning captain.
The road sign was unveiled at 1400 GMT on Saturday by Cardiff council's deputy leader.
Also attending will by Fred Keenor's nephew Graham, and ex-Bluebird favourites Nathan Blake and Phil Dwyer.
"I'm very excited about the naming of this road after Fred," said nephew Graham Keenor.
"It's wonderful to finally have recognition for my uncle and his family. It's also really great for all Cardiff City fans.
"I regularly keep in contact with Fred's only surviving son, Bryn, who is 83 and lives in Tunbridge Wells, about developments here regarding commemorating his father.
"It's absolutely tremendous for him and he is very grateful."
Cardiff-born Keenor famously led Cardiff City to glory and lifted the FA Cup at Wembley Stadium in 1927 after the Bluebirds beat Arsenal 1-0 to become the only team outside of England to win the coveted trophy.
The unveiling of the new sign on the approach to the stadium near Leckwith Road takes place ahead of Cardiff's Championship clash with Preston.
The council's deputy leader, Neil McEvoy, added: "I am a massive Cardiff City fan so for me, personally, it is a great honour to be involved in a project that honours one of the greatest players in the club's history and indeed, someone who has played a huge part in Cardiff's history as a city.
"It's amazing that it has taken 83 years for his contribution to be recognised.
"I'm delighted that we do now have a lasting tribute to this Cardiff hero and I'm really looking forward to the day in the not-too-distant future when a statue in his honour is erected in the city."
The council has already pledged Â£15,000 towards the statue of Keenor, which is being designed by artist Roger Andrews and will stand by the stadium.
