Fifa crisis: What you need to know

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sepp Blatter's shock resignation as president of football's world governing body caps a torrid week for the organisation. Here are key questions from the crisis answered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Short answer: Mr Blatter said a lack of "mandate" from the football world drove the decision, but reports have since emerged that say he is being investigated by US officials as part of a corruption inquiry.
Longer answer: Few saw the resignation coming. It was only on Friday that Mr Blatter was re-elected as Fifa president, pledging in a rambling victory speech to "take the responsibility to bring back Fifa where it should be".
But just four days later he announced his resignation, explaining "I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football - the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe and love football", and called for "profound restructuring" at the organisation.
The rapid turnaround led many to wonder if he had another motive. He has been Fifa chief since 1998 and comfortably won re-election, bolstered by support from the Asian and African football confederations.
Since his resignation, American media have reported that Mr Blatter is now a focus of a US corruption investigation.
But his daughter told a Swiss newspaper her father's decision had "absolutely nothing" to do with the allegations.
Short answer: Senior Fifa officials were arrested as part of a US corruption investigation; hours later the Swiss authorities announced they would examine Russia and Qatar's successful bids to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Longer answer: The drama began last Wednesday with the early morning arrests of seven senior football officials at a luxury hotel in Zurich, Switzerland, who were among 14 people indicted in the US on corruption charges.
US prosecutors allege the 14 - including two vice-presidents - presided over a "World Cup of fraud", accepting bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than $150m (Â£97m) over a 24-year period.
They outlined a dozen schemes, including one allegedly relating to the successful 2010 World Cup bid by South Africa.
The Swiss authorities separately announced they would investigate the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively.
The allegations prompted strong criticism and demands for change from leading football figures and major Fifa sponsors, overshadowing Mr Blatter's re-election.
Officials quoted in US media say they hope to gain the co-operation of some of those indicted to build a case against Mr Blatter.
Short answer: Other senior Fifa figures have been accused of corruption in the past, while the body was accused of a whitewash in its summary of an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Longer answer: Fifa has long been tainted by corruption allegations. Mr Blatter's predecessor, and mentor, Joao Havelenge, resigned as Fifa's honorary president in 2013 after a report ruled he had taken bribes.
The US indictments put the spotlight on other former Fifa executives, such as Jack Warner, who after his resignation as vice-president in 2011, also over bribery allegations, said he had been "hung out to dry" and that the giving of gifts was part of Fifa culture.
Russia and Qatar's successful bids to host the World Cup were dogged by claims of bribery and voting collusion, something denied by both countries.
Fifa investigated the allegations but never released the full results.
A summary clearing both countries of wrongdoing was described by Michael Garcia, the US attorney who wrote the full report, as inaccurate.
Short answer: Mr Blatter remains in charge in the short-term, with Uefa boss Michel Platini early favourite to take over.
Longer answer: Mr Blatter has said his resignation frees him to focus on reform during his remaining time as president.
He has said he will stay on until his successor is appointed at a special congress, pencilled in as taking place between December this year and March in the next.
Fifa is now facing life without its long-term boss. European football chief Michel Platini is early favourite to succeed him.
Other candidates include Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, who lost to Mr Blatter in last week's election, billionaire South Korean businessman Chung Mong-joon, the chairman of Fifa's audit and compliance committee Domenico Scala, and some of world football's most famous names - including Portugal's Luis Figo, Brazil's Zico and even Argentine legend Diego Maradona.
Russia and Qatar may have reasons to be nervous, especially if Mr Garcia's full report is released. But it may simply be too late to reallocate the 2018 World Cup, and Qatar can be expected to fight hard against any attempt to strip them of the tournament, including in the courts if necessary.
There may also be more to come from the twin investigations, with US Attorney General Loretta Lynch promising that the indictments were "only the beginning".
Short answer: Fifa presides over a lucrative, hugely popular international game. Rights groups have been alarmed by Qatar's hosting of the World Cup.
Longer answer: Many feel the scandal is now about much more than football.
Firstly, there are the vast amounts of money involved. Brazil spent more than $4bn hosting last year's World Cup, netting Fifa more than Â£2bn in profit.
Second, doubts over Qatar's hosting of the World Cup have been sharpened by allegations of mistreatment of migrant workers.
A recent Washington Post blog estimated that 4,000 workers were likely to die on World Cup construction sites, a claim Doha angrily disputed as having "no basis in fact".
Finally, there is simply the feeling that football fans' sense of fairness has been rattled by the very people entrusted in running the game.
In between the arrests, and Mr Blatter's resignation, Barcelona's Lionel Messi scored a stunning individual goal, while Arsenal had an eye-catching win in the English FA Cup, football's oldest association tournament.
From the fans to Fifa, all may be keen for the attention to return to what Mr Blatter called "the game we all love".
