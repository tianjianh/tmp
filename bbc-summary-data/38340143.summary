India v England: Joe Root says he needs to grow up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England batsman Joe Root says he needs to "grow up a bit" after reacting angrily to being given out on day one of the fifth Test against India.

Root was adjudged caught behind on review after playing a sweep shot against spinner Ravindra Jadeja.
He was seen talking to himself as he departed and aimed a kick at the boundary rope on his way off the field.
"There was frustration there," said Root. "If I get punished then I'm sure it's deserved."
The original decision of not-out was overturned when third umpire Bruce Oxenford decided that a sound picked up by the on-field microphone as the ball passed the bat was an edge to wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel.
"I was adamant I didn't hit it but there was a spike of sound on the replay and there is no point moaning about it," he added.
England, 3-0 down in the five-match series, reached 284-4 in Chennai, with Moeen Ali making 120 not out and Root 88.
"We want to start well on the second day and maybe even bat through the day," Root told BBC Sport. "We want to apply pressure where we can, put India's bowlers off their lengths when we can and be ruthless in our defence.
"If we can get all of those together, maybe we can post 500."
Root has made a half-century in each of the 11 Tests he has played against India, but has only converted one of his last seven fifties against all opponents into a hundred.
"It's frustrating to make scores of 70 and 80, then not kick-on. It does wind you up," said the Yorkshire right-hander.
"If I start thinking too much about it, it might detract from my natural game, but big hundreds are what win Tests so that is what I'll be striving for in the new year."
Vice-captain Root also became the latest member of the England set-up to offer support to skipper Alastair Cook.
Cook has admitted to having "questions" over his future as leader, while also saying he feels that Root is ready to take over.
"He has been a fantastic captain," Root told Sky Sports. "Hopefully he does stay in the job, he's a great leader who can take us forward.
"I just want to play cricket and things will take care of themselves."
Cook, who has been publically backed by coach Trevor Bayliss and all-rounder Ben Stokes, will meet with England director of cricket Andrew Strauss to discuss his future in January.
