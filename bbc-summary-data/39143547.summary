Six Nations 2017: Wales players must 'raise game' to make Lions - Robin McBryde

Wales' players will have to raise their game to maintain their hopes of touring with the British and Irish Lions this summer, says forwards coach Robin McBryde.

The former Wales hooker said the squad had been through a "painful" debrief after the 29-13 loss to Scotland.
He expects the team to improve for the matches against Ireland and France.
"There is a Lions tour and I'm sure that will be at the back of the minds of the players," he said.
Speaking in Welsh, McBryde added: "If there is to be any chance of them going on that tour they have to raise their game."
A defeat against either France or Ireland would consign Wales to their least successful Six Nations tournament since 2010.
Two losses would see them drop out of the top eight in World Rugby's rankings and face the possibility of a tough draw for the 2019 World Cup in Japan.
Seven of the Wales starting XV against Scotland were on the 2013 Lions tour under Warren Gatland.
The New Zealander is due to announce his Lions squad on 19 April and spent Wednesday with the Wales players as part of his rounds of the four home nations.
Gatland has been given a year off from his role as Wales coach to lead the Lions, and McBryde said he had offered almost unbiased feedback on the Murrayfield defeat.
"It is good to catch up with Warren," McBryde added.
"I would not say he is completely neutral, but someone who hasn't spent that much time in camp, it is good to hear his thoughts on the game and good for us to have another set of eyes and just being able to discuss things.
"It is also a gentle reminder to the players that there are Lions eyes upon them as well."
McBryde conceded that Wales were in a difficult position after two consecutive defeats in the Six Nations, and had faced tough analysis after losing to Scotland for the first time since 2007.
"It's been pretty painful really for all of us, coaches and players," he said.
"It's obviously something that hasn't happened for a while, losing two games on the bounce in the Six Nations.
"But there was a fair amount of honesty, people putting their hand up and being accountable for their errors.
"It is painful but until we get a level of performance and a victory - hopefully in the next match - that pain is going to be there."
