The 15-year-old, from Castlederg in County Tyrone, disappeared after a school disco in 1994.
Over the last two days searches took place near Killen, outside Castlederg after a farmer found disturbed earth that he said looked like a grave.
A police spokesman said "the Arkinson family have been updated".
The search had been concentrated on a derelict farmyard close to where the teenager was last seen alive.
That evening she was seen in a car with the convicted child killer and rapist Robert Howard, the main suspect in her disappearance.
Howard, who died in prison in England last year, was found not guilty in 2005 of murdering Arlene.
The jury was not told that Howard, who was originally from County Laois, had a history of sexual violence and was already serving a life term for rape and murder.
Arlene has been missing, presumed dead, for 22 years.
A number of searches have been carried out at various locations, but her body has never been found.
The farmer, who rents the land where the search is ongoing, said he noticed clay had been dug up and refilled with stones.
"It's about six feet long and about three-to-four feet wide with stones," Noel Doherty said on Friday.
The police cordoned off the area on Wednesday and brought in specialist teams to examine the site.
Searches took place on Friday and Saturday morning but were called off on Saturday afternoon.
