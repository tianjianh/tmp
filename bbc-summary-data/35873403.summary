Arnold motorcyclist admits killing cyclist in Nottingham crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A motorcyclist has pleaded guilty to causing the death of a former road safety worker who was killed in a crash on a busy Nottingham road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sally Shalloe, 51, of Attenborough, Nottinghamshire, died when her bicycle was hit by David Staley's motorbike in Middleton Boulevard in April last year.
At Nottingham Crown Court, Staley, 32, admitted causing Ms Shalloe's death by dangerous driving.
Staley, of Arnold, Nottingham, is due to be sentenced on 13 May.
Ms Shalloe worked as a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, and husband Jim Hill said his wife previously produced studies on road safety.
"She was cycling to work that morning," said Mr Hill, who had been married to Ms Shalloe for 16 years.
"I had a policewoman walk into my work office and tell me she'd been killed. It was like being split in two with an axe.
"It's turned my life upside down completely. I've got a constant feeling of loss."
Staley was disqualified from the roads before being bailed ahead of his sentencing.
