Aberdeen engineer Sean Sangerman, 25, caught the incident on his dash cam on the B9119 near Garlogie on Monday morning.
It showed the oncoming vehicle - believed to be a dark blue Nissan Qashqai - with only a small circle of snow cleared from the windscreen.
Police Scotland has been made aware of the footage.
Mr Sangerman said: "I have no idea what would cause someone to put themselves and other road users at risk in such a dangerous and reckless manner.
"What they are doing is outrageously silly and dangerous - there is no way that they are able to see the road properly through a gap of that size.
"They would have been driving almost blindly in conditions that were quite treacherous - snow, ice, slippy roads and so on."
The number plate could not be made out in the footage.
The Highway Code states that before motorists set off they must be able to see, so all snow and ice must be cleared from windows.
