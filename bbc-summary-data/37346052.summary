Granit Xhaka's stunning 30-yard strike gave the Gunners the lead.
Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner shot wide for Forest before Lucas doubled Arsenal's lead from the penalty spot after Chuba Akpom was fouled.
Lucas then rounded the goalkeeper for his second before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain drove in a late fourth.
The Spanish forward, who joined from Deportivo La Coruna in August, impressed with his pace and strength throughout, with both qualities particularly evident for the second goal.
He chased a ball down the left, brushed off Forest defender Michael Mancienne before bursting past goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic and then poking home.
Bendtner, meanwhile, was making his first appearance against his old club, where he spent nine years at between 2005 and 2014.
Nottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier: "Like the team, Niklas Bendtner started very well at the beginning and then after it was very difficult for him because Arsenal had the ball and he did not have a lot of opportunity to play.
"But physically I am surprised he is so fit because he had not a big pre-season with Copenhagen.
"It was a good experience not only for Nicklas but for all the players because Arsenal have great technique, better than us, and it was difficult for us but my players, they gave everything."
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said: "Lucas did well. He's quick, he's determined. He uses well his left foot - a bit too much in my taste. He doesn't use his right enough. Overall he's like all the left-footed players, you know.
"But I like his second goal because he has shown not only technique but determination and fight for the ball and finishing and I like that. The part he played in the goal of Oxlade-Chamberlain shows his awareness of other people and it is intelligent play.
"But the most important thing for me is that we win the game. Who scores is not so important but for the player individually it's good because he can convince people he can play for us. It will help himself as well to grow in belief."
