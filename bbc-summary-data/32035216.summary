Action has been taken to prevent an all-night house party in Leeds that was promoted on Facebook.

Police said around 350 people had been expected at the event on Richmond Avenue, Headingley, on Friday 27 and Saturday 28 March.
A closure notice was applied for, using anti-social behaviour legislation, due to concerns about drug use, anti-social behaviour and disruption.
It means only tenants at the property can enter it for 24 hours from Friday.
The party had been advertised on social-media as featuring "resident DJs" and guests were invited to bring "a bag o'chems", which police believe referred to drugs.
Supt Sam Millar said: "The open references to the planned consumption of drugs was a real cause for concern.
"As soon as the event was brought to our attention, we took swift action to put legal measures in place to stop it going ahead and to provide the basis for further legal action if the conditions were ignored."
Letters from Leeds City Council's licensing department have been hand delivered to the tenants.
The closure notice, served on the house, runs for 24 hours from 10:00 GMT on Friday and makes it an offence for anyone other than the tenants to enter the property.
