[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old will be back up to race drivers Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen but will not necessarily drive if one of them is injured.
Giovinazzi, runner-up in the GP2 feeder series in 2016, will start work in the simulator in January and will do some track running during the year.
President Sergio Marchionne said: "We took him because he is a great driver. I'm pleased also that he's an Italian."
Ferrari will run their new car for the first time at their Fiorano test track on 24 February - three days before the start of pre-season testing in Barcelona.
