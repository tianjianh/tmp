Emily Cherry, of the NSPCC, said YouTubers had a "responsibility" to make sure relationships with young fans were appropriate.
In total, 14 separate allegations were made against vlogger Alex Day who, at the height of his fame, had over one million subscribers to his channel. He was never charged.
He told BBC Radio 5 live he had ???never considered??? that making videos in his bedroom could put him in a position of power.
