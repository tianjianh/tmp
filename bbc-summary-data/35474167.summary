'Gay cake' case: Ashers bakery appeal adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal by a Christian-run bakery at the centre of a discrimination case over a so-called 'gay cake' has been adjourned for three months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It followed an intervention by Northern Ireland's Attorney General.
Last year, Ashers bakery was ordered to pay £500 for refusing to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan on it.
A Belfast court found that customer Gareth Lee had been discriminated against on the grounds of his sexual orientation.
He was backed in the case by the NI Equality Commission.
The commission paid almost £39,000 in legal fees.
However, the McArthur family who run Ashers, said they had decided "after much careful and prayerful consideration" to appeal.
Following a short hearing on Wednesday, the case has been rescheduled for 9 May.
Speaking shortly after the court ruling last May, the McArthurs said: "We continue to insist that we have done nothing wrong as we have discriminated against no individual, but rather acted according to what the Bible teaches regarding marriage."
The  judge had ruled that, as a business, Ashers was not exempt from discrimination law.
The firm was found to have discriminated against Mr Lee on the grounds of sexual orientation as well as his political beliefs.
At the time, the judge said she accepted that Ashers had "genuine and deeply held" religious views, but said the business was not above the law.
