He follows Iggy Pop, Charlotte Church and Billy Bragg, who have used the lecture to give their verdicts on the music industry in previous years.
Eno's speech will be broadcast on BBC 6 Music and BBC Four.
Eno made his name in Roxy Music before going solo and producing acts including Talking Heads, U2 and Coldplay.
The lecture is named after the influential BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who died in 2004.
Eno said Peel "had a profound effect on my musical life and indeed my becoming a musician at all".
He added: "His career as a non-musician who altered the course of music has been an inspiration to me and forms the basis of this talk."
A statement from the BBC said Eno would "examine the ecology of culture" and "show how cultural processes confer essential and important benefits on society".
The lecture will take place during the Radio Academy's Radio Festival at the British Library on 27 September.
