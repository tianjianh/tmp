Jury inquest over teen's death at private Powys school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jury inquest into the death of a 15-year-old boy at a privately-run school in Powys will focus on his care plans, staff training and the suitability of the school, a hearing has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Jordan Kane Woonton, from Nottinghamshire, was found at the residential Pentwyn School at Clyro near Hay-on-Wye in June 2012.
The school was closed in December 2012 by Hampshire-based owners, Hillcrest.
The Cardiff hearing was told that next autumn's inquest will last two weeks.
The school cared for boys with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties and accepted children from across the UK.
Hillcrest was fined Â£2,400 in 2014 after being prosecuted by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales in relation to the teenager's death.
The company admitted employing insufficient experienced staff and not checking their fitness to work there.
Assistant Coroner for Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan Chris Woolley said he had agreed to hold the inquest in front of a jury after considering the "youth and vulnerability" of Jordan Woonton, and the fact that the conditions in which Jordan were held were akin to secure accommodation.
He said the teenager's family had a "reasonable expectation a jury will be called" and that their expectation should "not be disturbed without good reason".
The inquest is expected to take place from September onwards next year, said Mr Wooley.
