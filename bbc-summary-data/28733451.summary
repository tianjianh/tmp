West Bromwich Albion captain Chris Brunt has signed a new three-year contract at The Hawthorns.

The 29-year-old midfielder, who joined the Baggies from Sheffield Wednesday in 2007, is one game away from making his 250th appearance for the club.
A 12-month option on his previous deal was activated earlier this summer.
"Chris is an influential figure both on and off the pitch," said manager Alan Irvine. "He has the respect of all the players and staff."
The Northern Ireland international has recently returned to fitness following a groin operation during pre-season.
Since finishing last season one place above the Premier League relegation zone, West Brom have appointed Irvine after parting company with predecessor Pepe Mel.
They paid Dynamo Kiev a club-record fee of about Â£10m for Nigeria striker Brown Ideye, and extended England goalkeeper Ben Foster's contract by another four years.
