Hostel plan provokes angry reaction from Nottingham parents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of objections have been made against plans for a hostel for young people with homelessness and mental health issues near a primary school.

Nottingham-based charity Framework wants to convert two empty houses on Trent Boulevard in the Lady Bay area.
But opponents claim it is too close to a school and believe their children could be exposed to drugs and alcohol.
Brenda Baxter who lives nearby accused objectors of "discriminatory attitudes".
So far almost 270 objections have been made to the proposals which were submitted to Rushcliffe Borough Council last month.
One of them, Morris Enderby, said it was "completely the wrong location" and he objected to "ex-drug addicts and people with alcohol issues" congregating in the area.
Ms Baxter, who has previously worked with children, said the hostel would help young people turn their lives around.
"There's kids already living here that have mental health and drug problems," she said. "Everyone is entitled to a chance."
The charity's chief executive, Andrew Redfern, said they aimed to house young people close to transport links, shops and schools.
"There's no inevitability these young people have drug or alcohol problems, no more than anyone else living in Lady Bay," said Mr Redfern.
"As a community we have to decide whether we are going to shut them away without support or involve them in the neighbourhood and support them to play their part in it."
A final decision on the plans will be made by the council in December.
