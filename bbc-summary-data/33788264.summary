Leicestershire police 'ignore' attempted burglaries at odd-numbered houses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Attempted break-ins at odd-numbered houses were not fully investigated by one police force as part of an experiment to save money.

Leicestershire Police said the pilot scheme had "no noticeable effect" on public satisfaction or crime rates.
Results of the three-month trial are being evaluated and could see it rolled out throughout the East Midlands.
Police and Crime Commissioner Sir Clive Loader said he was unaware of the idea and would have advised against it.
Due to cuts in central government funding, the force has cut Â£33.9m - about 17% of the entire budget - over the four years to March 2015 but is expecting more savings to be needed.
The pilot was prompted by analysis by East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU), which covers Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, which found of 1,172 attempted burglaries scenes, few were found to contain any forensic evidence, and only 33 suspects were identified.
Jo Ashworth, director of forensic sciences with the unit, said: "The pilot was developed to look at what value forensic teams bring to the detection of attempt burglaries.  At a time when we are operating within reduced budgets, it is even more critical that we make the absolute best use of our crime scene investigators' time."
Leicestershire's Deputy Chief Constable Roger Bannister said they were examining many ways to deliver more cost effective policing.
He said: "The public would expect us to make the very best possible use of our time and limited resources to have the biggest impact on public safety and the prevention and detection of crime.
"This pilot suggests that we may need to reconsider how best to deploy crime scene investigators, especially if we are currently sending them automatically to scenes where, despite their professionalism and expertise, there is no evidence for them to retrieve."
The force also said forensic teams were still sent to all attempted burglaries involving vulnerable people or those thought to be part of a series.
But Sir Clive Loader said: "I was unaware of this trial and while I appreciate that technically this is operational policing territory, carried out by an East Midlands Collaborative Unit, I believe that I should have been informed, principally because it was taking place in Leicestershire.
"Had I been consulted, I would have advised against it, particularly in light of the controls chosen which, to me at least, are unlikely to inspire much public confidence."
