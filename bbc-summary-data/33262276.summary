Omar Al Shaikh and Amie Cresswell, both 16, tied the knot in front of family, friends and patients on a ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.
Omar, from Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, died on Monday after a suitable stem cell donor could not be found in time.
He had proposed to Amie after learning he only had days left to live.
Omar's aunt Anca Dumitriu said: "It was beautiful and he was happy... after he put the ring on Amie's finger he held her and was like 'you're mine now'. He was proper happy."
What is it?
Why does it happen?
A number of factors which can increase the risk of developing AML have been identified. These include:

Former Air Cadet Omar, who wore his dressing gown during the Islamic ceremony, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after fainting during a football match.
His mixed Arabic and Romanian heritage made it difficult to find a stem cell donor and by the time one was eventually found, he was too ill to have the transplant.
Medical staff broke news the cancer had gone into his bone marrow earlier this month.
His mother said he was strong right until the end.
"He died in peace," she said.
Friends and relatives are urging people to sign the Anthony Nolan register. The charity recruits stem cell donors and carries out research to make bone marrow transplants more effective.
