Luton Town 2-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cameron McGeehan scored two penalties as Luton Town maintained their lead at the top of League Two with a late win over Newport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McGeehan scored his first penalty after Jamie Turley's foul on Danny Hylton.
Jennison Myrie-Williams levelled for County direct from a corner after substitute Jon Parkin's presence caused problems in the Luton defence.
Johnny Mullins was sent-off for the hosts but McGeehan's stoppage time penalty secured victory.
Darren Jones was punished for his challenge on Pelly Ruddock, a decision which infuriated Newport players and staff.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales: "You could see by their [Luton] reaction that they got out of jail free tonight.
"I think the first [penalty] was a foul but we should have dealt with it. But the last one was an absolute disgraceful decision.
"I thought our boys were absolutely outstanding tonight. I think you could see the desire and passion and to get done by an absolute joke of a decision is heart breaking for them."
