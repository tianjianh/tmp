South Lakes Safari Zoo, where a keeper was killed by a tiger in 2013, was last month given 28 days by Barrow council to prove its aerial walkways were safe.
It was also feared baboons could escape by scaling a pile of rhino dung.
The zoo said it would close on Saturday and accused the council of harassment but the decision has now been reversed.
Following the rulings by the licensing committee in December, bosses said the zoo could not operate under such circumstances.
The closure was set to be temporary but there was no definite date for reopening.
However, after the scheduling of a further meeting between zoo management and the council's chief executive, the attraction will remain open, with areas roped off while work takes place.
The zoo said on its Facebook page: "In response to this very positive and constructive move and as a show of good faith the zoo management has agreed to open throughout the negotiations."
It has also emerged that the attraction is to become a charity - with founder and licence-holder David Gill retiring and gifting the venture to the Safari Zoo Nature Foundation.
The zoo and Mr Gill were last year charged with health and safety breaches following the death of keeper Sarah McClay who was mauled by a tiger in May 2013.
She suffered deep puncture wounds to her neck and body when the animal pounced on her.
A trial is scheduled to begin in June.
