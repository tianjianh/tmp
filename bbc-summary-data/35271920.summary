Luke Miller, from the Isle of Wight, was reportedly found dead at a hotel on the island of Koh Tao.
An online appeal to help repatriate Mr Miller's body has so far raised more than Â£5,000.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokeswoman confirmed it was providing assistance the family of a Briton who died on the island.
"Local authorities are investigating the death and we will remain in contact with them," it said in a statement.
Among the messages on the fundraising page, Maria Mimi Miller posted: "I just want my baby brother home, where he belongs. This is so devastating and heartbreaking."
Another message described him as "one of the nicest people we ever got to know".
Mr Miller had left the UK on 22 December to spend Christmas and the New Year on the Thai holiday island.
In September 2014 two British backpackers, Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were murdered on a beach on the island.
Miss Witheridge, from Hemsby in Norfolk, had been raped before she was killed, and Mr Miller, from Jersey, was hit over the head before drowning in the sea.
Two migrant workers were later found guilty of their murders and sentenced to death last month.
