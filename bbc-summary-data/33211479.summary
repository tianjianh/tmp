The driver has been arrested but police have released no further details.
Part of the city has been sealed off and emergency services have launched a major operation.
Graz is Austria's second largest city and the square was hosting an event related to the nearby Austrian Formula 1 Grand Prix.
The area's governor confirmed that three people had died and 34 were injured, some seriously.
Governor Hermann Schuetzenhoefe told reporters that the suspect arrested was a 26-year-old man. The motive for the attack is not clear.
Emergency forces sent 60 ambulances to the scene and four helicopters to take victims to hospital.
The Austrian Grand Prix takes place this weekend in Spielberg, and it is thought that many of the city's emergency services had been deployed there. Crowds had gathered in the square to take part in a Formula 1 event.
There are unconfirmed reports that after crashing the man exited the vehicle and attacked people with a knife.
Photographs from the scene show a heavily damaged SUV and blood on the pavement.
Eyewitness Helmut Reinisch told the BBC he saw bodies lying on the ground "covered in blood," including a young boy.
An eye-witness also told the agency that the car was travelling at 100km/h (62mph) when it entered the square.
