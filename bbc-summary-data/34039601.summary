[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crossbow murder trial of Daniel Schofield starts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man murdered his violent brother-in-law by firing a crossbow bolt straight through his body, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Schofield, 29, shot Roy Hanson, 50, with the weapon on his farm on the Lizard in Cornwall, Truro Crown Court was told.
It happened after Mr Hanson had viciously assaulted his wife, Mr Schofield's older sister Julia Hanson, the court heard.
Mr Schofield denies murder and manslaughter.
In her evidence Mrs Hanson told the jury about her husband's temper and violence, saying that he had dangled her out of a hotel second-floor window on their honeymoon.
She had left Mr Hanson and was staying with Mr Schofield, when Mr Hanson, a plumber from St Keverne, arrived at the farm on 25 October last year.
An argument followed and Mr Hanson attacked his wife, putting his hands around her neck, the court heard.
The jury was told Mr Schofield confronted Mr Hanson with a loaded and cocked crossbow.
It was discharged and the bolt hit Mr Hanson in the chest, passing straight through his heart and a major blood vessel before exiting through his back.
They were also shown the blood-soaked bolt and the crossbow that fired it.
The trial continues.
