[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sunderland Ladies 1-0 Bristol City Women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland Ladies overcame Bristol City Women to remain unbeaten from three Spring Series games so far thanks to their first league goal of 2017.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lucy Staniforth's penalty with 14 minutes remaining settled a close top-flight game at The Hetton Centre.
Staniforth had earlier been denied by Caitlin Leach's low save before hitting the bar from a direct free-kick.
The Vixen's Leach also saved from Abbey Joice, before Jodie Brett and Claire Emslie went close at the other end.
But centre-back Hayley Ladd's challenge on Joice in the area left Staniforth to win the game and move the Lady Black Cats to third in the table after three games - and three league clean sheets - this term.
Bristol City - who were promoted to Women's Super League One as WSL 2 runners-up last year - drop to fourth.
