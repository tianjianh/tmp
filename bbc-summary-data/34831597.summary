Nick Blackwell 'can win world title' - Mick Hennessy

Nick Blackwell's promoter Mick Hennessy believes the 25-year-old is capable of winning a world title and has accused Chris Eubank Jr of avoiding his man.

Blackwell retained his British middleweight title on Saturday with a unanimous points decision at the end of a gruelling bout with Jack Arnfield.
And Hennessy was impressed with the performance of the Wiltshire fighter.
"He is the dark horse of the middleweight division," Hennessy told BBC Wiltshire.
"We are going after the Lonsdale belt, the European title and then a genuine world title. He can definitely win a world title and win it in style because he is the type of fighter everyone wants to see in this country - a great TV fighter."
Blackwell, who has three defeats and one draw from his 23-fight professional career, will keep his British title belt if he makes a third defence, something he says is his next target.
"I'm learning," he said.
"I want to defend it again and win it outright. One more defence and it is mine, I never thought in a million years that when I laced up a pair of gloves I would be winning a British title."
Hennessy says he would like that next defence to be against interim WBA middleweight title champion Eubank Jr, but does not hold much hope of it happening.
"The board have just mandated Chris Eubank junior so let's see if he turns up," he said.
"We'd love that fight but it needs to be said the board have already called two eliminators with Nick and Chris Eubank junior and he has pulled out of both. Who is to say he will go ahead with this mandated British title.
"We'd love him to, it would be a British super-fight, it's what everyone is in the game for. We made him a large offer to fight on this domestic route but they chose to go another way."
