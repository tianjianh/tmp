The Wings are four points adrift of safety and without a win in 10 league matches, stretching back to 13 October.
The 31-year-old led the side to the FA Cup second round before losing to Carlisle, but they have lost their last five games in all competitions.
Coaches Matt McEntegart and Paul Barnes have also left the club.
Welling operations manager Barry Hobbins told the club website: "We're disappointed that we've had to make a change but we felt we had to give ourselves the best chance possible of staying up.
"We enjoyed a good run in the FA Cup this season but the league is our priority and we need to get back to winning ways very quickly."
Former Welling defender Fazakerley, who made 219 appearances for the club, helped save the Wings from relegation last season after taking over from Jody Brown in March.
"I'm very disappointed because I still believe we could still have turned things round," he told BBC Radio Kent.
"It has been a very intense few months and we gave it everything. With every game you fail to win your time runs out so we knew it was a possibility.
"It is the end of an era as I had some great years at Welling."
