Will Young: Five favourite albums

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Will Young grew up surrounded by music, listening to cassettes in the family car and smuggling a walkman into his strict boarding school.

His musical education has paid dividends since winning the inaugural series of Pop Idol in 2002, prompting him to pick interesting and unexpected collaborators over his six studio albums.
It's given him one of the most successful careers of any talent show winner: Young has sold eight million records, won an Ivor Novello Award, and scored four number one albums, including his most recent release 85% Proof.
"I like frailty and vulnerability," he says. "People who let me into their music and songs that evoke an atmosphere."
As he releases his new single, Thank You, the musician sat down to discuss his five favourite (and one least favourite) records.
"If we did this tomorrow it would be five different albums," he laughs.
Recorded at Abbey Road studios between April and June 1966, Revolver is the Beatles' first psychedelic masterpiece. Featuring tracks like Taxman, Eleanor Rigby and Good Day Sunshine, it ends with John Lennon's Tomorrow Never Knows - an attempt to condense the experience of an LSD trip into three minutes. It pointed the way forward not just for the Beatles, but popular music as a whole.
It was a record that was always played in my house from about the age of 10. It was probably when CDs first came in - my folks got Revolver and Abbey Road and we went away on holiday to South Africa and played it in the house we were staying in.
Every song was so different.  I'd never heard anything like it before - and never since, actually.
Paul McCartney is one of my favourite singers. He's got this brilliant vibrato - but he doesn't rest on it. A Jazz singer would use the vibrato a lot, but his projection is quite straight. He passes through it.
I can do quite a good Paul McCartney impression, actually.
The follow-up to Thriller, Bad was released to fevered anticipation in 1987. Spawning nine hit singles, from the title track to Smooth Criminal, it marked the point where Jackson transformed from nimble-footed musical genius to paranoid, self-promoting King Of Pop.  The key track is Man In The Mirror, a gospel-powered ballad that's equal parts self-reflection and self-flagellation.
Bad came out when I was at prep school, aged about nine, and it just took over the school. Everyone had it... on cassette, actually.
It was a really strict school. We were only allowed to listen to music on Wednesday, Saturday or Sunday and we weren't allowed to play music out loud. So it really was contained to my own world, on my Walkman.
Sonically, it was incredible. He'd moved to a lot harder sound. It became insane, epic. Dirty Diana is incredible - because it's so loud, then suddenly drops out to that fantastic bassline.
Michael was a global pop star with Thriller, but this moved him to a completely different sound. The videos and his look - suddenly he had the glove and the leather jacket.
The thing was, he wasn't Bad. But I guess as a young kid he did seem quite rebellious. There were all these posh kids running around doing a flick of their leg and saying, "who's Bad?"
Terence Trent D'Arby's fourth album was a scattershot selection of funk, rock, R&B and heartfelt ballads. A showcase in eclecticism, it was nonetheless short on memorable melodies. The exception was Holding On To You, a low-key love song that became a minor hit in the UK. After the album stalled, the singer was dropped by his record label and changed his name to Sanada Maitreya.
I was at public school by this stage, and Vibrator felt like it was my little secret. It's just incredible. Quite avant garde. Very weird. He was posing in a pair of feathered wings on the cover. People probably thought he was a madman.
I used to go to athletics meetings - I was quite a keen athlete - and I'd listen to Surrender before I ran the 400 metres. There was something a bit sad about it - but for some reason that's always got me hyped up. A bit like Radiohead. I've always found their music is really powerful and gets me psyched up if I'm doing exercise. When I used to do marathons, I used to listen to Radiohead.
The hit from that album was Holding On To You - I don't know where it charted but I remember him on Top of the Pops with his bleached blonde hair, cut really short. He was such a beautiful man. A very feminine-looking man. Still, to this day, no-one has rivalled him vocally.
After the Fugees disbanded in 1997, Lauryn Hill branched out and released her solo debut. Updating 70s soul with a hip-hop aesthetic, it sold more than 12 million copies and won five Grammy awards. An intensely personal record, Hill sings about putting her son before her career (To Zion) and her painful break-up with Wyclef Jean (Ex-Factor).
"I was in this tiny village in France and this flower shop was playing The Fugees' cover of Killing My Softly and I thought 'this is the singer I've been waiting for'. Her voice is so crystal, and all her vocal licks are so clear. You hear every note. It's not lazy. It's true great gospel singing in a pop voice.
I got this in in my first month at Uni in Exeter. I splashed out and bought it on Minidisc rather than copy it from someone else. It was very lavish.
"At the same time, I fell in love with someone and it was unrequited. It's that song, Tell Him. I used to listen to it over and over and over again.
"Did I tell him? Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got that out of the way. We're still great friends. He's a great actor. He lives in LA now with his wife. They're lovely.
"I learned how to write songs on my first album," said Emiliana Torrini of her debut, released in 1999. A collection of hushed, cherubic electro-pop, it produced a minor UK hit in the shape of To Be Free. The Icelandic singer took six years to follow it up with the vulnerable, confessional Fisherman's Woman and 2008's Me and Armini, whose rambunctious single Jungle Drum became a number one around Europe.
When I go into record shops I always ask for three recommendations. So I discovered this when I was in [defunct chain store] MVC buying Lauryn Hill. I heard this song and asked the staff, who's that playing?
Five more Will Young favourites
??? The Black Keys - Attack and Release
??? Sia - Only See
??? Lucy Pearl - Lucy Pearl
??? D'Angelo - Brown Sugar
??? Sade - Love Deluxe
It's a really interesting record. It's not an amazing record, actually. I don't come back to it. But I'd mention that as my lead-in to Me and Armini. That should have won awards.
That's where she starts getting a bit punchy. There's a song - Gun - I listened to that and I wanted to do a whole dance piece to it. The same with another of the tracks, Big Jumps.
I love the softness of her voice, and I love the crack in her voice. Those are the artists I find interesting - that have every emotion and aren't afraid to show it. The frailty and the vulnerability.
That's what I've liked about singing and writing - it's like a musical version of the 12 Step programme,  except you don't know who else is in the room.
I was at Glastonbury and I refused to see him. He's awful. What does he stand for? His arrogance completely over-runs him as a musician. He's so audacious and opulent.
It shows the worst of people who have loads of money. Massive weddings, opulent engagements. Who is this man? And why do we laud these people?
I'm not interested in arrogance. It's just a cover. Get rid of the arrogance and show me the frailty. I won't listen to his music.
Will Young's album, 85% Proof, and single, Thank You, are out now.
