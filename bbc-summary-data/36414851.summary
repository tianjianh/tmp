Dutch striker Yordi Teijsse has signed for Dundee after helping Quick Boys win the fourth tier in the Netherlands.

The 23-year-old has been handed a two-year contract at Dens Park.
Dundee say Teijsse, who scored 31 goals this season, is a player they "monitored closely from the beginning of the 2015-16 season".
His twin, left-back Kenny, plays for Go Ahead Eagles, who defeated De Graafschap in their play-off to win promotion to the Dutch top flight.
Having begun his senior career with Pancratius, Yordi Teijsse moved to VV Ter Leede before joining Quick Boys in 2014.
He becomes Dundee manager Paul Hartley's third summer signing.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle midfielders Danny Williams and James Vincent signed pre-contract deals earlier this year.
