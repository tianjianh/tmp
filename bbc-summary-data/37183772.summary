[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire set up a chance of a victory over Nottinghamshire at Scarborough as Gary Ballance completed his second Championship century of the season.

England batsman Ballance (101 not out) reached a 163-ball ton, containing 14 fours, as the hosts declared on 263-4.
In reply, Notts lost Steven Mullaney for two in Jack Brooks' first over.
Tim Bresnan (2-15) took wickets in six balls but Tom Moores dug in with 41 not out, before rain saw an early close with Notts 390 behind on 61-3.
After early-morning rain, play got under way 40 minutes late and Yorkshire added 63 runs in just under an hour.
A boundary from Bresnan (35 not out) saw the home side declare, setting Notts a target of 452, and Brooks then stuck in the second over when he had Mullaney caught by Jack Leaning at slip.
Bresnan took two wickets in an over to see off Jake Libby for nine and Michael Lumb for a five-ball duck as Notts, who look favourties to be relegated to Division Two, slipped to 34-3.
But debutant Moores, who played two Championship games on loan at Lancashire earlier this season, hit eight fours in 80 minutes at the crease, before bad light took the players off the field.
Heavy rain meant play was called off for the day at 15:50 BST but with a day remaining, Yorkshire have given their hopes of a third Championship title in a row a major boost.
Nottinghamshire coach Peter Moores on his son Tom Moores:
"He played really well at a time we really needed people to play well. He had to be patient for around the first hour, but then he could get away - it's that sort of pitch.
"He will go back to the hotel tonight and get ready for tomorrow. He's got a big role to play.
"Going to Lancashire was great for him and he enjoyed his time there."
