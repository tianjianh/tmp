Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin insists he has no issues with Neil Taylor after substituting the defender in the first half of their 2-2 draw with Chelsea.

Wales international Taylor, 27, was replaced by Modou Barrow after just 41 minutes as the Swans trailed 1-0.
The left-back looked furious as he left the pitch, but Guidolin says the matter is resolved after he apologised.
"I'm sorry with Neil Taylor because I'm not used to changing a player before half-time," Guidolin said.
"If I waited three minutes, maybe it was better for him, but Mo [Barrow] was ready five minutes before and I decided to change.
"No problem between me and Neil. I spoke with him in the dressing room. I think this change was good for us."
Trailing 1-0 after a torrid first half, Swansea fought back to lead 2-1 before Diego Costa's late acrobatic strike snatched a point for Chelsea in a fiery encounter.
Left-back Taylor had been recalled to make his first Premier League start of the season as Guidolin switched to a 5-4-1 formation, but the Italian soon ditched the new system in an attempt to salvage the game.
The draw lifts Swansea up to 13th place in the Premier League table and, although his new system initially proved problematic, Guidolin would be happy to use it again.
"In my opinion, we have the characteristics to play this way," added Swansea's head coach.
"I was not very happy about my wingers and I decided it was the right moment to change something.
"We can play again with this shape because, in my opinion, we played well before the first Chelsea goal but not what I want. We can improve."
