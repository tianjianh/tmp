The Northumberland Development Project will double the capacity of the existing stadium at White Hart Lane to seat 61,000 fans.
The club's chairman, Daniel Levy, said it was a "major milestone".
Five days ago a neighbouring sheet metal business lost a High Court appeal against a compulsory purchase order.
"We are grateful to the mayor for his ongoing support," said Mr Levy.
"We remain focused on completing the final stages of the planning process."
The new stadium will have a retractable pitch and will host two American football games each season and concerts.
The surrounding complex will have a 180-bed hotel, sports and health centre, and a nearby listed building will become an interactive museum devoted to Spurs' history.
Visitors will be able to climb the exterior of the south stand for views across London.
Spurs hope to move into the new stadium in time for the 2018/19 season.
London Mayor Boris Johnson said: "The stadium will also be the focal point of a major drive to regenerate Tottenham, breathing new life into the area, creating jobs and boosting growth."
