[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gavin Thorman, 37, of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, is serving 12 years in jail as ringleader of a drugs' gang.
He thought no one would understand his boasts in Welsh on a prison phone at Altcourse in Liverpool but the calls were being recorded and translated, Mold Crown Court was told.
The seizure included a VW car, a van and a speedboat.
In prison Thorman had bragged about his new contacts, discussed drugs and how he was going to come out "making millions".
He had told his girlfriend: "I'm only doing a small sentence so they won't be listening to my calls."
Operation Yonside, which led to Thorman's conviction last year, was one of North Wales Police's biggest probes and led to the seizure of almost £200,000 worth of cocaine and cannabis.
