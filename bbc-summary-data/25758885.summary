Improvements needed at Dundee's Fernbrae private hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An unannounced inspection of a private hospital in Dundee has uncovered shortcomings in cleanliness and infection control.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inspectors who visited Fernbrae Hospital also said improvements were needed to ensure patients health records were fully completed.
They have stipulated four requirements for improvement at the hospital along with eight recommendations.
Inspectors visited the hospital on 29 October and 7 November last year.
The hospital, which has 15 in-patient beds and is run by BMI Healthcare, also carries out diagnostic tests and surgical treatments to in-patients over the age of 14.
It will now have to carry out a full domestic cleanliness and infection control audit and forward its findings to Healthcare Improvement Scotland.
While inspectors found the quality of care and support offered at the hospital was "good", they said the quality of the environment in which patients were treated was "weak". The quality of staffing was also described as "good", with management and leadership described as "adequate".
'Not satisfied'
Susan Brimelow, chief inspector at Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said: "Our unannounced inspection identified a number of significant areas for improvement.
"We had concerns about cleanliness and compliance with standard infection control precautions.
"In particular, we were not satisfied there was an adequate system and process in place for the continued monitoring of domestic cleanliness and actions taken to reduce the risk of infection for people using the service."
Ms Brimelow said future inspections would be carried out to ensure improvements were made.
Louise Buchan, executive director of the hospital, said BMI Healthcare took the recommendations "very seriously".
She added: "High standards of hospital cleanliness and effective infection control precautions are an important aspect of delivering high quality patient care, and we accept that there were some areas where our normally high standards were not being met.
"Patient safety and wellbeing is our first priority and we have taken substantive steps to address the concerns raised."
In addition to improving patients records and carrying out a cleanliness and infection control audit, managers will be required to ensure that all staff are compliant with standard infection control precautions.
Inspectors also recommended that staff who administer medication have periodic competency checks as well as ensuring that all staff who are responsible for cleaning any body fluids are aware of the correct products to use.
