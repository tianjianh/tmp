Nade tucked the ball beyond Robbie Thomson, but Queens were level when Iain Russell found the top corner.
The visitors took the lead when Alex Harris slotted past Jamie Ewings.
But, within two second-half minutes, Tom Walsh and Nade put the Sons ahead and Garry Fleming's penalty secured the win after a foul on Gregor Buchanan.
The win lifts Dumbarton five points clear of second-bottom Livingston with a game in hand.
