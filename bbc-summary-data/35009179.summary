The former Filton Airfield in Bristol has been sold to Malaysian developers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 350 acre (142 hectare) site was previously owned by BAE Systems and has been bought by YTL Utilities for an undisclosed sum.
Planning permission for 2,675 new homes and 62 acres (25 hectares) of office and industrial use was granted by South Gloucestershire Council in July.
The airfield closed in 2012. Three schools, a community centre and a care home are included in the plans.
Colin Skellett, chairman of YTL Homes UK, said "We are delighted to have acquired this significant site which is a strategically important development for South Gloucestershire and the South West region."
Mike Craddock from BAE Systems said: "We wanted to ensure that we chose a buyer with the skills and track record to deliver the vision for the redevelopment of this regionally important brownfield site."
Part of the old Filton Airfield site will be used by the new Bristol Aerospace Centre, which will house a Concorde museum, and is due to be completed next year.
The development is part of wider plans to build about 5,700 new homes on the edge of Bristol over the next decade.
