Yorkshire clinched their first County Championship title for 13 years, with victory over Nottinghamshire by an innings and 152 runs at Trent Bridge.

Former England paceman Ryan Sidebottom took 6-30 against his former club as Notts were all out for 177.
It took the White Rose county just 14.2 overs to collect the five wickets they needed on the final morning.
Sidebottom ended the game when James Taylor (75) was caught at gully, giving him match figures of 9-65.
It was a magnificent performance by the evergreen 36-year-old, who was a member of Yorkshire's 2001 title-winning squad, but moved to Notts three years later.
He contributed 50 wickets to help them win the Championship in 2005 and 30 when they did so again in 2010 before returning to his home county for the final phase of his career, after retiring from international cricket.
Yorkshire were relegated in Sidebottom's first season back at the club, but bounced straight back the following year as runners-up in Division Two after Australian Jason Gillespie took over as coach.
They began the game at Trent Bridge with a 26-point lead over the home side and were bolstered by the return to the team of England Test players Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Tim Bresnan.
They dominated the game after opener Adam Lyth's sixth hundred of the summer enabled them to pile up 532-9 declared.

Resuming on 149-5 after being made to follow on, Nottinghamshire's chances of holding out for a draw were slim and became even slimmer when Sidebottom knocked back Gary Keedy's off stump in the third over of play.
He then produced an absolute beauty to account for home skipper Chris Read, seaming away to find the edge and leave wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow with a simple catch.
Sidebottom underlined his commitment by racing round the boundary to make a sliding save before collecting his fifth wicket of the innings by having Luke Fletcher taken at second slip by Lyth,
Taylor went past 50, but new batsman Jake Ball found himself ringed by fielders when leg-spinner Adil Rashid replaced Jack Brooks and was soon beaten by a flipper which left the umpire with a straightforward lbw decision.
With only last man Harry Gurney for company, Taylor ran out of patience and carved a ball from Sidebottom straight to substitute fielder Rich Pyrah as Yorkshire wrapped up their eighth win of the season and took the title with a game to spare.
Club captain Andrew Gale was unable to lift the trophy as the England & Wales Cricket Board felt it was not appropriate for him to be involved in the presentation while he awaits a Disciplinary Panel Hearing.
Gale, 30, was banned for the final two Championship games following an altercation with Lancashire's Ashwell Prince on the third evening of his side's innings and 18-run win at Old Trafford.
He was reported by the umpires for "using language or gesture that is obscene or of a serious insulting nature" and an ECB statement at the time said: "The Cricket Discipline Commission will also consider whether any further action needs to be taken in relation to Mr Gale."
Yorkshire's final match of the summer against Somerset begins at Headingley on 23 September.
