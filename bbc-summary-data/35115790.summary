A 35-year-old man who threatened to kidnap, rape and kill a nurse has been jailed for seven months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Garrick, from Perth, sent more than 70 messages to the woman, who was assigned to work with him at a medical day centre.
The sheriff said it was likely that Garrick's habitual use of legal highs had probably contributed to the crime.
The building worker admitted the offences, committed between 11 and 12 November, at an earlier hearing.
Perth Sheriff Court heard Garrick believed he was having a conversation with the nurse because a cocktail of drugs had sparked voices in his head.
Sheriff Lindsay Foulis was told that he had started sniffing gas and smoking cannabis at the age of 11 and had been taking legal highs - also known as new psychoactive substances.
The sheriff said: "You have six previous assault convictions and seven convictions for breach of the peace. There are undoubtedly other issues relevant to your offending.
"Nonetheless, if you didn't take illicit substances then I suspect you wouldn't appear before this court. There is a voluntary aspect in your actions which causes all sorts of problems.
"A custodial sentence may just bring it home to you that taking illicit substances which result in you behaving in this manner then it does have real consequences."
Garrick was given the nurse's work mobile number after she was assigned to him and used it to send numerous texts and voicemails over a 24-hour period, including the threats.
Garrick also admitted possessing an offensive weapon.
