Plans for a large housing development to be built in the South Downs National Park have been approved.

Developers want to build more than 400 homes alongside workshops and shops in the Phoenix Quarter of Lewes.
Protest group Lewes Phoenix Rising said the current plans would wipe away the good aspects of the current area and devised an alternative scheme.
However, the South Downs National Park Authority agreed planning permission at a meeting earlier.
Andy Smith, leader of Lewes District Council, said the approval was "great news for Lewes" and would provide the town with homes, flood defences and jobs.
He said: "We hope that we can now work with all of those who care about this site to build a truly exceptional development for the people and businesses of Lewes."
He said the scheme would provide 416 new homes, with 40% of them dubbed affordable.
