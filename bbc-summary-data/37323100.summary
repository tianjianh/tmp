[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Byrne, 33, was shot dead at the Regency Hotel on 5 February.
The details were given at an extradition hearing in Belfast.
Kevin Murray who was arrested earlier this week at his home in Townsend Street in Strabane was refused bail.
He was arrested by PSNI officers on Monday, using a European Arrest Warrant.
Mr Murray is objecting to a bid by the Irish police, who claim he played a a central role in the hotel shooting,  to extradite him to the Republic of Ireland.
The details of the overnight stay were revealed by the recorder of Belfast as among the reasons why she was refusing bail to Mr Murray.
She also said that Irish police investigating the killing of Mr Byrne also claimed that Mr Murray could be clearly identified on CCTV footage at the Regency Hotel in Dublin.
Byrne, a 34-year-old father of two from the Crumlin area, was shot dead when masked men dressed as Garda (Irish police) officers opened fire with automatic guns.
Two other men were injured in the attack which police have linked to a gangland feud in Dublin.
A full extradition hearing is expected to take place at Laganside Court in Belfast in the near future.
