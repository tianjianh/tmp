A lorry driver who killed a cyclist in a hit-and-run collision has been given a suspended sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Saunders, 61, was found dead at the side of the A49 near Dorrington, in June last year.
Mark Baker, 40, of Clarence Street, Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf, pleaded guilty to causing the death by careless driving at an earlier hearing.
Shrewsbury Crown Court sentenced him to 26 weeks imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.
Baker initially tried to claim the damage to his lorry occurred at a vehicle yard, but changed plea to guilty due to "overwhelming evidence against him", the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
The CPS said Mr Saunders was cycling home from his work in Church Stretton at 05:00 BST when he was struck by a HGV driven by Baker.
He failed to stop and continued with his journey to Chirk near Wrexham.
His lorry was indentified by a headlight washer blanking plate found at the roadside, the CPS said.
Spokesman Robin Allen said: "A prudent and careful driver would have seen Michael Saunders, who was using flashing lights [and] wearing high visibility bright yellow clothing.
"More importantly, having seen the cyclist, they would have avoided colliding with him."
Baker was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, disqualified from driving for two years and told to take extended re-test.
