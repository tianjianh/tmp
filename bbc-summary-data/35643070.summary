A four-year-old girl has been hit by a car that was reportedly "driven at speed away from the scene".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl is being treated in hospital for grazes, cuts and bruises following the incident in Oxford on Monday.
Police are hunting for the car - believed to a black or dark-coloured Audi - which did not stop after the crash in Mortimer Road, close to Nowell Road junction, at about 16:15 GMT.
Witnesses are urged to contact Thames Valley Police.
PC Daniel Watford of the Roads Policing Unit said: "It is hard to believe that a driver would not stop at the scene following an accident, especially when a young child is involved.
"I would therefore appeal to anyone who may have any information, no matter how insignificant they think it might be, to search their conscience and contact police."
