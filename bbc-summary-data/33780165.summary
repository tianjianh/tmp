Gatland has handed debuts to four players in an experimental Welsh side.
Wales host Ireland on Saturday, before playing them in Dublin on 29 August and hosting Italy on 5 September.
"Joe rang me last week to talk about what we were looking at in the squad," Gatland said.
"I said we were going to have a mixed squad with an opportunity for some younger players.
"He sort of indicated that they were probably going to do the same thing.

"I think they will experiment with the squad too."
Ireland lock Iain Henderson says head coach Schmidt has given his players no indication of who is likely to face Wales.
New Zealander Schmidt will name his side on Thursday to play at the Millennium Stadium and is then expected to cut three or four players from his provisional World Cup training group of 45 players.
Wales will cut their World Cup training squad from 47 players to between 36 and 38 after Saturday's game against Ireland.
Uncapped Ross Moriarty, Tyler Morgan, Eli Walker and Dominic Day will make their Wales debuts on Saturday.
Gatland said Schmidt had also asked if the Millennium Stadium roof would be shut for Saturday's game.
The Millennium Stadium will host Wales' Pool A matches against Uruguay on 20 September and Fiji on 1 October as well as Ireland 's Pool D matches against Canada and France.
"He [Schmidt] proceeded to ask what was happening with the roof," Gatland added.
"I said: 'Well, it's a bit ironic that you wanted it open during the Six Nations and now you want it closed'.
"He was hoping during the Six Nations that it was pouring down with rain, so we had a bit of a chat about that.
"I think he wants it closed because it's closed during the World Cup. It makes sense to close the roof if it will be closed for the World Cup.
"There was a cynical side of me that did feel like saying we were going to leave it open."
