The restaurant chain has been battling to save its reputation and share price amid a growing E. coli outbreak.
Chris Arnold, a spokesperson for Chipotle said, "Health officials in Boston seem to believe this is a norovirus, which seems consistent with the pattern in our estimation."
The branch has been closed while the illnesses are investigated.
According to Boston College, as of noon on Tuesday, 80 of its students - including members of the men's basketball team - reported suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms after eating at the Chipotle restaurant near the university.
Boston College said all the students had been tested for both E. coli and the norovirus, but the test results would not be available until late on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Chipotle's share price fell 2.9%.
Last Friday, the company told investors it expected to see an 8% to 11% drop in sales in its fourth quarter as a result of the E. coli outbreak that started in October.
Norovirus, also known as winter vomiting, affects approximately 20 million Americans a year according to the US Centres for Disease Control.
It can be easily spread by person-to-person contact, contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces.
