[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steven Pressley's Fleetwood earned a key win in their battle against League One relegation as he marked his return to the Ricoh Arena with victory over his old club Coventry City.

Fleetwood took a 56th-minute lead when Wes Burns headed in David Ball's cross.
The Sky Blues hit back to level when substitute Marcus Tudgay fired in on 75 minutes from Adam Armstrong's cut-back.
But Ball fired in an 83rd-minute winner from 20 yards to send Fleetwood two points clear of the relegation zone.
Pressley was making his first return to the Ricoh Arena since being sacked in February 2015.
While Pressley's Cod Army climb to 19th, his former club Coventry remain sixth, 12 points adrift of leaders Burton Albion ahead of Tuesday night's trip to Barnsley.
Fleetwood now have four of their next five games at home, but all of them are against promotion-chasing sides, including three of the current top four.
Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"We huffed and puffed and didn't quite blow their house down. They're a decent football team and probably in a false position.
"It's frustrating for us, especially when we got back to 1-1 and we should have gone on to win from there.
"But we have to accept it and put the defeat behind us."
Fleetwood manager Steven Pressley:
"I'm very proud of my players. The only disappointment that I have is that it was only 2-1 in the end, because it should have been much, much more than that.
"It wasn't just the win that impressed me, it was the manner of it. It's difficult as a manager to individualise any player after such a performance, because it was one of real quality.
"The reaction was terrific after the setback we had at Rochdale on Tuesday evening, but to take six points from nine is a good achievement."
