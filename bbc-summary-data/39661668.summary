Dwight Yorke: Ex-Man Utd striker cannot get interview to be manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke has criticised the lack of black bosses in football and claims he cannot get an interview for a manager's job.

Yorke, 45, said he knew of black former players who would not do coaching badges as they felt they had little chance of getting a coaching role.
"If it's not because of the colour of our skin then tell me what it is?" the former Trinidad and Tobago player said.
"I'm speaking out about it. Be fair. At least give us an interview."
Speaking to BBC World Service's World Football show, Yorke suggested that black players might have to consider going on strike to force those involved in the game to take a serious look at the lack of black managers.
Earlier this month Grimsby Town sacked Marcus Bignot, leaving Brighton's Chris Hughton and Carlisle's Keith Curle as the only managers from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds in the top four divisions of the English game.

"Football is a global sport and black players have contributed to the global sport for a number of years," added Yorke, whose former clubs also included Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers.
"Look to the Premier League. Are there any black managers? Look at the Italian league? Are there any black managers? The list goes on."
Yorke won the Premier League three times at United, in 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-01. He also helped Sir Alex Ferguson's team win the Champions League in 1999.
He added: "People like myself, who have good credibility in the game and played at the very top level, you'd think would get a job or at least be given an interview, but you're not even getting an interview.
"I see managers with my own eyes walking out of jobs and then walking into jobs, getting sacked and then walking back into another job... yet we can't even get an interview.
"I see that as not being fair."
Last month, Brighton boss Hughton said there was a "real enthusiasm for change" to give equal opportunities for black managers in the English game.
"It is going to be about talking around the table as much as possible, highlighting it as much as possible and looking to see change," added Hughton, who has masterminded Brighton's promotion to the Premier League.
"There is no doubt that the balances are not right.
"Where I have seen change is at grassroots level and academy level. I think everybody wants to see that at first-team level up through the leagues.
"I do think there is a real enthusiasm to want change."
