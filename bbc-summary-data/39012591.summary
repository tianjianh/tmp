Wrexham remain 10th following their first away win under Dean Keates while Solihull are 14th.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales:  "I'm happy with the result and happy with the clean sheet.
"I thought in the first half we controlled the game and was happy with the performance but we were under too much pressure in the second half.
