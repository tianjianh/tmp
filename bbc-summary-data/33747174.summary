The Queen has shown off her best sides in a quadruple portrait produced by photographer Hugo Rittson-Thomas.

The image was taken using mirrors, enabling the photographer to capture full-length pictures of the Queen from the front, back and sides.
Prince William and the Duchess of Cornwall have also posed for similar shots.
All of the images, taken over the last few years, will be used in the exhibition The Queen's People.
Mr Rittson-Thomas, who has photographed people including the Dalai Lama and David Cameron, spoke of technical problems during his session with the Queen.
"The camera had a digital seizure but luckily I was about two-thirds of the way into the shoot. She was very calm and cool and put me at ease," he said.
Mr Rittson-Thomas said he captured the Queen's smile after he asked the passionate horse-owner how she would feel if one of her horses won the Epsom Derby - the only classic to have eluded her.
The photographs were taken in 2013 at Windsor Castle.
Prince William, Colonel of the Irish Guards, was photographed in 2012 when he and wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, joined the regiment to celebrate St Patrick's Day.
He was wearing his Irish Guards frock coat for the occasion.
The exhibition features members of the Royal Household and senior ceremonial figures in their traditional uniforms depicted using the same quadruple portrait effect.
Others featured in the exhibition include the Bishop of London Richard Chartres, who is Dean of the Chapel Royal, and Lieutenant General David Leakey, who is the senior House of Lords officer Black Rod.
The Duchess of Cornwall's picture was taken earlier this year wearing formal attire, designed by Bruce Oldfield, together with family jewellery.
The project was inspired by 16th and 17th Century paintings of monarchs such as Elizabeth I and her court, often painted against a black or dark background which emphasised the rich colours of the outfits worn.
The Queen's People exhibition will be held at Eleven Gallery in London from 19 August to 19 September.
