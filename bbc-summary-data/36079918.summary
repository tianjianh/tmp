The FTSE 100 closed 51.83 points, or 0.8%, higher at 6,405.35.
Anglo American shares rose 8.5%, with Antofagasta up 7.6% and silver miner Fresnillo up 5.1%, after the price of silver hit a 10-month high.
Hopes that China's economy is not slowing as quickly as feared helped to support the sector.
"With Chinese data clearly showing tentative signs of a resurgence, there is a feeling that the commodities sector as a whole will begin recover despite ongoing reservations over the crude oil glut," said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG.
Shares in Primark owner Associated British Foods rose 1.9% after reporting a small rise in half-year profits.
Underlying pre-tax profits rose 4% to Â£466m for the 24 weeks to 27 February, with sales down 2% to Â£6.1bn.
On the currency markets, the pound rose nearly a cent against the dollar to $1.4384, and was up more than half a euro cent against the euro at â‚¬1.2653.
