Kesha denied drug, sex claims against Dr Luke in 2011

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It has emerged that Kesha said her long-term producer never had sex with her, nor gave her drugs, in a deposition given three years ago.

The statements contradict a lawsuit filed by her that accuses Dr Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, of sexual and emotional abuse.
Kesha's attorney, Mark Geragos, said the 27-year-old singer was ambiguous in the deposition.
He also claimed she was warned to never talk about the alleged assault.
The deposition was revealed after a lawyer for Dr Luke successfully asked a New York state judge to unseal portions of the statements, which stem from a 2010 lawsuit launched by Kesha's former manager against the singer and producer.
Kesha's current lawsuit, which was launched on 14 October, alleges the producer drugged and raped her.
Geragos added that the questions about drugs and sex with the producer prove that she had spoken to her former manager about them.
In the 2011 deposition, Kesha said she didn't know if Dr Luke, who has also produced songs for the likes of Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus, had given her "drugs which could not be purchased at a pharmacy" and said the two never had an intimate relationship.
Kesha and Dr Luke, 41, traded accusations of abuse and extortion as Kesha sued Dr Luke to get out of her contract with the producer, which she signed when she was 18.
Dr Luke countersued, accusing Kesha and her mother, Pebe Sebert, of defamation, breach of contract and contractual interference.
Kesha's lawsuit also alleges the producer's insults about her appearance caused her to develop bulimia.
The singer, whose real name is Kesha Rose Sebert, finished a course of treatment for the condition in March after announcing she was entering rehab in January.
