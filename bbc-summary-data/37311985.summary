A driver whose car got trapped in flood waters has been cleared of endangering the safety of emergency services by ignoring road closure signs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jane Brewis, 50, from Jedburgh, had denied culpable and reckless conduct on the A699 near Kelso in December.
The case collapsed after a firefighter in charge of the rescue operation said he did not feel in any significant danger due to his specialised training.
As a result Ms Brewis was found not guilty of the charge.
The firefighter told Jedburgh Sheriff Court he had little difficulty in rescuing the driver after her car got trapped between two trees in water up to the level of its door handle.
The trial did not reach the stage of evidence being heard as to whether she had ignored road closure signs.
Sheriff Peter Paterson told her: "The charge against you is one of endangering the safety of emergency services personnel with whatever that conduct was.
"But the evidence from the fire officer was that he had effectively rescued you without danger.
"The Crown cannot prove danger or potential danger."
