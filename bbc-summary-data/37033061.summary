Canna white-tailed sea eagles raise four chicks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
White-tailed sea eagles have had a successful breeding season on the Isle of Canna, according the island's owners National Trust for Scotland (NTS).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two breeding pairs of the birds, which are the largest raptor species in the UK, are both rearing two chicks.
NTS said Canna's golden eagles are rearing a single chick.
For many years, golden eagle chicks from the Hebridean island were used to reintroduce the birds of preys to parts of Ireland.
NTS said Canna is believed to have the highest density of eagles in Scotland.
The trust's Dr Richard Luxmoore said: "Canna has proven to be a very productive breeding site for sea eagles and most years since reintroduction we have had two pairs nesting on the island.
"It is not so common to have both pairs successfully raise two chicks each so this is great news."
