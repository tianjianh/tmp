[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 1-0 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe gave their League One play-off prospects a boost with victory over second-placed Bolton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron scored the vital goal in the 11th minute, when Josh Morris curled a free-kick to the back post and defender David Mirfin headed home.
Scunthorpe were good value for their victory, despite a late spell of visiting pressure.
They controlled much of the first period with Bolton's only sight at goal, six minutes before the break, hooked high and wide into the crowd by Conor Wilkinson.
The Iron were unlucky not to double their lead early in the second half when a low strike from Neal Bishop took a slight deflection before striking the foot of a post.
But they had goalkeeper Joe Anyon to thank for a first clean sheet in almost two months as he tipped over a powerful drive from James Henry, before later going down to his left to brilliantly keep out Max Clayton's downward header.
