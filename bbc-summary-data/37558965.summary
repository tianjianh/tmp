Cardiff City: Neil Warnock named manager after Paul Trollope sacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neil Warnock has been appointed manager of Cardiff City following Paul Trollope's sacking.

Trollope was dismissed on Tuesday after less than five months in charge, with Cardiff second bottom of the table after two wins from 11 games.
Former Sheffield United boss Warnock, 67, helped Rotherham avoid relegation from the Championship last season, but turned down the chance to stay.
He now hopes to rekindle ambitions of an eighth promotion as a manager.
Warnock told the Bluebirds website: "I enjoyed it at Rotherham last year and I've got seven promotions and, I can't tell a lie, I thought I was trying to get that eighth promotion.
"I decided to wait - I had talks with three or four clubs from the summer onwards and it never materialised and, although I was disappointed, I'm a big believer in fate and when this cropped up, I had one phone call from Mehmet [Dalman, Cardiff chairman] and it was straight away.

"I always want to feel wanted and he told me straight away I was his number one target, the club's number one target, and that goes a long way I think."
Kevin Blackwell will be assistant and Ronnie Jepson first-team coach.
Existing staff members James Rowberry, Martyn Margetson and Lee Southernwood will continue as part of Warnock's back-room team.
Cardiff is Warnock's 15th club as a manager and he says experiences on past visits and the challenge of trying to revive their fortunes will inspire his efforts.
"I've always liked it here. I've always liked getting off the bus," he said.
"Everywhere I go I get stick, but at Cardiffâ€¦ I get on quite well with the Cardiff lads. I'm sure the same people are there by the bus with their autograph books.
"I've always had good banter with the Cardiff people. They are my kind of crowd, blood and guts and all that, which I like.
"If I can get it right for them I know they will get behind me and that's what keeps me going at the moment.
"There's some mouth-watering games coming up too.
"When I looked at the fixture list, it was not one of trepidation, it was one of looking forward to it really because that's the way I am."
The Englishman spent eight seasons in charge of Sheffield United, has twice managed Crystal Palace and QPR, and was also boss of Leeds United.
Former Cardiff defender Danny Gabbidon, who played under Warnock at QPR, said before Warnock's appointment that he "could be a nice fit" to "get the team up and running quickly".
He added: "He's a very good man-manager. He's good at working on a tight budget and getting the right players in. He's also proven in that division."
Trollope's assistant, Lennie Lawrence, and conditioning coach Ryland Morgan have also left the Welsh club.
