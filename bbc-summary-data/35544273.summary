Morgan has also played for Reading, Luton Town, Crewe Alexandra, Southend United, MK Dons, Chesterfield, Oxford United and Woking.
The 32-year-old had a spell with Italian side U.S. Ancona 1905 earlier in the season before signing for Warren Feeney's side.
"The manager is someone I have known for a good number of years," Morgan said.
"I'm hoping that I can now get match fit and help the team progress and push on in the league."
"I feel that I have been playing consistently throughout my career and now I want to push
on and score a few goals during my time here with Newport."
