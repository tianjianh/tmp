A rare first-edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, featuring personal anecdotes and illustrations by author JK Rowling is to go on display in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The original hardback book was annotated by JK Rowling in 2013 to raise money for charity.
It features 43 annotations, including 22 original drawings by the author.
The book will be on display at Edinburgh's Writers' Museum from Thursday until 8 January.
The book includes a sketch of baby Harry asleep on the doorstep of the Dursleys, the author's thoughts on Quidditch, and the Hogwarts Crest featuring a bear rather than a badger as the Hufflepuff house mascot.
Richard Lewis, City of Edinburgh Council's culture convener, said: "This unique first edition features a remarkable glimpse into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
"In it, JK Rowling opens her heart about her characters and creations and makes beautiful illustrations of magical scenes from the series.
"It is a privilege to display this book by one of the world's most popular authors in the city's Writers' Museum.
"The historic building houses rare books and items belonging to some of Scotland's greatest ever writers and is the perfect place to display JK Rowling's classic, annotated, book.
"We are thankful to the private lender, JK Rowling and the Scottish Book Trust for their generous support."
Ms Rowling annotated the book to raise money for her international charity, Lumos, and English Pen, a global network that promotes literature.
