Will Boyde crossed to put Scarlets ahead before Peter Horne's penalty got Glasgow back in the game at the break.
Jonathan Evans sent the hosts 14-3 ahead with a try from the restart and the visitors faced an uphill battle when Pat MacArthur was sin-binned.
Scarlets then drove for the line and Boyde touched down again while Rhys Patchell's kicking sealed the win.
The result means Scarlets leapfrog Cardiff Blues into sixth in the table, while Glasgow remain fourth after their third league loss of the season.
After Boyde's early try, Glasgow fought back and Patchell was forced to pull off a tremendous clearance kick to deny Glasgow's Rory Hughes as he chased his neat chip towards the tryline.
After a dull first half, the game's second period started dramatically as Patchell jinked his way through unopposed to offload to Steffan Evans, who fed Jonathan Evans to cross over.
Glasgow's task was made even harder after MacArthur was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle on James Davies. Patchell kicked the penalty that followed on the way to his 12-point contribution for the hosts.
The visitors were given their second yellow card of the game when lock Brian Alainu'uese, who was making his first Glasgow Warriors start, was sent to the bin for an elbow to the back of Werner Kruger.
Scarlets chased a bonus-point win and were denied a fourth try in the last play of the game when captain Hadleigh Parkes carried the ball into the post but could not ground it over the line.
