Simon Hammersley: Brive win gives Newcastle Falcons boost

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Full-back Simon Hammersley believes Newcastle Falcons' European Challenge Cup win over Brive will give them necessary Premiership momentum.

A late try from the 22-year-old ensured Newcastle preserved their perfect home record in the competition, although they failed to make the quarter-finals.
Falcons are bottom in the Premiership, one point behind London Irish.
"It was mainly a matter of building momentum and we've done that," Hammersley told BBC Newcastle.
"We didn't think it was a dead game going in but obviously with results yesterday we knew unless Connacht slipped up it was pretty much over."
The end of their European campaign leaves Falcons with 10 consecutive Premiership matches, starting with third-placed Harlequins at Kingston Park on Sunday.
"We have got a lot of teams we would fancy ourselves against coming here in the next few weeks," the Hull-born player said.
"They [Harlequins] lost last night to Montpellier, but they are a great team so it's going to be another tough test up here.
"But we're three from three here and unbeaten in the new year here so bring them on."
