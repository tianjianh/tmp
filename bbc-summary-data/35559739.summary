Salford owner Marwan Koukash has said he has learned the need for patience when in charge of a Super League side.

Koukash, 57, took over in 2013 but the Red Devils are yet to finish higher than 10th during his tenure.
"In the first year I came and I thought I could buy the superstars of this game, bring them in, put them together and win the Grand Final," he said.
"That didn't work. What you need is to invest in the future and be patient about that success."
The Red Devils started the 2016 season with a loss at Hull FC, but produced a stunning display to put eight tries past St Helens in a 44-10 win in their first home match of the year.
With 13 new arrivals, head coach Ian Watson and director of rugby Tim Sheens have transformed the squad during the winter.
"It's a belief in the players and we were always confident and we know we've got a good team here," Watson, 39, told BBC Radio Manchester.
"People have challenged our middles saying that they're not good enough - well I think we were more than good enough on Thursday.
"We had a blip last week at Hull and we knew we had to fix that up really quickly - the big thing for us is consistency and getting it week in week out."
