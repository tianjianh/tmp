Tyler Walker: Port Vale sign Nottingham Forest striker on half-season loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale have signed young Nottingham Forest striker Tyler Walker on loan for the rest of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old has made 22 first-team appearances for Forest, and also been out on loan twice.
He scored once in a late-season loan with Burton Albion in 2015-16, helping them to win promotion from League One.
And he scored three goals in his first two games for League Two side Stevenage this term before suffering an injury which kept him out for over two months.
He still ended with four goals from nine appearances for Boro and also has two in seven games for England at Under-20 level.
His arrival follows that of Chris Eagles last week on a short-term deal and midfielder Callum Guy on loan from Championship club Derby County.
Following Saturday's snow-enforced postponement of the game with MK Dons, all three are now expected to make their Vale debuts in Friday's home fixture against Bury.
