[SN]TITLE[SN]
GP and ex government advisor faces misconduct charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish GP and former government advisor is facing charges of misconduct over his treatment of a number of patients, including a child.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Tom Gilhooly runs the Essential Health Clinic in Glasgow which offers alternative treatments for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune conditions.
He has championed the use of low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, organising international conferences on the subject and raising money for research.
Naltrexone is normally used to treat alcoholics.
He became the subject of a BBC investigation in 2011 for offering a controversial vein-widening treatment which was based on unproven theories that MS is caused by vein blockages.
Dr Gilhooly is charged with prescribing low dose naltrexone and prescribing risperidone to a child.
It is also alleged that he failed to refer the child to a specialist service for urgent support.
Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug normally used to treat schizophrenia.
Dr Gilhooly has been a GP in the east end of Glasgow for 22 years where he specialised in addiction medicine.
He developed an interest in alternative treatments for MS and offers private treatment to patients through the Essential Health Clinic, which he set up.
He has acted as an advisor to the Scottish and UK governments on drug misuse.
Dr Gilhooly's case is being heard in Manchester by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS).
Independent tribunals carried out by the MPTS replaced Fitness to Practice hearings held by the General Medical Council as part of reforms designed to increase public confidence in the regulation of doctors.
