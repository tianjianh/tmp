Poles are the biggest migrant group in Scotland, figures show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One in five of the non UK-born population in Scotland is Polish, new figures have shown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK Office for National Statistics report estimated about 86,000 Poles were living in Scotland in 2015.
The next most common nationalities in Scotland were India and the Irish Republic, both with 16,000. Poland was also the top country of birth for migrants living in the UK.
In total, an estimated 393,000 people in Scotland were born outside the UK.
This was an increase of about 12,000 over the previous year - 7.4% of the overall population.
A total of 203,000 of those non UK-born residents were born outside the European Union (EU) (51.7%).
An estimated 295,000 (5.6%) of the usually-resident population of Scotland held non-British nationality, an increase of 13,000 on the previous year. Of those non-British nationals usually resident in Scotland, 113,000 held non-EU nationality (38.3%).
The estimates show a significant difference over the past 10 years in the number of people living in Scotland who were born outside the UK.
In 2005, the figure was estimated to be 221,000 compared with 393,000 in 2015 - an increase of 172,000.
The number of people with non-British nationality living in Scotland was estimated to have grown from 137,000 in 2005 to 295,000 in 2015, an increase of 158,000.
The figures - for the period before Britain voted to leave the EU - differ from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) mid-year population estimates as the ONS excludes students in halls who do not have a parent resident in the UK and people in most other types of communal establishments such as hotels, boarding houses, hostels, care homes, prisons and mobile homes.
