Shaun Walmsley, 28, escaped during a hospital visit last month.
He was getting into a cab with prison officers outside Aintree Hospital on 21 February when he was sprung from custody by two armed men.
The image taken from hospital CCTV shows Walmsley looking "very different" to the picture of him circulating from his conviction, police said.
Det Supt Natalie Perischine said he has "lost a considerable amount of weight".
Police also released an image of a silver Hyundai i10, which was seen in the Fazakerley area following his escape, and asked anyone who recognises it to contact police.
Walmsley is one of four men serving life sentences for the "vicious and savage" stabbing of Anthony Duffy in 2014.
Described as "highly dangerous", he was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years.
Det Supt Perischine asked the public not to approach Walmsley if they see him.
She said Merseyside Police are "working with the National Crime Agency and police forces in Europe and further afield to locate Walmsley."
Earlier this month armed officers arrested four men on suspicion of assisting an offender in Dorset. They were later released "pending a disposal decision", police said.
The men were all from Merseyside - two 24-year-olds, both from Toxteth, a 25-year-old from Maghull, and a 25-year-old from Vauxhall.
