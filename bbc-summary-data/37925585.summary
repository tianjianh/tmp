It took ??1.6m in its opening weekend, but could not topple Doctor Strange or Trolls from the first two spots.
The Marvel film starring Benedict Cumberbatch topped the chart for a second week, taking ??3.4m, while Trolls stayed at number two, with ??2m.
There was another new entry for A Street Cat Named Bob, based on the true story of a homeless man and his cat.
