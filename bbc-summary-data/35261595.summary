[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Passengers on South West Trains have hit out after icy conditions caused delays and cancellations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rail provider said ice in Petersfield, Hampshire, was causing disruption between Havant and Guildford, in Surrey, on Friday.
Commuters took to social media to complain with some saying the firm should have been more prepared.
A spokeswoman said weather forecasts indicated temperatures would not be as cold as they were.
One rail passenger used the hashtag "kidnapped" after being stuck for three hours.
South West Trains had said disruption, which began about 05:00 GMT, was expected until 15:00.
It has since issued an apology and said delays were compounded due to signalling problems between Hilsea and Havant.
