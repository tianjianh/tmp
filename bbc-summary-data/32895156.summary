Water voles reintroduced at Ffrwd Farm Nature Reserve

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Water voles are being reintroduced at a Carmarthenshire nature reserve.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The project at Ffrwd Farm Nature Reserve, Pembrey, is part of a wider ongoing water vole strategy for south Wales.
Natural Resources Wales said the creatures had suffered a huge decline in recent decades as a result of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and predation by American mink.
It is the second release of water voles in the area.
