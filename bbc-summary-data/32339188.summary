They are using their Twitter accounts to "tell the whole story of the PSNI family".
Officers have been explaining what they do, from tackling security alerts to putting escaped donkeys back in fields.
They are regularly updating Twitter throughout Friday.
The PSNI [Police Service of Northern Ireland] has 32 official Twitter accounts used by its district police officers.
They have already been posting plenty of updates, with some more serious than others:
Twitter users can follow the updates by using the #KeepingPeopleSafe hashtag, but police have said they will not be able to have conversations with people.
Ass Ch Con Chris Noble said the aim of the event was to show people that police are "much more than just uniformed officers".
Not only have officers been doing their part for the public, but they have been helping to protect animals too.
They have also been posting some pictures on their various accounts throughout the day.
The PSNI also has a road policing Twitter account where they tweet traffic and travel information:
One of the more unusual tweets came from PSNI Fermanagh:
The accounts also issue advice to people about protecting valuables, traffic information and appeal for witnesses to crimes.
The PSNI said it hoped the event would give people an insight into how public money is being spent.
It also said the Twitter updates would reflect the complexity of policing Northern Ireland in 2015.
