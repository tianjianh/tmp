Middlesbrough showed togetherness with the squad's celebrations after Adam Forshaw's late winner against Reading, says boss Aitor Karanka.

Boro looked to settle for a point after Simon Cox cancelled out Emilio Nsue's opener, but substitute Forshaw netted in injury time to win it.
The win took the Teessiders to the top of the Championship table.
"When Adam scored, once again we were together and the crowd was amazing," Karanka told BBC Tees.
"It was a difficult game, I can understand the frustration [of supporters] when they want us to win the games but they trust these players and together is best way to go about it."
Karanka's side have won their past five games following the Spaniard's absence from the defeat at Charlton on 13 March, when he was contemplating his future.
With that episode resolved, Boro have rediscovered their form to lead the table from Burnley by two points.
"It was our third game at home in a row, and it's always difficult after the QPR game - people already had nine points in their pockets," he said.
"I feel how difficult is to win every game so now we're in a really good position, I'm pleased for them and I couldn't be prouder than I am at this moment."
