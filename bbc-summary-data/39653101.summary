Hibernian v Aberdeen: Graeme and Andrew Shinnie vie for Scottish Cup final place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It won't be brothers in arms for Graeme and Andrew Shinnie as they prepare to face each other in Saturday's Scottish Cup semi-final as rivals.

Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes could even give Graeme the task of marking midfield playmaker Andrew, who is on loan at cup holders Hibernian from Birmingham City, out of the game at Hampden Park.
It will be the first time that the former Inverness Caledonian Thistle team-mates have played against one another in a competitive senior game.
The Aberdeen-born siblings have only been in opposing colours once - when Birmingham faced Caley Thistle in a friendly at a time when Graeme was still operating more regularly at full-back.
But Graeme believes that destiny has played its hand and that facing his older brother on Saturday was "meant to be".
"It just had that feeling about it that it was going to go that way," he said.
"We have had a bit of banter about it. We both know it's a massive occasion for both teams and we both will just be focused on doing well.
"We're both professionals. We both know, when it comes down to the day, we've both got a job to do for our teams."

Andrew, two years the elder at 27, had left Caley Thistle by the time a Highland side featuring his brother lost the Scottish League Cup final to Aberdeen at Celtic Park in 2014.
A year later, Graeme captained Caley Thistle to their first major cup success in the Scottish Cup final against Falkirk.
Andrew was also three months too late in joining Hibs to be able to enjoy the celebrations that accompanied them lifting the same trophy for the first time in 114 years.
Then, in November, Graeme was part of the Dons side that lost this season's League Cup final to Celtic.
The younger Shinnie is all too aware that he could help crush Andrew's dreams of reaching a cup final, while Andrew can destroy his own hopes of a first winner's medal with the Dons.
"The relationship of brothers goes out the window for that 90 minutes," he said. "It's all about doing what we've been doing all season.
"It'll be a different experience but one that can't get in the way of what either of us are trying to do.
"We just need to treat it as a normal game."
Although rivals this weekend, the sibling rivalry has run in the family for a lot longer.
"We were both really competitive - probably one of the worst things for our parents," said Graeme, whose fine strike secured the Dons a place in the semi-final at the expense of Partick Thistle.
Andrew, who can boast one more Scottish Cup goal this season after hitting the net against Bonnyrigg Rose and Hearts, agreed.
"We have always been like that from a young age," said the Hibs midfielder. "Everything we did was to the max.
"We argued quite a lot when we were younger as brothers because we are that competitive, whether it was football or computer games.
"But it made us what we are now - we're winners.
"He's a winner and I like winning as well and it bode well for our futures really."
Any brotherly love will be left in the locker room as both insist that winning comes first, especially when a cup final place is at stake.

"Winning silverware is always the best thing in football," the Dons midfielder explained. "I'm at a club now where it is kind of expected.
"The fans are desperate for us; the players are desperate for it, the management, everyone's desperate for it.
"The whole focus is on the game on Saturday and trying to get through to the final."
Andrew is looking forward to the challenge.
"It's going to be a feisty affair, but you've got to keep your head as well and you've got to keep your composure and play with a bit of quality and that's what's ultimately going to get you there," he suggested.
"Both teams desperately want to be in the final. I know I do and I know Graeme does."
For the brothers, there is happiness that at least one Shinnie will be in the Scottish Cup final.
As for the parents, Graeme suspects: "They'll try find the most neutral seat in Hampden."
