The driver reversed into the woman and her male colleague after the vehicle was spotted in Neachells Lane, Wednesfield, Wolverhampton.
The female officer, who has serious leg injuries, had responded to a break-in at Lyndale Drive at about 04:00 GMT.
A man, 19, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and another man, 21, is being held on suspicion of wounding.
The female police officer, in her 40s, was one of several officers responding to the burglary, where keys to a Ford Fiesta were taken before the car was driven off.
It was spotted 10 minutes later in Neachells Lane, but when the two officers closed in, the driver reversed into the pair, police said.
The female officer, who has served with Wolverhampton Police for seven years, suffered muscle damage and bruising and was taken to hospital. Her colleague was treated for shock and minor injuries.
Insp Peter Haywood, said: "Several members of the public, including a lorry driver and two people commuting to work, came to the aid of the officers. I'd like to thank them for their fantastic support."
