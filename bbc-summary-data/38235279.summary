Aberdeen baby ashes compensation claims deadline to be set

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A deadline for families affected by the baby ashes scandal at Aberdeen's Hazlehead crematorium to lodge compensation claims is to be set.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together at the crematorium and given back to relatives of the adult.
The parents of infants were told there were no ashes.
Families affected will be given a closing date to lodge a claim for compensation. The council has not confirmed when that date will be.
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
It followed similar revelations about Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh, which had been secretly burying baby ashes for decades.
A report into the scandal by Dame Elish Angiolini described the practices as "abhorrent".
The council is working with bereaved families on a memorial.
An interim director was put in place last month at the department criticised over the baby ashes scandal.
Bernadette Marjoram takes over the role held by Pete Leonard, who was responsible for communities, housing and infrastructure.
His duties included overseeing Hazlehead Crematorium.
