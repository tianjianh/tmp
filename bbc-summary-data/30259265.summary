Journeys around Oxford will be improved by up to £50m of investment in the A34, the Department for Transport has said.

A new study will also look at creating an express-link between Oxford and Cambridge via Milton Keynes.
The news came as work begins to prevent flooding on a stretch of the A34 between Chilton and the A4130 Milton Interchange.
Nicola Blackwood, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, described it as "a real breakthrough in tackling congestion".
However, Labour has criticised the plans, saying they were announced previously.
Technology enhancementson the A34, from junction 13 to junction 9, will include CCTV cameras and screens to warn drivers about delays.
There will also be improvements at Peartree and Botley interchanges.
A study will look at linking Oxford and Cambridge by using existing roads and considering the case for filling missing links.
All of the changes were announced in this year's Autumn Statement and are part of a £15bn nationwide programme.
Ms Blackwood, who said she was given the figure of up to £50m by the treasury, said: "Thousands of my constituents are affected by traffic misery on the A34 on a daily basis yet there has been no major investment for over two decades."
But, Labour shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said it was "yet another re-announcement" on road improvements.
A six-month drainage programme has also begun on both carriageways of the A34 between Chilton and the A4130 Milton Interchange.
The Highways Agency said the work would mean fewer unplanned road closures for emergency repairs.
A 50mph speed limit will be in place for the duration of the work, while overnight lane closures will also take place.
