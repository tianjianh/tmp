Jackson's Lane and King Street in Carmarthen are transformed in the proposals, which form part of a master plan for the town.
A new town square with an outdoor LED screen has been proposed for Jackson's Lane, while King Street would become pedestrian-friendly.
Carmarthen Town Regeneration Forum is holding a public consultation on the plans.
It takes place in the former Myrddin Day Centre in John Street, Carmarthen, on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Carmarthenshire council said King Street was a hub for local culture, arts and crafts but that it was dominated by vehicles "which causes a cluttered pedestrian environment".
It has proposed removing vehicles to allow business owners to put tables and chairs on the street, which would make it less of a "thoroughfare to the town centre" and more "of a destination in its own right".
Jackson's Lane is a key route for pedestrians joining King Street, Jackson's Square and Red Street, but the council said it had "no real sense of place".
It plans to create a town square that would be free of vehicles and would become a focal point and meeting place, with shops, cafes, restaurants and the LED screen which could display sporting events, TV and films.
There are also plans to bring Jackson's Square and Chapel Street back to life, where kiosks could be created for new small businesses to open.
Marian Ritson, from Siop Pethau Bychain on King Street, welcomed the proposals.
"For years we've been in discussion with the council with regards to developing King Street, as this is one of the oldest parts of Carmarthen. It's full of independent shops, which gives the town a different feel," she said.
"When people find King Street they come back all the time, but the challenge is to lead them here in the first place."
Dai Jenkins, deputy leader of Carmarthenshire council, said: "A sum of money has been put into the five-year plan - the capital programme - Â£500,000.
"But we have to start the process first, we need to consult with the people of Carmarthen before we can move on."
Council executive board member for regeneration and leisure, councillor Meryl Gravell said: "I would urge Carmarthen residents to take the opportunity to see the exciting proposals for Jackson's Lane and King Street and to tell us what they think of them."
