[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ayrshire man jailed for raping woman in her home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for five years for raping a woman in her own home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Sanders, 50, from Stevenston in Ayrshire, was convicted of raping the 46-year-old on 21 December 2014 after attempting to kiss her.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Sanders went into the woman's Ayrshire home uninvited and refused to take "no" for an answer.
Sanders, who denies the offence, was cleared of two other rapes against the same woman.
Judge Lord Beckett told him: "A charge of rape is a serious crime.
"You attended the complainer's home uninvited. You would not take 'no' for an answer when she asked you to leave.
"You are bigger and stronger than she is and you used your size and strength to rape her.
"The 999 call the court heard showed the anguish and stress you caused to the complainer. You have shown no remorse and you are said to blame your victim for the situation you find yourself in."
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleged that Sanders had also raped her in February and June 2010.
The jury found these two rape charges not proven.
Sanders was placed on the sex offenders register.
