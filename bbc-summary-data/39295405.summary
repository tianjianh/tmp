The 26-year-old, who joined on loan from Italian club Udinese until May, with a view to a permanent deal, was injured making his debut in the 1-0 FA Cup defeat by Millwall in February.
City manager Craig Shakespeare told BBC Radio Leicester: "Our best wishes are with him. It was freak incident.
"He will be back and around the training ground, but won't be playing."
