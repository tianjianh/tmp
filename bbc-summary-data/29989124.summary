Russell Brand has now released his own version of Parklife.

After being mocked on social media for sounding like Phil Daniels from Blur's 1994 hit, Brand has now covered the song.
In it he tackles income inequality, corporations not paying taxes and the "ineffective media".
The Prime Minister David Cameron and leader of UKIP Nigel Farage also get a special mention too.
It was Twitter user Dan Barker who began the Parklife meme after noticing the similarity between Phil Daniels and Russell Brand.
After his tweet was retweeted thousands of times, people began making vine-mashups, posting 'Parklife' in Amazon book reviews and repeatedly replying PARKLIFE! to anything Brand tweeted.
Dan told BBC Newsbeat: "I enjoyed the video and found it pretty funny, though I'm not totally surprised that a week of difficult brainstorming with his vast PR army, and a Hollywood-sized production budget resulted in a funny response to a mild 140-character observation.
"I was surprised the video content is all about politics and class though.
"The tweet that went viral had nothing to do with either - just an observation about his writing style (though I'm sure the state schools I went to in Whitley Bay would love to be compared to Eton, they were sadly lacking that kind of money).
"If I'm honest I think he's done a great job of turning it round from a PR point of view, and hopefully boring people so much with the word 'PARKLIFE!' that it may limit the amount of times people shout it at him in future."
