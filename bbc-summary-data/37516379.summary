The vision for Ebbsfleet, Kent, will be developed around the international railway station over the next 15 years.
Pedestrian bridges and cycleways will link Swanscombe, Northfleet and Greenhithe with the city, alongside eight new urban villages.
A primary school will open in 2017 and more than 30,000 jobs will be created.

The River Thames will also be opened up, with new promenade walks giving the public access to the waterfront in the area for the first time in a century.
Construction on the site, which was once four quarries, has already seen more than 400 new homes built, with work on several hundred more under way.
Ebbsfleet has a stop on the high-speed rail line, which links passengers with central London in 17 minutes and Paris in two hours.
Michael Cassidy, chairman of the Ebbsfleet Development Corporation, said the "exciting vision for Ebbsfleet Garden City is already becoming a reality".
"The pace of growth over the last 12 months has been impressive, with major developers now on site building hundreds of homes," he added.
Open days will be held in October to inform the public about the plans.
