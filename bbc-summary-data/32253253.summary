John Ogston, 54, from the Banff area, died after the crash which happened in Plaidy, near Turriff, at about 07:45 on Thursday.
His wife Lesley said the whole family was "absolutely devastated at the loss of Oor Jocky" who was "born in his leathers" and had a "big heart".
She said motorbikes had been a huge part of his life since he was 16.
"He loved his current job at Fisher Offshore in Oldmeldrum and helped out in the evenings at Lesley's bakery in Whitehills," she said.
"He forced everyone around him not to take life too seriously. His many friends and family will know what a great loss to the world he will be but he will be in our hearts and minds forever."
