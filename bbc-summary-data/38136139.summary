[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Elliot Daly has been banned for three weeks for the dangerous tackle which led to him being sent off in Saturday's victory over Argentina.

Less than five minutes into the match, Daly took out Leonardo Senatore in mid-air, becoming only the fifth England player to be sent off in a Test.
A statement issued by World Rugby said the disciplinary committee had found that the Wasps wing "acted recklessly".
Daly, 24, will miss Saturday's international against Australia.
He was initially given a six-week ban, but the punishment was halved after the player acknowledged wrongdoing.
He also apologised to Senatore, who took no further part in the match after the incident.
England went on to win their 13th match in a row by  beating Argentina 27-14, despite Daly's red card. Victory over Australia on Saturday would equal England's record of 14 consecutive wins, set under Sir Clive Woodward in 2003.
