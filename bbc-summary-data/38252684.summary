Two police officers who were pursuing a car reported as stolen which crashed killing a woman and a boy are being investigated by the police watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rozanne Cooper, 34, and Makayah McDermott, 10, were knocked down by the car in Penge, south-east London.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had questioned both officers under caution.
The Met said the officers had been placed on restrictive duties while the investigation is carried out.
A spokesperson for the IPCC said it had "met with and updated the families involved" but could not comment further because the driver of the car is being prosecuted.
The IPCC automatically investigates a police pursuit which ends in someone being killed.
Police drivers have to be able to show a pursuit was necessary to protect life, prevent or detect crime, or to apprehend an offender.
Joshua Dobby, 23, has admitted causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving, but denied two counts of manslaughter.
He will face trial on 27 February 2017.
