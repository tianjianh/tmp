[SN]TITLE[SN]
Trial of seven 'crash for cash' accused begins at court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trial of seven people accused of involvement in a so-called "crash for cash" scheme in south Wales has begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jurors at Cardiff Crown Court were told the trial involved six separate insurance claims between 2009 and 2011, totalling more than Â£144,000.
The court heard "virtually" all the vehicles involved in the alleged collisions were recovered to the same garage, and different accounts were given for the alleged accidents.
All seven deny conspiracy to defraud.
One defendant also denies perverting the course of justice.
Prosecuting barrister Christopher Clee QC told the court that all seven were involved in a "crash for cash" scheme which involved "insurance fraud" following road traffic collisions "that did not occur".
"Not once" were the emergency services called to the scene of the alleged collisions, he added.
The case continues.
