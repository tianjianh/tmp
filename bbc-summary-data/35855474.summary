Vincent Ryan killing: Man arrested in Dublin murder inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man in his 30s has been arrested by police investigating the murder of a dissident republican in Dublin last month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vincent Ryan was shot a number of times in Finglas, north Dublin, on 29 February.  He died later in hospital.
The 25-year-old Dubliner was a brother of the alleged Real IRA leader Alan Ryan, who was shot dead in 2012.
The man was arrested on Saturday.  A total of three men are now in custody in relation to the investigation.
Mr Ryan's murder is believed to be connected to a feud between dissidents and criminals in Dublin which also led to his brother's murder three and a half years ago.
The Ryan family have said that Vincent Ryan was not an IRA member.
