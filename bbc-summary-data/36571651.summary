Wales won group B, securing their place in the final 16 of the tournament.
Aaron Ramsey and Neil Taylor gave Wales an early lead, while Gareth Bale scored in the second half.
The game had been designated high-risk after violence in Marseille and Lille, but there have been no reported incidents.
Fans were in fine voice at the fanzone in Toulouse, chanting "we are top of the league" as phones were checked for the latest updates from England's game against Slovakia which ended in a 0-0 draw.
At the final whistle, arms and beers were thrown into the air in celebration of the win and delighted fans were quick to praise their team's efforts.
Stephen Palmer, 49, of Port Talbot, said: "My reaction to the game is... marvellous.
"We're through, that's all that matters. We're through and I'm staying in France for another week."
Samantha Caniff, 28, of Tredegar, watched the game in the Toulouse fanzone and said: "All the family watched the game, my mum and the baby. We stayed out and really enjoyed it."
