[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kilmarnock 1-1 Inverness Caledonian Thistle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Souleymane Coulibaly's stunning strike against Inverness Caledonian Thistle was not enough to give Kilmarnock back-to-back home league victories.

Coulibaly looked to have won the game as he slalomed inside the penalty area before firing home after 73 minutes.
But Gary Warren rose to head a powerful equaliser six minutes from time.
Kilmarnock's Nathan Tyson went closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half, but Josh Meekings did superbly to clear the striker's lob off the line.
Coulibaly's goal prevented Caley Thistle recording their first top-flight clean sheet in 18 games at Rugby Park since April 2005.
But Killie, who won 2-0 against Dundee in their last home game, could not see it out in search of their first back-to-back league wins at Rugby Park since March 2015.
And the point ensured Caley Thistle stay ahead of Partick Thistle at the foot of the Scottish Premiership.
Coulibaly has sometimes been labelled a "luxury player" because of his lack of involvement at times during games.
That, though, would be harsh as whenever the 21-year-old manages to get on the ball near the opponents' goal, defenders must be wary.
The Ivory Coast-born striker found the net for the 11th time this season with another piece of magic.
When he picked the ball up around 25 yards out on the wing, there appeared to be little hope of an effort on target.
However, Coulibaly had different thoughts and, after twisting his way past three Caley Thistle defenders, he unleashed a right-foot shot that beat goalkeeper Owain Fon Williams at his near post.
Warren has more than proven his worth to Caley Thistle over the past few years with his at-times excellent game reading at the heart of the defence.
However, he can also pose a real threat up front and notched his opening goal of the season late on to grab a point.
Greg Tansey floated in a free-kick that was met by Warren and the Englishman bulleted a header beyond goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald to snatch a point that at times looked highly unlikely.
Referee Nick Walsh is a new name for many who watch the Scottish Premiership and he did little at Rugby Park to enhance his reputation.
At times, his decision-making at best looked poor, with Killie manager lee Clark on his knees at one point after one ruling in the first half.
However, the man in the middle could not be blamed for a pretty dreadful first half by both teams with a point apiece was just about the right result.
Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark: "We deserved to win the game. Totally dominated the first half.
"Granted, Inverness came back into the game in spells.
"We score a terrific goal through Souleymane again, but we defended a set-play very very poorly and that has cost us all three points and another real good win at home.
"I'm frustrated, disappointed, but the work ethic of the players was terrific as we pressed really well.
"There are lots of positives to take from the game. Young Ian Wilson was outstanding all game. Another full debut and he can be really pleased."
Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Richie Foran: "Definitely happy with a point away from home. It's always a good result away from home.
"Kilmarnock were the better team in the first half. They put a lot of balls into the box, but we dealt with them really well.
"In the second half, we were the better team. We had a great chance with Alex Fisher.
"You also have to look at their goal. My goalkeeper and players tell me it was a blatant hand ball to control the ball. So we didn't get that decision.
"It should have been our free-kick but he goes and sticks it in the top corner. It's took a fantastic finish for them to score against us."
