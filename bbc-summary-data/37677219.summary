After climbing initially, the Dow Jones then went into reverse and was 23.93 points lower at 18,114.45.
The wider S&P 500 index dipped 2.70 points to 2,130.28 while the Nasdaq fell 7.66 points to 5,206.50.
Shares in toymaker Hasbro rose 7% after its latest results beat forecasts thanks to strong demand for Disney Princess, Frozen and Trolls dolls.
Profits for the third quarter of the year climbed to $257.8m from $207.6m a year earlier, with revenues 14.2% higher at $1.68bn.
Third quarter profits also rose at Bank of America, although shares in the bank were little changed in early trade.
Profits rose 6.6% to $4.45bn with revenues up 3% to a better-than-expected $21.64bn.
Like its rivals JP Morgan and Citigroup the bank benefitted from a recovery in bond trading, which was partly triggered by the UK's Brexit vote. Profits have also been boosted by cost cutting across all units of the bank.
