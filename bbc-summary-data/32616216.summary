Olympian Bryan Clay removes daughter's loose tooth with javelin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Just what does an Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete do with his spare javelins once he's retired?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bryan Clay has a novel answer.
The 2008 Olympic champion, 35, put his to productive use by helping to remove his daughter's loose tooth.
A quick internet search on removing loose teeth suggests eating chewy food or wiggling it with your tongue.
Even quicker is attaching it to a javelin and launching it across a field. Although it helps to know how.
The American posted a video of the feat on his Twitter page with the heading: "What you use javelins for once you're retired."
An Olympic javelin weighs around 800g and can reach speeds approaching 70mph on release, so we couldn't possibly put you through watching the clip in full.
The 2010 heptathlon world champion said his daughter had been "wiggling it all day until it was hanging by a thread just so she could do something cool to get it out".
He added: "Don't worry, the tooth is safely under her pillow!"
Even more importantly, his daughter looked pretty unfazed after seeing the offending tooth launched a good 30 metres across a field.
