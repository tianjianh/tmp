Nicola Rees, 51, hit Gregory Flowers, from Crynant, near Neath, when she pulled into oncoming traffic on the A4019 in Aberdulais in October, 2013.
Rees, of Abercrave, Powys, admitted causing death by careless driving.
A judge at Swansea Crown Court handed her a 14-month suspended jail term and banned her from driving for 18 months on Thursday.
The court heard that Rees overtook a taxi without checking for oncoming traffic before she hit the 40-year-old's Suzuki motorbike on the Dulais Valley road.
Judge Paul Thomas said that a brief moment of "uncharacteristically poor driving" by Rees caused Mr Flowers's death.
