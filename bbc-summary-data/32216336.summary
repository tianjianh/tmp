[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Becky, 16, was reported missing on 19 February. Body parts were found at a house in the Barton Hill area of Bristol on 2 March.
The inquest, at Flax Bourton, was told Becky's body was identified by her DNA but no details were revealed about how she died.
Stepbrother Nathan Matthews, 28, from Warmley, is charged with her murder.
Mr Matthews has yet to enter a plea and a provisional trial date has been set for October.
His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, is charged with perverting the course of justice.
Four other defendants, Jaydene Parsons, 23; James Ireland, 23; and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, have been charged with assisting an offender.
The inquest was adjourned until the end of the criminal proceedings with a review after five months.
Earlier on Wednesday details were released of Becky's funeral.
It will take place on 17 April, at 11:00 BST, at St Ambrose Church in the Whitehall area of the city.
A notice in the Bristol Post said the church was reserved for family and close friends but the service would be relayed to mourners outside.
Afterwards there will be a private family burial.
