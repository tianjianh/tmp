[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town A-A Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Referee Oliver Langford was forced to call off Swindon's home game with Bristol Rovers due to adverse weather conditions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pitch was deemed to be unplayable in the 60th minute, with the game goalless, after the pitch became severely waterlogged.
Langford conducted a pitch inspection 20 minutes after taking the two sides off and, with the rain still pouring down, he called the game off.
Defender James Sendells-White headed against the woodwork for the hosts early on and Chris Lines sent an acrobatic effort wide for Rovers.
Yaser Kasim and Luke Norris both saw efforts saved by Kelle Roos, leaving it goalless when torrential rain intervened.
