It was found at North Queen Street on Tuesday morning and was declared a "viable device".
The police have now launched an attempted murder investigation.
Det Ch Insp Peter Montgomery said it was "lucky" that no officers or members of the public were hurt.
"This incident also caused massive inconvenience, disruption and upset for the local community of north Belfast," he said.
During the operation, a number of families had to leave their homes and several roads in the area were closed.
Police have said they want to speak to the driver of a white van that was seen in North Queen Street just before midnight on Monday 8 August.
Det Ch Insp Montgomery added: "I am appealing for anyone who noticed any activity in the North Queen Street area, close to Spamount Street, between Monday evening and Tuesday morning."
