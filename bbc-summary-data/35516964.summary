Spanish police have arrested seven people with suspected links to so-called Islamic State (IS) and other jihadist groups, officials say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suspects were held in raids in the cities of Valencia and Alicante and in Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta.
They provided logistical support for terrorist activities in Iraq and Syria, police say.
They say the alleged leader of the cell was also asked by IS to supply women for militants in the two countries.
Four of those arrested are Spanish nationals of Jordanian, Moroccan and Syrian origin. Another two are Syrian and Moroccan citizens.
The authorities did not provide details about the seventh suspect.
The investigation - which is still ongoing - was launched in 2014 into what police describe as "foreign structures" of IS on Spanish soil.
