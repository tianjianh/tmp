World number six Judd Trump made light work of both a cold and 124th seed Hammad Miah to progress to the second round of the UK Championship in York.

The 2011 winner hit breaks of 77, 64 and 75 to seize control at 3-0 on his way to a 6-1 win against the Egyptian.
Trump, 26, said: "I'm just happy to get through. I feel a bit ill and have not been able to practise much, but I've a three-day break now so should be fine."
There were also wins for Shaun Murphy, Mark Williams and Joe Perry.
Trump, who faces Stuart Carrington in the second round, added: "Hammad beat me at one of the PTC events this season, so I knew he could play a bit.
"A lot of people have raised there game against me this season, but it's still not been a bad season. I have had a couple of early defeats but I feel like I am playing well."
World number four Murphy was at his ruthless best in the afternoon session at the York Barbican, closing out a 6-1 victory over Ashley Hugill.
Murphy hit a century on his first visit in the opening frame and the 2008 champion barely gave his 21-year-old opponent a sniff after that.
"I played well. I was pretty tight and didn't give him much chance to get going," Murphy told BBC Sport.
In the morning session, Welsh veteran Williams went 4-0 ahead against Hamza Akbar, Pakistan's only professional player, but struggled before getting over the line 6-4.
The afternoon's play saw world number 11 Perry record an untroubled 6-1 success over veteran James Wattana, while Ali Carter also eased through, finishing off his 6-4 win over Alfie Burden with a stylish ton in the final frame.
Matthew Stevens, the 2003 winner, suffered a shock 6-5 defeat against 89th seed Chris Wakelin.
