[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inter Milan suffered a fourth defeat in five Serie A games as they were beaten by Sampdoria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club's owners said boss Frank de Boer's job was "100% safe" during the week but a defeat at Samp will not help the Dutchman.
Sampdoria's Edgar Barreto and Inter midfielder Marcelo Brozovic both hit the woodwork before Fabio Quagliarella scored the only goal from 12 yards out.
Rodrigo Palacio almost scored an injury-time equaliser but hit the bar.
Inter - whose only wins in October were against Southampton and Joe Hart's Torino - are now only above 12th-placed Sampdoria on goal difference.
Earlier on Sunday, Roma drew 0-0 at Empoli, meaning they are now four points behind Serie A leaders Juventus.
Empoli, who have scored two goals in 11 league games this season, frustrated the visitors, who had Mohamed Salah booked for diving in injury time when his shirt had been pulled.
AC Milan moved up to third behind Roma with a 1-0 win over Pescara, Giacomo Bonaventura scoring the only goal.
Crotone picked up their first ever Serie A win as they beat Chievo 2-0.
Lazio beat Sassuolo 2-1, and Atalanta earned a 3-0 win over Genoa in Sunday afternoon's other Italian top-flight games.
