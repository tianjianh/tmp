He told the British LGBT Awards on Friday evening via a video message: "It's so important to be proud of the person you are."
The Duke of Cambridge was named "straight ally of the year" and was among several celebrities given awards.
TV presenter Clare Balding and diver Tom Daley were also named winners.
Prince William, who appeared on the cover of gay magazine Attitude last year, made the video message ahead of the ceremony in London's Grand Connaught Rooms.
In the video, he said: "In recent years I've become passionate about what we can do to protect people from bullying, particularly online.
"I have encountered a number of tragic stories about LGBT young people who have sadly felt unable to cope with the abuse and discrimination they face in their lives."
He added: "It is 2017, and nobody should be bullied for their sexuality, or for any other reason."
The awards, in their sixth year, recognise individuals and organisations which promote equality for lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual people. Among this year's winners were:
Comedian Alan Carr, who presented the awards, said: "So many brilliant people have won awards and there were some very special moments."
Sarah Garrett, who co-founded the awards, praised Prince William for speaking out against homophobic bullying.
"Prince William has used his position to promote diversity," she said.
"His message will resonate and offer hope to young people around the world who have faced discrimination because of their sexuality."
