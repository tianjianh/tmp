Chris May, 28, has been missing from his home in Kelevdon, Essex, for more than a fortnight.
Essex Police said Mr May's car was found in Fairstead near a popular area for geocaching, a treasure hunt where participants use GPS devices to search for hidden boxes.
The force wants to speak to geocachers who were in the area on 25 May.
"They may have information which could help the inquiry," a police spokeswoman said.
Det Ch Insp Marina Ericson said she had "fears that something might have happened to him, criminally or otherwise".
"He may have become ill, but we have done extensive searches around the area where his car was found. I have a high level of confidence that he's not there," she said.
Mr May's family has been putting up hundreds of posters and using social media to try to find him.
His mother, Lorraine May, said she just wanted to know he was safe.
"Even if he can't come home, or he doesn't want to come home - we just need to know he's alright."
