Six Nations: Scotland are favourites, says England coach Jones

England coach Eddie Jones says Scotland will start as favourites when the two sides meet at Murrayfield in next week's Six Nations opening round.

Scotland's World Cup performances and the fact they have a settled side give them the advantage, according to Jones.
"We've only had six training sessions together so there is an enormous pressure on Scotland to perform and not so much on us," he said.
"The bookies might have us as favourites but Scotland have to be."
Scotland have lost their last seven Six Nations games.
Their only win in their last 12 championship games was a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome in February 2014.
They have not beaten England, runners-up for the last four years, since 2008.
The sides meet for the Calcutta Cup on Saturday, 6 February (16:50 GMT).
Scotland, coached by Vern Cotter, reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup, losing narrowly to Australia, while hosts England surprisingly bowed out in the group stages.
England's displays ultimately cost Stuart Lancaster his job and led to former Australia and Japan coach Jones taking over.
