[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gary Timoney had parked the Mercedes estate near a CCTV camera before a failed Glasgow petrol station robbery where he had appeared to have a gun.
He had later made off with Â£6,296 from a bank in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire.
The 41-year-old was given a four and half year jail sentence after pleading guilty at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The court heard how police discovered the only car matching the description, registered in Glasgow, belonged to Timoney.
Further checks showed images of him on Facebook with pictures of the car.
Timoney, from Ryehill Road, Barmulloch in Glasgow, had gone to Balmore petrol station on 2 August and exposed the handle of what appeared to be a handgun.
One of the staff pressed a panic alarm prompting him to leave.
Five hours later he went to the Royal Bank of Scotland in Stonelaw Road and made demands for money.
He had warned staff: "Don't do anything stupid, don't press any buttons."
He told one of the bank tellers: "I'm so sorry, it's a desperate time. Let me see your hands. Don't do anything silly, it's not worth your life."
Lord Boyd of Duncansby said that he accepted that it was an imitation firearm involved in the attempted robbery at the petrol station.
The judge said testimonials suggested the offences were out of character and that they were driven by drug debt.
