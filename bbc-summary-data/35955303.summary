The Breffni men beat promotion rivals Galway 1-16 to 1-12 to finish runners-up to Division Two winners Tyrone.
The lads have taken a bit of criticism in the media because of the lack of senior success after the exploits of our Under-21s," said boss Hyland.
"You have to give them time to mature and develop and I believe they are."
Cavan scored an early goal through Jack Brady in Sunday's match but Patrick Sweeney quickly netted Galway's reply after the ball had come off an upright.
With Gearoid McKiernan putting in a superb display, Cavan racked up six unanswered points before the break.
Despite having Liam Buchanan sent off, they ran out four-point winners.
"Galway put us under pressure in the second half but our lads responded to it," added Hyland.
"It was a winner takes all match and there was a Championship feel about it.
"Roscommon have proved you can go up from Division Two and compete quite well and that is what we want to do."
Cavan will play Tyrone in the Division Two final at Croke Park on Sunday, 24 April.
