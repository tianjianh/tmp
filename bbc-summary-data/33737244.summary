[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The man accused of murdering nine black churchgoers last month in Charleston, South Carolina, has pleaded not guilty on more than 33 federal charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twenty-one-year old Dylann Roof, who is white, wanted to plead guilty on all counts according to his lawyer.
His lawyer, David Bruck, said he would not enter guilty pleas for Mr Roof until prosecutors determined whether they would seek the death penalty.
US Judge Bristow Marchant entered the not guilty plea on all counts.
Mr Roof appeared in the courtroom shackled. He was silent except for a few "yes" responses to the judge's inquiries.
Church representatives and the family members of victims of the 17 June attack also spoke briefly.
The charges against Mr Roof include hate crimes, weapons charges and obstructing the practice of religion.
Police have said the shooting was racially motivated and Roof has been linked to a website featuring racist writings.
Mr Roof also faces charges from the state of South Carolina, including nine counts of murder.
