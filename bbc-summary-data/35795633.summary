Exeter City's game with Carlisle United was halted for more than an hour after smoke was seen coming from the back of a stand at St James Park.
Hundreds of supporters were told to leave the Stagecoach stand at around 15:10 GMT and congregated on the pitch.
The club said police made an arrest at the stadium and have taken the suspect into custody.
