Police investigating the murder of a 72-year-old in Saltcoats last month are trying to trace a man seen riding a BMX cycle close to the scene of the attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Malcolm Ballantyne was found at his home in the North Ayrshire town's Glebe Place on 21 August.
Det Ch Insp Gary Cunningham said CCTV images showed a man on a BMX near Glebe Place between 02:20 and 02:40 on the day Mr Ballantyne was found.
The cyclist then appears to head back towards the town centre.
The man was described as white, 18 to 30, of medium build and between 5ft 6in and 5ft 9in.
He was wearing a dark hooded top and dark trousers.
Police said it was possible that some parts of the bike or wheel trim were fluorescent yellow.
DCI Cunningham said: "It is important that we speak to this man as he may have information which could help with our ongoing inquiry into the death of Malcolm Ballantyne."
