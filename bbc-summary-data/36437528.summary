Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Rot-Weiss Oberhausen will make Sweden striker king

Zlatan Ibrahimovic could become king of Oberhausen if he signs for the German city's fourth-tier football club.

The striker, 34, is considering offers after leaving Paris St-Germain but few will be as creative as what Rot-Weiss Oberhausen have put forward.
The club says the striker's signature on a two-year contract would see the city introduce a monarchy that Ibrahimovic will head, while a local beer will be renamed to feature his name.
Sweden captain Ibrahimovic is known to be a confident operator, so could a seat on a newly-formed throne tempt him?
If this is not enough, a local swimming pool - which closed over 20 years ago - would again be filled with water and opened for the former Barcelona player whenever he needs it.
In a statement, the club referred to their target as "God" and confirmed they have "made an offer" featuring an "attractive package".
After finishing fifth last season, Oberhausen are in the market for "a powerful forward who's good in the air" and Ibrahimovic - who scored 156 times in 180 games at PSG - fits the bill.
"In a football province like Oberhausen, there are a few things which other places wouldn't have," club president Hajo Sommers told German broadcaster Sport1.
"If he wants to expand his horizons, let him come."

Rot-Weiss Oberhausen have also offered to construct a new stand using materials sourced from a Swedish retailer if Ibrahimovic moves to the city and Sommer even agreed to pick his man up from the airport.
This chauffeur service once worked for Manchester United in their pursuit of Dimitar Berbatov and the Red Devils - heavily linked with Ibrahimovic - may well need to again pull out all the stops if they are to acquire the former AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus front man.
United can of course offer average attendances in excess of 75,000 compared to the 2,100 Oberhausen pulled in last season, not to mention sizeable financial initiatives.
But crucially, they are yet to put forward a 'king of Manchester' proposal.
"In the coming days the player will decide. We are cautiously optimistic that his decision will be positive," concluded the German minnows.
