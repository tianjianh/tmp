[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prince Charles and Camilla to visit Australia and NZ

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla are to visit Australia and New Zealand in November, his office says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The trip includes a birthday barbeque in Western Australia for the heir to the British throne, who is turning 67.
The pair will also meet new Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull, once the public face of the country's republican movement.
Their 12-day tour will take in 12 different towns and cities across Australia and New Zealand.
Charles and Camilla arrive in the New Zealand capital Wellington on 4 November.
They will then travel around Australia between 10 and 15 November, visiting Adelaide and Tanunda, Canberra, Sydney, Albany and Perth.
It will be the 15th time the Prince of Wales has visited Australia.
His son Prince William and his wife Kate proved a hit with Australians when they visited last year to show off their baby son.
