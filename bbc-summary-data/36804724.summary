The coastguard was alerted to the emergency at about 12:15 BST on Thursday, when the pleasure craft Le Babe hit rocks on Puffin Island.
The RNLI inshore lifeboat from Beaumaris and the all-weather boat from Moelfre were called out.
A passing sightseeing boat helped pull the two onboard Le Babe to safety.
The rescue attempts and the stricken vessel were captured on camera by Laura Heywood, who praised the RNLI volunteers: "Excellent work by all," she said.
However, attempts to tow the boat of rocks on Thursday failed.
"They were unable to recover the vessel yesterday. The pleasure craft has suffered some serious damage," said an official at Holyhead Coastguard station.
The coastguard said there had also been some minor pollution caused by a fuel leakage.
Huw Jones, of environment body Natural Resources Wales, said there was no reason to believe there was any threat of significant pollution but fishing firms in the Menai Strait and Conwy Bay had been advised and the situation would be monitored.
A team of salvage experts will attempt to recover the damaged boat later on Friday.
