Steven Williams produced a star-studded congratulations video for his wedding to bride Ceri last month, with the help of Twitter.

Steven, 29, followed celebrities on the social networking site and asked them to send in video messages.
Stars from, among others, TV series Breaking Bad, Wales' rugby captain Sam Warburton and weatherman Derek Brockway were among those who said yes.
The 12-minute video was a highlight of the couple's Gower wedding last month.
Betsy Brandt from Breaking Bad, comedian Matt Lucas, broadcaster Jonathan Ross, actor Matthew Rhys, singer John-Owen Jones and ex-Scarlets rugby player Stephen Jones are among the stars who wished the couple good luck.
Neighbours' Dr Karl Kennedy (actor Alan Fletcher), and Everton and former Swansea City manager Roberto Martinez are also in the video.
It has attracted nearly 4,000 hits on YouTube.
Steven, who works for a volunteering charity, spent about a year pulling together the surprise "wedding project" for his bride who he met three and a half years ago when they both worked at the Wales Millennium Centre.
Steven, originally from Llanrug, near Caernarfon, set up a dedicated Twitter account and started following several dozen celebrities.
"Unlikely enough, quite a few of them followed me and asked what it was all about, " he said.
"I tried to keep it to about three tweets a week, but I didn't want to be overzealous. I just asked them to give me a bit of help and sent them a message to say what was going on.
"They either said yes or unfollowed me."
Guests at the reception, at the King Arthur Hotel in Gower on 31 January, also heard from rock star Ricky Wilson, BBC Wales weatherman Derek Brockway and Welsh rugby legend Adam Jones.
"He told me he was going to do something but I didn't know it was going to be such a surprise," said Ceri, 27, from Llanelli.
"I thought it was amazing and I couldn't believe it. But 10 minutes later it was still on, I was absolutely stunned."
The couple are now enjoying a three week honeymoon in the US.
"I put it up on Facebook and I don't think I've seen anything that has been like or commented on so much," said Steven.
"It was all for Ceri but it was nice to get so many different reactions."
