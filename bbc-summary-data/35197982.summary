Police chiefs in Belgium have reportedly launched an internal investigation into claims soldiers and police officers held an orgy while colleagues hunted for terror suspects.

Two policewomen and eight soldiers are said to have engaged in a sex party at a police station in the Brussels neighbourhood of Ganshoren.
The city was in lockdown over fears of a Paris-style attack at the time.
Soldiers slept at the police station for two weeks during the operation.
"When they left, they organised a small party to thank the police in the area," police spokesman, Johan Berckmans, told Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure (in French).
"We have launched an investigation to find out what exactly happened."
Speaking to De Standaard (in Dutch), the spokesman said 15 to 20 soldiers had been sleeping at the Ganshoren police station during two weeks in November so they did not have to travel so far at the end of their shift.
The police station was near Molenbeek, where anti-terror raids had been taking place.
Mr Berckmans said an internal investigation was launched after allegations of an orgy were reported by La Derniere Heure on Tuesday.
The Belgian capital was on the highest level of alert last month after the Paris attacks that left 130 people dead.
Schools, shops and the Metro stayed closed for days, and troops were deployed as anti-terror officers searched for suspects connected to the mass killings.
