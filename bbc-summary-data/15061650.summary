Wildlife experts in the Isle of Man have issued a seal pup warning ahead of the annual breeding season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officials from the Manx Wildlife Trust said the pups may look harmless but can be aggressive if approached.
The first pup to be born this season was recently spotted by wardens on the Calf of Mann.
A spokesman from the trust said mothers have been known to abandon their pups if they are unduly disturbed by members of the public.
He added: "It's important to keep dogs away from them too.
"It is usual for the mothers to leave them alone for a while on the beach, so there is no need to be alarmed if they appear to be on their own, their mum is probably not far away."
The Wildlife Trust is currently carrying out a monitoring programme to gain more insight into the Grey Seal population around the Manx coastline.
Anyone concerned about a pup is asked to contact the Manx Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA).
