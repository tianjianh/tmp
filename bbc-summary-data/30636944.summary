Aneurin Bevan health board said people should not go to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital or Abergavenny's Nevill Hall Hospital's "extremely busy" A&E departments unless it is an emergency.
People are also being asked not to visit patients if they have had diarrhoea, vomiting, colds or flu.
One Newport GP practice saw 75 patients before 11.30 GMT on Tuesday. It would usually see 50 in a whole morning.
