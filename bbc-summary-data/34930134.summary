Five Irish people have died in Western Australia this week, according to a charity that helps to bring home the bodies of people who die abroad.

The news comes as tributes have been paid to two Northern Ireland men killed on a building site in Perth.
Joseph McDermott of Omagh, County Tyrone, and Gerard Bradley from near Macosquin, County Londonderry, were working on an apartment block.
Reports suggest a concrete slab fell from a crane.
Friends and family of the two men have been describing their shock, following the accident on Wednesday.
Mr Bradley's brother, Gregory, said: "What happened in Australia this week has come as a tremendous shock to our family and friends and to those of the McDermott family, whose grief we share.
"It is impossible to describe the hurt and loss we are all feeling now.
"Gerard was one of the happiest people you could ever meet.
"He was a wonderful son, grandson, brother and friend and whilst his death will leave a great void in all our lives, he will leave us with some wonderful memories.
Mr McDermott worked for 10 years at the Silverbirch Hotel in Omagh, and his former manager, Carla Hosie, said he was "a massive part of our working lives here".
"He was such a vivacious character - he was a cheeky charmer who got away with everything because he was so charming.
"He practically grew up here with the guys, and it's just simply devastating."
Matthew Sweeney, who worked with Mr McDermott for two years, said: "Joe was always kind of the head barman even before he got the title, and as soon as a shift started he'd come in and make everyone smile straight away and feel at home.
"He was here 10 years and finally built up the money and courage to go off to Australia, and from what we heard, he was having a ball - it just breaks your heart."
The owner of a bar in Perth where Mr Bradley had worked has spoken of his shock at the accident.
"He was a good mate and a good employee," said Paul North.
"He was a great representative, not just of Ireland, but of Northern Ireland - we're all devastated."
Floral tributes have been left at the building site where the two men worked, and David Dobbs, the chief executive of Jaxon Construction, has visited it.
Colin Bell, who helped to set up the The Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust after his son, Kevin, died in New York, said it was a difficult time.
"I'm sure the families are devastated, and it's just the feeling of helplessness and distance," he said.
"I'm sure they feel like they should be able to do something but they have to wait and see what people on that side can do."
The Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust was set up just over two years ago by the Bell family from Newry, County Down, after the 26-year-old was killed in a suspected hit-and-run in New York in June 2013.
On Saturday, Alan Haughey, 28, from Craigavon was killed in a car crash at Kilgoorlie in Western Australia, and Mr Bell said five people from the island of Ireland had died in the area in the space of a week.
"There was a young lad who fell off a ladder, that young man who was killed in a car crash and a young girl who contracted a virus and all of her organs shut down," he said.
Repatriating bodies can cost several thousand pounds and it can be a lengthy and distressing process, but Mr Bell said he understood that the construction firm that Mr McDermott and Mr Bradley worked for had offered to pay to bring them home.
Liz O'Hagan of the Claddagh Association, a group that supports Irish people during times of crisis and trauma in Western Australia, said the deaths have brought "a sense of devastation" to the ex-pat community in Perth.
"I've never witnessed this level of grief and devastation before," she said.
"It's estimated that over 75% of Irish people here are connected to the construction industry in some way, and so people have come out from across Western Australia, offering to help in any way, because they want to look after their fellow Irish.
"By the sheer nature of the tragedy this week and the fact that it was a workplace accident, it has attracted huge attention locally.
"But there's this comforting support and warmth in the midst of the devastation, because people are so affected and they want to join forces and say prayers in some instances."
The Claddagh Association has been offering support to the families of Mr McDermott and Mr Bradley.
Liz explained that most of the people the charity deals with are young, without a solid support system, which compounds their grief.
"For some, this might be the first real experience of this kind of bereavement. So we keep an eye on them and encourage them to look out for each other."
Meanwhile, there are plans for a church service in Perth next week, followed by a wake and a fundraiser for the two men who died at the building site.
Fr Brendan Mulhall, parish priest of St Malachy's in Coleraine, said he had spoken to relatives of Mr Bradley.
"It goes without saying that they're devastated, but they are aware and thankful for the support of so many people who have been expressing their sympathy and condolence," he said.
"I've heard so many things about him today and all of them positive.
"He was a very popular, kind, caring, generous young man with a great future ahead of him, and it's just so sad that this has been snuffed out by this awful tragedy."
