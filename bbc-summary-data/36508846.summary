Edinburgh-based Payne, who won silver at the 2008 Beijing Games, required a top-nine result in Portugal.
China's Xin Xin took victory, finishing the 10km race in one hour 55.12 seconds, with Payne 0.8 seconds behind.
Stirling-based Danielle Huskisson was ninth but misses out with only one athlete qualifying from each nation.
Payne, who was fourth at London 2012, told BBC Sport: "It totally was emotional and hasn't really sunk in, but I'm definitely going to cry later - tears of happiness.
"I mean I have put so much into this last four years and I'm so happy that it's all paid off in the end.
"Coming fourth at a home Olympics was the worst place to come and I took a year out after that, but I just decided at one point I needed to fully commit to it. Getting back into training was hard, but I have loved the journey - even today when I was elbowed in the face!
"Everything I've done is to get prepared to stand on the podium in Rio. I'll be doing everything that I can to make that happen."
The men's event will take place over the same course in Setubal on Sunday at 15:30 BST.
British Swimming already has Jack Burnell as a consideration for nomination to Team GB after he finished fifth in the 10km event at last year's World Championships.
