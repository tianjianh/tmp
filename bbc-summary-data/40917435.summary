Caroline Hope, who was 37 and from Clydebank, had been undergoing cancer treatment at a Turkish hospital when she became infected.
She arrived back in Glasgow by private plane last month after campaigners raised funds for a medical evacuation.
A relative confirmed that she passed away at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in the city on Sunday.
Ms Hope had been working as a teacher at an international school when she was diagnosed with late-stage colon cancer in January.
She had planned to return to Scotland and her employer had taken out medical insurance to cover her stay at the Medical Park Hospital in Izmir until the end of July.
However, she became critically ill after contracting E.coli during an operation to remove a tumour.
Her family had feared she would not survive and launched a JustGiving page to raise money for her return to Scotland.
That appeal raised more than Â£31,000 to pay for a private medical evacuation.
Her mother Catherine thanked those who had contributed to the fundraising campaign and all the staff on the high dependency units at the hospital who cared for her daughter.
"I would just like to thank all the people who put money in towards bringing Caroline home. She was so grateful to be back in Scotland," she said.
