Russell Slade has left his role as Cardiff City's head of football after only 28 days in the job.

The former Bluebirds manager was moved to a new role at the end of the 2015-16 season and was replaced by Paul Trollope.
Slade was appointed Cardiff boss in October 2014 in succession to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
Cardiff finished 11th and eighth in the Championship under Slade, with several players departing.
The 55-year old previously managed Leyton Orient, Brighton and Yeovil Town.
"The club feels that it is necessary to have a change. We want to create a spark to take us to another level," Cardiff chief executive Ken Choo said about the decision to remove Slade as boss.
Slade is understood to be keen on a return to management and is among the favourites for the vacant Charlton Athletic role, the south London side relegated to League One last term.
He endured a difficult time with Cardiff City's supporters, who were often not shy in voicing an opinion against him, despite his tenure including a backdrop of wage reductions and player sales.
Cardiff let Kenwyne Jones and Joe Mason leave the club in January when a transfer embargo was slapped on them for breaching Financial Fair Play rules.
The previous season Slade was forced to reduce the bloated squad he inherited from Solskjaer.
