Toddler found in Crawley may be adopted judge rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A toddler who was taken into care and whose parents cannot be found should be placed for adoption, a High Court judge has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl, temporarily named Jade, is thought to be about two years old and is of Afro-Caribbean appearance.
In March she was found in Crawley and taken into the care of West Sussex County Council (WSCC).
The court ruled the council had done all it could to trace Jade's parents and she could be placed for adoption.
Earlier this month the council and Sussex Police made a public appeal for information.
Mr Justice Hayden, at a hearing of the family division of the High Court, said all "realistic avenues" had been pursued - although he urged anyone with information to come forward.
"I am wholly satisfied that Jade's best interests now lie in a smooth and structured move to a loving permanent (adoption) placement.
"There is no reasonable prospect of identifying her two parents," he said.
Sussex Police said Jade had been found in Crawley in March although may have been separated from her family before then.
Social workers think she may have links to Uganda.
Det Sgt Alexis Witek said: "We really need to find out who this little girl's parents are.
"She may have connections to Crawley and West Sussex as well as Tooting or south London more generally."
