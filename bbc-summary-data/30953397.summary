Employees were told on Thursday evening that the facility would close in April. The audio systems company has been in Carrickmacross for 37 years.
The chairman of Monaghan County Council, Padraig McNally, described it as a devastating blow to the area.
A special meeting of the council has been called to discuss the issue.
In a statement the company said it had taken the decision to close the Carrickmacross plant as well as a facility in the United States, in order to streamline the company's global supply chain.
