A rise in global milk price has not reached NI farmers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland farmers have criticised processors over the price they are being paid for their milk.

They say that a rise in world prices after an 18 month slump is not being reflected in what they are being offered.
And they have criticised the big processors here, which are co-operatives run by and for farmers.
For a year and a half dairy farmers have been losing money on every litre of milk they have produced.
Oversupply in world markets has depressed prices for products like milk powder.
Darren McCormick milks 150 cows near Bessbrook, County Armagh.
He says dairy farmers like him have been existing on "extended lines of credit" from the banks.
Darren added that patience is bound to run out and as global markets picked up farmers had been expecting a better return from processors. But that has not happened yet.
"Just when we see light at the end of the tunnel, the tunnel seems to be getting longer," he said.
The Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) has been highly critical of dairy processors and relationships have come under pressure.
Deputy President Ivor Ferguson has questioned why the companies that make milk powder, butter and cream "can make profits while the farmer is losing money".
He has claimed the biggest processor here, Dale Farm, has refused to engage with the UFU.
In turn Dale Farm has described the "tone and wording" of recent statements from the union as surprising and disappointing.
There is a delay between milk prices rising to reflect world commodity prices.
Mike Johnston of Dairy UK, which represents processors, said they forward sell their produce.
That means they are now finalising the quantities of product and the prices they will get paid for it, for the first quarter of 2017.
Mr Johnston said if they get a better price, they will be in a position to pass it on to farmers.
But farmers say they have been patient and it is now time for the processors to pass the benefit on.
Prices are beginning to move upwards as supply control measures across Europe kick in.
Famers at Dale Farm's AGM were told on Thursday that there would be a 2.5p per litre increase in the base price of their milk, with a further 2p per litre winter bonus for all milk supplied in October, November and December.
That brings the current price, including bonuses for Dale Farm suppliers, up to 26.17p per litre.
