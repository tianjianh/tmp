Labour calls for Police Scotland staff survey results

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour has called on Police Scotland to publish the results of a major staff survey carried out earlier this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The force asked for the views of every officer and member of civilian staff, with the survey closing in June.
Scottish Labour said the recent M9 tragedy exposed the impact of cuts to civilian staff.
Police Scotland said the results were currently being analysed by an independent organisation.
An urgent review of all police call handling in Scotland was ordered by the Scottish government in July following the death of Lamara Bell, 25, and John Yuill, 28, in a crash on the M9 which happened three days before they were discovered.
Although the couple were not found until Wednesday 8 July, Police Scotland admitted the crash was reported to them 72 hours earlier.
Chief Constable Sir Stephen House said information from a call received on the Sunday had not been entered into police systems.
Following calls for Police Scotland to be restructured, on Thursday Mr House and the head of the Scottish Police Authority, the body set up to hold Police Scotland to account, issued a joint statement making the case for the single police force.
Former SNP leader Gordon Wilson had argued that local oversight needed to be returned, suggesting a federal structure with four regional forces.
Scottish Labour's justice spokesman Graeme Pearson, a former deputy chief constable of Strathclyde Police, said: "We know that rank and file officers are under huge pressure because of the decisions taken by government ministers and the leadership of Police Scotland.
"They are doing their best in very difficult circumstances. Cuts to civilian staff numbers and budgets mean officers and civilian staff are doing more with less. That's unsustainable.
"No matter how many joint statements the leadership of the Scottish Police Authority and Police Scotland issue, the big problems faced by officers and civilian staff can't be swept under the carpet."
He added: "If the chief constable and SNP Justice Minister Michael Matheson really value the opinions of officers and civilian staff then they would publish the results of this staff survey without delay.
"The fact that it has taken so long to make the views of police officers known isn't acceptable.
"We need full transparency from the SNP government and Police Scotland. Only by being honest about the problems in our police service can we hope to be able to reform it."
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "The joint SPA/Police Scotland officer and staff engagement survey closed at the end of June.
"The results are currently being analysed by an independent organisation and as planned, the results will be published as soon as possible."
The spokeswoman added: "The engagement survey generated a high percentage of responses from both officers and staff. The survey is the largest of its kind and the first since Police Scotland began.
"We look forward to working with all our employees as we go forward, taking into account any changes which may be needed."
