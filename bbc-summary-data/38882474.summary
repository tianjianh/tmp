Wrexham midfielder Mark Carrington has signed a contract extension with the National League club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Crewe and Bury player Carrington, 29, joined Wrexham in September 2013 and is the club's vice-captain.
Manager Dean Keates said the club had also come to an agreement with fellow midfielder Paul Rutherford over a new deal for next season.
Keates said talks were ongoing with top-scorer John Rooney.
Rooney, who came off the bench to score twice in Saturday's 3-1 home win over Guiseley, is one start away from triggering a new contract.
