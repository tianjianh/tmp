[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A date has been set for a hearing after an Aberdeen councillor referred himself to the Standards Commission over an "accidental" leak.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Willie Young admitted he emailed confidential legal advice to one of the campaigners against the controversial Â£107m Marischal Square project.
It is a new look for the site of the former council headquarters, with offices and a hotel.
The hearing on 12 January will examine if Mr Young broke the code of conduct.
The incident happened before protestors failed in their bid to get the development halted in March.
Councillors voted by 22-21 to continue with the project.
Opponents expressed anger at being thrown out of the debate because it was hearing confidential legal advice.
But it emerged the authority's finance convenor Mr Young had sent some of that advice to one of the campaigners.
He referred himself to the Standards Commission.
Opponents argue the development blocks the view of historic Marischal College and Provost Skene House.
Developers Muse say it will be a world class project.
