The evidence was from a child witness who was in the  house when Nyomi Fee and her partner Rachel Fee realised that two-year-old Liam was dead.
The couple deny murdering Liam Fee in Fife in March 2014.
They also deny ill-treating two other boys.
In an interview with police and social workers, which recorded soon after Liam's death, the young boy was asked about what happened on the day that toddler Liam fee died at a house near Glenrothes.
The young boy spoke about a makeshift cage in which it is alleged another boy was imprisoned by the accused.
He said: "They were panicking about the cage. They kept asking where can the cage go."
The court also heard allegations that he and another boy had been made to hit each other.
The jury heard recorded evidence from the child who said Nyomi Fee told another boy to hit him with a shoe in the private parts.
The child said he ended up bleeding.
Rachel Fee and Nyomi Fee, w ho are originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, are accused of murdering Liam in March 2014 and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by blaming the killing on a seven-year-old boy.
The couple are also charged with a catalogue of allegations that they neglected Liam and abused two other children in their care over a two year period.
One of these boys is the witness the jury heard from while the other is the child they are accused of falsely blaming for Liam's death.
They deny all the charges against them.
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
