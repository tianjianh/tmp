[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man high on drugs and alcohol sexually assaulted then killed his mother before taking her car to make his getaway, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander McDonald, 27, of Hilly Park, Norton Fitzwarren, admits carrying out the fatal attack but denies murdering Catherine McDonald, 57, in their home in Somerset on 30 September 2014.
Exeter Crown Court was told he stabbed his mother with a kitchen knife, a knitting needle and scissors.
The trial continues.
The court was told McDonald woke his neighbours by revving the car at 04:45 BST on 30 September 2014 as he tried to get it into reverse.
He crashed it, turning it over at Burrows Corner, near Butterleigh shortly after 09:00 BST, and was seen by a father on his way home from the school run and by two horse riders and a farmer as he walked into Tiverton, Devon.
The court heard he called the police to report the accident then walked into a couple's home in Exeter Hill uninvited and was told to leave.
He was later arrested on Old Road.
The court was told McDonald had moved back to his mother's home five months earlier after splitting up with his girlfriend in Kent.
He was working at the Sausage and Wine Restaurant in Taunton as a waiter but got drunk at a wine tasting at the restaurant on the afternoon before the killing and had taken cocaine before returning home.
The jury was shown CCTV footage of him shopping at Tesco and Sainsbury stores in Taunton and played three calls he made to the AA after crashing the car.
The accused has pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The trial at Exeter Crown Court continues.
