[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 3-0 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe returned to the top of League One with a decisive victory against Millwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They stretched their club-record unbeaten home run to 23 games thanks to a brace from last season's leading marksman Paddy Madden and a goal from recalled winger Hakeeb Adelakun.
In an evenly balanced opening 45 minutes, it was Millwall who twice almost snatched the lead.
Shaun Williams tested goalkeeper Luke Daniels with a dipping long-range effort and the United stopper had to be at his best again to turn away a shot from Lee Gregory after he had wriggled free in the box.
But it was the Iron who finished the half with a flourish to take command with two goals in nine minutes.
Madden steered them in front in the 36th minute with a measured header from a free-kick on the right curled in by Josh Morris.
Then, just before the break, they made it 2-0 when Adelakun celebrated his return to the starting line-up by forcing his shot past keeper Jordan Archer at the second attempt after a low ball into the box from Jordan Clarke.
The visitors made a double substitution at half-time, sending on striker Steve Morison and midfield man David Worrall.
They pressed forward strongly to try to  get back into the game but could make little headway against a solid home defence.
It was the hosts who struck again to make it 3-0 in the 68th minute when Tom Hopper drove forward into the box and unselfishly squared a pass into the path of an unmarked Madden. The striker crashed a first-time shot low into the bottom corner for his second goal of the game - and eighth of the season.
Only a great reaction save prevented full-back Harry Toffolo adding a fourth as Scunthorpe ran out comfortable winners.
