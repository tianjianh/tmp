[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phillip Nicholson, 22, died from a stab wound to the neck in the Boscombe area of Bournemouth on 26 May.
His ex-partner Isabella Gossling, 20, was found guilty of murder after a trial at Winchester Crown Court.
Her lover Richard Moors, 26, had previously admitted murder. The court heard Moors inflicted the fatal wound.
Gossling and Moors, both of Sea Road, Bournemouth, will be sentenced on Monday.
During the trial, the court was played a recording, made on Gossling's phone, of the final moments of Mr Nicholson's life in which he is heard saying: "Stop, I just want to be friends, please."
Nigel Lickley QC said Gossling was a manipulative and threatening figure who could be heard on the recording telling Mr Moors to "go on. Do what you need to do".
Gossling insisted she could do nothing to stop the attack.
The jury also heard the couple had taken Â£800 from Mr Nicholson's bank account.
Mr Nicholson, who had learning difficulties, had been lured to Gossling's flat on the pretence of meeting another girl they were friends with.
After the attack the killers can be heard discussing how to leave their victim's body to make it look like he had stabbed himself.
Mr Nicholson's aunt Dee Drummond described him as "lovely and affectionate".
"His death was nasty, vicious and cruel by people who had already made his life hell," she said.
Det Ch Insp Stewart Balmer said: "We, along with Phillip's family, are delighted that Isabella Gossling has been convicted today.
"This follows Richard Moors' previous guilty plea to Phillip's murder.
"Family liaison officers are supporting Phillip's family at this difficult time and our thoughts are very much with Phillip's family."
