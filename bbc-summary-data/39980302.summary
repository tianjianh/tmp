The 26-year-old is the Brewers' first signing of the summer as they prepare for their second Championship campaign.
Lund, twice capped by Northern Ireland, scored 10 goals in 37 games for Rochdale this season.
"He's a goalscoring midfielder and there aren't many of them about," Burton boss Nigel Clough said.
Former Stoke City trainee Lund played for Hereford, Oldham, Bristol Rovers and Southend before he joined Rochdale in June 2013.
He made 149 appearances for Dale, scoring 22 goals.
Lund told Burton's official website: "Playing in the Championship has been an aim of mine for a couple of seasons.
"It's an opportunity for me to show what I can do at a higher level and I want to show Burton, my family and friends that I can make that step up."
