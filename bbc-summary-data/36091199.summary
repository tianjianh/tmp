The BMW was pulled over in North Quay, Great Yarmouth, on Wednesday morning.
Norfolk and Suffolk Road Policing tweeted a photograph of the car and said "4m of guttering does not fit in a 2 door saloon. #RoadSafety".
On Friday, a car was stopped in Great Yarmouth with a wardrobe strapped to the roof with bubble wrap.
Police are yet to comment further on the latest incident but are deciding whether to prosecute the driver using a "clearly very dangerous" method to transport furniture.
Sgt Chris Harris tweeted an image and said the thin plastic was "not sufficient to secure a wardrobe to a car roof".
