The Deeside factory is now making engines for vehicles made in Brazil and it is about to start supplying them for a new car being made in the UK.
The Welsh plant employs more than 500 people and became the first factory outside Japan to build Toyota's hybrid engine.
Welsh Secretary David Jones will visit the factory later on Friday.
Toyota said it had already started recruiting new staff to help with its increased workload.
Welsh Secretary Mr Jones, who is MP for Clwyd West, said: "Toyota has made a vital contribution to the growing success of the UK car manufacturing sector and to the creation of sustainable jobs in north Wales.
"It is a glowing example of collaboration between a global company and the UK, and a demonstration of why Wales continues to be a prime location to invest and do business."
Richard Kenworthy, director of the Deeside engine manufacturing factory, said the new jobs were great news for the plant and for Wales.
The Deeside plant marked its 20th anniversary last year, with First Minister Carwyn Jones describing it as "a Welsh success story".
