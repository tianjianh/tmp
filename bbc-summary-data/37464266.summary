[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carrick Rangers manager Kieran Harding has resigned following Saturday's 3-0 Irish Premiership home defeat by Dungannon Swifts.

The defeat - Carrick's seventh in their opening nine games - left them 11th in the table with only Portadown behind them because of their points deduction.
Carrick also bowed out of the County Antrim Shield in midweek when they were shocked 4-1 by the PSNI.
Harding was only appointed the Carrick job in May after Gary Haveron resigned.

A Carrick Rangers statement shortly after Saturday's game said that Harding has resigned "with immediate effect".
The club thanked the former Portadown assistant boss for his "hard work and effort", adding that "we wish him well for the future".
Carrick had a turbulent 2015-16 season with pitch problems meaning that a series of games had to be played at away venues which was followed by controversy over a touchline ban handed to Haveron.
Rangers said after Haveron's departure that they were "unable to establish a mutual agreement on the best way forward for the club".
Carrick's only Premiership win of the season came in the victory over Glentoran on 13 August.
