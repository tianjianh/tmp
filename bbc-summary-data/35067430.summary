The Scottish champions fought back to claim a 1-1 draw against Fenerbahce in their final Group A fixture.
Celtic were destined to finish bottom before the match in Istanbul but the result took them on to three points.
"Of course, I have confidence in this group, that we can do it and we're going to show it," said Deila.
"This club can do it but it's a selling club, it's a club that want to build up talents. We want to be among the big teams and that's in the Champions League, of course.
"This year, we have conceded too many easy goals. We have scored goals. It's small things that have to be better to get the results we want.
"We know what we want, we know what we need, and we're going to do everything we can to get that right next year.
"But, before that, we have a lot of games [domestically] and we are looking forward to that as well.
"They showed today that they can get results."
Dropping into the Europa League after being beaten on aggregate by Malmo in the Champions League play-off round, Celtic opened with 2-2 draws with Ajax and Fenerbahce before back-to-back defeats against Molde and then another loss to Ajax.
Those results ensured Deila's men would not emulate last season's last 32 appearance in the competition.
Another defeat looked to be on the cards after Fenerbahce took the lead in Istanbul, Lazar Markovic scoring after goalkeeper Craig Gordon missed the ball while closing the forward down.
"It was a difficult situation," Deila explained. "Craig was thinking that he was coming first on the ball and then he was taking his legs a little bit out.
"He didn't touch it, maybe because he was afraid to meet the goalkeeper and it's gone through his legs.
"That can happen in a football game but he had a couple of very good saves as well."
Fenerbahce's Diego, who had earlier clashed with Stefan Johansen, was dismissed for a kick on the Celtic midfielder and substitute Kris Commons soon headed Celtic level.
"Things turned around on the red card and also we brought on fresh legs and creative players," added Deila.
"We got our goal and I'm very satisfied with that. We had three good substitutes and we turned it.
"The back four defended well, on the ball we can be better and also in the midfield - play passes forward instead of playing sideways and backward.
"These are things we have to work on. Overall, it's a good performance and a good result. To get something from Fenerbahce is tough."
