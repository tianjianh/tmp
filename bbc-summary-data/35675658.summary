[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 0-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Dickson scored his second Yeovil Town winner in the space of five days with a stoppage-time goal at League Two play-off chasers Mansfield Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dickson struck in Tuesday's win that dented Accrington's promotion bid, and followed it with a low finish from Brandon Goodship's cross.
Mansfield peppered Artur Krysiak's goal in the prelude, with Reggie Lambe spurning several opportunities.
Yeovil are nine points off the drop, while Rovers remain in the play-offs.
