RNLI urges 'respect' for Scotland's coastal dangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RNLI has launched a drowning prevention campaign with the intention of reducing coastal deaths by 50%.

It coincides with the release of figures showing that 24 people died on Scotland's coastline in 2014.
Over the past five years, the average fatality rate in Scotland was 35 each year.
Scotland experiences proportionately more coastal drownings than the UK as a whole. The UK figure for 2014 recorded by the RNLI was 163.
The charity's Respect the Water campaign aims to halve the rate of drownings by 2024.
It includes two films which will be shown in cinemas throughout the UK.
The largest proportion of deaths over the past five years - 24% - were accounted for by people slipping and falling into the water while walking and running.
Other dangers included:
Men are considerably more likely to put themselves in danger than women. Over the five-year period, 74% of those who died were men.
RNLI lifeboat crews in Scotland saved 51 lives in 2014.
The charity has highlighted dangers which can be more common in Scotland.
After falling in, people can experience cold water shock or the effects of strong currents under the surface. There are also problems with slippery rocks, sudden waves or unstable ground.
RNLI coastal safety manager for Scotland Michael Avril said: "We want people to enjoy the water but to make sure they respect it.
"Around 35 lives are lost around Scotland's coast each year but many of these losses could be avoided if people acknowledge the dangers and follow some basic safety advice."
