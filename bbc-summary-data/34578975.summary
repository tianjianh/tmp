Ellie Kendrick plays Clover Catto, who returns to her family's farm after her younger brother Harry dies.
Wellington Films producer Rachel Robey said: "It follows a family, the Cattos, as they get back on their feet after the floods."
The Levelling is expected to be released in cinemas next year.
Ms Robey added: "Even in Burrowbridge, you can see new flood defences being built, preparations being made.
"When we did the research for the film, the overwhelming feeling we had from all the residents that we spoke to is that the floods have had a long and lasting legacy for them and that's what inspired us to make the film."
Although best known for her role as Meera Reed in Game of Thrones, Ellie Kendrick also played Anne Frank in The Diary of Anne Frank in 2009.
Filming is expected to finish on 30 October.
