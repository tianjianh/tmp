The Championship side led when Hal Robson-Kanu rolled his marker to fire a powerful shot into the roof of the net.
The lead was doubled within four minutes, Matej Vydra bundling in Stephen Quinn's cross from close range.
Romaine Sawyers and Oliver Norwood hit the bar for each side after the break before Danny Williams ran clear to finish and Vydra headed a fourth.

Reading - beaten by winners Arsenal at the semi-final stage last season - survived an early scare when Tom Bradshaw had a shot deflected just wide for the visitors.
But their superior quality told against their League One opponents, with Williams impressively crafting space for Quinn to create the second four minutes before the break.
Brian McDermott's side - 15th in the Championship - have just two league wins from 11 matches and will take a welcome boost in confidence ahead of Tuesday's trip to Ipswich.
Walsall kept an unchanged side for the trip to the Madejski despite being third in their division and with a trip to Doncaster on Tuesday.
Sawyers' strike against the bar was a moment where they could have kept the tie alive, but while they had much of the possession, it was the home side who created the more telling openings and they deserved their place in Sunday's draw.
Meanwhile, Saddlers goalkeeper Neil Etheridge was stretchered off on 78 minutes, with what appeared at first to be a serious knee injury, to be replaced by his deputy Craig MacGillivray.
But Walsall head coach Sean O'Driscoll's initial post-match assessment was that the injury is not as bad as first feared.
"I don't think it's anything structural," he told BBC WM.
Walsall head coach Sean O'Driscoll told BBC WM 95.6:

"We said before the game that this would be our most difficult game just because they're really functional.
"They put pressure on our back line and it was just a case of when to play and when not to play.
"We got caught a couple of times and as the game progressed we realised we couldn't overplay in the middle of the park, and when we got the ball forward we were a threat."
