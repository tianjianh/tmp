[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham remain winless in the Premier League after being held to a goalless draw by Everton at White Hart Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Kane had the home side's best chance when he was sent clear but Toffees goalkeeper Tim Howard saved.
Jan Vertonghen also skimmed the bar for Tottenham while Tom Cleverley, who was later carried off on a stretcher, went closest for Everton.

The last time Spurs did not win any of their opening four league fixtures was under Juande Ramos in 2008-09.
Ramos was subsequently sacked by Spurs a few months later and current boss Mauricio Pochettino will now have to wait until a trip to Sunderland on 13 September for another chance to register their first win of the campaign.
Everton, who included John Stones in their starting line-up even though he handed in a transfer request, lost midfielder Cleverley to injury after an awkward tangle with Eric Dier while Spurs midfielder Mousa Dembele also left the pitch on a stretcher.
Relive Tottenham's stalemate against Everton
Reaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action
When Kane raced clear of the Everton defence and found himself one-on-one with Howard, White Hart Lane held its collective breath.
This was the kind of opportunity he scored for fun en route to 31 goals in 51 appearances for Spurs last season, but a combination of Howard's speed off his line and Kane's hesitancy saw the chance go begging.
All strikers go through peaks and troughs, but Kane looked like a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Perhaps he just needs a break.
Tottenham have signed forward Son Heung-min from Bayer Leverkusen for £22m, and remain keen on West Brom's Saido Berahino, so he might get some time out of the firing line.
While Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal refuses to pick unsettled goalkeeper David De Gea because of concerns over his focus amid interest from Real Madrid, Stones remains a fixture in Everton's starting line-up.
If Everton chairman Bill Kenwright's determination not to sell the 21-year-old England international is admirable, Martinez's insistence on picking him could prove to be a canny piece of man-management.
Rather than isolate Stones and drive a wedge between the pair, Martinez has ensured their personal relationship remains unaffected.
Stones produced a composed and defensively sound performance and it certainly did not suggest a player who had his head turned.
Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino: "We created a lot of chances but you need to score. It was impossible today but I am happy with the performance. I am happy with Harry Kane, he had two or three clear chances but I am happy. He needs to work hard and play. A goal will come for Harry. All strikers have spells like this and only time can do it. I trust in him."

Everton manager Roberto Martinez: "John Stones was an immense influence on what we did defensively. The reading of the game, he looks like a player who has grown in the last few weeks under the pressure and speculation. Every single Evertonian will show that respect to him for the way he has handled the situation. You can see the signs of a future England captain."
BBC Radio London's Bradley Allen: "Some of the Tottenham fans are right to be disappointed because that was probably the best Spurs have played so far this season. Everton were solid defensively, Tim Howard made some fine saves, and it just wasn't Spurs' evening."
Everton host Premier League champions Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday, 12 September where John Stones could once again be the centre of attention. Tottenham will head to the Stadium of Light on 13 September to attempt to record their first win of the season against Sunderland.
