Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, hosts City fell further behind to Eniola Aluko's strike and Fran Kirby and Gilly Flaherty added further goals.
But Booth was pleased with how the Scottish champions applied themselves against their English opponents.
"I'm proud of my team," said Booth," I think they've done great."
And the former Scotland and Aberdeen striker added: "Each year, in the Champions League, we come across teams like that. Last season it was PSG that put Glasgow City out. This season it's Chelsea.
"They want to go and play against these teams - some of the best teams in Europe.
"Sometimes you can get through and you can make it work, other times it's a little bit difficult because you're fighting against a massive gulf in finance and resources.
"We were totally committed again, over the two legs. I'm not disappointed in my team one bit. We did very, very well and I'm still proud of them.
"They commit everything to this club and that gives me loads of energy to keep going for them."
Booth felt pace in particular gave Chelsea the edge at Airdrieonians' Excelsior Stadium.
"We don't lack anything in belief and the way that they give you absolutely anything but, at times, just that little bit of pace," he explained.
"Even defensively, they've got quick players. I think that, at times, has been the difference.
"Once they got the goal, it sort of changed things for us. We had to really gamble. We knew by doing that, we'd concede space centrally and on the wings. We were happy to go and try it but, at the end of the day, they just had too much for us."
With Booth having taken over from Eddie Wolecki Black in July, this was his first Champions League campaign as City boss.
"I'm loving it, I really am," he said.
"They're brilliant to work for. I feel like I work for them. They're so committed to what they do. A lot of them are just working through the day and then at night - four nights a week - we go and train and we train well and then we play at the weekend.
"Every year, you feel that the women's game is getting stronger and stronger. It certainly is in our country and there's lots of good players coming through.
"I just hope that we can continue to grow the women's game."
