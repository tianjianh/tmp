Large fuel spillage closes part of M1 in Bedfordshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A large fuel spillage has resulted in the closure of part of the M1 in Bedfordshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 800 litres of diesel is thought to have spilled from the lorry after it crashed with a car on the northbound carriageway, between junctions 11 and 12.
The spillage spread across the slip road and three lanes of the main carriageway.
Three people received minor injuries in the crash.
Highways England said the road would be closed well into the afternoon as workers dug up and replaced the surface.
Northbound traffic on the M1 is being diverted through Dunstable and Houghton Regis.
