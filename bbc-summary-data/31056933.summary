[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The prosecution of a second UK skipper in a week for breaching Manx fishing regulations sends a "clear message to the industry," a politician has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Tuesday the captain of a UK-registered vessel was fined £10,000 for unlawfully fishing in Manx waters.
It follows the prosecution at Douglas courthouse last week of a Scottish fisherman who was fined £15,000 for breaching Manx regulations.
Richard Ronan MHK said the "significant fines send out a clear message".
The Deputy High Bailiff ordered both skippers to forfeit their catch of King Scallops worth nearly £5,500 each (about 90 bags).
Both vessels were routinely boarded by officers from the Manx government's fisheries protection vessel Barrule before being escorted back to the island and detained.
Mr Ronan, the Minister for Environment, Food and Agriculture, said: "The Isle of Man is committed to the protection and development of stocks of shellfish within its territorial sea and is vigilant over illegal fishing activity.
"These significant fines must act as a strong deterrent."
He added that the Isle of Man "welcomes responsible skippers" with registered vessels to sustainably fish in the Isle of Man's territorial sea with the appropriate licence.
Manx territorial waters extend out to 12 miles around the island's coastline and contain a number of restricted zones.
