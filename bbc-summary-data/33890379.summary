It's unlikely that your garden shed has electric windows, an engine and four wheels, but Kevin Nicks' shed does.

The gardener from Oxfordshire is competing for the title of 'Fastest Garden Shed' this weekend in York.
It took Kevin seven months to transform his car, using steel beams and timber, to create his shed on wheels.
It's a really popular sight with kids and local people.
His shed is safe to drive on the road and it can reach speeds of almost 80 miles per hour.
However, this isn't the first shed to take to the road.
Edd China is the current record holder for fastest garden shed.
His shed got to a top speed of 58.4 miles per hour on an Italian TV programme in 2011.
