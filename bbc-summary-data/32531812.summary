Andrew Beaumont posted a picture on Twitter of the parliamentary hopefuls alongside his ballot paper for the Oxford West and Abingdon marginal seat.
The 34-year-old father of two, a bursar at Oxford University's Hertford College, says he hopes his figures will liven up the final days of campaigning.
Conservative candidate Nicola Blackwood is defending a majority of only 176.
Dr Beaumont, who describes himself as a "benign Lego obsessive and sometime c.18th historian" on Twitter, told BBC News he came up with the creations through "sheer boredom".
"I got all the literature and the manifestos through the door for all the seven candidates and looking at their mugshots, I just thought they all looked a bit the same," he said.
"That's where the idea to recreate them in Lego came from really. I took a look at my ballot paper and thought it would be a bit of fun to pair them up."
Some of the candidates got the chance to meet their Lego alter egos during a BBC Radio Oxford constituency debate which will be broadcast on Friday.
In alphabetical order, the candidates standing for Oxford West and Abingdon are: Nicola Blackwood (Conservative); Sally Copley (Labour); Mike Foster (Socialist Party of Great Britain); Alan Harris (UK Iindependence Party); Layla Moran (Liberal Democrat); Helen Salisbury (National Health Action Party); Larry Sanders (Green Party)
