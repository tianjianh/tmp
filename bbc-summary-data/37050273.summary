The Ministry of Justice said the incident on Friday 5 August lasted for around 15 minutes.
The prisoners involved have since been moved to other establishments.
A Prison Service spokesperson said they "do not tolerate any violence" against prison staff and were working with the police to push for the "strongest possible punishment".
The spokesperson added: "Safety in prisons is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system."
