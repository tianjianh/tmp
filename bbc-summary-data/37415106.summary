[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With Wanderers already three goals ahead at half-time after efforts from Sam Wood, Paris Cowan-Hall and Dominic Gape, Kashket entered the action on 62 minutes before scoring twice in the next seven minutes.
George Cooper netted a consolation but the night belonged to Wycombe, who scored five for the first time under manager Gareth Ainsworth.
Wood broke the deadlock with an easy finish from Paul Hayes' cut back.
The goal looked to have galvanised Crewe but the Chairboys struck again with a looping header by Cowan-Hall from Michael Harriman's cross in the before Gape's curled finish made it 3-0 before half-time.
Crewe looked to fight back in the second half, with a spell of possession, but conceded again when Kashket beat keeper Ben Garratt to the ball and finished into an open goal.
The Wycombe man then added another on 69 minutes from close range while Cooper pulled one back two minutes later following a corner.
