Suspend inspection regime, GPs urge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The inspection regime for GPs in England should be suspended because it is "overly bureaucratic" and "nit-picking", doctors say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Medics at the British Medical Association's annual conference said they were being asked to do unnecessary tasks to prepare for assessments.
These included keeping schedules of cleaning regimes and detailed records of staff performance reviews.
The Royal College of GPs also spoke out against the inspection system.
Delegates at the BMA conference, in Liverpool, voted in favour of a motion saying the current Care Quality Commission regime was "unfit for purpose".
The inspection regime, which began last year, will see all 8,000 practices in England given a rating by September 2016. So far, more than 1,000 have been assessed.
BMA GP leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the inspection regime had "lost the confidence" of the profession and should be suspended.
And he objected to the suggestion patient safety would be put at risk if GPs failed to keep such detailed records.
"We have been voicing significant concerns about the [Care Quality Commission's] operation, particularly the overly bureaucratic and often nit-picking assessments that are wasting days of valuable GP and staff time that could be spent on treating patients."
The Royal College of GPs also used the vote to speak out against the inspection process, saying there should be an "emergency pause" to stop the GP system going into meltdown.
In recent weeks, there has been growing anger in the profession about work pressure.
A recent poll by the BMA suggested nine out of every 10 doctors felt their workloads were harming patient care.
RCGP president Dr Maureen Baker said: "The current inspection process tends to focus on those things that can be most easily documented and generates considerable additional clinical and administrative activity for practices."
She pointed to research done by the college suggesting every family doctor could gain 120 additional hours per year for patients if the administrative burden was reduced by half.
There should be an urgent review to eliminate "unnecessary bureaucracy", she added.
Professor Steve Field, chief inspector of general practice at the CQC, said he was "extremely disappointed" by the criticisms.
He added while 85% had been rated good or outstanding, it still meant one in seven were not delivering the care that patients have every right to expect.
"In the last few weeks alone, we have found some seriously deficient primary care, which has led to us cancelling the registrations of some practices, in the interests of protecting the safety and quality of care for people who use these services."
