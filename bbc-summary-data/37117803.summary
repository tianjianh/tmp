All-rounder Sean Ervine made a vital century for Hampshire as they reached 281-6 on the opening day against Somerset at Taunton.

The Zimbabwean hit 10 boundaries in his 207-ball knock before he was lbw to left-arm spinner Jack Leach (3-77).
Leach earlier bowled England batsman James Vince for a third-ball duck as the visitors struggled to 92-4.
Ryan McLaren, though, scored 61 as he and Ervine added 118, while Lewis McManus was 41 not out at the close.
Hampshire are second from bottom of the table but defeated Nottinghamshire in their last outing, while Somerset are fifth, 35 points behind leaders Middlesex.
Lewis Gregory struck the first blow for the home side by bowling Jimmy Adams in the fourth over of play.
Will Smith and Vince followed in successive overs as Somerset wasted no time in bringing their two spinners, Leach and Roelof van der Merwe, into the attack.
Paceman Craig Overton was awarded his county cap during the lunch interval but went through the day wicketless, and it was Leach ended the partnership between Ervine and McLaren by having the latter caught by Tom Abell at short leg.
Hampshire all-rounder Sean Ervine told BBC Radio Solent:
"We looked at the wicket and we all saw it was going to spin.
"They bowled well up front and obviously the partnership with Ryan McLaren was hugely important and great for us.
"He played very well and was a bit unlucky - it was a great catch at short leg.
"We had a game plan, I guess it helped us being left-handed, and just had to bide our time and try and hit the bad balls."
