South Sudan thrashed Djibouti 6-0 in Juba on Tuesday to overturn a first leg deficit and win 6-2 overall.
It means South Sudan progress to play in Group C with Mali, Gabon and Burundi.
Earlier on Tuesday Mauritius held visiting Comoros to a 1-1 draw but lost 3-1 on aggregate.
Comoros now advance to Group B to play along side Morocco, Malawi and reigning champions Cameroon.
The Indomitable Lions will qualify automatically as hosts no matter where they finish in the final standings.
Greece-based Ben El Fardou extended Comoros' overall lead in the 13th minute with a header from the edge of the area.
It was to be his last contribution following a clash of heads with Walter Saint Martin as he scored his goal meant he had to be substituted.
Mauritius were lucky not to go further behind as the woodwork and goalkeeper Kevin Jean Louis came to their rescue.
The hosts equalised in injury time at the end of the first half as Comoros failed to defend a corner and the ball fell Ipswich Town's Kevin Bru whose shot was deflected into the net by Saint Martin.
Mauritius once again ended the game with 10 men after Andy Patate was shown a straight red card in the 80th minute, they had also ended the first leg a man down after Emmanuel Vincent was sent off.
