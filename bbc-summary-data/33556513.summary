A man banned from driving for life has appeared in court after he was caught driving his carer's car home from a pub.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hugh Thomson, 67, from Lumsden, drank half a pint of beer and four whiskies, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard.
Police found that he was more than four times the legal drink drive limit and in breach of a life-long driving ban.
He has been given a community payback order as a direct alternative to jail and a further 10 year driving ban.
The court heard that Thomson, who says he has a terminal illness, was banned from driving for life when he appeared at Fort William Sheriff Court in 1997.
On 23 May this year he drove from Lumsden to Rhynie, a nearby village, and drank in the Gordon Arms Hotel.
People tried to take the car keys from him when he set off for home. He refused to give the keys up and police were alerted, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard.
Sheriff Alison Stirling imposed a further 10 year ban on driving and told him to carry out 60 hours of unpaid work in the community in a year.
