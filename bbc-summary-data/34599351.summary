Cage reaches compromise in funding case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A court case brought against the Charity Commission, after it called for funding to human rights group Cage to stop, has ended in a compromise.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A row broke out after Cage described Mohamed Emwazi, known as Islamic State extremist Jihadi John, as an "extremely kind" and "beautiful young man".
Cage claimed the commission should not have sought to block its funding.
The High Court case judge called for proper discussions in future to avoid wasting taxpayer and charity money.
The case was brought by Cage and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust.
Cage's research director Asim Qureshi claimed in February that former London student Emwazi - identified as the man in a number of Islamic State beheading videos - had been driven to extremism after UK security services harassed him.
Cage later said it had made "mistakes" in its comments about Emwazi, a former client.
The Charity Commission had urged the Joseph Rowntree Trust and the Roddick Foundation not to make any future donations to Cage, which offers support to Muslims suspected of terrorism offences.
Cage and the trust told the High Court the commission had issued a direction it had no power to make, as well as unlawfully fettering the trust's discretion over whether or not to fund Cage should circumstances change.
The commission, which disputed the accusation, said it had been acting within its powers to give advice and seek assurances from the charities that they would not offer future funding to Cage.
The case was settled after a day-long hearing with all sides agreeing that Joseph Rowntree's trustees "must be free to exercise their powers and duties in the light of circumstances existing at the time".
And the commission stated it was not seeking to fetter the charity's discretion to fund Cage "for all time regardless of changing circumstances".
The case was heard by Lord Thomas - the Lord Chief Justice - and Mr Justice Ouseley.
