[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Cookson, 30, who served with the South Yorkshire force, was arrested in November 2013 after the teenager's parents found "inappropriate text messages" on her phone.
Officers found he had contacted her between March and November, the force said.
He denied inciting the girl to engage in sexual activity but was found guilty at Sheffield Crown Court.
Cookson, from Worksop, was handed an 18-month jail term and put on the sex offenders register for 10 years. He was also banned from working with children.
He was also subjected to a sexual harm prevention order, police said.
The PC, who was based in Rotherham, was suspended after he was arrested and charged in August last year.
South Yorkshire Police said a "misconduct investigation will be considered by the force's Professional Standards Department".
