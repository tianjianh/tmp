Aylesbury Young Offenders Institution violence levels 'too high'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Levels of violence at a young offenders institution have become so high it is an unsafe place, inspectors said.

Standards of safety, decency and meaningful activity had all failed at HMP Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.
The chief inspector of prisons said the unannounced inspection showed the facility's regime was "so poor [it] fostered inactivity and indolence".
Staff shortages had caused problems but more officers were being recruited, the Prison Service said.
The institution holds up to 444 18-21 year olds, serving long sentences - including more than 80% serving at least four years and 30% more than 10 years to life.
Too many temporary staff from other prisons were there for too short a time to build relationships with inmates, inspectors said.
Long periods of lock-up and inactivity caused frustrations that led to violence and aggression, they said.
Many classes and workshops were closed owing to staff shortages.
Inspectors found adequate security and good management of intelligence but drug usage was double expected levels and a high number inmates had self-harmed.
Nick Hardwick, chief inspector of prisons, concluded the institution required a fundamental improvement in the quality of learning, skills and work.
"Aylesbury was not safe enough: levels of violence were high and some incidents were serious," he said.
Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said: "We are recruiting more staff and have put an action plan in place to address the recommendations.
"The governor will receive the support he needs to urgently improve the prison."
