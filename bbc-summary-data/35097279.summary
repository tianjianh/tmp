[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US is hitting so-called Islamic State (IS) harder than ever, President Barack Obama has said in a speech at the Pentagon.

November saw more airstrikes launched against the group than in any previous month, he said.
He said the US had killed a number of its leaders and attacked oil facilities it relies on for cash.
He has been seeking to reassure the public following an attack in California at the hands of militants.
Fourteen people were shot dead by a radicalised Muslim couple, weeks after the killing of 130 people by Islamist gunmen in Paris.
On Thursday he will visit the National Counterterrorism Center in Virginia, where he is also expected to speak.
The National Security Council (NSC) held a rare outside-of-the-White House meeting at the Pentagon ahead of Mr Obama's remarks.
The marquee visits come about a week after Mr Obama gave a major televised address to reassure the public of his strategy and to warn against anti-Muslim sentiment in the US.
In recent weeks, US fears of a terror attack have swelled, with about 70% of Americans saying the risk of an attack in the US is at least somewhat high.
Just before the Thanksgiving holiday in November, Mr Obama delivered a speech saying that there was no "specific or credible" threat of a terrorist attack in the US.
