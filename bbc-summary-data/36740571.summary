Scotland's Reid, 24, overcame Nicolas Peifer of France 6-3 6-4 in the men's draw while Whiley, 24, beat fellow Briton Lucy Shuker 6-1 6-1.
Reid will now face Joachim Gerard in the last four, while Whiley will play Aniek van Koot in the ladies' event.
In other matches, there were defeats for Alfie Hewett and Louise Hunt.
Hewett, 18, lost 6-0 6-4 to Belgium's Gerard, the number two seed, while Hunt, 25, was beaten 6-2 6-0 by Marjolein Buis of the Netherlands.
This is the first year that wheelchair singles has been included in the Wimbledon schedule and Whiley made an impressive start.

The Birmingham-born right-hander, who won the wheelchair doubles title at Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015, broke twice early on against Shuker and remained in control.
Having broken serve twice more in the second set, Whiley wrapped things up on her fourth match point when Fleet's Shuker, 35, sent a backhand into the net.
Reid impressed in his quarter-final tie in front of vocal support on Court 17, with the Duchess of Cambridge watching the first set from a balcony on Centre Court.
"She (the Duchess of Cambridge) was lovely," he told BBC Scotland later. "She was just asking me about my competition here, when I started and a little bit about how the wheelchair moves on the grass, so that was really nice. And she came out to watch my match as well, so that was pretty special."
The Glasgow-based right-hander managed to overpower his opponent, despite being broken once in each set, and won on his first match point when Peifer sent a backhand long.
He will now face Gerard, who he beat in the Australian Open final in January, in the last four.
"We had a little match together in Melbourne earlier this year," Reid added.
"Jo's a great player; he had a good performance today against Alfie. I'd have put him down as favourite before the start of the event.
"He's got a big serve and he likes to come forward, which is obviously a good tactic on grass. So it's going to be a really tough match.
"At the same time, I think if I play like I did today, especially at the start of the match, I can make it difficult for him and anything's possible."
