The incident happened in the Clovenstone Road area of Wester Hailes at about 21:00 on 3 February.
The girl was hit on the back of the head while she was walking along the path and woke up in the wood.
Police have appealed for information about the incident, which was only recently reported.
It is believed she was the victim of a serious sexual assault while she was unconscious.
Det Insp Julie Marshall, of Police Scotland, said: "I want to commend the victim for her bravery in coming forward and reassure the community that we have launched an extensive investigation into this.
"Since this was reported to us on 14 June we've had specialist resources in attendance at the scene and local officers are continuing to conduct inquiries within the area.
"We're also appealing to anyone who may have seen suspicious behaviour in the area around 3 February, or has any information which can help, to get in touch as soon as possible."
