The film, Where You're Meant To Be, was premiered at the Glasgow Film Festival in February.
It follows Moffat, former singer with indie rock band Arab Strap, as he explores Scottish music and folklore.
The documentary features rival Loch Ness Monster hunters and 79-year-old folk singer Sheila Stewart.
Moffat and Fegan also documented a crofter singing at his kitchen table on the Isle of Skye and chainmail clad re-enactors portraying events from history in a village cemetery outside Oban.
The tour starting later this month includes dates in Aberdeen, Dundee, Drumnadrochit, Bo'ness, Blairgowrie, Kirkcaldy and Edinburgh.
