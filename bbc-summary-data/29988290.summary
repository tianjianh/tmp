Portugal Telecom shares spike on bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shares in Portugal Telecom have jumped following a €1.2bn (£940m) bid by the Angolan president's daughter.

Isabel dos Santos has offered €1.35 a share for Portugal Telecom, which is controlled by Brazilian telecommunications group Oi.
The company described the bid as inopportune, ill-timed and inappropriate.
Her move is an attempt to derail a €7bn offer for Oi's Portuguese assets by French company Altice.
Oi is still considering the offer made last week by Altice, which is controlled by Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi.
The eldest daughter of Angola's president is Africa's first female billionaire.

Altice already owns two small cable companies in Portugal and buying the assets of the former state-owned monopoly would help it compete with rivals Vodafone and Optimus.
The offer from Ms dos Santos's Terra Peregrin represented an 11% premium to the closing price of Portugal Telecom on Friday and sent the shares up by 12% to €1.37 on Monday.
Oi is considering selling the Portuguese assets it acquired by taking over Portugal Telecom to pay down some of its $18bn debt mountain.
The Brazilian company's merger with Portugal Telecom soured in the summer after the Rioforte holding company of the Espirito Santo banking family - ultimately a shareholder in PT -  defaulted on nearly €900m of debt owed to PT. Oi said it had not been aware of the debt before the merger.
As a result Portugal Telecom's stake in Oi was slashed, leaving it with just 25.6% of Oi rather than the 38% originally agreed. It also led to the resignation last month of Zeinal Bava, the chief executive of the new company and former chief executive of Portugal Telecom.
The 25.6% stake in Oi is the only asset now held by Portugal Telecom.
Shares in Portugal Telecom have fallen by about 60% in recent months following the debt scandal.
