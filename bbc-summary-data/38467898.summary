Martin Jones, coxswain since 2010, has been on more than 700 call-outs from north Wales' busiest lifeboat station.
An RNLI flood rescue team volunteer, he helped save 74 people in Cumbria during the storms of December 2015.
Mr Jones said he was "extremely proud and thankful".
He added: "To be honest, this award isn't just for me - it's recognition of the lifeboat station, the local community, and most importantly it's for my family, who have allowed me to drop everything and leave important events when the pagers go."
Flintshire secondary school headteacher Rosemary Jones was appointed an OBE for her contribution to education.
The head of Buckley's Ysgol Elfed High, who has taught in the area for more than 30 years, led the school to an "excellent" Estyn rating in 2015.
Mrs Jones said she was "surprised and delighted".
"I feel privileged to work with young people, their families and educational professionals across Wales, and look forward to contributing to the further development of education in the country," she said.
Joan Aird, secretary of the Hawarden, Ewloe and Mancot branch of the Royal British Legion, was also recognised with a BEM for voluntary service to the community in Deeside, Flintshire.
