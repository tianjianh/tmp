Bristol Aerospace Centre: Sneak peek at exhibits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Since its final flight 12 years ago, the last Concorde to take to the skies has sat exposed to the elements on a runway outside Bristol. But the grounded jet is soon to become the centrepiece of a new museum.

After its last, poignant fly-over of its home city, the 216 jet has sat on the tarmac in the Filton area of Bristol.
Meanwhile, an army of volunteers gathered a huge collection of items documenting the history of flight, which they stored in a lonely hangar in the Cotswolds.
The grounded jet and the hoard of aviation treasures are to be brought together at Bristol's Aerospace Centre, documenting the city's central role in the development of the modern aviation industry.
Here are some of the exhibits.
The Bristol Aerospace Centre is expected to open in 2017.
