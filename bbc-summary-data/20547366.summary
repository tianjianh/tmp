The 29-year-old, who was appointed vice-captain of the side last month, has scored more than 10,000 runs since his first-class debut in 2002.
"I am delighted to have signed for the next four years," he said.
"Our success over the past decade has been great to be part of and I look forward to continuing that."
Nash, who joined the county at the age of nine, scored just shy of 1,000 runs and took 21 wickets in the County Championship last season while also contributing with bat and ball in both one-day formats.
He added: "Personally, I want to continue my good form across all competitions again next season and continue to push for higher honours."
Sussex coach Mark Robinson was delighted that Nash, who is currently spending his winter playing club cricket for Western Province in South Africa, has prolonged his stay at Hove.
"It is good news to know that Chris will be here for a minimum of the next four years, as we embark on an important time for the club," Robinson said.
"It is not only Chris's proven abilities with the bat and ball that we will be relying on, but also his ability to support and lead the team in his role as vice-captain."
