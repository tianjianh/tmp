Local media has reported Stacey Tierney, 29, was found dead in Dreams ­Gentlemen's Club in Melbourne on 19 December.
The former fitness instructor from Manchester may have lain undiscovered for up to 12 hours, the Herald Sun reported.
Her death is being reported as "unexplained" by Australian police.
Victoria Police said a post-mortem examination was to be held to investigate the cause of death.
Ms Tierney's body was found at the club about 11:50 local time, Victoria Police said.
In a statement the force said: "The exact circumstances surrounding the English woman's death are yet to be determined and a post mortem will be conducted."
Police did not say whether Ms Tierney's death was being treated as suspicious.
Ms Tierney studied dance at Oldham College and had worked as a fitness instructor at Nitro Boxing Fitness Centre and Manchester Aquatics Centre before moving to Australia.
Dreams ­Gentlemen's Club said it was not making any comment on the incident.
The online funding page set up by Ms Tierney's cousin Colleen Sarah has raised more than £11,000.
"As some of you may know we sadly lost our beautiful Stacey on Monday," a message on the page reads.
"Stacey was living her life to the full in Australia and she has made a huge impact on everyone who knew her.
"We just want to bring her home and give her an amazing funeral."
John Rushton posted a message on the page which said: "Such sad news to hear of the passing of our beautiful bridesmaid.
"We have many treasured memories and Stacey will be so sadly missed.
"Stacey you will [always] be forever in our hearts. Our Sincere condolences to all family and friends."
