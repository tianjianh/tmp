C&T Auctioneers in Kent received the collection from a 72-year-old historian who had amassed the items over a period of more than 30 years.
The anonymous seller claimed he never worked as a spy himself.
He told BBC South East: "I have had the pleasure of owning them and feel it is time that another collector or museum has the opportunity.
"I would like to think they will go to a collector who will cherish them as much as I have over the years."
Other items sold in the auction on Tuesday included a watch with a hidden microphone, which was bought for £550, a rare special forces escape utility knife, which went for £1,600, and an assassination lapel spike, sold for £420.
It is not known who bought the items.
