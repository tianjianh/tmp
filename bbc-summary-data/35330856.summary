Coventry's Jim O'Brien had an effort tipped onto the bar before Jack Payne's low effort put the hosts ahead.
Barnett ran onto a Stephen Hendrie through ball to slot home a second.
Gary Deegan was then dismissed for a second yellow on 51 minutes, but Barnett ensured victory from the penalty spot, after City keeper Reice Charles-Cook had fouled Will Atkinson.
Coventry slip to fifth, six points off top spot in League One, after three games without a win, while Phil Brown's Southend climb to ninth, within two points of a play-off place.
Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"Obviously we're disappointed. We struggled from the start really.
"We haven't got any excuses. We were beaten by a team who were very resilient. They dug in and didn't give us a minute on the ball.
"We came here with a very experienced team. They defended resiliently, put a lot of men behind the ball and made life difficult for us."
