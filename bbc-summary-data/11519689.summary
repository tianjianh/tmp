Nurses attend tribute to Florence Nightingale in Derby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stained glass window featuring Florence Nightingale has been unveiled in a Derby church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The window, rededicated at St Peter's Church, used to be in two former hospital chapels.
The ceremony also celebrated the centenary of Florence Nightingale's death and gave thanks for her work.
As part of the service, a replica lamp of the one she took to the Crimea was handed over from former nurses to current hospital staff.
The window had originally been in two successive chapels in the Derby Royal Infirmary and its nine panels were removed for restoration when that main hospital complex closed.
Former nurse Pat Crapper modelled for one of the images in 1959.
She said: "Matron just came down one day with an architect and said 'Stand still while they sketch your uniform' - and when it went up it was me.
"I'm glad they've managed it. It would be a shame to lose it, wouldn't it?"
