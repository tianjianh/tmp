Archive images of Skye in new arts project

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Photographs showing life in Kyleakin in Skye between the late 1950s and early 1970s feature in a new arts project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The images were selected from more than 400 slides made by photographer Joan Wilcock, who died in 1994.
The project called Travelling The Archive is a collaborative effort.
It involves Skye-based Atlas Arts, artist Nicky Bird, Kyleakin Local History Society and the Portree-based Highland Archive which is operated by High Life Highland.
A selection of the images will be installed and projected indoors and out of doors in Kyleakin on 19 March.
To promote the new arts projects, photographer Colin Hattersley set up shots of some of today's islanders with prints of Ms Wilcock's portraits.
