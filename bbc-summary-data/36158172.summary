Happy Ed Balls day, from Ed Balls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Happy Ed Balls Day! Who knew that five years ago, a Twitter fail would still be remembered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
And now Ed Balls and his family are joining in the celebrations.
It all started on 28 April 2011 when Ed Balls was shadow chancellor. He was urged by his aide to look on Twitter for articles mentioning his name, but instead of doing a  simple search he tweeted his own name in error.
Since then on 28 April every year Twitter rejoices in the madness of the internet gaffe and marks Ed Balls Day.
As Ed Balls Day draws to a close, his wife MP Yvette Cooper has been urging him to join in.
Finally after thousands of tweets Ed Balls himself responded to his Twitter fans with a photo of a cake to mark the occasion.
The hashtag #EdBallsDay has been the top trend in the UK and has been used over 26,000 times.
Some have even tried to start their own trend.
Others are happy to share the love.
And Brian Bilston has even been inspired to write poetry
