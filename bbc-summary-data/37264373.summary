[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cameron Jerome scored from close range and Russell Martin headed in from a corner to put the hosts 2-0 up.
Anthony Pilkington's late goal gave Cardiff hope of a comeback, only for Josh Murphy to score Norwich's third.
Pilkington struck again in added time but the Bluebirds' defeat sees them drop to 19th, just one point above the relegation zone.
Although Cardiff enjoyed some early possession, Norwich took the lead with the first real attack of the game.
Cardiff goalkeeper Ben Wilson could only palm Jacob Murphy's cross into the path of Jerome, who finished inside the six-yard box against his former club.
Rickie Lambert was twice denied a goal on his Cardiff debut, with one header tipped over by Michael McGovern and another hitting the bar.
Martin appeared to have sealed Norwich's win with his free header after an hour, but Pilkington scrambled in a goal for Cardiff to spark a frantic finale.
Substitute Murphy restored the Canaries' two-goal advantage and, although Pilkington scored a second against his former side, Norwich held on.
Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"I could have done without what happened at the end. I enjoyed the first 85 minutes of the match but I'll admit I was sweating towards the end.
"I think the lads clocked off because they thought the points were in the bag. We got done by two set-pieces, which was frustrating, but I'll take the win.
"We didn't start the game particularly well and when we scored it was against the run of the play, but once it went 1-0 I thought we controlled the game and looked reasonably comfortable until the closing stages."
Cardiff manager Paul Trollope:
"We came here with a plan and were confident we could get something against a good Norwich side and I was pleased with the way we went about it.
"I don't want to be known as one of those coaches who always comes and says 'we didn't get what we deserved', but I really thought that was the case.
"Having said that I was disappointed with the first two goals we conceded, they were both soft. The first one was a poor cross that somehow ended up in the back of the net and for the second we switched off at a set-piece.
"The main positive from my point of view was the spirit the lads showed when they went 2-0 down. They showed what they are all about by making a real game of it."
