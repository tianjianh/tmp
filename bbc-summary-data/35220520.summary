The explosion happened in the early hours of Monday at the post office branch in Long Ashton, near Bristol.
Avon and Somerset Police said three people were arrested and are being held on suspicion of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.
The Post Office's owners, David Andrews and Andrew Crabb, said they were "devastated" by the news.
Police said they wanted to hear from anybody who was in the area at about 03:30 GMT.
A spokesman said cash was stolen but it was not yet known how much was missing.
The owners, who are away on holiday, learned of the news after being called by the police.
They said they were now flying home to "assess the damage" to the store.
"We would like to thank everyone in the community who has been so supportive at this time," the pair added.
