Rose Property Consultants' plans for Nene Park in Irthlingborough, the former home of Rushden and Diamonds, include a multi-use football facility and entertainment and retail zones.
Up to 170 jobs could be created if the plans go ahead, it said.
The proposals are due to be displayed later and on Saturday at Huxlow Science College in the town.
Rushden and Diamonds was founded by Max Griggs in 1992 by the amalgamation of Rushden Town and Irthlingborough Diamonds.
After building a 6,500-seat state-of-the-art stadium in Irthlingborough, the club was half way up the third tier of football when Mr Griggs pulled out in 2005 for financial reasons.
The club was sold to a supporters' trust but it eventually folded in 2011.
Shortly afterwards, Kettering Town played at the ground for 18 months but could not afford its long term upkeep.
Elements of the heritage of Rushden and Diamonds are due to be conserved, the consultants said.
The plans are due to be shown later between 16:00 and 19:00 BST and between 10:00 and 14:00 BST on Saturday.
