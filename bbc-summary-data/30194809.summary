Sarah Champion, the Rotherham Central MP, made the remarks in a BBC debate on how the town should move on after a report on child sexual exploitation.
But South Yorkshire Police said while reports of abuse directed at Asian people had increased, incidents of violence had not.
The debate will be aired on BBC Radio Sheffield at 09:00 GMT on Wednesday.
The  report by Prof Alexis Jay, published in August, revealed that 1,400 children in Rotherham had been sexually exploited by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani origin, between 1997 and 2013.
The findings prompted marches in the town by right-wing groups the English Defence League, in September and November, and Britain First in October.
Ms Champion told the BBC: "I had a meeting with eight young Asian girls and they told me they've been too scared to go into town for the past three months because when they do, they get threatened.
"Since the [marches] coming through, they said they've been getting white right-wing men having a go at them in town."
Ms Champion said the men had suggested they would rape the women to "even things up".
South Yorkshire Police said it had not received any reports of this kind of incident but urged anyone who had witnessed this to contact police.
Earlier this week, 80 people signed a pledge to tackle child sexual exploitation in the town and an awareness campaign, Spot the Signs, was launched across South Yorkshire.
Listen to the debate on how Rotherham should move on BBC Radio Sheffield at 09:00 GMT on Wednesday.
