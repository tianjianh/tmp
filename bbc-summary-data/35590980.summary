Baa-rking mad: Sheep spotted in back of car in Abergele

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheep being transported in lorries is a fairly regular sight in rural parts of Wales, but seeing them in a car is not.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Farley, 19, spotted this animal in the back of a Nissan Micra in Abergele, Conwy county on Sunday.
He said: "I'd just been to McDonald's. As we were leaving in the car I looked to my left and saw something moving... then realised it was a sheep.
"I double glanced. I told my mate to stop the car so I could take a picture."
Mr Farley, from Denbigh, Denbighshire, added: "I was just picturing the scenario of the farmer, I assume, bundling the sheep into the back of that little tin car. I didn't think it was real at first."
