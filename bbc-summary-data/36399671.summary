There is still a 300mm gap between the two, however, which will be levelled by counter balancing the tower deck with a further section on the south end.
Attaching and tensioning the stay cables to the deck unit will also make it straight.
The project is due for completion in December 2016.
A Transport Scotland spokesman said: "More visible progress was made on the Queensferry Crossing on Thursday evening as the remaining deck section was lifted between the Queensferry Crossing's north tower deck fan and the north approach viaduct.
"At present the deck fan from the north tower is lower than the viaduct deck, with a 300 mm gap between the two.
"This will be levelled by counter balancing the tower deck with a further section on the south end of the fan and attaching and tensioning the stay cables to the deck unit.
"There is then a complex technical process of fine tuning the various temporary loads the superstructure faces during construction before the 300 mm gap will be fully closed later in the year."
