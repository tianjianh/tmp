Toy Story 4 will be a romcom, with less of a focus on the relationship between the characters and children.

Pixar studio president Jim Morris made the revelation in an interview to Spanish fan site Disney Latino, in which he talked about the future direction of the animated franchise.
"It will be a love story," he said. "It will be a romantic comedy.
"It will not put much focus on the interaction between the characters and children."
John Lasseter, who directed Toy Story and Toy Story 2, is returning to direct the new film, which is due for release on 16 June, 2017.
The new story was created by the original Toy Story writing team of Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter and Lee Unkrich.
Morris said that, although Toy Story 4 would pick up from the events at the end of the last film, it wouldn't be a continuation.
"The third film ended in a beautiful way and completed a trilogy," he told Disney Latino blog.
"This movie isn't part of the trilogy. It's a separate story and I don't know if will be continued."
The news of a fourth Toy Story film didn't go down well with fans when it was announced in November.
Many told Newsbeat that it should have ended with the third film.
But Morris denied they were reviving the franchise just to make money.
"The decision to make a second or third [film] entirely depends on how passionate the director of the project is.
"Fortunately, our films are successful and we don't have to keep having to make sequels to make money."
2010's Toy Story 3 was the highest-grossing animated film of all time, before Frozen knocked it off the top spot last year.
The third instalment of the series also won two Oscars - for best animated feature and best original song.
Some of its iconic characters were already well-known toys, such as the Etch-A-Sketch and Mr Potato Head, while others like Woody and Buzz Lightyear became toys after being invented for the film.
