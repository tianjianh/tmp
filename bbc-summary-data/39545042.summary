Coleraine's continuing run of good form has been recognised by Bannsiders boss Oran Kearney being awarded the March manager of the month prize.

Kearney received the recognition after his side picked up 10 points from four difficult league fixtures and continued their progress to the Irish Cup final.
Coleraine are now unbeaten in 16 games in all competitions, winning 14 of them, having not lost since Boxing Day.
They lie third in the table and will face Linfield in the Irish Cup final.
The Ballycastle Road outfit are also in a good position to secure a potentially lucrative place in the Europa League qualifying rounds.
"It's nice to have that record (of being unbeaten in 2017) but it doesn't give you a God-given right to win a football match," said Kearney, who also won the January managers' award.
"We need to continue to hit the same levels and with the top six teams playing each other now, anything can happen in any given match."
Coleraine beat Glentoran, Glenavon and Crusaders in Premiership games during the month of March, and also drew a rearranged match with derby rivals Ballymena United.
They comfortably accounted for United 4-0 at the quarter-finals stage of the cup and subsequently defeated Glenavon 2-1 to clinch a place in the showpiece occasion of the season on 6 May for the first time since 2008.
