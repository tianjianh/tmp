A performance marking the event was part of Cosmic Collisions, a two-day celebration of art, architecture and science taking place in and around Sanquhar in south-west Scotland.
Charles Jencks' work is called Galactic Collisions.
The work was launched with Sea Hames, by the performance theatre company Oceanallover.
Charles Jencks said: "The whole event has been a huge success, our own Big Bang. It's been fabulous to see how much people of all ages have enjoyed this fusion of art, science and architecture.
"It has been such a privilege to be able to bring some of the world's leading space scientists, architects and others to Sanquhar and as part of such an enjoyable and colourful event."
