A Kenyan inquest into the death of the son of an English lord has been adjourned to give the family time to study police statements.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Monson, 28, was arrested in Diani on suspicion of possessing cannabis in May 2012 and died in police custody.
Kenyan Police have denied any involvement in his death.
The inquest in Mombasa was adjourned until 27 April to allow closer study of the documents.
Mr Monson was heir to his family's Burton estate in Lincolnshire.
An independent pathologist hired by his family found he died from a head injury. The family was originally told he died of a drugs overdose.
The family lawyer said they had been kept in the dark about the findings of three separate investigations into his death.
