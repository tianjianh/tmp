Why one football club won't be lowering ticket prices (despite mega TV deal)

It's the deal that's shaken football.

With the bank manager just about finished with the calculator, criticism of the sport's biggest ever TV arrangement has started.
First the pundits and politicians, then those that quite frankly matter the most: the fans.
Supporters' groups from nearly half of all Premier League clubs have told Newsbeat they've got "no faith" the Â£5.136 billion deal will help bring down ticket prices.
"It's time to fulfil the true potential of this TV deal, the players are paid enough already lets see the fans get some benefit for a change," said Martin Smith from Stoke City Supporters Trust.
"It's time to reintroduce sensible ticket prices, which will give the game back to ordinary people, especially the young who find themselves priced out."
Fans from Manchester United, Hull City, Leicester City and Burnley agree. They have all told us the TV deal is looking after the clubs and not the fans.
So could the contract signed between the Premier League, Sky Sports and BT price fans out of the game?
Stoke City chairman Peter Coates has spoken exclusively to Newsbeat.
"I don't see why that should be so," he explained.
"We do play to very high attendance ratios, obviously people are coming and we have to ensure that continues, that's up to the clubs.
"Clearly the major source of income for football clubs in the Premier League is television revenue. I believe there is an opportunity for clubs to make sure (ticket) prices are more affordable."
Leading politicians have called for more money from the sale of domestic TV rights to be put into grassroots football and reducing ticket prices.
Former England internationals Gary Lineker and Jamie Carragher are among those who feel the revenue increase should result in cheaper tickets.
The BBC's Price of Football survey last year showed that the average price of cheapest tickets in England has risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011.
As part of its current TV contract, the Premier League says it has invested Â£56m in grassroots football in each of the last three seasons.
We will have to wait and see how this is affected by the new contract.
"We won't be lowering ticket prices," admits Peter Coates.
"We will probably freeze them though and we have done that several times since the last deal. We also support away travel, we subsidise coaches.
"Football supporters want the best players and that's what the Premier League delivers.
"It is a great product which demonstrates itself by the kind of money we are getting for TV rights."
