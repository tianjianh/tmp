The right-back has agreed a contract until June 2019 on his 17th birthday, having impressed in three EFL Trophy appearances this season.
Davies has been with Cambridge since he was eight years old.
"Our long-term vision for the success of our club is to create pathways for our best young players into the first team," said chief executive Jez George.
"That is why Shaun (Derry, Cambridge manager) deserves credit in being so invested in the progress of our young players and willing to give them an opportunity in the first team."
George added: "We know that our players are coveted by other clubs.
"Therefore, it is extremely important that we are proactive in securing their futures and that we create an environment in which they recognise their best route into professional football is with Cambridge United."
