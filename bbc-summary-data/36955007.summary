Hull City 'not big enough' for Wales manager Chris Coleman - Sam Ricketts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-Hull City defender Sam Ricketts says the club is not big enough for Chris Coleman to leave Wales to take over as manager.

The Football Association of Wales (FAW) has rejected an approach by the Premier League club to speak to Coleman.
Welsh international Ricketts, who spent three seasons with Hull, does not believe it is the right job for Wales' manager.
"I can't see Hull being a big enough pull for Chris Coleman," Ricketts said.
"I don't think Hull is the right job for Chris Coleman and I don't think it's a big enough job for him to leave what he's built at Wales.
"But if a job come along which he feels can't necessarily turn down or thinks is too good an opportunity to turn down then I think that might be the only way for him to leave.
"I do believe that if Chris Coleman really wanted to become manager of Hull City I think he could force it."
Coleman is one of the candidates Hull have targeted to replace Steve Bruce, who resigned in July after a breakdown in his relationship with Hull vice-chairman Ehab Allam.
Hull's owners put plans to sell the club on hold after Bruce's departure to "ensure stability in the transfer window", with the senior squad reduced to only 13 fit players.
Fans are planning a protest against the "ill-considered ideas" of the newly-promoted club's owners on the first day of the Premier League season.
Ex-West Ham and Watford boss Gianfranco Zola, Roberto Martinez, sacked by Everton in May, and former Unites States coach Bob Bradley have also been linked with the vacancy.
Former Fulham and Coventry boss Coleman guided Wales to the Euro 2016 semi-finals a month after signing a new two-year contract with the FAW.
He has already said the 2018 World Cup campaign, which begins with the qualifier Moldova at Cardiff City Stadium on 5 September, will be his last in charge of Wales.
FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford said earlier in July that he was hopeful Coleman would honour his two-year contract extension.
But Ford acknowledged it would be difficult to keep Coleman if he decided he wanted to manage a club side before then.
Coventry City defender Ricketts is not surprised Coleman, whom he played under during a Wales career in which he won 52 caps, is in demand after Wales' exploits at Euro 2016.
"Any club that sacks their manager or is looking for a new one will consider Chris Coleman," Ricketts told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"What Wales did in the summer has brought Chris Coleman as a manager to the forefront.
"I wouldn't imagine this to be the last approach the Welsh FA get for their manager."
