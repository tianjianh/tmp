[SN]TITLE[SN]
What happens in Parliament after the election?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2015-17 Parliament dissolved on 3 May for the election campaign. What will the new MPs be up to at the start of the new Parliament?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The father of the House - now Conservative Ken Clarke following the death of Sir Gerald Kaufman - sits in the Chair of the Commons before Black Rod comes to summon MPs to the House of Lords.
MPs then return to the Commons where the father of the House presides over the election of a Speaker.
The former Speaker, John Bercow, is not expected to face a challenge and will give a speech of thanks before being congratulated by senior figures.
MPs will return to the House of Lords to receive Royal Approbation (approval) of its choice of Speaker, and, on returning to the Commons, members will begin to swear in.
The first to be sworn in is the speaker, followed by father of the House, members of the Cabinet and shadow cabinet, other privy counsellors and ministers, then other MPs by length of service
MPs can either swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen, which is generally done using a Bible or Koran, or make a solemn affirmation, which does not have a religious element.
Swearing-in continues, and the House will not sit on 16 June.
State Opening will take place, although the exact date is not yet known.
The BBC understands it has been changed from the original date of Monday 19 June.
As BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt reported in April, that the occasion is expected to be a "dressed-down" affair.
Members can follow the Speaker and party leaders out of the Commons chamber to hear the speech delivered in the Lords. Afterwards, the House may meet again to allow swearing-in to continue before the start of the Queen's Speech debate.
The debate takes place on a motion formally thanking the Queen for her speech, with a proposer and a seconder chosen by the government. It's followed by an end-of-day adjournment debate.
The debate on the Queen's Speech usually lasts for six sitting days and is expected to conclude on 27 June.
The Speaker will announce at the start of the debate which subjects are to be covered, and there will be an adjournment debate each day.
On the final day of the debate on the Queen's Speech, the House votes on the motion, and there may be votes on amendments to the motion on the penultimate and final days.
