Englishman Lewis, 25, was 12 under par after 13 holes in Farso, but finished with a nine-under-par 62, equalling the course record.
"Maybe I thought too much or tried too hard, hence the finish," said Lewis.
He is tied with Joakim Lagergren and Thomas Pieters, who partnered Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke.
Belgian Pieters is a contention to earn one of the three wildcards in the European team, which will be announced next week.
"I did all I could in front of Darren. He has a lot on his mind other than golf and we will just have to wait and see," he said.
