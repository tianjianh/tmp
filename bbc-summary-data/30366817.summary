Passengers were terrified as a gust of wind sent empty carriages swinging at the top of the 60m (198ft) Sky Swing at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland.
Sayers Amusements, which operates it, said there was no fault with the ride.
It said it shut down automatically - as it should - when the wind got too strong on Friday.
The operator released a statement after it had investigated what happened on the towering ride.
It said when the ride started the wind had not exceeded the ride's  wind speed limit, which is 10m per second.
However, when gusts picked up the ride shut down.
"It took less than five minutes to get all gondolas unloaded," the operator said.
"No one was hurt as the safety system was working correctly at all times, and a full explanation was given to everyone on the ride, and they were all given a full refund, and all stayed onsite for a while afterwards."
It added that the ride re-opened after the wind eased.
The Winter Wonderland is a Cardiff Council event and the authority said it has sought assurances steps have been taken to ensure there is not another incident.
