[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tayo Wesley, 39, from Earls Court, fatally stabbed 59-year-old Tony Charlery in the neck in Notting Hill on 29 August 2014.
The police said Wesley thought Mr Charley was responsible for the death of his sister 15 years ago.
Wesley will serve a minimum of 21 years after being convicted of murder at Kingston Crown Court.
Det Insp Sarah McConnell said: "Wesley had harboured a serious grudge against Anthony Charlery for many years, believing him responsible for the death of his sister.
"He claimed he did not mean to kill Anthony, but had lost control when approached by him due to their shared history."
Wesley's sister Bolajai died in 1999 after falling out of a third-floor window in Earls Court, the court heard.
Mr Charlery, who was living with her at the time, was acquitted of any crime by a jury at the Old Bailey in 2002, to the "fury of Wesley", police said.
In 2004, Wesley attacked Mr Charlery with an iron bar outside his home and stood trial for causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was acquitted.
He later admitted he carried out the attack, officers said.
During his trial, Wesley admitted manslaughter but denied murder on the grounds of loss of control.
