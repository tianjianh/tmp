Cycle path plans backed by councillors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a controversial cycle path through Edinburgh have been agreed in principle by city councillors.

But the council is to set up a group to "resolve outstanding design issues".
The proposed cycle route will link Leith Walk in the east of the city to Roseburn in the west, via the city centre and Haymarket.
The plans include reducing four lanes of traffic from Roseburn to Haymarket to two, and using half a carriageway and a bus lane for cyclists.
Supporters of the path said it was vital for cutting congestion and would provide a safe route across the city. They said it would also encourage more active travel.
But residents and shop owners in the Roseburn area said reducing loading bays to make way for bikes would have a huge impact on passing trade, and that reducing traffic lanes could increase congestion at Roseburn.
The council said the new working group would be set up to help resolve outstanding design issues with the plans.
It said work would start immediately to secure further funding and to "make preparations to commence the necessary statutory processes for the scheme".
A final decision will be taken after the the working group's discussions.
Transport convener Councillor Lesley Hinds said the council was still "100% committed" to the project but acknowledged it had divided opinion.
She said a new group would be formed to try to reach a conclusion on the final route design "which the majority are happy with".
Ms Hinds added: "Given the strength of feeling out there about certain aspects of the plans, there's clearly still work to be done before the final route design is agreed."
