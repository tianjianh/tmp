His British trainer Ed Dunlop said: "This is my saddest day in racing. Red Cadeaux was a much-loved member of our family."
The horse was injured in the Australian race on 3 November, but it had been hoped he would recover, until complications set in.
Red Cadeaux won seven and finished second in 13 of his 54 races.
Owner Ron Arculli said the popular nine-year-old gelding's final resting place would be at Flemington Racecourse where he was second in the Melbourne Cup three times.
"For a race that stops a nation we were lucky to have a horse that touched a nation. We will miss Red Cadeaux dearly," he said.
Red Cadeaux was euthanised on Friday after blood stopped flowing to the foot on his injured left foreleg.
"Unfortunately the complication was irreversible and the decision to euthanise the horse, whilst terribly hard, was made in his best interests," said Dunlop.
Ridden by Gerald Mosse, the horse was pulled up injured in the race won by Prince of Penzance, whose jockey Michelle Payne was the first female rider to triumph in the race.
"Red Cadeaux has given us and the racing public so much joy competing with great distinction across the world," said Newmarket trainer Dunlop.
