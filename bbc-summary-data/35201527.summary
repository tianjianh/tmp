[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two areas of north Wales which were hit by recent flooding will be visited by First Minister Carwyn Jones.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Jones will visit Beaumaris on Anglesey and Tal-y-Bont near Bangor in Gwynedd on Thursday.
A string of weather warnings have been in place throughout Wales during December.
Speaking ahead of his visit, Mr Jones expressed his "heartfelt gratitude to all those involved in preventative, rescue and recovery work".
He will meet workers from the emergency services and look at the impact floodwater has had on roads in the area, especially the A55 dual carriageway.
It was completely closed at Bangor on Saturday, along with A5 routes, effectively cutting off north-west Wales.
The first minister said while this month has seen exceptional rainfall, the changing climate will see such problems "happening more frequently", so flood management remains a priority for the Welsh government.
He added: "My thoughts over the festive period have been with everyone, including many people in north and mid Wales, who have seen their homes and businesses affected by the recent flooding."
Three flood warnings are in place for the Lower Dee Valley in Wrexham, Abergwili in Carmarthenshire and Pontargothi and Pontynyswen in Carmarthenshire.
On Wednesday, Storm Frank brought heavy rain and winds of up to 75mph (120km/h), leading to more than 1,400 properties losing power across south Wales.
The wet weather also caused problems on the roads with the M4 flooding in two areas.
While the worst of the storm has passed, there were still problems on Thursday morning.
In Powys, about 160 homes had power cuts while replacement buses will serve Arriva Trains Wales services between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog due to flooding.
