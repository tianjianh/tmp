[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leeds United 1-2 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham beat Leeds at Elland Road for the second season running to leave Garry Monk's side still pointless.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors led on 15 minutes when Jacques Maghoma was credited with the goal after he, home keeper Rob Green and defender Charlie Taylor collided.
Winger Hadi Sacko levelled when Tomasz Kuszczak dived over his low shot.
But Blues captain Michael Morrison lashed in his side's second-half winner from close range after Leeds had failed to deal with Jonathan Grounds' cross.
Maghoma, who scored the second goal in last season's win at Elland Road, was involved in both goals as Blues improved on the disappointment of last week's goalless home draw with Cardiff City.
Gary Rowett's men claimed their first win without the need of either of their two new strikers, Che Adams, from Sheffield United, and Greg Stewart, from Dundee.
Their first victory in eight Championship games going back to 9 April extended their fine record of just one defeat in seven visits to Elland Road.
Leeds were the only EFL team who failed to register a shot on target in their opening game - the 3-0 defeat at QPR.
This time, in new boss Monk's first home game in charge, they managed just three shots - and one of those was Sacko's tame 27th-minute shot which somehow squirmed under Kuszczak's body.
Leeds United boss Garry Monk:
"I did not like that softness and I told the players that. When you are on the pitch you have to be a man. You have to put your body on the line and suffer.
"We gifted that game to Birmingham and I will not accept that. We did not have the determination and desire we needed in the second half. They have to have a strong mentality.
"We have a young group of players, but you are in a man's world and you have to do more than that. We are not here to put cotton wool around anyone. The players have the capability but they have to grow up fast.
Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett:
"It suits us playing away from home. Leeds did well in the first half and caused us bother with their runners. But we got into good areas often and limited them in the second half.
"It was a really strong, organised and tactically concentrated performance. We were in control of the game, We did not look under threat, only when we caused ourselves trouble.
"The keeper is disappointed with the goal. He made a mistake. Players make mistakes and you hope they don't make too many. He shouldn't have scored from there but it was an honest mistake and I will support him."
