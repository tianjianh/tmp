A man in his 40s was airlifted to Basildon Hospital. His injuries are described as serious but not life-threatening.
Officers are looking for a woman who left the scene and say they are "concerned for her welfare".
The man and the woman were known to each other, an Essex Police spokeswoman said. A weapon was recovered from the scene, she added.
The National Police Air Service helicopter based at Boreham, near Chelmsford, said on its Twitter account that it was also involved in looking for the woman.
