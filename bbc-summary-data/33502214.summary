Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic will win "four or five more Grand Slams" in the next two years, according to former world number one John McEnroe.

Djokovic, 28, beat Roger Federer on Sunday to retain his title, his third at SW19 and his ninth Major in total.
"Novak is just coming into his prime and it is pretty hard not to think that he is getting stronger and stronger," McEnroe told BBC Sport.
"If he stays healthy, he is going to dominate the next couple of years."
Djokovic has been top of the world rankings for the last 53 weeks and has won two out of the three Grand Slams this year, losing in the French Open final.
"He is definitely into my all-time top five," added McEnroe. "My top four are Rod Laver, Pete Sampras, Roger and Rafael Nadal but Novak is at number five and rising.
"Novak does not have as many Grand Slams as those guys but I am thinking his total is going to rise quickly.
"He could be moving up even further in my eyes, but he has already jumped some people by winning Wimbledon again."
Djokovic's best year since he turned professional in 2003 came in 2011 when he won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.
He won only two more majors in the next two-and-a-half years but McEnroe, who won three Wimbledon titles, does not foresee any more lapses in form from the Serbian.
"He is a different player now," McEnroe explained. "Mentally he is tougher but he has also added more to his game.
"He is a better volleyer, he is more resilient defensively, and he is also a better returner.
"Now he is not just able to do that consistently, he also steps in and just crushes the ball.
"I did not think that was possible, but he is more aggressive now when before there were times that he was content to just get it back."
Djokovic also seems settled off the court, celebrating his first wedding anniversary with Jelena during Wimbledon fortnight, and enjoying family life with son Stefan, who was born in October last year.
"He seems supremely motivated," said McEnroe. "His dream must be to win a Calendar Slam, which he can't do this year because he lost in the final in Paris.
"It is not going to be easy, but at the same time he keeps finding ways to push himself.
"He has got a great team and emotionally he is in a great place so you have got to think he has got a couple more great chances.
"I am always pulling for the top guys to stay healthy so they can maximise their potential. He certainly is right now."
