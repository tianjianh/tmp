[SN]TITLE[SN]
Candidates for the North Norfolk constituency give their views

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The North Norfolk constituency is set to be high on the list of seats Conservatives want to take from the Liberal Democrats, and with UKIP stepping aside, former minister Norman Lamb's 2015 majority of 4,000 is in their sights.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Lamb supported remain in the European Union referendum in a strongly euro-sceptic area where last time around UKIP garnered more than 8,000 votes.
The North Norfolk constituency contains the holiday resorts of Sheringham, Cromer and Wells-next-the-Sea, along with the small inland towns of Holt, North Walsham and Fakenham, and many more villages.
The constituency has a high number of elderly people, with 4% of the population over 85 years, making pensions and social care key issues.
It is also an agricultural area and issues such subsidies for farming after Brexit will figure high in many people's minds.
North Norfolk had the rare distinction of being an agricultural seat which elected a Labour MP between 1945 and 1970 and had a strong tradition of organised agricultural trade unionism.
The Conservative Sir Ralph Howell took the seat in 1970 and it remained Tory until Norman Lamb of the Liberal Democrats won the seat in 2001.
The candidates, profiled in alphabetical order according to their surname:
I am the only candidate who lives and works in North Norfolk, so I know the issues facing voters here. I am involved in improving health, housing and care in North Norfolk. I have extensive experience running national charities and working across government to champion the case for investment here.
Universal mobile and broadband coverage.
Universal mobile and broadband coverage.
I have played football at Chelsea, Fulham and QPR.
I would have loved to have been alive when Clem Attlee was Prime Minister in the pioneering post-war government. I was fortunate to campaign in the USA for Barack Obama when he was elected in 2008. Both would be great.
I have demonstrated my passion and commitment to my community, North Norfolk, for the last 16 years. As an MP, I have worked hard to give a voice to those who are disadvantaged and marginalised in society - and in particular, fighting on behalf of those with mental ill health.
A bold solution to the crisis in NHS and social care. I want an NHS we can be proud of on its 70th birthday - properly funded, treating mental and physical conditions with equal priority, and joined-up with a compassionate social care system that meets today's needs.
I would deliver a fairer, sustainable way of funding health and social care to ensure dignity in old age, including the cap on care costs I fought for as health minister. I would invest more in children's education, so that they can flourish and make the most of their talents.
I re-mortgaged my house to fund a grime album.  My eldest son, Archie, is a music producer who discovered the artist Tinchy Stryder. We helped him launch his breakthrough album, which spawned three Top 10 singles including two that topped the charts. Talented man!
Jo Grimond. He was a great liberal thinker - a radical - who was all about giving power to people. For him, politics was about empowering individuals to flourish and make decisions about their lives. That principle drives my determination to defend people's rights and give them more control over public services.
I'm standing to be MP for the area I grew up in because I want to make North Norfolk a better place and to live and work. As part of Theresa May's team, I will deliver a better deal for North Norfolk than it has had in the past.
I backed Brexit, like the majority of the people in North Norfolk. Now I want to see it delivered with the best possible deal for Brexit and beyond - not have the damaging uncertainty and attempt to undermine that vote with a second referendum which the Liberal Democrats want.
I would tackle long-running issues that North Norfolk has faced. My priorities are delivering comprehensive mobile coverage, ensuring every home and business gets high speed broadband by 2020, helping regenerate towns including North Walsham, delivering more affordable homes, good school places, and looking after people who have worked hard.
I've had a pint of Rockhopper in the Victory Bar in Port Stanley after meeting the penguins on the Falkland Islands.
The country needs Theresa May's strong and stable leadership. In an alternative scenario, then Winston Churchill was an inspirational leader who defined Britain's place in the world. He would get a good Brexit deal!
