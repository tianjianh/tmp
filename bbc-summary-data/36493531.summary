Simon Roberts, executive vice-president of Walgreens Boots Alliance and president of Boots, will  "pursue new opportunities", a statement said.
It comes after the Guardian reported that Boots claimed money from the NHS by giving face-to-face consultations for customers who did not need them.
The announcement was made as part of other senior management changes.
Stefano Pessina, executive vice-chairman and chief executive officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, said: "I would like to warmly thank Simon for his outstanding contribution and for the key role he played at Boots during the past 13 years of his career.
"We wish him the very best for the future."
Mr Roberts said: "Over the past three years we have achieved good progress in modernising our business to be better prepared for the opportunities and challenges of today's world and the strategy and plans to build an even better Boots are well on track.
"I've therefore come to realise that now is the right time for me to step away and consider new opportunities for the future, and for a new leader to take the business forward in the next phase."
Alex Gourlay, executive vice-president of Walgreens Boots Alliance and president of Walgreens, will take over responsibility for UK operations.
Elizabeth Fagan, currently senior vice-president of Walgreens Boots Alliance and managing director of its international retail division, will become Boots' new managing director and senior vice-president and will report to Mr Gourlay.
The announcements were made as part of a restructuring of Walgreens Boots Alliance and Boots' UK operations.
