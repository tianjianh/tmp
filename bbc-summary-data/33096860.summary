An inquest into the death of a pilot who died in a helicopter crash on the Isle of Man has been opened and adjourned at Douglas Court House.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Businessman Matthew Chapman, from Louth, Lincolnshire, was the only person on board the privately owned helicopter when it came down on 6 June.
The inquest heard Mr Chapman, 48, had dropped off two passengers shortly before the crash in the Baldwin Valley.
Coroner John Needham said the cause of death had "yet to be established".
The court heard Mr Chapman had set off from Milton Keynes at about 06:00 BST with two passengers on board his Bell Jetranger aircraft.
After travelling to the island, he dropped both of them off at the Creg Ny Baa, a popular viewing area for the annual TT races.
The court also heard that Mr Chapman had intended to refuel at Ronaldsway Airport before returning to the area to watch the races with friends.
But his helicopter came down at about 09:00 BST in a field on a hillside adjacent to the 33rd milestone on the Mountain Road.
Mr Chapman, whose body was found "trapped in wreckage", was pronounced dead at the scene.
A paramedic's report recorded "multiple trauma consistent with a helicopter crash".
Mr Needham said inquiries into the crash were being conducted by inspectors from the UK's Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB).
The inquest has been adjourned to a yet-to-be fixed date.
