The Public Health Agency (PHA) said the pneumococcal disease was detected in a number of employees.
It can cause infections, including pneumonia and meningitis.
It is understood four employees are infected.
Unite's Regional Coordinating Officer, Davy Thompson, said he was satisfied with the management response to date, and said more than 450 workers were screened and offered immunisation on Saturday.
"Management has engaged with the PHA to coordinate their response to four workers being hospitalised with pneumococcal infection," he said.
"Our thoughts are with these workers and their families and we are hopeful that they will make a swift recovery.
"The fact that four workers were hospitalised with this infectious disease in a short space of time in one area led to the PHA becoming involved."
Mr Thompson said the steps being taken were proportionate and Unite was hopeful "that they will prevent any further spread" of the infection.
"We will continue to work to ensure that this situation is managed effectively", he added.
Earlier, the Public Health Agency (PHA) said it was working with the Health & Safety Executive Northern Ireland (HSENI) and Port Health colleagues to investigate "a cluster outbreak of pneumococcal disease" at the shipyard.
"A small number of employees working at Harland and Wolff have been confirmed as having pneumococcal disease," it said.
"The PHA is working closely with Harland and Wolff and hygiene advice has been given to employees. Vaccination is being offered to employees working in high risk exposure areas as a preventative measure."
The PHA said there was no wider risk to the public.
