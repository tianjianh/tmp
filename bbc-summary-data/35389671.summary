"It's annoying, as we'd spoken all week on how to deal with their set pieces and that's how the goals came.
"We were camped in their half after the break but could not score.
"James Alabi worked hard but he was feeding off scraps and did not get the best of service.
"We're on a bad run of results in the league but we've got the FA Trophy to look forward to."
