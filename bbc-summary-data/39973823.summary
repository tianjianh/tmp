A women's version of the British and Irish Lions could be launched some time after 2019, according to the team's chief operating officer Charlie McEwan.

Planning for a women's team could start after the men's team's place in World Rugby's post-2019 global calendar is fixed.
Tours to New Zealand and Canada, first and third in the world, could form the basis for a women's team's itinerary.
"A Lions women's team is an important step forward," said McEwen.
"There is a place for a women's Lions team, lots of people have been talking about it.
"Whether that's in the next two or three years, whether that's in five, 10 years, who knows?"
New Zealand's women will play world champions England in a curtain-raiser to the Lions' match against the Maori All Blacks in Rotorua on 17 June.
