[SN]TITLE[SN]
Conservatives win general election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron will stay as Prime Minister after his party, the Conservatives, won the general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Conservatives won the magic number of 326 seats, more than half of all those available, and more than any other party.
The other big story was the success of the Scottish National Party (SNP) who won all but three of the seats in Scotland.
Ed Miliband resigned as Labour leader after a terrible night.
He had been hoping his party would win the election but they have got fewer seats than they did in the last election.
The Liberal Democrats, led by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, experienced even worse results.
He also stepped down from running the party after the Lib Dems were only left with 8 MPs.
