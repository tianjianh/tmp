You wanted to know if a village existed at Ironbridge before the famous structure was built over the river.
You were curious to know if the Staffordshire oatcake was eaten outside of the county and if so, how far the local delicacy had travelled.
And you asked about Shakespeare's birthday celebrations in Stratford-upon-Avon. Here is how we got on with answering your questions.
There was a community before the bridge and it was called Coalbrookdale - a name which still describes the area a little further along the gorge.
The Ironbridge Gorge Museums Trust told us the location was chosen because land there was stable enough to support a bridge ands high enough for boats to pass underneath.
It's like a pancake, but not a pancake. It's definitely not a biscuit like its Scottish cousin.
The Staffordshire oatcake is a unique delicacy people in the county will at times talk about for a long, long time.
It's made from a recipe typically including oatmeal and yeast and turns out looking rather like a dirty flannel.
But don't let that put you off. People in the Potteries love them.
They've sent us questions about their history and appeal and told us how they've taken their oatcakes across the world.
Thousands of people turned out to this artistic event on Saturday. BBC Midlands Today's Lindsay Doyle was there and you can watch her report here.
BBC News Online reader James Willets sent in these scenes and made his own video of the day.
"It covers the journey of the quill, representing Shakespeare's legacy, from his birthplace to the chancel of Holy Trinity Church," said Mr Willets.
