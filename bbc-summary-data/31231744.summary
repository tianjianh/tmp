Scores of residents have been evacuated from their homes in southern Guatemala after the Fuego volcano erupted, the country's president says.

Clouds of black ash belched into the sky, while showers of rock and dust fell on to surrounding towns.
The international airport in the capital Guatemala City was closed as result of the explosion, President Otto Perez said.
It is expected to reopen later on Sunday, reports suggest.
The Fuego volcano is about 40km (25 miles) south-west of the capital and stands 3,763 metres (12,346 feet) above sea level.
In September 2012 the authorities evacuated thousands of people from the area after Fuego started spewing large volumes of lava and ash.
Experts said at the time it was the biggest eruption from the mountain since 1999.
