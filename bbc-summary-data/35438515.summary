He sustained head injuries but was said to be conscious when ambulance crews arrived at the scene in Pinkhill at 07:45. He was taken to the ERI.
Meanwhile, a tree fell onto the roof of a bus on Corstorphine Road near Ormidale Terrace at 07:35.
There are no reports of injuries. The road was reopened at 09:49.
The tree has now been removed.
The Forth Road Bridge was closed to all traffic at 07:15 due to high winds and reopened at 12:30. The highest recorded gust on the bridge was 91mph.
An inspection was carried out before it was reopened to check for damage as the high winds had put a lot of stress on the structure, officials said.
Oxgangs Primary has also been forced to close after part of the wall was blown off. The school will remain closed on Monday.
Elsewhere in Edinburgh, fallen trees caused road closures on city routes during the morning rush hour.
Among the roads affected were Liberton Brae, Corstorphine Road, Bonaly Road and Hermitage Drive, with congestion reported on some diversion routes.
Edinburgh Zoo said it would not be opening this morning due to the weather conditions.
