Six Nations 2016: Jared Payne doubtful for Ireland's England game

Jared Payne remains a fitness doubt for Ireland's Six Nations game against England on Saturday.

Ireland team manager Mick Kearney said that the Irish are adopting a "wait and see" attitude over centre Payne's recovery from a hamstring injury.
If Payne is ruled out, his Ulster colleague Stuart McCloskey will be in contention for a first cap.
Props Mike Ross and Cian Healy are available to bolster the scrum after missing Ireland's first two games.
The Irish scrum struggled badly in the second half of the defeat by France and the return of the Leinster duo after injury will be a boost to coach Joe Schmidt.
Loose-head Healy has returned to Leinster duty in recent weeks after knee surgery while tight-head Ross has recovered from hamstring trouble.
"They both participated in Leinster's last two games and both got a significant amount of game-time at the weekend against Cardiff," said Kearney of Healy and Ross on Monday afternoon.
"So they're in, fully fit and available for selection."
Kearney appeared less certain of Payne's fitness.
"Jared Payne is continuing his rehab and the hope is that he will train fully tomorrow," added the Ireland team manager.
"He did some running last week and will continue with that rehab today."
Payne was initially thought to have suffered a dead leg in the Paris game but it was later diagnosed as a hamstring problem.
Fears over Johnny Sexton's fitness appear to have eased after he picked up a neck injury in Paris and then strained an ankle in training on Friday.
Ross and Healy join Ulster wing Craig Gilroy plus Munster lock Dave Foley and Leinster flanker Jordi Murphy in being added to the Ireland squad for the Twickenham contest.
Munster pair Keith Earls and Simon Zebo, who started in the draw against Wales, are included after missing the defeat by France because of injury.
Sean O'Brien, Dave Kearney and Mike McCarthy have all been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after picking up injuries in the France game.
Ulster flanker Chris Henry remains a notable absentee, despite starting for his province in the defeat by the Scarlets.
After the daunting match against England, Joe Schmidt's side then finish their campaign with home games against Italy and Scotland on 12 and 19 March.
The holders' chances of retaining the title they won in 2014 and 2015 look remote, with just one point from their opening two fixtures.
