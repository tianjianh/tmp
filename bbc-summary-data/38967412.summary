[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin will replace Bruce Anstey in the team, who won last year's race.
McGuinness had been on his way to a third straight victory before suffering a technical issue, and eventually finished fourth.
The team said the duo, who will also be team-mates at Honda at the TT races, will target the first 120+mph lap.
McGuinness still holds the lap record for the class of 119.279mph (18:58.743), which he set on way to victory in 2015.
Martin, from Grimsby, missed last year's TT and North West 200 to compete in the 2,712-mile Tour Divide mountain bike race in the United States.
The 35-year-old has not raced since suffering multiple broken vertebrae and a fractured sternum in a crash in the Dundrod 150 Superbike race in 2015.
The truck mechanic and TV personality is still looking for his first TT victory, having finished on the podium 16 times.
