The Oroville Dam in California in the United States is around 230 metres high and holds back a large lake.
An unusual amount of rain and snow had caused a lot of damage to two parts of the dam that let water escape.
The authorities were worried water could come out of the dam and flood nearby areas and told thousands of people to leave.
But the experts managed to drain away some of the water and now they think the danger to homes is past, and people can get back to their lives.
