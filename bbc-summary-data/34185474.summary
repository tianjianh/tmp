[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The West Midlands officer and two other men are being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
Police said they were given "false and malicious information" suggesting an officer was to "be kidnapped as part of a terrorist plot".
West Midlands police were put on high alert because of the hoax.
The three Birmingham men are questioned by anti-terrorism and anti-corruption teams.
The 28-year-old officer at Birmingham West & Central Local Policing Unit has also been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office and misuse of police systems.
The other men, aged 25 and 31, are also being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.
The force issued an alert to officers and staff after receiving the anonymous tip-off on 8 December last year.
It urged them to take extra precautions, including not wearing uniform during journeys to and from work.
"At a time when the national threat level was severe, the threat was considered credible and police acted swiftly to protect officers and police staff," a police spokesman said.
The three men are being questioned by detectives from West Midland Police's Anti-Corruption Unit, with support from the Counter Terrorism Unit.
A 31-year-old man, who was arrested on the day of the offence, was eliminated from inquiries and has been deported.
