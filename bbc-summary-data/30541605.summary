The robber stole a three-figure sum from the Niddrie Licensed Grocers in Niddrie Mill Drive during the incident, which occurred around 13:10 on Thursday.
Police have appealed for three customers who were in the shop moments before the robbery to get in touch.
The suspect has been described as a white man aged around 30.
He is around 5ft 10in - 6ft tall (1.8m) and of gaunt appearance.
The man was wearing a black hooded top, a black scarf covering his mouth, black jogging trousers and white trainers.
He was carrying a black and white polythene shopping bag and fled the shop on foot.
Police have said he used a handgun during the incident.
Det Sgt Robbie Wallace said: "While the shopkeeper was not physically harmed, this was a very distressing experience for her.
"We are keen to trace the suspect as quickly as possible, and ask that anyone with information should contact police immediately."
