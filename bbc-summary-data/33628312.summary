Armadillos blamed for rise in leprosy cases in Florida

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health officials in Florida are warning people to avoid contact with armadillos after a recent rise in leprosy cases linked to the armoured creatures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Florida officials have reported nine cases of leprosy already this year - double the normal rate.
Leprosy is a bacterial disease that affects the skin and nerves.
While the risk of contracting leprosy from an armadillo is low, health officials advise against touching the animals.
The disease can be spread through saliva. Armadillos sometimes spit when cornered or caged.
Most of the population is immune to leprosy - also known as Hansen's disease - and the disease is treatable. However, leprosy can be life-threatening if left untreated.
Originally from South America, armadillos are found in many southern states in the US, most notably in Texas.
