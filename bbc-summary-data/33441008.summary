Liverpool's historic Chinatown could benefit from a £200m redevelopment plan which would house 200 businesses and result in 800 new homes being built.

The New Chinatown scheme aims to build on a derelict site at Great George Street, near the Anglican Cathedral.
Developers North Point Global said the plans would provide 200,000 sq ft (18,580 sq m) of commercial space along with flats and town houses.
A planning application is expected to be submitted to the city council soon.
A listed building containing a bridal shop on the site will be retained, the developers said.
Meetings will be held with local community groups and businesses, with a two-day exhibition about the plans starting on Sunday at Studio 2 Parr Street.
Councillor Ann O'Byrne, from Liverpool City Council, called it a "really exciting proposal".
She said: "It's about the creation of new jobs in an area that has been left derelict for far too long.
"The community quite rightly have been frustrated. I think once they see these plans, they will think we're making a difference."
