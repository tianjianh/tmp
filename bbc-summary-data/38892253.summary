Hundreds of people reported seeing the glowing green meteor, from places like Wisconsin, Illinois, Ontario, and even Canada, according to the American Meteor Society.
The fireball also created a sonic boom, which shook some homes in the areas nearest to it.
Sonic booms happen when something flies faster than the speed of sound.
When an object moves through the air it makes invisible pressure waves in front and behind it, like ripples.
If an object goes faster than these waves it breaks through them creating a really loud banging noise, called a sonic boom.
