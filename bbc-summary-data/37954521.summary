The 420,000 sq ft interchange, next to Cardiff Central railway station, will also have private apartments as well as offices and shops.
Cardiff's bus station will be part of a Central Square redevelopment which will include BBC Wales' new headquarters.
"The gateway to our city is being transformed," said council leader Phil Bale.
The planning application was submitted after a 28-day public consultation period and the developers hope to know the outcome by the end of February 2017 after a 16-week scrutiny period by city planners.
Central Square developers Rightacres Property claim the Interchange will have an "airport-lounge" style concourse and a 600-bicycle hub.
