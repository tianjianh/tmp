[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Katy McAllister, 31, was found not guilty at the High Court in Edinburgh of causing the death of Louise McGowan at Voodoo Tattoo in Dundee in May 2015.
Prosecutors had alleged she had administered the drugs to Mrs McGowan.
However, judge Graham Buchanan QC said they had failed to provide evidence of culpable homicide. McAllister was convicted of other drug offences.
She admitted being involved in supplying or offering to supply Diazepam and Temazepam to other individuals.
She also pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing magic mushrooms at her home on 11 May 2015 and possessing a controlled drug called Midazolam.
McAllister had originally faced charges of "recklessly and unlawfully" supplying "potentially lethal" drugs, including Tramadol, Diazepam and Temazepam, to Louise McGowan.
The court heard that Mrs McGowan had felt "anxious" about getting her body inked at Voodoo Tattoo parlour in Dundee's Perth Road.
She died a day after taking the drugs after suffering a cardiac arrest.
But defence advocate Mark Stewart QC made legal submissions to the court after prosecutors had concluded their case that they had led insufficient evidence against his client.
Judge Buchanan agreed and acquitted McAllister of the culpable homicide charge on Wednesday.
The acquittal prompted crown lawyers to seek a 48-hour adjournment to consider whether or not they wanted to appeal that decision.
On Friday, prosecutors said they would not appeal.
Adjourning sentence on McAllister for the drugs offences, judge Buchanan described the evidence against her as "somewhat concerning".
He added: "I think there are certain troubling aspects in relation to what has been going on in the accused's life over the last few years."
McAllister will be sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow next month.
