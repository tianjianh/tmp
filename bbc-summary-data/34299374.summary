Stockley prodded home from close range to win it for Pompey.

"I just thought we were excellent today, I thought it was a really good game of football. I have said for a while now about the balance of the team, you know the modern day game especially being Portsmouth manager you judge form game to game.
"Good passing, good movement, great ball in the box and you get goals.
"Adam (McGurk) did his ankle in the warm up so that was disappointing so we had to make a few changes today but that's part of the game. We are just happy that the squad is working together."
