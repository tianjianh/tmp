Kerri McAuley, 32, died at a property in Southalls Way, Norwich, on Sunday evening.
Joe Storey, 26, appeared at Norwich Crown Court earlier charged with her murder.
In a statement, Ms McAuley's mother described the loss of her daughter as "untimely" and "horrific".
She said: "Words can't describe the pain we are feeling.
"The love and support displayed by her family and friends is overwhelming and immensely comforting.
"[It] is giving us the strength to help carry Kerri's two beautiful boys through their loss, in their words, of the most awesome and everything mummy."
Mr Storey, of Murrells Court in Norwich, was remanded in custody until a plea hearing on March 21.
A provisional trial date has been set for June 5.
The results from a post-mortem examination were inconclusive but Norfolk Police said there was evidence Ms McAuley had been subjected to a "severe blunt force assault".
A fundraising page set up to raise money for her funeral and two sons has so far raised more than Â£10,000.
