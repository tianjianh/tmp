The 22-year-old won Olympic gold on Sunday after a dramatic countback win over Roberto Cammarelle, Italy's defending champion from Beijing.
Joshua won silver at last year's World Championships in Baku, Azerbaijan.
"I'd like to become world amateur champion before I go professional," said the London 2012 gold medallist.

It was Joshua's second victory over the Italian two-time world champion, having beaten him at the last-eight stage in Baku last year.
However, the Finchley ABC boxer was eventually beaten by home favourite Magomedrasul Medzhidov in the decider.
Joshua now wants to win gold at next year's event in Kazakhstan - and join Frankie Gavin and Savannah Marshall as Britain's only world amateur champions.
He said: "I know there's the World Championships next year. I need to rest my body first because it is in pain."
Joshua insists he is not motivated by money and is keen to emulate world amateur greats such as Ukraine's Vasyl Lomachenko who became a two-weight Olympic champion on Sunday.
"If fame comes I'm going to be OK with it, but I don't want to be hyped up and made out to be something I'm not," he added.
"I look at great amateur champions like Lomachenko and how he just goes out there and gets the job done every time, and that's the kind of attitude I want to have.
"I'm not interested in the money. I want to go out and get a burger and a big chocolate cake, then I want to go back to my flat just to kick back for a few days and enjoy some of my mum's home cooking."
The super-heavyweight sensation could also be tempted to stay in the unpaid ranks until Rio 2016 and help Great Britain improve on the five medals they claimed in London.
He added: "You look at the Cubans, the Ukrainians and the Chinese and all their double Olympic champions and imagine how great that would be.
"If Great Britain can keep this team together, we would be incredibly strong in Rio in four years. We are in a position where we could dominate amateur boxing over the next four years."
