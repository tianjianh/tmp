The Guardia Civil in Palmanova told the BBC the holidaymaker's body was found late on Monday night in Magaluf.
A police spokeswoman said hotel staff were alerted when they saw water coming out of the room and that they had tried to resuscitate her.
Post-mortem tests found alcohol in her body and death was determined to be accidental through drowning, she added.
The Foreign Office said it was "providing support to the family of a British national following their death in Mallorca on 2 May 2016".
"We are in close contact with local authorities," a spokesman added.
