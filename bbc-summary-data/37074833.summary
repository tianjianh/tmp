Joe Hart: England keeper is better than Willy Caballero - MOTD's Ian Wright

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joe Hart is a better goalkeeper than Willy Caballero but the England player needs to prove it after being dropped by Pep Guardiola, says Ian Wright.

Caballero started City's 2-1 win over Sunderland, the first match of Guardiola's City reign.
"It leaves Hart with a lot to think about," Wright told Match of the Day. "Coming off the Euros and some high-profile mistakes, he has to suck it up.
"I don't think Caballero is a better keeper than Joe."
