The renowned Bramley apple has been celebrated with a festival in the town where they originate from.

Every single Bramley apple ever eaten can be traced back to a 200-year-old tree that is still growing in Southwell in Nottinghamshire.
It grew from a pip sown by a young girl called Mary Ann Brailsford in 1809.
The apples are now so popular that 83,000 tonnes of them - approximately 400 million apples - were grown in Britain in 2014.
The Bramley Apple Festival was organised with the help of Roger Merryweather, great-grandson of Henry Merryweather, the first person to grow the trees commercially.
"Here we are 200 years since the first pip was sown and it's still a very popular cooking apple," said Mr Merryweather.
"The tree is showing a little bit of wear and tear as you can expect, but it bore fruit this year.
"How many more years it has to go, who knows?"
Mr Merryweather said the Bramley became popular because of its strong growth, the qualities of the fruit, and also because it can be stored for a long time.
He believes the National Federation of Women's Institutes has also done a lot to promote the qualities of the Bramley in cooking.
