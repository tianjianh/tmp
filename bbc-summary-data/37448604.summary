Pilot Nick Jefferies and Scott Penlington, both from Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, died at the scene at Cwmbach, Builth Wells.
Mr Jefferies was described as an adventure seeker "fuelled by his love for life".
Mr Penlington's family said they had been "overwhelmed by the hundreds of tributes" in his memory.
The Independent Air Accidents Investigation Branch is leading the inquiry into the crash.
The wreckage has been taken to its headquarters at Farnborough, Hampshire, for a more detailed examination.
Farmer Steve Powell said the aircraft appeared to have "fallen out of the sky".
"It is a terrible tragedy," he said.
Dyfed-Powys Police released statements on behalf of both men's families on Friday.
Mr Jefferies' family said he had "influenced the lives of many", adding that he believed in "living a life without limits".
Mr Penlington's family described him as a fun-loving and kind-hearted man who would be "desperately missed".
