[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of a 20-month-old girl whose body was found in a house in Bicester has paid tribute to his "uniquely beautiful Sarah."

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sarah Dahane was identified by her father Nabil earlier but a post-mortem examination has failed to establish the cause of her death.
Mr Dahane was separated from the girl's mother, who is believed to have fled the UK on Wednesday.
Sarah's body was found at the house in Herald Way, Bicester, on Thursday.
Officers had received a report concerning fear for a child's welfare. Sarah was pronounced dead at the scene.
In a statement, Mr Dahane said: "To my uniquely beautiful Sarah, you have meant the world to me.
"The time spent with you, though it has been cut very short, was an absolute joy and the sweet memories we made together will stay with me for as long as I live.
"May you rest in peace babe and I will surely see you in heaven."
Thames Valley Police is working with other authorities to trace Sarah's mother.
Det Ch Insp Ian Hunter said: "We urgently wish to speak to Sarah's mother to better understand exactly what has happened.
"We strongly urge her to present herself to the authorities."
Examinations are expected to continue at the house on Friday.
Police have not yet revealed the identity of the mother and said further lines of inquiry needed to be pursued.
