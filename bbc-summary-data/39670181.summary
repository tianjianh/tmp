Michael Keane's future at Burnley has "not changed" despite reports linking the defender with a move away from the club, says manager Sean Dyche.

The 24-year-old has had an impressive season and has been shortlisted for the Professional Footballers' Association young player of the year award.
He made his England debut on 22 March in the 1-0 defeat by Germany.
"He is focused on the job at hand in delivering performances for the club," said Dyche.
The Clarets manager said he heard rumours that Keane was leaving the club on television, adding it was "news to me".
"The reality is nothing's changed," he said.
"We have had no contact from any clubs. We are a different animal from what we were a few years ago. We are in a very strong business situation and there is no consideration of our players leaving."
Everton, Tottenham and Liverpool are all reportedly interested in signing the centre-back, who began his career with Manchester United.
After loan spells with Leicester, Derby, Blackburn and Burnley he moved permanently to Turf Moor in January 2015, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal.
