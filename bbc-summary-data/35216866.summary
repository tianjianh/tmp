Oscar hopefuls Cate Blanchett and Matt Damon were among the winners at Palm Springs Film Festival, with Damon saying director Ridley Scott deserved an Academy Award.

Damon, who starred in Scott's film The Martian, said of Scott: "I hope that this is his year".
Carol star Blanchett thanked the festival for giving its honourees "a moment of glory" even if "we are not nominated for any other award".
The festival also honoured Johnny Depp.
Depp, who won the achievement award for actor for Black Mass, joked about making a lengthy acceptance speech, saying: " I  hope you guys are planted well in your seats, this is going to take about 35 minutes. Maybe 37.  We'll just wing it shall we?  Yeah, I'm going to take 45."
Damon, who was given the chairman's award, added that he thought Scott already had an Oscar for best director - for Gladiator, which won five Academy Awards in 2001 - but he had lost out to Traffic's Steven Soderbergh.
"What he's given to cinema, it's not an accident," Damon said of Scott.
"He's just a master director. There are a handful of them on planet earth, but he is one of them. Gladiator won best picture, but he wasn't a producer on Gladiator. And so, the bottom line is, he's given more than enough to cinema, so I hope that this is his year."
Blanchett joked as her achievement award for actress was presented by Brooklyn star Saoirse Ronan: "Thank you, Saoirse, you can get off the stage now. You're too young, talented and gorgeous.  It's all me."
Ronan won the international star award for actress and told the audience of around 2,000 people that since she was recently given a prize by actor Ryan Gosling, "everyone can pronounce my name".
"He got up and he said her name is Saoirse like an 'ursher' and since he said that everyone noticed and everyone listened," she said.
"I've been saying it for years and no-one listens but as soon as Ryan says it everyone listens, so just get Ryan to spread the word.  If you need something done, just get him to do it for you."
Michael Fassbender, who starred in Steve Jobs as the Apple co-founder, paid a light-hearted tribute to his co-star Kate Winslet.
"Kate, you had my back from day one and yes, I did hold on to you longer than I should. Your wicked sense of humour and just maternal nature kept everyone's spirits buoyant and that's not to mention your acting ability. You're a class act and I owe you big time," he said.
Brie Larson won the breakthrough performance prize for starring in the thriller Room, saying: "I mean it's all over-exciting and overwhelming and I've never experienced it before so I'm just trying to take it one step at a time."
The Danish Girl's Alicia Vikander won the rising star award while director Tom McCarthy was awarded the visionary prize for Spotlight. Roony Mara took the spotlight award for actress for Carol while the actor spotlight award for Trumbo went to Bryan Cranston.
The Big Short won the ensemble performance award.
A total of 11 awards are given at the international festival's gala evening, but the recipients are told beforehand if they have won, which Blanchett said was "a relief".
This year's Oscars take place on 28 February.
