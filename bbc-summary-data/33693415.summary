[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Ross, 27, undertook a vehicle which was already in the process of overtaking a truck near Hatton.
Ross, of Boddam, admitted careless driving at Peterhead Sheriff Court. He was fined Â£400 and received four penalty points.
The video had been posted on social media in November.
Sgt Kelly Manson, of Police Scotland, said: "This incident could have had serious consequences for other road users as well as the driver concerned and would have shocked those who viewed the footage available on social media.
"This incident should be a reminder to all road users of driving safely and considerately at all times.
"We launched Operation Cedar (Challenge, Educate, Detect and Reduce) in May 2014 to tackle road safety in Aberdeenshire and patrols and operations have run regularly since then to highlight and educate drivers and carry out enforcement accordingly."
