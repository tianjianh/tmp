Licence fee payers and audience groups will be given a chance to respond to the plans, which will be published in full on the Trust website.
A timetable for the process will also be unveiled.
Plans to make the channel an online-only proposition were announced by BBC director general Tony Hall in March.
Making the service only available on iPlayer from autumn 2015 will see the channel's budget slashed by Â£60m.
The move will also make way for the creation of a BBC One+1 service and an extension of CBBC's evening schedule.
The Trust has said that this represents a significant change to UK public services, so will be subject to a public value test, enabling viewers to have their say on the proposals.
Media watchdog Ofcom will also conduct a market impact assessment of the planned changes.
The Trust has said that its "priority throughout will be to listen to the views of audiences and stakeholders".
