Johnson scored 15 goals in 41 games for the Heed this season, having signed in July 2015 following his release by Championship side Cardiff City.
The 23-year-old has also previously had spells with Stevenage and Tranmere.
"If you have someone who is capable of scoring goals, then it's important that you re-sign him," manager Neil Aspin told the club website.
"At the age he is, I believe he can get better, too."
Gateshead finished ninth in the National League, 13 points outside the play-off places.
