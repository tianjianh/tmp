Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, 24, was attacked on Sunday outside Topper's Pizza in downtown Menomonie, Wisconsin, near his university.
Local media reported police found Mr Alnahdi unconscious and bloodied. He died on Monday.
The motive of the crime is unclear and police have asked for any information about a possible assailant.
The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported the suspect was a white male, about 6ft.
According to a statement on Facebook by the university, Mr Alnahdi, was in his third year of studies pursuing business administration.
University chancellor Bob Meyer said: "Our deepest sympathies, thoughts and prayers go out to Hussain's family in Buraydah, Saudi Arabia, and his friends at UW-Stout."
The Minnesota Council on American Islamic relations said in a tweet they were "monitoring" the death of Mr Alnahdi.
