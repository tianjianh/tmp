Edwina Hart said there were "issues we do not control" as AMs debated chaos surrounding games in Cardiff in 2015.
Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said one family with tickets gave up the journey and watched the game on TV in Bath.
A committee of AMs has made several recommendations, including improvements to Cardiff Central railway station.
Problems for rail passengers suffering delays and overcrowding were the main focus of a report by the business and enterprise committee in December.
But fans travelling by road also suffered, AMs debating the report in the Senedd on Wednesday heard.
Mr Davies spoke of "considerable congestion" at the Severn Bridge toll plaza, and highlighted the case of a family travelling from London who gave up their attempt to reach Cardiff for a match.
"They were so far away from the toll plaza that in the end they turned in for Bath, watched the match in Bath, and spent the weekend in Bath," he said.
"They had to forego the tickets that the father had bought for his family to enjoy a game of rugby here in Cardiff.
"What sort of message is that sending out?"
Responding, Mrs Hart said: "I'll be writing to the Department for Transport to raise the committee's concerns because these are issues we do not control.
"We don't want to apportion blame but it's important people recognise the difficulties that were surrounding what was happening on the bridge."
