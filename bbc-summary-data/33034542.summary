Police said the privately-owned helicopter crashed in the valley just off the Ramsey to Douglas Mountain Road at about 09:00 BST.
It is believed there was only one person on board the aircraft, a man who was not thought to be from the Isle of Man, police said.
The annual TT motorbike racing festival was due to start this weekend but the opening race was delayed by the winds.
Det Insp Steve Maddocks of the Isle of Man Constabulary said the aircraft crashed into the fields near the 33rd Milestone.
Officers said they were unable to reveal the condition of the helicopter crash casualty.
The six-lap Superbike event was due to be staged on Saturday but has been postponed until Sunday.
Mountain Road has been closed between Ramsey and Creg Ny Raa until further notice while the cause of the crash is being investigated by police, the Isle of Man Rescue Service and air crash investigators.
