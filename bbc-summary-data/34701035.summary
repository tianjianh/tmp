CCTV footage showed him outside the jail tying the goods to a fishing line that was pulled into a cell.
Karl Jensen, 27 and his girlfriend, Lisa Mary Hutchinson, 26, both of Ladbroke Grove, were sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on Thursday.
Jensen was jailed for two and a half years and Hutchinson received a 12-month community order.
Jensen pleaded guilty to seven charges including conspiracy to supply a class A drug and three counts of conveying an article into prison.
Hutchinson admitted allowing her home to be used for the supply of class A and class B drugs.
Met officers were alerted when prison staff spotted Jensen and Hutchinson in Artillery Lane near the prison on in October last year.
Staff watched on CCTV as Jensen tied a bag to a fishing line and it was hauled up into the prison.
The bag, which was found inside the cell, contained a five-inch blade, a Smartwatch, a mobile phone, cannabis and cocaine.
Other smuggled goods included a McDonald's McMuffin, a plastic Kinder Surprise egg containing five Sim cards, a bottle of vodka and USB chargers.
Det Con Andy Griffin said the combination of items "could have been deadly."
There have been no further arrests in connection with the smuggling.
