[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 3-2 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry suffered their fifth straight league defeat as they went down at fellow strugglers Oldham, who moved out of the relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rock-bottom Sky Blues were punished for defensive errors and have now taken just two points from their last 14 League One outings.
Oldham, who started the day in 21st, led after eight minutes as Ryan Flynn crossed from the right and Coventry defender Kevin Foley horribly miscued his clearance, scoring an own goal from six yards.
The visitors were level just a minute later when Marcus Tudgay seized possession 25 yards out and hit a powerful shot which dipped under the crossbar.
Callum Reilly almost put Coventry ahead with a curling effort against the bar, while George Thomas was denied by Oldham goalkeeper Connor Ripley.
Yet the visitors were guilty of another howler on 66 minutes as keeper Reice Charles-Cook dropped a simple high ball which allowed Oldham skipper Peter Clarke to bundle into the empty net.
The Latics quickly made it 3-1 as Ryan McLaughlin sprinted through half-hearted tackles before drilling into the bottom corner from 14 yards.
Coventry regained hope on 76 minutes as substitute Kwami Thomas buried a header from Ryan Haynes' left-wing cross, but Oldham held on for a vital three points.
