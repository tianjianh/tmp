[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A film about songwriter Edwyn Collins is to be given a special screening to raise awareness about strokes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edinburgh-born Collins went into a coma after suffering a stroke and two haemorrhages in 2005.
The Possibilities are Endless, explores his journey from the brink of death to rediscovering memories lost because of his medical condition.
NHS Highland and Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland will host the screening in Inverness on 17 September.
The film will be shown at Eden Court.
Sandra Hewitt, of NHS Highland, said: "This is an inspirational film showing one man's personal journey and I think it will have a profound effect on stroke survivors, not just here in Highland, but across the UK and beyond.
"Stroke is a lifelong condition but you can improve with time."
She added: "I'm looking forward to the film. It's one man's story which many of those we hope will attend can see similarities with their own situation and they can also get the chance to meet their peers and learn about what support is available for them."
After waking from his coma, the first two phrases Collins was able to say were "Grace Maxwell" - which is his wife's name - and "the possibilities are endless".
The singer-songwriter is known for his work with the band Orange Juice and his 1995 solo hit A Girl Like You.
