[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington Wolves went level on points at the top of Super League with an 11-try victory over Castleford Tigers.

The hosts scored seven first-half tries as Chris Sandow, Kevin Penny and Tom Lineham went over inside 15 minutes.
Two tries from Matthew Russell, added to by Ryan Atkins and Ben Currie, saw Wolves open a 38-0 half-time lead.
Sandow grabbed a second try, before Joel Monaghan and Gadwin Springer got Cas on the board, while Brad Dwyer, Lineham and Currie sealed the win.
Warrington, who have won all six of their league games this season, went ahead when Sandow's pace got him to the ball following an angled kick and Penny finished off a well-worked move from right to left before Russell and Rhys Evans combined to set up Lineham.
Russell then went over twice from close range, Atkins barged over and Currie - on his 100th career appearance - raced in on the left-hand side.
The barrage continued after the break as Australian half-back Sandow jinked through for his second try, before Cas finally got some points on the board.
Monaghan, facing his former club for the first time, finished off a sweeping move from the right and Springer powered over, with Luke Gale's conversions pushing Castleford's tally to 12 points.
Dwyer twisted in for Warrington's ninth try and Lineham scored his second when he collected Sandow's kick as Warrington hit 50 points.
Currie raced in for his second try and Kurt Gidley took his personal tally to 12 points with his sixth successful goal in the final minute.
Warrington coach Tony Smith:
"We were building up for one. We've got ourselves into winning positions by the end of games, but we wanted to do it a bit differently and we put some pressure on ourselves to do something like that.
"We felt it was time to have a performance like that. It was very good.
"It was pretty faultless first half. It is difficult to stop that momentum when it gets going."
Castleford coach Daryl Powell:
"It was a hugely disappointing night. I want to start by apologising to all the Castleford fans for a performance that is so unrecognisable from what we have become.
"I thought Warrington were outstanding across the board. They absolutely annihilated us in every department.
"But for us it was a terrible effort, so soft in every way. We weren't at the races.
"There needs to be some changes in terms of the way the players are going about their work at the moment. They have to change their mindset and work ethic."
