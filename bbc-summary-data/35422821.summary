The 21-year-old Ghana international, who can play in defence or midfield, signed a four-year deal for a fee of up to Â£6m on 22 January.
"I have strong confidence in my ability to play in the Premier League," Amartey told BBC Sport.
"And I believe I can make a strong contribution to Leicester City."
He added: "I don't want to make any promises now but to be judged by my performance when given the opportunity.
"As a professional footballer I am mentally prepared and ready to challenge for a place in the first team."
Amartey realises it will be difficult to break into the starting XI of a Leicester side that sits at the top of the Premier League table but is clear about what is required.
"I saw the game against Stoke [a 3-0 league win on 23 January] and I also had a chat with the manager and technical staff too, so I have a very good idea of their expectations," he said,.
"The Premier League is one of the best leagues if not the best so the first key will be to work extremely hard because the team is flying right now.
"It's every player's dream to have the opportunity to play in the Premier League not to talk about the high possibility of being champions.
"So joining Leicester at this particular time is just awesome but I have to earn my spot among the stars in the team."
Amartey has won six international caps and played in all the group matches for Ghana at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, where the Black Stars finished as runners-up.
Has also played in the Uefa Champions League and the Europa League.
