Bottom side Daggers broke the deadlock when Joss Labadie's long-range drive bounced over Morecambe keeper Barry Roche and into the net.
Dagenham doubled when Labadie teed up Jamie Cureton who rounded Roche before tapping in from close range.
Morecambe's Tom Barkhuizen found a consolation tap in late on but Dagenham held on for all three points.
Dagenham are 11 points from safety at the bottom of the League Two table with seven games left to play, but have a game in hand on 23rd-placed York City.
Dagenham & Redbridge boss John Still told BBC Radio London:

"It's been a funny time because we've gone so long without playing.
"Sometimes people say is it a good thing or a bad thing, but you never know how it's going to be.
"I thought in the first half we were good. I thought in the second half we got pushed back too much.
"I actually think that will do us the world of good for Saturday. I think it will put a little bit more in the tank."
