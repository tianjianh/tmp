[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers discovered the man's body inside a property in Lincoln Avenue in Knightswood at about 20:45 on Monday.
Police said he had yet to be formally identified and that they were conducting door-to-door inquiries in the area.
A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out to determine exactly how the man died.
Det Insp Alan McAlpine, who is leading the investigation, said officers were also looking for CCTV in the area and urged anyone with information about the circumstances surrounding the man's death to come forward.
He said: "Extensive inquiries are ongoing and specialist forensic teams have been active at the scene.
"At this time I am seeking the assistance of the local community to provide us with any information.
"I am asking them to think back across the last week. Have you heard anything unusual?
"Did you witness any kind of disturbance? The information you have may not seem like much, but as part of our broader investigation it could make all the difference."
