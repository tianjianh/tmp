Crawley Town: Joe McNerney signs new two-year Crawley Town deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crawley Town defender Joe McNerney has signed a new two-year contract with the League Two club, with the option for a third year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old signed from non-league Woking in July 2015 and has made 34 appearances, including 21 this season.
He missed much of his first season at Broadfield Stadium because of a knee injury and subsequent surgery.
McNerney said: "I'm delighted to have agreed the new contract and to know I have a long-term future at the club."
