The 24-year-old was kept away from the Riviera by promotional duties for another film, Disney blockbuster Prince Of Persia.
Director Stephen Frears (The Queen) was instead accompanied by Arterton's co-stars Dominic Cooper and Tamsin Greig.
The film is based on Posy Simmonds' comic strip, a reworking of Thomas Hardy's Far From The Madding Crowd.
Frears told reporters at the festival that he was glad the film was not in the running for the prestigious Palme d'Or prize.
"You smile a lot more. I'm not going to lose! I've eliminated the possibility of losing!" said the film-maker.
He added that his film would be a hit with overseas audiences, because "they like that sort of British looniness".
Arterton, who also starred in Bond movie the Quantum of Solace, was in Hollywood on Monday night for the US premiere of Prince of Persia.
The actress has the only female role in the film, alongside actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Sir Ben Kingsley.
Since first coming to attention in the BBC adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, the actress has become one of the UK's most in-demand young actresses.
Having completed a well-received stint in West End comedy The Little Dog Laughed this spring, she will appear in three films over the summer blockbuster season - Tamara Drewe, Prince Of Persia and low-budget thriller The Disappearance Of Alice Creed.
