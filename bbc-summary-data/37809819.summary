Conor McGinn, 32, said Neasa Constance was born after "a crash course in midwifery over the phone with a 999 call handler" on Friday evening.
The Labour MP for St Helens North announced the birth on Facebook, saying "mum and baby are doing very well".
"Those 'Labour delivers all year round' leaflets will take on a new meaning in St Helens," he joked.
He added: "Dad is only slightly traumatised after delivering the baby on the living room floor when she decided to arrive a bit quicker than expected... so quickly in fact that she beat the ambulance to it, meaning I had to have a crash course in midwifery over the phone with a 999 call-handler!
"Neasa is healthy and content and we feel very lucky and happy to have her."
Mr McGinn and his wife Kate married in 2009 and have a son.
The Northern Ireland-born politician was elected in 2015, and was a Labour whip before standing down earlier this month following the controversial sacking of chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton in Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle.
