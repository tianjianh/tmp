The 25-year-old midfielder previously made 60 appearances for Rovers between 2012 and 2014 and played under Tranmere boss Micky Mellon during a loan spell at Shrewsbury last season.
"We are continually trying to improve," said Mellon.
"I believe that adding James's quality to our squad will certainly do that."
Since arriving at Prenton Park in late November, Wallace has helped Rovers, who are third in the table, to league wins over Gateshead, Wrexham and Macclesfield Town.
