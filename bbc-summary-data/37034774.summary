[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old midfielder signed a one-month deal at Fratton Park on Monday and made his debut against Coventry in the EFL Cup 24 hours later.
"I haven't come here just to sit on the bench," the Congo international told BBC Radio Solent. "I'm hungry and Portsmouth are a top club."
Linganzi and goalkeeper Liam O'Brien, 24, have both signed short-term deals.
O'Brien returns for a second spell at Portsmouth, having left in 2010.
The former England Under-19 international has previously played for Barnet, Brentford and Dagenham.
