Luke Chadwick: Cambridge United goal against Southport best memory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-midfielder Luke Chadwick thinks about his first goal for Cambridge most days, despite winning the Premier League with Manchester United in 2001.

The 35-year-old also played in the Champions League semi-final that year.
He joined his hometown club in 2014, with them in the Conference Premier.
"My dream as a kid was always to play for Cambridge United so that moment when I scored against Southport at the Newmarket Road End is without a doubt the best moment of my career," he said.
"I have a little think about it most days. I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a little one-two with [Andy] Pugh and then a bad touch before a left-foot finish."
Chadwick helped the U's win promotion back into the Football League after joining on loan from MK Dons and signed a one-year deal with the club in the summer.
After appearing 30 times for the League Two side in 2014-15, including against Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round, he left the club and after a brief spell in non-league with Soham has retired from playing to take up a coaching role with Cambridge's academy.
He continued to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "It's the end of my football career so it's a bit of a strange transition period.
"But to play for the club I love and now have such a great role is really thrilling for me.
"As a player you can't go on forever, even though in my head I still think I could. It's time now to concentrate on the next stage of my life as a coach and I couldn't be any happier."
