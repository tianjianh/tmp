Truro City manager Steve Tully says his squad is capable of dealing with a backlog of fixtures.

The White Tigers suffered another postponement on Tuesday as their game with Weston-super-Mare was called off.
"That's the whole reason I asked the chairman about a month ago to get a couple more players in," Tully said.
"I believe I've got the players who can play two or three games a week, they're fit lads and we also have cover in depth which is what we needed."
Truro are currently one place outside of the National League South play-off spots on goal difference, but have at least one game in hand, and in some cases four matches, on the teams above them.
"They're all good players and they all want to be in the starting 11," Tully added to BBC Radio Cornwall.
"The more numbers you have, as long as you've got quality in those numbers, then you shouldn't be afraid.
"I'm not afraid to swap and change players in and out and I know that I have a starting 11 on Saturday and I'm quite happy to change five or six for Tuesday and still be as strong as we were."
