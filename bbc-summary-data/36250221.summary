[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in his final Paris St-Germain league appearance in a game which was briefly stopped for a standing ovation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PSG's all-time top scorer is leaving the club this summer and after 10 minutes the game with Nantes was halted while fans applauded their number 10.
By scoring twice, he broke another club record - for most goals by a PSG player in a league season, with 38.
He chested in an opener, and headed home to make it 4-0 late on.
His 89th-minute goal saw him overtake Carlos Bianchi's 37-goal league haul of 1977-78.
The 34-year-old Swede has scored 154 goals in 179 appearances in his four years in France. Next Saturday's French Cup final against Marseille will be his final game for the club.
PSG have won Ligue 1 in each season Ibrahimovic has been at the club, with the veteran - who has been linked with a move to LA Galaxy - winning the golden boot three times.
His 38 goals in 31 league games this season saw him finish 17 goals above second-placed Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon.
