The local television channel is run by Archant, which publishes a number of local newspapers and magazines including the Eastern Daily Press.
It was one of 19 initial local TV stations, awarded licences by the government.
The station started broadcasting in March 2014 to 162,000 homes across Norwich and parts of Norfolk.
The BBC has agreed to buy content from local television firms for £15m over three years. This is due to end in March 2017.
Jeff Henry, chief executive of Archant, said: "The cost of running the licence for a local television channel such as Mustard TV is a significant investment and we are working towards the establishment of both sustainable cost base and commercial revenues.
"The results demonstrate the underlying economic difficulty of providing a quality service in a limited broadcast area. Addressing the local TV model is the next important step in enabling media businesses like Archant to thrive and grow."
In March, the television channel apologised after a presenter used a swearword to describe a colleague on air.
