The 27-year-old former Kilmarnock and Oldham midfielder will officially join the relegated Sky Blues on 1 July.
He was given a six-game ban in February for pushing over a ball boy and missed Orient's last three games of the season as they went down from League Two.
"He is a very talented footballer who will contribute goals from midfield for us," said Coventry boss Mark Robins.
