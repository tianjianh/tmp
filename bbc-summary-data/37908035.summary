[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A long-serving former Aberdeen City Council leader has announced he is stepping down from the local authority after 35 years as a councillor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Len Ironside, the Labour councillor for Kingswells, Sheddocksley and Summerhill, led the council for four years, from 1999 to 2003, and spent 10 years as group leader.
He will stand down at next year's council elections.
Mr Ironside said it was time for someone new.
He told BBC Scotland: "It's been a huge part of my life and I have enjoyed it, even the difficult bits - it's been a battle sometimes.
"I respect what the public say and I think I have done my best to serve the public of Aberdeen.
"But now it's time to move on and some new people to take on the challenge."
