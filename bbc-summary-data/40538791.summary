European 10,000m champion Jo Pavey says she will not seek selection for the 2017 World Championships in London because she is hampered by a sore heel.

Pavey, 43, won world bronze in 2007 and said she would "love to have run" but the injury had restricted her training.
In 2015, at 40 years of age, Pavey became the oldest woman ever to claim gold at the European Championships.
British sprinter Adam Gemili has pulled out of Sunday's Anniversary Games in London with an unspecified injury.
The 23-year-old, who represented Team GB at the past two Olympics, was due to compete in the 200m at London Stadium but is not deemed fit enough.
However, he hopes to be in contention for next month's World Championships, taking place at the same venue.
Gemili said: "I have been carrying an injury and after seeing a specialist, I was pleased to hear that I will be able to resume full training shortly but sadly this weekend comes too soon."
Gemili's withdrawal comes after long jumper Greg Rutherford said he could not compete because of an ankle injury.
