Six Nations: Eddie Jones promises more focus from England against Wales

The atmosphere in the England camp on Monday was "as if they had lost against France" in the Six Nations opener, says head coach Eddie Jones.

England came from behind on Saturday to win 19-16 at Twickenham in what Jones described as an "ugly" victory.
The Australian said he will tweak the preparation before his side travel to Wales this weekend.
"We are all disappointed and that helps to sharpen the focus a bit more," said Jones.
"I'm sure this week against Wales you will see a much sharper England side," Jones told BBC Radio 5 live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast.

The 57-year-old is also seeking to nullify Wales' home advantage at the Principality Stadium. England have won just two of their past seven visits to the Welsh capital, and Rob Howley's men top the table after beating Italy 33-7 on Sunday.
"I can't see that just because we drive down the M4 they get an advantage," said Jones. "It's not different water, it's not different air. The beer is the same, the pies are the same, the seats are the same, the grass is the same. Everything is the same.
"So we are the side who is going to get better this week, not Wales."
Jones, whose side set a new national record 15th consecutive victory at the weekend, is trying to balance short and long-term goals; to win the next game, while also planning to win the World Cup in 2019.

"So we have started some things that will help us win the World Cup, and maybe those other areas have distracted from our game preparation. So we will just tighten things up a little bit more this week.
"At the end of the day, we are going to be judged by our performance in the World Cup, just as [former coaches] Stuart Lancaster's side were just as Martin Johnson's side were."
England full-back Mike Brown said he is taking inspiration from Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic as he tries to prove he has many years ahead of him at the highest level.
Brown is England's most-capped full-back and one of the more experienced players in the side at the age of 31.
Former Sweden international Ibrahimovic became the oldest player - at 35 years and 125 days - to reach 15 Premier League goals in a season when he netted during United's 3-0 Premier League win at Leicester on Sunday.
"In terms of age, Zlatan Ibrahimovic said it brilliantly not long ago," said Brown, who is a Manchester United supporter. "He's older, but he's not old.
"I am a bit older than some of the guys here, but I am not old. I look after myself, prepare well, and have that experience to go with it.
"It is nice proving people wrong, I have had it all my career. It's all about controlling what I can myself."
