Designer Kelly Hoppen has announced she is quitting BBC Two's Dragons' Den after two series.

The businesswoman said she was too busy to commit time to the filming schedule, but added she had "thoroughly enjoyed" her time on the show.
"It has been a privilege to be part of a programme which champions entrepreneurs," she said.
"I will miss my fellow judges and I'm sure someone amazing will fill my seat."
Hoppen will still be seen on screen when the show resumes on Sunday after a mid-series break.
"I've had a brilliant time and made several successful investments," she said.
"However, due to a packed schedule and international commitments... I sadly cannot commit to the filming schedule.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my time on Dragons' Den and met many inspiring entrepreneurs along my journey. I will continue to work and invest in young entrepreneurs.
"I wish everyone on the show the best luck. What's left to say but 'I'm out.'"
A replacement for Hoppen has yet to be announced.
The designer was drafted in to take the place of previous Dragon Hilary Devey, who also appeared on the programme for just two series.
Duncan Bannatyne has also announced the current series will be his last after a 10-year run.
It leaves Peter Jones as the only investor from the original series line-up.
