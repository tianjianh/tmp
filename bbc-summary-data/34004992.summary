[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cumbria Police officer has been found guilty of causing the death of a motorcyclist by careless driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Gibson, 23, died in a collision with a police van on the A590 between Melton and Lindal on 4 April 2014.
PC Patsy Blakeborough was performing a U-turn when her vehicle collided with Mr Gibson's Honda motorbike, Carlisle Crown Court heard.
The 41-year-old, of Tamar Gardens, Walney, was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work and a 12-month driving ban.
The jury heard Mr Gibson, of Barrow, suffered multiple injuries in the crash, which happened at about 10:30 BST. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Blakeborough, who denied the charge, wept in the dock after the unanimous verdict was announced.
Her defence barrister, Mark Aldred, told the court the married mother-of-two's job was "now in jeopardy".
"Her husband is a soldier who was injured on duty. She is the sole bread-winner in her family," he said.
"She has shown considerable remorse and is still emotionally affected by what has happened."
Judge Paul Batty QC called the case "truly a human tragedy" for the parties involved.
He told Blakeborough: "You made, on the night, a bad decision to do a U-turn."
During the trial, the jury was told Mr Gibson was probably speeding at the time of the crash.
