[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southport 0-0 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport climbed out of the bottom four of the National League despite being held to a goalless draw at home by Solihull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moors keeper Daniel Lewis was in inspired form for the visitors throughout, and was forced into action in the opening stages as he made a point-blank save from Andrai Jones.
Akwasi Asante, having scored five goals in as many games, went close twice at the other end for Solihull, seeing his shot well-saved before firing against the angle of post and bar after 17 minutes.
Asante went close again before Lewis made a fine save from Jack Higgins' header shortly after the break.
Jack Byrne had a header cleared off the line in the dying moments as Solihull threatened to take the win, but both sides had to settle for a point.
