The new positions will be based at the company's call centre at Springtown business park.
The jobs will bring the total local workforce at the firm to over 300. Axa has operated in the city since 2007.
In February, the company confirmed it would be relocating some roles from Dublin to the north west.
Centre manager Sean Harnett said their customer contact centre in Derry "efficiently services the company's business operations across the Island of Ireland while, at the same time, building on AXA's strong presence with 15 branches across Northern Ireland".
The jobs are a mixture of part-time and full-time permanent posts.
