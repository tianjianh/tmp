Protection order for 200-year-old Carnoustie tree

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A preservation order has been granted for a 200-year-old tree in Carnoustie, said to have given the town its name.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Residents in the town have spent 18 years campaigning to have the Dibble Tree in Ferrier Street protected.
The 30ft (9m) "cricket bat" willow was planted in 1797, and the present town of Carnoustie grew up around it.
Carnoustie's name is said to derive from the Scottish phrase craw's noustie, or crow's nest, after the birds which nest in the tree.
The Dibble Tree now sits between a back lane and a disused public toilet, and fears were raised after adjacent trees were cut down.
It dates back to the late 1790s when Thomas Lowson, a loom wright, was granted the first patch of land in the area now occupied by the town.
In 1797, it is said that while farming cabbage he left the willow stick he had been using stuck in the ground, and later found it had taken root and sprouted leaves.
Angus Council head of planning Vivien Smith recommended the order be granted, calling the tree "an important part of cultural history".
Willows are not normally expected to live more than 150 years, but the Dibble Tree has prospered despite being split in two almost to the roots by a lightning strike in the 19th Century.
Mr Lowson's great-great-grandson Davie, 94, had supported the call for the preservation order.
