The Britain's Got Talent judge has signed a deal with Scholastic to write two books about Aurora Beam, a young girl who happens to be a superhero.
The ex-Strictly champ said she wanted to "create a strong female character who young girls and boys can hopefully be inspired by and look up to".
The singer and presenter confirmed the news on Instagram.
Dixon said she was "delighted to be working" with Scholastic on the books, the first of which will be out next spring.
The deal sees the former Mis-teeq member join a growing number of celebs who have written books for kids, including:
Nine stars who became unlikely children's authors
Earlier this month politician George Galloway revealed he had signed a deal to write a series of children's books about an "ethical pirate" called Red Molucca.
DJ Greg James, meanwhile, has teamed up with Radio 1 colleague Chris Smith to write a series of books about an ordinary boy - "Kid Normal" - who attends a school for children with super powers.
