Reading 2-1 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading reclaimed third place in the Championship with a hard-fought victory over Cardiff City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joe Ralls hit the post from 18 yards for the visitors before John Swift swept Reading in front from Garath McCleary's neat back-heel.
Cardiff soon levelled when Ralls tucked home from the penalty spot after Liam Moore tripped Sean Morrison.
But Yann Kermorgant fired in the winner direct from a free-kick after he was fouled by Sol Bamba.
Reading's victory lifts them back above Leeds and leaves Jaap Stam's team six points behind the two automatic promotion places.
The home side dominated the game in terms of possession but Cardiff, who remain 16th after this loss, always carried a threat and registered more attempts on goal than their hosts.
After the Royals went in front for the second time, home goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi tipped over Junior Hoilett's free-kick and clawed away Kermorgant's sliced attempted clearance.
Kadeem Harris also clipped an effort across the face of goal for the Bluebirds but Reading held on.
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"The teams around us are close so it's good to keep the momentum going and keep winning games.
"Cardiff kept us going until the end. We knew what their qualities were and how they played. We saw them a couple of times.
"They tried to stop us playing at the start by getting everyone compact and not giving us the space to get through.
"We didn't make the right choices always. We needed to move the ball more from side to side, to wear out Cardiff."
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock:
"I wouldn't have swapped too many players on the different sides today but we've lost the game.
"I know the style I want, we want to excite people, and I don't think we're far away from being a very good side."
