British fencer Richard Kruse produced his best performance of the season to win the Shanghai Grand Prix - just days after being mugged in the Chinese city.

Kruse, ranked 10th in the world, beat Italy's Alessio Foconi 15-8 in the final to win the foil.
The 33-year-old was attacked shortly after arriving in Shanghai last week.
"The adrenaline that went through my body was unbelievable," said Kruse, who will rise to world number five. "When I came to fence, I was ready to fight."
Kruse, who finished fourth at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, received a bye through the qualifying rounds in Shanghai before beating German fencer Benjamin Kleibrink in his opener.
Further victories over American Nick Itkin, Hong Kong's world number seven Cheung Ka-long, Italian Lorenzo Nista and France's world number six Erwann le Pechoux set up the meeting with Foconi in the showpiece.
"Maybe coming fourth in Rio was the best thing to happen to me," said Kruse, who missed out on Great Britain's first Olympic fencing medal in 52 years.
"Had I got a medal then perhaps I wouldn't have had the motivation to carry on."
