PM's EU negotiations of no significance - Lord Lawson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron is unlikely to achieve anything of significance as he seeks to renegotiate the UK's EU membership, former Chancellor Lord Lawson has said.

The Eurosceptic Conservative peer said the prime minister's efforts probably will not deliver "fundamental change".
Lord Lawson told BBC Newsnight the PM promised to hold an in/out referendum "largely" to keep the Tories together.
Speaking on the eve of the anniversary of the 1975 referendum, he feels the UK will vote to stay in and "regret it".
Lord Lawson said: "I think it's likely that the changes that David Cameron will secure will be inconsequential, of no significance at all.... but given the authority he has and the lack of a credible opposition leader I think it will be the same result."
He added there "isn't anybody" he can see who would be an effective leader of the campaign for an EU exit.
Last week, the prime minister began meeting European leaders as he tried to gather support for changes he wants before holding the UK's EU membership referendum, a vote which is to take place by the end of 2017.
Tighter rules on migrants' benefits are a priority for the Conservatives, as they want to control immigration from the EU.
Mr Cameron also wants an opt-out from the EU pledge of "ever closer union" and more influence for national parliaments over European laws.
Lord Lawson told Newsnight there was "a very small outside chance that he might achieve something of significance" but it was more likely to be "trivial".
He added that "in the short term, the next few years the PM will have bought peace in the Tory party".
On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was confident conditions can be created for the UK to stay in the EU.
"It's not about losing sleep over this, but about doing our work and creating the necessary preconditions for Britain to remain in the EU," she told the BBC.
Mrs Merkel said: "There are other points where we have a different opinion, but we have always been able also to pursue a Europe at different speeds, to find opt-out solutions for example."
Meanwhile, a survey for think tank British Future suggests most people have still not made up their minds on which way to vote in the referendum.
David Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means:

Why Germany is David Cameron's new best friend
The online poll of 3,977 people across Britain found fewer than a third have firmly made a decision.
Only 16% of those questioned said they were definitely in favour of staying in the EU, while 12% said definitely in favour of leaving.
Of those surveyed, 31% said they were leaning towards staying and 28% towards leaving but they would want to see the final conditions of any deal Mr Cameron could secure with Brussels.
