The five-day festival features 150 films and is expected to attract about 30,000 people.
The event will also feature a series of talks from people including Sir David Attenborough, Joanna Lumley, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Professor Green.
Doc/Fest will open later with the UK premiere of political activist Michael Moore's 'Where to Invade Next'.
Claire Aguilar, the festival's director of programming said: "It's great to be able to connect the films to the people from the industry and also to the general population.
"It's an event that engages the whole city."
The festival will also focus on interactive media and virtual reality in its Alternate Realties strand.
Among the events is the premiere of three BBC Virtual reality experiments and the first UK demonstration of holographic technology, which allows people to have a virtual conversation with a hologram - in this case, a Holocaust survivor.
Mark Atkin, curator of Alternate Realities, said the section had grown in recent years.
He said: "Two years ago we had two virtual reality projects at Sheffield Doc/Fest. Last year we had nine.
"This year we have created a Virtual Reality award, making Sheffield Doc/Fest the first film festival to announce such an award."
