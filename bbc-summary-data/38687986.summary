The 17 linocut prints are on display from Saturday at a free exhibition at the town's Cooper Gallery.
The valuable prints are out on loan from the British Museum and were previously on display at the Lady Lever Art Gallery near Liverpool.
Barnsley-born Ian Macmillan has written a poem about a previous visit by the artist to South Yorkshire.
Mr Macmillan was inspired by Picasso's visit to Sheffield in 1950 for an international peace conference.

The Spanish artist is acknowledged to be one of the most important artists of the 20th Century.
He experimented with a wide range of styles and themes in his long career, most notably inspiring Cubism.
The artworks at the gallery include prints showing the development of key Picasso prints including Jacqueline Reading that depicts the artist's wife, Jacqueline Roque.
Mr Macmillan said: "It shows the dynamic cultural times we're living through round here and that the town is becoming even more of an artistic and creative hub."
The Picasso prints are on show until 29 April.
