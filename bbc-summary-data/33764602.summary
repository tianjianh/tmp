Farmers with a dozen tractors held protests at three supermarkets in Coleraine on Monday night.

They say the price of milk is too low for them to make a living.
The tractors started off in a shopping centre car park and their first stop was at Sainsbury's.
After taking supermarket trolleys into the store, the farmers surrounded the milk fridge in an attempt to let shoppers know how their incomes have fallen.
They partly blame supermarkets for the reduction in the price of milk.
They are being paid 10p a litre less this year than last.
They also went to Tesco and Asda stores.
Police and supermarket management took a low-key approach during the protests - as long as shop business was not disrupted the protests were allowed to continue.
Later, a lorry delivering milk to Tesco Bannside was blocked by the farmers.
One of those taking part in the protest, Paddy Brennan, said: "We're definitely worse off - we've no money to do nothing.
"We went and bought more land, more cows and now we're losing money - there's 11p of difference between this time last year."
On Friday, dozens of farmers protested against low milk prices at a supermarket in Strabane, County Tyrone, on Friday night.
Up to 50 tractors blocked a lane into the Asda car park.
Farmers went into the store and cleared bottles of milk from the shelves, took it to the checkouts and left it there in trolleys.
The police say they received no complaints. Asda said it respects the right to peaceful protest.
