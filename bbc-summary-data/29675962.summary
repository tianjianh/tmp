The Royal National Mod 2014, which has ended after nine days of competition and events in Inverness, has been hailed a "huge success" by its hosts.

Gaelic's showcase of language, song and arts is expected to have brought in up to Â£3m to the local economy.
Inverness hosted the event for the first time in 17 years.
It ended with a mass choir procession and a ceremony handing the reins to representatives from the 2015 host town, Oban.
Highland Council convener Jimmy Gray said: "The Highland Council sees this year's Mod as an incredible success for the city as well as for competitors, their families, supporters, visitors to the Highlands, and not to mention the people of Inverness, who have joined in and embraced this vibrant celebration of Gaelic culture.
"Businesses have received a very welcome economic boost at what is traditionally a quieter time of the year and the atmosphere during the day and in the evening within the city centre has been really fantastic."
Mike Cantlay, chairman of tourism body VisitScotland, said: "Our unique culture is one of the many reasons why people choose to visit Scotland.
"It's clear from the success of this year's Royal National Mod that traditional Gaelic culture continues to delight and enthuse people from across the world."
During the festival, more than 3,000 entrants competed in 200 competitions in Highland dancing, music, song, literature and drama.
It featured the biggest programme of fringe events in the Mod's 122-year history.
Next year's festival will take place in Oban from 9-17 October.
