Cheryl James Deepcut death: Family in exhumation call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a soldier found dead at Deepcut Barracks has urged a coroner to let her body be exhumed so a "full inquiry" can be held into her death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a bullet wound to her head in Surrey in 1995.
Her parents said a dispute over the ballistics evidence could only be resolved if her body is exhumed.
Coroner Brian Barker QC said he would wait for a doctor's report before he made the decision.
He told the pre-inquest review at Woking Coroner's Court that exhumation was a "difficult and unusual" step.
Alison Foster QC, representing Pte James' family, said her relatives were "really dismayed to be at this point today".
"From our standpoint, an exhumation would be necessary for you to carry out a full and proper inquiry."
Bullet fragments in Pte James' body were yellow, while the SA80 rifle she was armed with used red bullets, Ms Foster said.
"There is no actual evidence that it was an SA80 that caused the bullet wound to Cheryl," she added.
The coroner said the full inquest on 1 February would consider whether there were "shortcomings" with the barracks's policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young females, drugs, alcohol and accommodation.
Another pre-inquest hearing is to held on 10 September.
Pte James was one of four soldiers found dead at Deepcut, in Camberley, between 1995 and 2002.
Surrey Police's request that her inquest should be heard alongside fresh inquests into the deaths of Privates Sean Benton, Geoff Gray and James Collinson was turned down.
A spokeswoman for the force said: "[Surrey Police] has now completed the review of disclosure documents relating to Pte James."
She said arrangements for the inquest were a matter for the coroner.
"Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into circumstances surrounding the death of Pte James and our thoughts remain with her family."
