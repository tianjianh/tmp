The Neath-born mezzo-soprano, 34, wed Andrew Levitas, a film director and artist, at the ceremony on Saturday evening.
The couple had to be given permission from Buckingham Palace to fly the Welsh dragon at their wedding venue.
The singer later tweeted fans, thanking them for their "love and support".
"It's already been such a special day & wanted to share my happiness with you xxx," she wrote.
The relationship between Jenkins and Levitas became public in March when he accompanied the singer to Buckingham Palace to collect her OBE.
There was tight security surrounding the event.
It is known that the Welsh flag was raised at about 18:00 BST on Saturday as the wedding got under way.
Guests were treated to a wedding breakfast full of Welsh produce, including Welsh cheeses, black beef and lamb.
They were also entertained by a harpist.
The singer was previously engaged to Cardiff-born television presenter Gethin Jones but the pair split up in early 2012.
