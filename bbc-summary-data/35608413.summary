[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Tooth, 32, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, was detained in Badacsonytoma, by Hungarian Police and Greater Manchester Police.
Tooth was convicted of wounding in his absence in 2010 following the assault outside The Angel pub, Royton, in 2008.
The National Crime Agency said he would be sentenced following extradition.
Tooth has evaded justice since 2010 when he failed to appear at court and was found guilty in his absence of affray and unlawful wounding.
Dave Allen, head of the International Crime Bureau at the agency, said: "Thomas Tooth is a violent criminal who wanted to evade justice by fleeing the country."
Tooth is the 10th fugitive to be arrested as part of Operation Return, a joint initiative involving the National Crime Agency, Crimestoppers UK, Bel M (Dutch Crimestoppers) and the Dutch authorities.
He featured in an Operation Return campaign after spending some time in the Netherlands while on the run.
