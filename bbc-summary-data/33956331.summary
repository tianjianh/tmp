Petition pressure on police chief Nick Gargan after misconduct ruling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pressure continues to build on Chief Constable Nick Gargan, as hundreds have signed a petition calling on him to go.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Avon and Somerset's Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens accepted the petition at police HQ in Portishead on Monday.
Mr Gargan has been found guilty of eight counts of misconduct, details of which have not yet been made public.
He has said he understands people's concerns but is looking forward to rebuilding confidence in the force.
Ms Mountstevens is due to determine Mr Gargan's future at a sanctions hearing on Wednesday over the misconduct findings.
He was suspended in May 2014 while the IPCC investigated claims of inappropriate conduct and data breaches against him.
Last month an independent panel cleared him of gross misconduct but found him guilty of eight misconduct charges.
His critics say he should resign, or be required to resign. The sanction recommended by the panel that found him guilty was the most severe available - eight final written warnings, one for each misconduct finding.
Ms Mountstevens has been urged to use the powers available to PCCs to call upon the chief constable to resign.
Three former chief constables have written to her, saying Mr Gargan should go for the good of the force.
She has said she is taking concerns seriously but does not want to comment before the misconduct process is finalised.
Mr Gargan has said he understands people have questions and said he would address them. In July he said he was "very much looking forward to returning to work" and "beginning the process of rebuilding confidence in the force".
