The officer said the vehicle was "one of several" caught exceeding the limit in the area.
"It's very dangerous, not just for the driver but everyone around him, and for myself having to travel at those speeds on a motorcycle to catch and stop him," he said.
Shortly before the Audi was stopped, the same officer had pulled over a motorcycle speeding at more than 100mph (160km/h) on the same stretch of 70mph (112km/h) road.
