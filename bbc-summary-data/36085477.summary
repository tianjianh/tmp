It comes after the trust was scrutinised by MPs following the "preventable" death of an 18-year-old.
In 2013, Connor Sparrowhawk drowned in a bath after suffering an epileptic fit in Oxford.
Suella Fernandes, an MP for Hampshire, said a debate will be held at the end of the month.
Trust chief executive Katrina Percy, addressed MPs at a meeting of the Hampshire All-Party Parliamentary Group on Tuesday.
Speaking after the meeting Ms Suella, Conservative MP for Fareham, said: "Whilst I appreciate Katrina Percy's willingness to answer our questions, I told her that I still have serious concerns about the failings in the trust's governance which have now been highlighted by two investigations.
"The CQC's warning notice is a serious matter, and time is running out for the trust to demonstrate that it has the right leadership to make the changes required."
After an inspection in January, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found there were "longstanding risks to patients" and investigations into deaths "were not good enough."
Scrutiny of the trust was sparked by the death of Connor at Slade House in Oxford, in 2013.
A report commissioned by NHS England showed that of 722 unexpected deaths at Southern Health over four years, only 272 had been investigated.
Ms Percy has previously apologised for the issues that came to light following several inspections by government watchdogs.
A debate is due to be held after the publication of the full report from the CQC, expected at the end of the month.
