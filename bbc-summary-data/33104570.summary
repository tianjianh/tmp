The trust said E.coli 0157 has been detected during routine sampling at the main kitchen at the hospital.
"No patients, staff or members of the public have shown symptoms of being affected by this bacteria," it said.
"We currently have stringent food safety measures in place and are liaising with all relevant agencies."
DUP assembly member Sydney Anderson said the news would cause concern among patients and staff.
"However, it demonstrates that the routine checks carried out in the kitchens are necessary and are capable of identifying the presence of this bacteria without anyone displaying symptoms of infection," he added.
