Barrie played in the garden of the house when he was a child.
Historic Scotland's Building Repair Grants Scheme will also fund repairs at medieval Dean Castle in Kilmarnock.
There are also awards for Cambo Stables in Fife and Brough Lodge in Shetland.
The funding was announced by Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop.
She said: "Our diverse built heritage plays an important role in towns and cities across Scotland and forms a key part of our cultural identity.
"The recipients of this award showcase the scope and scale of these buildings and investing in their repair will ensure they can open their doors to the public for years to come."
Dean Castle will receive £500,000 to carry out urgent repairs, including making the castle watertight and repairing fallen masonry.
The Battery on Lamer Island, Dunbar, has been awarded £56,344 towards improving public access.
Brough Lodge on Shetland will receive more than £460,000 to complete all repairs and begin welcoming tourists to the island of Fetlar, which has a population of 61.
An award of £280,000 will go towards restoring a 19th Century stable block at Cambo Stables near St Andrews, and provide visitor and educational facilities.
The derelict Kirkhaven Hall, a category A listed former church hall in Glasgow's Calton district, has been awarded more than £112,000 to create office and training space for groups in the architecture sector.
