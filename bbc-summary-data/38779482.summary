[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Clarkson knocked in a Cammy Smith delivery from close range to give the Buddies a half time lead.
But Christian Nade was given time and space to power in a header from a corner on 56 minutes.
Harry Davis nodded in a debut goal for the visitors but Robert Thomson later finished after a smart turn.
The draw keeps Dumbarton, in eighth spot, 11 points clear of the Paisley side, who could not make up any ground given ninth-placed Ayr United's surprise draw away to leaders Hibernian.
