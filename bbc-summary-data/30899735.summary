[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A solicitor who was convicted of sexually assaulting a colleague has been fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £2,500 in compensation to his victim.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Logue, from Lady Wallace Crescent in Lisburn, County Antrim, carried out the assault at an annual solicitors' function in November 2012.
He denied the offence but was convicted after a two-day trial last month.
As he was sentenced at Downpatrick Magistrates' Court, a defence barrister said Logue's career was "shattered".
The judge warned the 34-year-old defendant that although he was not being placed on the police sex offenders register, "by virtue of the conviction your name may appear on the barred list of working with children and vulnerable adults".
The married father of two is a junior partner in County Down law firm, Joe Mulholland and Company.
During the trial, the victim gave evidence that a drunken Logue pestered her for about 15 minutes, and touched her inappropriately while the pair sat at a table during the function.
The woman said that, initially, she politely told Logue to stop and asked him to "respect my space".
However, she said that she swore at him when he would not take no for an answer and eventually elbowed him in the stomach.
Giving evidence on his own behalf, Logue told the trial that he was in "boisterous form" after a few pints of beer and had recited poetry to those at the table.
He said sexual assault was "absolutely not" his intention.
Passing sentence, the judge warned Logue that his victim still had "civil remedies available to her".
Logue sat five seats away from his victim, with his head bowed and with his hands clasped as his defence barrister described him  as a "skeleton of the man that he once was".
Imposing the fine and compensation order,  the judge said while he accepted Logue's offence was in  the "lowest category" of sexual assault, nevertheless it was still a serious matter that had a negative impact on his victim's family and professional life.
