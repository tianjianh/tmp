The ambulance and fire services were called to the McNeill Court complex in Larne shortly after 10:00 GMT on Thursday.
None of the residents required medical treatment and they have all now returned to the building.
Police are not treating the blaze as suspicious.
Gregg McKeen, a Democratic Unionist Party councillor for the area, said: "Some of the residents were put up in some shops for a short period of time."
