[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The remains of Saima Ahmed, 36, were discovered on Saturday 9 January at Gogar Mount House, on the edge of nearby Gogarburn Golf Club.
It is believed the librarian had travelled by rail from her home in Wembley to Edinburgh a year ago.
Leaflets will also be handed out in Waverley Station on Tuesday.
They will also be given to people in the Wembley area of London, train stations in Hemel Hempsted, Birmingham and elsewhere in Edinburgh.
Police will also be distributing posters and leaflets to visitors to the Unofficial Fringe Venue 999 in East Princes Street Gardens until the end of the festival next week.
Det Ch Insp Martin MacLean, of Police Scotland, said: "There are several outstanding lines of inquiry in what has been a painstaking investigation.
"We still need to establish why Saima came to Scotland and Edinburgh and the circumstances that led to her death.
"The information gathered thus far certainly indicates that Saima left her home on Sunday, August 30th, last year and travelled by train to Edinburgh.
"Now, almost one year on, Edinburgh is again in the midst of hosting the International Festival and there will be a number of people returning to the city who may remember Saima.
"It's my hope that these posters might help jog some memories and we can gain vital information to assist with our investigation."
Ms Ahmed's death is still being treated as unexplained.
Police said she may have been spotted months earlier on Portobello beach - after travelling to the city in August.
A man walking his dog spoke with a woman on the beach, who was walking alone and who closely matched Ms Ahmed's description, at about 10:30 on a Monday in August, possibly 31 August, although the exact date is unknown.
The woman said she had wanted to see the beach and said she had travelled up from London and was going back down later the same day.
The police want to know if she stayed in a guest house there the night before, possibly on Sunday 30 August.
Ms Ahmed's exact movements as she travelled to Scotland remain unconfirmed.
However, detectives now believe she bought a Birmingham to Edinburgh rail ticket at Birmingham New Street Station at about 17:00 on Sunday 30 August 2015.
Officers said there was a strong possibility she then boarded one of two Edinburgh-bound services - either the 17:15 Virgin service due to arrive at Edinburgh Waverley at 22:22, or the 13:30 Virgin Cross Country Network (via York), which was due to arrive at 22:21.
