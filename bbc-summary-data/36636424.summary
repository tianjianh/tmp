[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Centuries from Johann Myburgh and James Hildreth helped Somerset to a huge lead against Hampshire on day two of their County Championship match.

They shared a third-wicket stand of 167 at The Ageas Bowl before Myburgh, in his first four-day appearance of the summer, was dismissed by leg-spinner Mason Crane for 110.
Hildreth was out lbw for 152 to seamer Ryan McLaren (5-104) as Somerset declared on 474-8 - a lead of 255.
Hampshire then closed on 18-1.
Hildreth, one of county cricket's most prolific scorers never to have won an England Test cap, was at his fluent best in a 167-ball knock which included 24 boundaries.
The 31-year-old has now made 721 runs in Division One this season, second only to Durham opener Keaton Jennings, at an average of more than 72.
Myburgh, who has been limited to one-day appearances for Somerset in 2016, was equally as aggressive as he and Hildreth scored at almost five an over.
Once both were out, wicketkeeper Ryan Davies smashed 52 off 39 balls and Craig Overton made an unbeaten 35 in a partnership of 82 in just 10.4 overs, to take Somerset past 400 and earn maximum batting bonus points.
Hampshire suffered a late blow when Jimmy Adams was bowled by Lewis Gregory for nought in their second innings, but captain Will Smith and Tom Alsop held out until stumps.
