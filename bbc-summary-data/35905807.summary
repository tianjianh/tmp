Players Championship: Mark Allen beats Shaun Murphy to reach final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Allen won four frames in a row to beat Shaun Murphy 6-4 and reach the final of the Players Championship in Manchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
World number 10 Allen will now face Ricky Walden, who earlier defeated Barry Hawkins 6-3, on Sunday.
Allen's win prevented Murphy from securing back-to-back world-ranking titles following his victory in the World Grand Prix.
Northern Ireland's Allen, 30, will be looking to win a third ranking event.
Murphy led 2-0 and 4-2 but Allen made a break of 134 in the third frame on his way to repeating the 6-4 victory he enjoyed over the defending Masters champion in January.
Allen will also be hoping to avenge a defeat to Walden, who is ranked 11 in the world, in the final of the 2014 International Championship.
