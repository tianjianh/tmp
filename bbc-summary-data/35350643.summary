Glasgow Warriors flanker Wilson, 26, has been cited for allegedly grabbing the testicles of an opponent in Sunday's defeat by Northampton Saints.
Tim Swinson, 28, who has been cited following a yellow card for punching in the same match, is in the squad.
"We made a decision with Ryan before he was cited," said coach Vern Cotter.
"We're happy with the way he has been improving but we feel that the [other] players are playing better than he is at the moment.
"I had a good talk with him last week. He is focussing on his game and he could come into contention as the competition goes on.
"Rory Sutherland has impressed us. He is coming through. We have worked with him and we think he has the quality to become an international player.
"Zander has done exceptionally well for a 20-year-old prop. He has proved that he has that competitive desire to do well.
"Both these players will get exposure at some stage."
The New Zealander, whose side lost all of last year's Six Nations matches, hopes his players can do "the simple things better" and continue the momentum and progress made at the World Cup, when the Scots reached the quarter-finals.
Experienced Scarlets back-row John Barclay, 29, is selected, having been considered and then left out of the final squad that went to England for last year's showpiece.
Scotland begin the championship at home to England then visit Wales and Italy before hosting France and finishing in Ireland.
"We've selected a mixture of experience with some exciting young players coming through, some of whom have experienced the Rugby World Cup and are eager to move forward, take the Six Nations head on and show that we can develop our game and be competitive," said Cotter.
"I think there should be confidence. The guys have worked hard and improved. There are positive signs that we can compete, and this championship will give us another opportunity to measure ourselves against very good opposition in a tough competition."
Fraser Brown, Grant Gilchrist, Henry Pyrgos, Richie Vernon and Jon Welsh are currently injured but Edinburgh lock Gilchrist and Warriors scrum-half Pyrgos will train with the squad.
Tournament veteran Alasdair Strokosch has retired from international duty.
Mark Bennett, Peter Horne, Tommy Seymour and Tim Visser are included, despite nursing injuries.
"If all goes well, he could be available in three weeks so he may be available for the first game," Cotter said of Bennett.
"There's half a dozen players in the squad that, if the game was this week, they wouldn't make the squad."
Among those who make the squad, John Hardie, Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Josh Strauss are yet to play in the Six Nations.
"I think the group can believe that they can compete and lift to another level again after the World Cup," added Cotter.
