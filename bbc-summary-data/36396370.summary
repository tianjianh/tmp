A Dara McVeety goal in the 25th-minute helped Terry Hyland's men establish a 1-9 to 0-7 half-time lead.
Martin Reilly converted a penalty 10 minutes into the second half after Cian Mackey had been brought down.
Armagh had a chance to cut their deficit to three but Stefan Campbell's weak penalty was saved by home goalkeeper Raymond Galligan.
Seanie Johnston, up against his former boss at Kildare Kieran McGeeney, landed seven points and was one of Cavan's eight scorers on the day.
Just three players were on target for the Orange County and in the end they fell well short.
Armagh played an outfield man in goals, Ballyhegan club man Paul Courtney making his Championship debut.
He was unable to keep out Reilly's penalty while, soon afterwards, his opposite number Raymond Galligan saved Campbell's poorly directed effort.
Armagh made a decent enough start, scoring three of the first four points.
But five unanswered scores - three of them from Johnston - saw things swing the way of the favourites, and there were seven points in it when Reilly advanced to feed McVeety who netted from close-range.
Tony Kernan and Ethan Rafferty got the last two scores of the half, but Armagh still trailed by five at the break.
It looked all over when Reilly's penalty made it 2-11 to 0-9, but Armagh had a great chance to ignite the contest when Killian Clarke's foul on Campbell resulted in a penalty.
However, Campbell's kick was too close to Galligan who saved and Cavan went straight up the pitch to go 2-13 to 0-12 up through Johnston. Then, it really was over.

What they said
Cavan skipper Gearoid McKiernan: "We put massive work in all year and learned a lot from a training camp we had in Portugal.
"We have three weeks now to prepare to play Tyrone and we'll want to put in a good performance at Clones.
"We lost to them in the league final because they played like a Division One side and we played like a Division Two side.
"That is the level we will have to step up to."
