Ranjit Power, owner of Ramada Park Hall Hotel and Spa in Wolverhampton, was reported missing on 14 May after he failed to return from a trip to India.
His daughter Emma said she feared her father had been kidnapped or killed.
"We've got to the point where we believe he is in a situation where he cannot get to a phone," she said.
Ms Power appealed for anyone who may have been on the same flight as her father on 7 May to try to remember whether they saw Mr Power.
"Ask friends, relatives, relatives of relatives, ask anyone," she said.
"We just want our dad home."
