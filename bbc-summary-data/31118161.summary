A planned visitor centre at the Kelpies attraction in Falkirk has been delayed after councillors agreed to expand the project.

Falkirk Council's executive committee agreed to add £160,000 from an existing budget for the centre at the Helix park.
The £1.8m facility will now open to the public in October rather than August.
The extra funding will allow expanded retail space, storage and staff facilities at the visitor centre.
Construction work on the facility has already begun in the shadow of artist Andy Scott's giant horse-head sculptures, which are the centrepiece of the Helix parkland project.
The committee heard that visitor numbers at the Kelpies have been double the original expectation.
The sculptures opened to the public in April last year, and by the end of September 680,000 people had already visited them. It is estimated the figure for their first full year could exceed 950,000.
As well as adding time to expand planned facilities, director of development services Rhona Geisler said rescheduling the opening of the building to after the peak tourist season would allow staff to resolve any "early issues".
The new building, designed by Dundee architects Nicol Russell Studios following an international competition, is to include a cafe, shop, toilets, offices and an exhibition area.
It is designed to merge into the surrounding landscape, to leave full attention on the Kelpies.
Funding has been secured from Score Environment, which distributes money raised from landfill tax, alongside the Scottish government, the Big Lottery Fund, Falkirk Council and Scottish Canals.
Councillor Adrian Mahoney, Falkirk council's spokesman for culture, leisure and tourism, said: "I'm looking forward to seeing the new building being completed.
"Work is progressing well on site and hopefully we will be operational later this year.
"The centre will provide welcome new facilities to the Helix Park to deal with the huge numbers of people visiting the site and seeing the awesome Kelpies."
Temporary visitor facilities are available on-site until the centre is ready to open.
