[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norfolk PC Nathan Lawn sacked for targeting divorce lawyer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has been sacked after he "deliberately targeted" a divorce solicitor who represented his ex-wife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Nathan Lawn purposely pulled the solicitor over in her car for failing to wear a seatbelt, a Norfolk Police misconduct hearing was told.
PC Lawn was "rude and confrontational" and tried to ensure she got a fine and not sent on a driver awareness course.
The hearing was also told he used his position as an officer to try to discredit his ex-wife.
He was dismissed without notice following the hearing.
On 6 October last year, PC Lawn stopped the solicitor in Blofield, Norfolk, to issue her with a traffic offence report (TOR) over the seatbelt infringement.
"At the time PC Lawn knew that she was a solicitor who had represented his ex-wife during his divorce proceedings," the hearing was told.
"PC Lawn deliberately targeted the solicitor when making the stop because she had represented his ex-wife during divorce proceedings.
"During the stop PC Lawn was rude and confrontational towards the solicitor."
He then made a "concerted effort to seek to influence" the outcome of the ticket he issued to ensure the solicitor was fined.
The misconduct hearing, on 8 May, was also told the former PC used his status as an officer to pursue misconduct allegations against his ex-wife with her employer.
After being told the outcome of her firm's investigation, he contacted senior staff on a "number of occasions to overturn" its findings.
He also sought to have the decision reviewed by the Health and Care Professions Council.
"This amounted to an extended and committed campaign to discredit his ex-wife," the hearing was told.
In dismissing PC Lawn, the force hearing found the officer's conduct breached the expected standards of professional behaviour.
