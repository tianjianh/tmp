Gary Clark Jr: 'Playing with The Rolling Stones is surreal'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He won a Grammy for his debut album, calls The Rolling Stones, Foo Fighters and President Obama fans and has performed at The White House - but it's still all sinking in for Gary Clark Jr.

Singer, songwriter and guitarist extraordinaire, Gary Clark Jr says he's had his "mind blown" by the whirlwind of his career so far.
From the moment Eric Clapton invited him to perform at his Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2010, the invitations and endorsements have kept on coming; performing with Beyonce and Ed Sheeran at a Grammys tribute to Stevie Wonder; winning a Grammy of his own for debut Blak and Blue; opening for the The Rolling Stones.
But Clark says returning to his hometown - the music Mecca of Austin, Texas - to produce his second album has given him plenty of time to reflect.
"I really had the time to just think 'wow - this is pretty amazing'," Clark tells the BBC. "It's far exceeded my expectations, dreams and goals in a short period of time.
"It's kind of unbelievable, like - 'did that really happen?' I can't wait to see... I don't know what else can happen!" he laughs.
Fusing Blues, rock, hip-hop, RnB and gospel, Clark's music is hard to pin down and he says that's how he likes it.
"I just like to call it all soul music. I don't ever want to put myself in a box," he says.
"You know [music's] really hard to put in words - I guess that's why we write songs."
Here is what you need to know about Gary Clark Jr, in his own words:
I guess [the album's] kind of like my story, or little snippets from my life - it's not really in chronological order - reflecting on the places that I've been, the experiences that I've had.
A lot of this album was inspired by the fact that my fiance Nicole (Trunfio, the Australian model) was about to have my son Zion - so I was really thinking of life and where I come from and where I want to go, going back home and being around my family and friends.
My mother called me "Sonny Boy" when I was a kid. And musicians on the Blues scene called me "Slim". When I showed up I was like this 14, 15 year-old-kid standing 5,11, maybe 90, 95 pounds. So The Story of Sonny Boy Slim - it just kind of came together that way.
I'm really proud of this record, I put in a lot of work, it's very personal. It's good to get it out of my system. It was kind of easy for me - I was in charge so I felt like 'it's on me, win or lose'.
I always kind of dreamed, 'what would it be like?'. It was pretty incredible. It's not really something you ever expect, so I felt great about it.
The thing that really struck me though is BB King and Buddy Guy, Booker T Jones - the older musicians, African Americans - they grew up in a time where...  you know obviously racist, segregated. So to be in The White House and be honoured and respected for what they've done and the foundation that they've laid? For me to even be thought of to be invited...
I really just couldn't keep my eyes off of [them] and I could see how proud they were. That was a special moment for me and all kind of thoughts [were] going on in my head, but I really felt for them. I was proud to be a part of that.
I still feel kind of out of place, you know - like the shy new guy - so I just respect them and let them do their thing. I don't want to bother anybody, so, just observe, smile and do my thing, try not to mess up.
I couldn't imagine what it's like to be [Obama's] position [as President]. Just to kind of shake it loose for a little while, I think it's good for him, I think it's good for everybody. So more power to him.
I'm looking forward to supporting Foo Fighters. I'm curious and a little bit scared of their antics - I know they like to cause up quite a stir and have a good time, so yeah I'm looking forward to jumping on that and just watching my back!
Being part of [the band's documentary series and album] Sonic Highways was great. Dave Grohl was really easy to talk to and I liked hanging out in the studio with him, I got to play on a track on their record and Pat Smear their guitarist gave me a guitar. I was really impressed by how deep those guys went to really research and expose and share the culture of these cities and I leaned a lot about my home town.
[Grohl's] always got a great attitude. We did this thing, a Beatles tribute a couple of years ago and it was early, maybe nine in the morning, doing this drum soundcheck. And he's just banging on the drums really loud and he lightly puts his drumsticks down and goes, 'good morning everybody'. It was really sweet. I'm looking forward to hanging out with them for sure.
There's a song called Hold On and he's just kind of whining a little bit, making some noise and Nicole's telling him everything will be ok - it's very sweet. I can't wait to have him running around, breaking stuff.
Having him definitely changed things. I feel like every word, every note has to count, has to mean something - otherwise there's no point in doing it. That kind of translates over into my life as well, about making good decisions and leading some sort of an example. I'm still new to it, but it's definitely kept me on my toes, made me pay attention. It's not all about me, like it was when I was in my early 20s.
I didn't really know about [the Austin music scene] until I was maybe 14 years old, because I grew up outside of the city, a little area called Oak Hill - riding around on bikes, playing skateboards, hanging around by the creek playing baseball. Until I became a teenager, and then my whole world opened up. I couldn't believe it, I just jumped right in, this never ending musical pool.
Quite honestly once I found out the music scene was going on, I lost interest in anything else. I just wanted to take my guitar everywhere and just soak up the sounds. It was really inspiring to see like jazz in one club and Blues and funk and country and reggae and bluegrass, all on one street. I would go watch the music and then immediately go back and practise, because I wanted to be a part of that scene really bad.
It's a trip, you know - to be singing on a microphone and have Mick Jagger right on my face and I'm singing with him - and look over and there's Ronnie and Charlie, Keith. That to me is one of the most surreal moments I've had playing music. They're like the biggest band in the world and [have] been doing it for such a long time.
I've definitely become more confident I think. The biggest confidence booster is to be able to play alongside people that I admire and look up to. If I have any doubts, [I] get a call from somebody who goes 'hey I want you to come [and play with me]', and it's like, 'oh right. Well I guess I must be alright!' I'm feeling better. It's like a light little pat on the back - 'you got this'.
The Story of Sonny Boy Slim by Gary Clark Jr is out today. He plays three nights at Camden's Electric Ballroom in London on 14, 15, 16 November.
