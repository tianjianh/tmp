Jess Ryan, 25, must spend a minimum of 25 years in prison while Jack Ryan, 22, must serve at least 21 years.
The brothers, from Toronto Road, were found guilty of murdering George Dagg, 53, and sentenced on Monday.
After the sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court Mr Dagg's sons called the brothers "callous and cowardly".
The court heard Jess Ryan stabbed Mr Dagg in the back of the leg in Sunderland on 2 June with the help of his brother Jack after an argument.
Mr Dagg's sons, Marlon and Robert, said: "They have ripped our whole family apart and taken away someone we love who we can never get back and that's something we now have to live with for the rest of our lives.
"Our father had his back turned and was walking away when he was stabbed from behind - this is callous and cowardly as our father was defenceless and unarmed."
The Dagg brothers also thanked the community of Plains Farm, where Mr Dagg lived, for supporting them and giving evidence against the Ryans.
They also joined Northumbria Police in criticising the Ryan brothers for initially blaming another man, who has subsequently died, for the murder.
Det Insp Mark Ord, from Northumbria Police's major crime team, said: "Mr Dagg was walking away from Jack and Jess when he was stabbed once in the thigh which caused a catastrophic loss of blood and resulted in his death a few days later in hospital.
"This was a senseless attack by the brothers."
Mr Ord also praised the Dagg family for their "strength, courage and dignity" shown throughout the trial.
