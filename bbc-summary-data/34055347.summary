Transfer deadline day: Spending, targets and how to follow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spending by clubs in England still has some way to go on deadline day if it is to surpass the record figure of the last summer transfer window.

Going in to the last week of this window, £680m had been spent, still some way short of 2014's £835m.
However, the 2015 figure is 4% higher than at the same point last year, according to finance experts Deloitte.
And with some big deals reportedly in the pipeline before Tuesday's deadline, clubs could set a new benchmark.
In England, the transfer window for both the Premier League and Football League closes at 18:00 BST on 1 September.
Six hours later, at midnight, the window in Scotland will close.
The deadline was shifted from 31 August as Premier League rules prevent it from falling on a Bank Holiday.
But as Champions League squads must be submitted to Uefa by 23:00 BST on 1 September, the Premier League has decided on a 18:00 BST deadline.
The windows for most of Europe's top leagues close on 31 August, including Germany (18:00 BST), Italy (23:00) and France, Spain and the Netherlands (all at midnight).
The passing of deadlines only affects the purchasing of players, meaning English sides can still buy from clubs in other countries until the window shuts in England.

Kevin de Bruyne's move to Manchester City from Wolfsburg for a club-record fee understood to be £55m has been the biggest deal, in monetary terms, eclipsing the £44m they spent to recruit Raheem Sterling from Liverpool. Those deals are among seven summer signings by City, including Fabian Delph,Patrick Roberts and Nicolas Otamendi.
Liverpool have used the Sterling money (and more) to sign seven players, with Christian Benteke (£32.5m),Roberto Firmino (£29m) and Nathaniel Clyne (£12m) the most expensive.
Manchester United have also been busy, spending £83m to bring in Memphis Depay,Matteo Darmian,Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin, while Chelsea have left it late in the window to conduct their serious business, signing Pedro and Baba Rahman.
Newly promoted Watford have been the busiest so far, signing 12 players, although clubs across the Premier League have ensured their finance departments remained busy throughout the summer.
Chelsea could continue their late-window spree by signing Everton's England defender John Stones, who handed in a transfer request last week.
The Blues have already seen bids of £20m, £26m and £30m rejected by the Toffees, who are adamant the player is not for sale.
Another player who has asked to leave his current club is West Brom's Saido Berahino, with the Baggies' resolve to keep the England Under-21 striker having already been tested by two bids from Tottenham, worth £18m and £22m.
However, Spurs have since signed South Korea international Son Heung-min, which could signal an end to their pursuit of the Baggies forward.
Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has hinted at a "surprise" signing, with a forward likely to be high on his shopping list, while West Brom's Tony Pulis has big plans, although this could depend on Berahino's departure.
With the Premier League TV rights deal increasing from £3.018bn to £5.136bn for three seasons from the 2016-17 season, clubs have more spending power than ever before and an even greater reason to ensure they remain in the top flight.
