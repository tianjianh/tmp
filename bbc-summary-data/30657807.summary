Police said the 38-year-old was walking along Arthurlie Street, Barrhead, at about 12:00 when he was approached from behind and pulled to the ground.
A local resident contacted emergency services and the injured man was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.
His condition has been described as stable.
The suspect was described as being about 40 years old, 6ft 2in and was wearing a hooded jacket.
Det Con Jacqui Carroll: "This was a particularly vicious attack and as yet we have still to establish a motive.
"We are currently viewing CCTV in the area and I'd like to speak to anyone who was in the vicinity of Arthurlie Street at midday on 1 January who either witnessed this attack or perhaps saw the culprit running off."
