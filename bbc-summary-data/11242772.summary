The 60 life-size cast iron human figures of Critical Mass, one of Gormley's best-known works, are on show at Bexhill's De La Warr Pavilion.
The Duchess, president of the pavilion, visited the Grade I listed building for its 75th anniversary.
She also toured the Tomok Takahashi Introspective Retrospective exhibition.
Vice-chair of the Pavilion, Sara Stonor, told the Duchess in front of the invited audience: "It was the vision of the 9th Earl De La Warr to create a people's palace in Bexhill. He chose the best architects of his day in Mendelsohn and Chermayeff.
"We continue to this day in choosing the very best international exhibitions and performances to fill this remarkable space."
The pavilion was commissioned by the ninth Earl De La Warr, designed by Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff, and opened in 1935.
The Duchess  sat down to speak to 100-year-old George Korner, a cousin of Mr Chermayeff.
She then visited Chailey Heritage School for disabled children and young adults in North Chailey, Lewes and met children, staff and volunteers.
Principal Sylvia Lamb and head teacher Simon Yates showed her facilities including the multi sensory studio and horse riding area.
