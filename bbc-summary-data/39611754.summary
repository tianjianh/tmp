Jamie O'Hara: Billericay Town fine midfielder after he confronts fan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Premier League player Jamie O'Hara has been fined two weeks' wages by his team Billericay Town for confronting a fan following their match at Leatherhead.

The incident happened as ex-Spurs and Wolves midfielder O'Hara, 30, left the pitch after a 3-2 loss in the seventh-tier Isthmian League Premier Division.
He pushed a spectator before being pulled away by team-mates.
Former England Under-21 international O'Hara joined Billericay in March.
The Essex club's owner and manager Glenn Tamplin claimed the former England Under-21 international had been spat at and had things thrown at him as well as being verbally abused.
"As Jamie O'Hara, Paul Konchesky and I left the pitch after the game we began to receive a totally unprecedented level of abuse from gathering opposition fans," said Tamplin.
"The three of us were unsurprisingly concerned for our safety and this led to a regrettable incident where Jamie reacted by pushing away a fan because of the abuse, which included him being spat at and having things thrown at him.
"As a club, and personally, the reaction was wholly unacceptable and a most regrettable incident. As I intervened to pull Jamie away I was punched in the back of the head, which underlines the level of abuse and anger being directed towards us.
"Billericay Football Club doesn't condone any reaction to provocation, be it on or off the field, therefore we have deducted Jamie two weeks' wages and made it very clear to him that any future incidents of a similar nature will lead to him being released from the club."
The team made the news last week when they performed a rendition of R Kelly's The World's Greatest in the dressing room before the Ryman League Cup final.
