Matthew Edwards, 20, of Southern Avenue, Preston, pleaded guilty at Preston Magistrates' Court.
Evatt, 33, alleged he was "punched, kicked and spat on" by rival fans after his team lost 3-0 at Deepdale.
The player previously played for Preston's Lancashire rivals Blackpool.
The assault happened after "an otherwise largely peaceful incursion on to the pitch" at the end of the match on Sunday, Lancashire Police said.
