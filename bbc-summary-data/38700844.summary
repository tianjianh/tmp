[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Rodman's first goal for Shrewsbury rescued a vital point for Paul Hurst's side, who moved up to 19th in League One courtesy of a draw at Gillingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts controlled the game in the first half, with Cody McDonald and Josh Wright both going close.
And they eventually opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time when Stuart Nelson's clearance found its way to Deji Oshilaja, who won the aerial battle with Aristote Nsiala and calmly guided a left-footed shot beyond Jayson Leutwiler.
After the break, the Shrews showed some signs of life when Tyler Roberts' low cross was met by Rodman, who somehow hit the post from just six yards out.
However, Rodman put his miss behind him swiftly. An awkward ball fell to Roberts whose effort was saved, but Rodman headed the rebound into the empty net just after the hour mark.
Both sides missed glorious chances to snatch all three points, Gills captain Max Ehmer striking the post from eight yards out, before Shrews substitute Louis Dodds blazed a loose ball over four minutes from time.
