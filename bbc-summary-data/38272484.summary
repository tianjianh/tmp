[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 1-0 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scott Kashket goal was enough for Wycombe Wanderers to see off a well-organised Leyton Orient side at Adams Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kashket's 49th-minute strike, against his former club, registered his 11th goal of the season and gave Wanderers an eighth win in a row, while Orient are languishing close to the relegation zone.
All eyes were on the in-form Kashket, facing Orient for the first time since his summer move, and it was the 20-year-old who opened the scoring just after the break.
The ball fell to the winger who guided his left-footed shot beyond the reach of goalkeeper Alex Cisak.
However, the visitors had nearly taken the lead on the half-hour mark when Jay Simpson's left-footed strike whistled past Jamal Blackman's post.
And Orient again thought they had the lead when Paul McCallum turned Jay Simpson's low cross into the roof of the net. However, the goal was ruled out for offside.
The game petered out in the final half hour as neither side went close, handing Wanderers maximum points.
