Electrician Carl Holdsworth has set up holographic video footage of Mr and Mrs Claus behind the windows of his Chaddesden house.
It suggest Father Christmas is in his front room preparing for the festive season.
Mrs Claus can be seen waving to passersby from an upstairs window.
Mr Holdsworth said people are coming from all over the city and on one occasion he was woken in the middle of the night by visitors from Cambridge who wanted to see the spectacle.
"We switched it on for them and they started carol singing at 1:15 in the morning. I don't think the neighbours were too appreciative but it was all in the festive spirit," he said.
He promised that next year it would be even better and said it was for the public to enjoy.
"It's been fun. A lot of people have enjoyed it and that's what we are doing it for, it's not for me. It's for people to enjoy," he added.
