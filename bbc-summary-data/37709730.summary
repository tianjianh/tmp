Campaign to collect five tonnes of clothes in Cardiff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents in Cardiff are being asked to donate unwanted clothes as part of a campaign to collect five tonnes of garments in the capital.

Love Your Clothes launches on Saturday and aims to encourage people to recycle or reuse clothes, rather than throwing them out with household waste.
In March, a similar event in Bangor collected two tonnes of clothes - double the original target.
Across the UK, 350,000 tonnes of clothing goes to landfill each year.
Everything donated will be given to YMCA Cardiff and other charities in Wales.
The event is in conjunction with Cardiff Fashion Week, which will see models march through the city centre as part of the launch on Saturday.
A weekly series of pop-up events then take place from Monday, including a sewathon and "upcycling" workshops.
Jamie Perry, of Love Your Clothes, said: "By calling on local people to collect a massive five tonnes of clothing, we will be ensuring it doesn't go to waste, and giving it a new lease of life for a good cause."
