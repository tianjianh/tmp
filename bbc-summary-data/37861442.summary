Schmeichel, 29, injured his right hand during the first half but managed to finish the 0-0 draw.
Leicester are the first team in Champions League history to keep clean sheets in their first four games.
Schmeichel will see a specialist when he returns to England with the rest of the squad on Thursday.
The Denmark international is "set for a spell on the sidelines", according to a Leicester statement.
Schmeichel signed a new five-year deal with Premier League champions Leicester in August
He played in all 38 of the Foxes' league fixtures last season, keeping 15 clean sheets.
He has made more than 200 appearances for Leicester since arriving from Leeds United in 2011, having started his career at Manchester City.
Ron-Robert Zieler is Leicester's back-up keeper.
The 27-year-old, who was part of the Germany squad that won the 2014 World Cup, joined the Foxes in June from Hannover 96 for an undisclosed fee.
Zieler's last Leicester start ended in a 4-1 defeat at Manchester United on 24 September.
He is set to start Sunday's Premier League home game with West Brom.
