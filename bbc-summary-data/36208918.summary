Fehily, 40, was unseated from the Nick Mitchell-trained Hinxworth in the handicap hurdle at 16:10 BST.
Racing was delayed by more than 30 minutes as medics attended to Fehily, who was taken to Derriford Hospital for precautionary X-rays on his back.
"He was talking, moving his arms and legs but they just want to be on the safe side," said Mitchell.
Irishman Fehily rode 122 winners last season.
His big-race victories include the 2012 Champion Hurdle with Rock on Ruby, and two King George VI Chase wins on Silviniaco Conti.
