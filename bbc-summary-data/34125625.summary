[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Family said father-of-two Masoud Esmailian, 46, "always thought of others before himself".
Police found his body at an address in Montgomery Walk, West Bromwich, after they were called out on Friday.
Family said Mr Esmailian, who would have celebrated his birthday on Tuesday, "was well thought of" by community members and would be "irreplaceable".
Officers have launched a murder investigation and appealed for information about Mr Esmailian's death.
His family said: "Masoud will always be in our hearts, the hardest thing to comprehend is that we will never see him again.
"He will not be here to see his sons marry and will never become a grandfather and see the children they will go on to have."
