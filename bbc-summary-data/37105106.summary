The programme followed the former Olympic athlete after she made the transition to a woman after previously living as Bruce.
The show launched with 2.7 million US viewers last year, but the average audience has now sunk to about 700,000.
E! said that "Caitlyn and E! have mutually decided not to move forward" with another series.
Jenner will continue to appear on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which also features her daughters Kendall and Kylie and step-daughters Kim, Kourtney and Khloe.
Earlier this year, it was revealed that Jenner will appear in the third series of Amazon's Transparent.
