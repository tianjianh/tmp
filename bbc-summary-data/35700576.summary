Partick Thistle's Steven Lawless happy to delay contract talk

Partick Thistle midfielder Steven Lawless wants to secure the Glasgow club's top-flight status before he decides on his own future.

The 24-year-old, who has been approached by Dundee United, is out of contract at the end of the season and has rejected the offer of a new deal.
"Nothing is set in stone," he said. "I have offers there, but I haven't signed anything yet.
"This is a familiar situation for me. I quite like the one-year deals."
While Thistle are sitting just above the relegation zone in ninth place in the Scottish Premiership, United's position is even more precarious as they are adrift at the bottom of the table.
"Once I have safety for the team, that's when I can start worrying about next season," said Lawless ahead of Thistle's Wednesday trip to Perth to face St Johnstone.
Lawless insisted that uncertainty over where he will be playing his football next season will not hamper his performances as the season draws to a close.
"Most seasons I am out of contract," said the winger who joined Thistle after leaving Motherwell in 2012.
"It has not really affected me over the last couple of years, so I don't think it will this year.
"It is good to have options. That takes a little bit of pressure off you when you are trying to perform, but it will take nothing away from the performances for Thistle."
