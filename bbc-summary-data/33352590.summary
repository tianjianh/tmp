The Airports Commission recommended the London airport expand in a report released on Wednesday.
Birmingham Airport's Paul Kehoe told BBC Midlands Today that a third runway would "draw back traffic that is being farmed out back to Birmingham today".
The report's author Sir Howard Davies said "the economic benefits of expanding Heathrow are much greater than any other option".
