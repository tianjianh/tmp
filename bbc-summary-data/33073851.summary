The GB squad of James Davis, Richard Kruse, Laurence Halstead and Marcus Mepstead had earlier reached the semi-finals in Montreux, but lost to Russia.
That meant a straight fight for the bronze medal against Germany, who were too strong.
Russia lost to France in the final while Romania won the women's epee.
GB defeated Hungary then claimed the scalp of highly fancied Italy en route to the semi-finals, beating a squad featuring individual champion Andrea Cassara and finalist Daniele Garozzo.
