Hartlepool Council agrees to A179 crossing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool Council has approved a new pedestrian crossing on one of the town's busiest roads.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Residents have long called for a new crossing on the A179 Easington Road dual carriageway amid safety concerns for pedestrians trying to reach a hospital, supermarket and bus stops.
The Â£90,000 crossing will be close to the Throston Grange Lane Holdforth Road roundabout.
Councillor Marjorie James said the concerns were being addressed.
