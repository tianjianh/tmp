[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australian tennis player Calum Puttergill has been banned for six months - three of which are suspended - after placing 291 bets on matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Puttergill, 1,207th in the rankings, has also been fined $5,000 (Â£4,115) and will pay a similar fine if he commits another offence before 11 July.
The matches took place between May 2012 and November 2014, but the 23-year-old was not playing in any of them.
An investigation found Puttergill used two online accounts to place the bets.
