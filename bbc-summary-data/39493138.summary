Swansea City's American owners insist chairman Huw Jenkins has a long-term future at the Premier League club despite criticism from fans.

Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien answered questions at a passionate forum hosted by Swansea City Supporters' Trust.
They admitted making mistakes during last summer's takeover and in the transfer market, but defended Jenkins.
"I expect him to be here a long time," said Kaplan. "He cares about the club deeply."
Kaplan added: "Not all his decisions are right, not all my decisions are right decisions, not all Jason's are either.
"But he cares deeply about the club. He was instrumental in getting the club to where it is.
"We have all made mistakes along the way, but Huw is our long-term partner. He's been very open to new ideas and he has been great to work with."
Kaplan and Levien bought a controlling stake of 68% in the club in July, a transaction which saw selling shareholders such as Jenkins make millions in profit.
The Americans and the existing directors faced stinging criticism from supporters, who called on Jenkins and other selling shareholders to leave during Swansea's poor start to the season.
Fans were also unhappy that the Supporters' Trust, which owns a stake of over 21% in the club, was not fully consulted during last summer's takeover.

With the benefit of hindsight, Levien admitted he and Kaplan would have done things differently - but stood by Jenkins and his fellow directors.
"I think mistakes were made in the acquisition process. Looking back now, I would have liked to engage earlier with the Trust," said Levien.
"I cannot speak for the shareholders, but I know for more than a decade they led the club to great success. I think the board who were here during that period deserve respect."
Swansea have endured a torrid season, plunging to the bottom of the Premier League table earlier in the campaign before finding themselves in their current difficult position of 17th spot, one place and one point above the relegation zone.
Mixed dealings in the transfer window have contributed to that decline, with club-record signing Borja Baston arguably the most disappointing signing with just one goal from 17 appearances in attack since joining from Atletico Madrid for Â£15m.
"Do I think mistakes were made in recent transfer windows? Sure," said Levien.
"I think there were big successes too. I think Alfie Mawson was quite a find.
"Do we think we can improve on the process [of signing players]? Yes."
