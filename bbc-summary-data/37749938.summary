The 37-year-old, ranked as the world's number one Twenty20 international bowler, will join the Division Two side following the ICC Champions Trophy.
Tahir has played 111 times for South Africa in all formats since his 2011 debut, and for five other counties, most recently Nottinghamshire.
He has taken 766 first-class wickets at an average of 26.48.
And in 311 limited-overs matches, he has 427 wickets at an average of 22.25.
Director of cricket Kim Barnett told the club website: "He is one of the best leg spinners in the world and we're very excited to have him on board.
"Not only will Imran bring an added dimension to our bowling line up, his influence on the team and players, such as Matt Critchley, will be immense."
Derbyshire will be Tahir's sixth first-class county following spells with Middlesex (2003), Yorkshire (2007), Hampshire (2008-09, 2011 and 2014), Warwickshire (2010) and Notts (2015-16).
