Accrington boosted their play-off hopes with a bad-tempered win over Crawley.

Gwion Edwards' shot put the visitors ahead but Billy Kee levelled with a tap-in soon after the break.
Stanley's Shay McCartan and Crawley's Simon Walton were then sent off following a melee, while Accrington's unused substitute keeper Jason Mooney saw red for racing onto the pitch.
The home side took control and goals from Matty Pearson, Seamus Conneely and Piero Mingoia sealed the points.
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"The sending off affected us massively and it was a disgraceful tackle.
"I've just seen the incident 20 times and how he [the referee] can pick Simon Walton out and send him off is beyond me.
"But why the heck are we getting involved? Their lad is getting sent off straight away for a disgraceful tackle and we decided to even it up.
"The referee lost the plot for two or three minutes, I don't think he knew what he was doing. I am fuming at my players for getting involved and I am even more fuming with that last half hour display."
