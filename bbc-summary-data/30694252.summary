Why are thousands of Germans protesting and who are Pegida?

Supporters and opponents of a group campaigning against what it describes as the "Islamisation" of Europe have held rival rallies across Germany.

There have been regular protests by the Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) since October.
A record 18,000 people turned out to support a rally on Monday in Dresden.
But where did Pegida come from and why is the group growing so fast?
Pegida is a German political movement based in Dresden in the west of the country.
It claims to be anti-Islamist and against what it sees as the growing influence of Islam in Europe.
The group also says it is not a racist organisation but that it is concerned by levels of immigration in Germany, which are at a 20-year high.
Pegida's online proposal claims it is "against radicalism" and "preachers of hate" and calls for stricter enforcement of Germany's current laws on asylum and deportation.
Pegida has been holding regular marches in Dresden for nearly three months.
Demonstrators at the largest pro-Pegida rally to-date on 5 January were heard chanting "we are the people" with one man telling the BBC "we don't want Mosques in Dresden."
Counter demonstrations have sprung up and the group has been condemned by senior German politicians.
German chancellor Angela Merkel has criticised the protests, calling them xenophobic and racist.
In her New Year address on German television she told the public: "Don't follow these people."
She said the people behind Pegida have "coldness, prejudice and hatred in their hearts".
In Cologne, the authorities switched the lights out at the city's cathedral as a way of warning Pegida supporters that they were supporting "extremists".
"We don't think of it as a protest, but we would like to make the many conservative Christians [who support Pegida] think about what they are doing," Dean Norbert Feldhoff, told the BBC.
Only about 250 Pegida supporters showed up in Cologne, compared to thousands of counter-demonstrators.
In Berlin, police said 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked hundreds of Pegida supporters from marching along their planned route.
At the Dresden march the counter-demonstration attracted 3,000 people.
