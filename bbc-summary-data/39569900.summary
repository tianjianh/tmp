[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super League: Leigh Centurions 10-24 Hull FC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC ended their losing run in the Super League as they beat Leigh Centurions at Leigh Sport Village.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam Watts put Hull ahead early on, Carlos Tuimavave scoring their second try midway through the first half.
Albert Kelly ran in just before the end of the first half while Tuimavave crossed for his second after the break.
Leigh scored twice late on, with Liam Hood and Ryan Hampshire both crossing but they could not chase down the visitors' four-try advantage.
While Hull ended a two-game losing run, during which they conceded over 50 points in home defeats by Salford and Leeds, Leigh's winless run continues, having not won in five games since beating Warrington 22-8 on 16 March.
Hull remain fifth in Super League as fourth-placed Wigan beat sixth-place Wakefield, while Leigh slip a place to 10th thanks to Warrington's third straight win, a tight 26-24 victory against Huddersfield.
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford:
"I thought we did a really good job today. We defended well when Leigh had sustained spells of pressure and the win gives us something to build on.
"Our away support was phenomenal throughout the game and gave us lifts when we needed it. That has a huge knock-on effect on the performance. The tempo and decision making was better than it has been over the last three or four weeks.
"I was really pleased with how we performed. My confidence as a coach has not been dented one bit in the last few weeks but as a team we looked like we were enjoying defending again."
Leigh Centurions coach Neil Jukes:
"We had a 12 or 13 minute blip in that first half but I though we were always in the game. I thought we created enough chances but couldn't get the ball down.
"We need to get a little bit better across the board. It has been a tough few games and we lost Micky Higham with a hamstring injury, which didn't help.
"We are probably at our peak in terms of being busted but I still fancied us with the side we got out there. We are not a million miles away but we lacked quality as and when we needed it."
