Heather Watson: British number two splits with coach Veronelli

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number two Heather Watson has parted company with her Argentine coach Diego Veronelli.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old from Guernsey appointed Veronelli in December 2013, but he is no longer able to commit to spending up to 40 weeks a year on the road.
Veronelli, 36, moved from Florida back to Buenos Aires earlier this year to be with his young family.
Watson, the world number 55, won her second WTA tour title at the Hobart International in January.
Veronelli, a former world number 150, had notable success in guiding Watson back inside the world's top 50 for a time, after she had slipped down the rankings following a bout of glandular fever in 2013.
