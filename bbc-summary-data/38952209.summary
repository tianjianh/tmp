Police hold grave fears for the woman after weekend temperatures in the Northern Territory soared above 40C.
The couple, in their 70s, arrived in Australia earlier this month before renting a car in Alice Springs on Thursday.
A search was launched on Sunday after the vehicle was found empty 70km (43 miles) away at Trephina Gorge.
Police confirmed the 76-year-old man's body was found on Monday.
Duty superintendent Brendan Muldoon said the search would involve helicopters, trail bikes, horses and people on foot.
"It's very harsh conditions out there, we hold grave fears for their safety," he told the NT News before the man's body was found.
"We'll definitely be pulling out all stops."
Australian authorities have contacted the German consulate.
