Football bosses are looking to recruit a brave fan to take on the role of "scary" yellow mascot Kingsley.

The spiky sunburst character, who cheers on Scottish Premiership club Partick Thistle, caused a global stir when he was unveiled last year.
He was likened to "a demented sun god" and described as "terrifying".
Club officials said the successful candidate should be able to whip crowds into a frenzy, pose for selfies and not mind being dragged in all directions.
A willingness to work at weekends is also listed as a requirement.
Jay McGhee, who wore the costume previously, has retired as he is about to become a father.
Mr McGhee told BBC Radio Scotland that any candidates to replace him would need to excel at conveying messages with just their hands and be "good with duct tape", to help keep the costume maintained.
But he said the character was really not as frightening as many people assume when they see pictures of Kingsley.
"I think it does look angry in photographs but when you see it in person it's completely different - it's seems like a happy face," he said.
"I knew it would be big when I first saw the costume, but nowhere near as big as it has been."
The club said it was now looking for someone else to step into the suit of the "mono-browed, dentist-deprived ray of sunshine that is Kingsley", who was designed by 2013 Turner Prize nominee David Shrigley.
Duties for the successful candidate - who must be between 5ft 8in and 6ft 2in tall - would include being the main focus at games, rubbing shoulders with celebrities and heading up an army of Jags fans.
Ian Maxwell, Partick Thistle managing director, said: "We've decided to turn to our fans to find our next Kingsley.
"We want to see passion, creative thinking and ideas that are a bit out there, just like the mascot should be.
"We have exciting plans for Kingsley next season that we hope will help keep the momentum around the club moving in the right direction.
"Kingsley is the face of the club and we can't wait to find the right person to make sure he remains the centre of attention, not only at Partick Thistle but also within Scottish football as a whole."
Those interested in the role can apply by submitting a short video, no more than two minutes long, along with a CV and covering letter.
The winner will be unveiled in the run-up to the club's opening home fixture in the Betfred Cup against Queen of the South on July 23.
