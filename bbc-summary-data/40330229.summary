It was found in Market Street in St Andrews on Wednesday. Police Scotland are now warning people to check machines before they insert a card.
Sgt Neil Johnston, of Police Scotland, said: "If you suspect an ATM has been interfered with, do not use it.
"If the cash machine is attached to a bank and the bank is open, then alert the staff who will check the machine." If not, police should be called.
Sgt Johnston added: "If you believe you may have used this ATM prior to Wednesday then check your bank account immediately and report any suspicious transactions you notice to police immediately."
