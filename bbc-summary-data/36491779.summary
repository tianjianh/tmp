Muller Aberdeen plant closes down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dairy giant Muller is closing down its Aberdeen operation on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company confirmed last month it was to close its Aberdeen and East Kilbride plants with the loss of up to 225 jobs.
The Aberdeen operation has now wound down, while the East Kilbride dairy will continue for up to two years.
Muller is transferring production lines to its Bellshill plant. Dairy farms in the north east which want to continue supplying milk to Muller will have to pay extra transport costs.
The move to close down the two plants followed a consultation period which was launched in April.
Muller is investing Â£15m over three years at Bellshill in North Lanarkshire as part of a drive to expand its range of products.
The plans include a new cream filling hall, high-speed production lines and investment in site infrastructure.
