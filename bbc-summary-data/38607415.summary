[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 65 jobs are under threat at the Hall Construction Group, which built the Centre for Digital Innovation (C4DI) building next to the River Hull.
Staff and self-employed sub-contractors have been informed of the move at the company's head office in Clay Street.
Administrators said it was "considering all options" for the firm to continue trading after it fell into difficulties following a Â£3m loss.
George Booth, a sub-contractor, said he felt "very sorry" at the company's demise.
"I've worked for Hall's on and off for 20 years," he said. "It has kept me in work."
The firm was working on a number of other buildings in the region, including projects for local councils.
Joint administrator Julian Pitts said it was "extremely sad".
"The company recently suffered from undertaking two significant fixed price design-and-build contracts, one of which subsequently resulted in a Â£2.9m loss.
"However, with its strong reputation in commercial construction, together with a number of blue chip and public sector clients within Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, we are hopeful that Hall Construction represents an attractive proposition for the right buyer.
"We are currently marketing the business and our aim is to find a buyer for the business as a whole, or for parts of the business, in order to achieve the best return possible for creditors."
East Riding of Yorkshire Council said it was "currently drawing up contingency plans to mitigate the impact on council projects in the event of the company ceasing to trade".
The authority added that it expected the company's administration to have minimal impact on unfinished buildings "as most ongoing projects are nearing completion".
The company is yet to comment.
