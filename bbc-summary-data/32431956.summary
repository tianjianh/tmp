James May 'will not return to Top Gear' without Clarkson

Top Gear presenter James May has said he will not return to the BBC show without co-host Jeremy Clarkson, who was dropped from the show last month.

"Me and Hammond with a surrogate Jeremy is a non-starter. It has to be the three of us," he told the Guardian.
He added that Top Gear without Clarkson would be a "tough call" and "a bit of a daft idea".
Clarkson was removed from presenting duties on the motoring show after assaulting producer Oisin Tymon.
"I don't think you could carry on with two people and put someone in as the new Jeremy because they are not going to be the new Jeremy," May said.
"That would be short-sighted and I don't think it would work. Virtually impossible."
May changed his Twitter account to say "former Top Gear presenter" on 25 March, the day it was announced Clarkson's contract would not be renewed.
May's own contract, and that of his co-presenter Richard Hammond, expired last month.
It raises the possibility of an entirely new presenting line-up for the hit BBC Two show.
Channel controller Kim Shillinglaw has been given the job of finding a replacement for Clarkson, with former X Factor host and Jodie Kidd rumoured to be in the running.
But May has said there "might be an opportunity for three of us to get back together on the BBC to do Top Gear or a car show of some sort".
"The BBC haven't completely closed the door on Jeremy's return," he told the Guardian.
"They've not banned him or fired him, only just not renewed his contract for the moment. It's a subtle difference, but an important one."
Earlier this week, Shillinglaw stressed there was no ban on Clarkson returning to the BBC, despite director general Tony Hall's decision to fire him last month, saying "a line has been crossed".
"It's serious and unfortunate what happened but there is no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC," said Shillinglaw.
"It's a big deal what happened and Jeremy, as any human being would, needs some time."
