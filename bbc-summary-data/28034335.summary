Matej Vydra returns to Watford from Udinese on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watford have re-signed Udinese striker Matej Vydra on a season-long loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old Czech international scored 24 goals in 51 games for the Hornets during a previous loan spell in the 2012-13 Championship campaign.
He spent last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion, making seven Premier League starts and netting three times.
Udinese and Watford are both owned by the Italian Pozzo family and the deal to bring him back to Vicarage Road has been described as an "initial" loan.
Vydra was a key figure in Watford's progress to the 2013 Championship play-off final, which they lost to Crystal Palace.
He will now rekindle his prolific strike partnership with Troy Deeney, who contributed 20 goals himself during that season and was on target 25 times last term.
