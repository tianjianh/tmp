[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Australian rugby league player has failed to sell himself on auction site eBay as it infringed website rules.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Castleford player Ryan McGoldrick is currently a free agent after a side he signed for in New South Wales folded.
However, eBay removed his listing because it "goes against their terms of selling body parts and remains".
The post appeared on Tuesday and described a "1981 antique rugby league player" who is "well maintained" and comes "with a full service history".
On Wednesday morning, the advert had attracted nine bids and stood at £11.50, with the winning bidder due to pay McGoldrick on a per game basis.
However, the auction had gained 22 bids at a price of £215 when the post was taken down later on Wednesday.
Utility player McGoldrick, who also played for Hull FC and Salford, made over 150 appearances in a seven-year spell in England from 2006-13.
Speaking before his listing was removed, the 35-year-old told BBC Sport: "If a really feasible option did come up and it worked out, then I will go do it.
"I was at home speaking to my father-in-law and he came up with the idea to put myself on eBay and let them decide where I play.
"We were talking about different options and I had just found out the club I was at wasn't going ahead. This gives me a little bit of time to think and assess the options I have in front of me.
"I am really open to seeing where it goes, if there is something serious then I am happy to sign a contract.
"There have been a couple of enquiries from England too but I have told them that postage comes at the buyer's expense. They'll have to make sure they can afford to get me over there.
"I hope I am not going anywhere too cold. If one of those sides come in for me, it will have to be in the summer months. Don't expect me to train over winter!"
