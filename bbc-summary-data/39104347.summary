After a goalless first half, American teenager Christian Pulisic slotted in Ousmane Dembele's pass.
Andre Schurrle converted from close range before captain Marcel Schmelzer added a third with a late free-kick.
Dortmund, who have not won the competition since 2012, will play holders Bayern on 25 or 26 April.
"We took a bit of time to get into the game, but we didn't make any major mistakes before half-time," Dortmund left-back Schmelzer said. "Then we put in a very good performance in the second half."
The tie against third-division side Lotte was originally scheduled to be played on 3 March but was called off after snow made the pitch unplayable.
