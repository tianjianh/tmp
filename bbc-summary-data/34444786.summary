Sajid Javid defends strike law reforms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Business Secretary Sajid Javid says the government's trade union reforms will prevent people from being "bullied" by striking workers.

Mr Javid hit back at unions, who protested about the Trade Union Bill outside the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.
He also said he would not "turn a blind eye to bad practice" in business.
And he repeated the Tories' claim to be the "only party for working people".
Labour had "better get used to it", he added.
The "bad practice" Mr Javid highlighted included companies not paying their fair share of tax, banks rigging interest rates or a car company "cheating" on emissions.
"Free enterprise is not a free-for-all," he said.
Defending the union reforms, he added: "For too long, trade unions have been able to bully working people by striking, even though only a small number of their members have voted for strike action.
"So we are introducing new laws to ensure working people's lives aren't unfairly disrupted."
