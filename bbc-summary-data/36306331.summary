Actor Brian Cox appears in two of the films, a comedy, The Carer, and a western, Forsaken, which also stars Donald and Kiefer Sutherland.
Braveheart actor Angus Macfadyean will bring his first film as a director, Macbeth Unhinged, to the festival.
The film is a modern, black and white retelling of the Shakespearean tragedy.
Scot Dougray Scott will be starring in the apocalyptic thriller The Rezort.
The 70th edition of the film festival runs from 15-26 June. It will include feature films, shorts, documentaries and animations.
The opening night gala will feature the world premiere of Jason Connery's drama Tommy's Honour, about Scottish golfing pioneer Old Tom Morris and starring Peter Mullan and Jack Lowden.
It is based on a true story and focuses on Morris's turbulent relationship with his son, Tommy.
The festival will close with the world premiere of Gillies Mackinnon's Whisky Galore, featuring Gregor Fisher, James Cosmo, Kevin Guthrie, Sean Biggerstaff and Eddie Izzard.
Mark Adams, artistic director said: "We are delighted to once again cast the spotlight on great Scottish talent at this year's festival. It speaks so much about the breadth and variety of filmmakers, craftspeople and performers that our selection of projects featuring local talent shines so brightly."
Natalie Usher, director of screen at Creative Scotland, said: "EIFF is a key event in Scotland's cultural calendar, offering audiences inspirational, world-class cinema.
"EIFF is recognising and celebrating the wealth and depth of home-grown filmmaking talent supported by Creative Scotland."
The festival will also have a special screening to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Danny Boyle's Trainspotting and a world premiere screening of the newly 4K restored Highlander, attended by the film's star Clancy Brown.
