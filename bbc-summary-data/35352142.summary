The bookmaker firm said the winning ticket for Saturday night's draw had been placed at a branch in Westmuir Street, in the city's Parkhead area.
The winning numbers - 14,18,25,27,33,44 - were put on with a £12 stake. The prize totalled £1,018,020.
Ladbrokes said the customer may be unaware they had won and their cheque was waiting to be picked up.
The betting firm said the lucky punter was "Scotland's third betting millionaire inside a week" following the £33m Lotto win in Hawick and a £2.2m jackpot landed by an online casino player in Tayside.
Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said: "Scotland is on a winning streak at the moment but the country's latest millionaire may still be none the wiser.
"It's a life-changing sum of money and we've got a cheque ready to hand over to the lucky recipient, so we'd suggest everyone looks down the back of the sofa for the winning ticket."
