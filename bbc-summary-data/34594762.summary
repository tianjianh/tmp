The Upper Chinese Pagoda is at risk from ground movement and will be placed in storage, Liverpool City Council said.
The pagoda was a defining image of the 1984 festival, which was launched in a bid to boost tourism in the city.
The council wants to regenerate the festival site with housing and space for public events.
The pagoda, which was initially developed as a temporary structure for the Chinese Garden at the site, will be stored "with a view to possible future re-use", the council said.
It became neglected, but was later refurbished.
