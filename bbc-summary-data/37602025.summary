Wales wind-up? There's something strange about their recent team photos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There appears to be something strange going on with Wales' team photos.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As their players prepared to face the photographers prior to kick-off in Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Georgia, the way they lined up was, shall we say, a little unusual.
Three at the back and eight across the front is not the usual formation for a team photo. A Wales wind-up?
Gareth Bale feigned ignorance when pressed about recent lopsided line-ups. Asked if the players were just really bad at it, he said: "Yes, I think it must just be that."
Do you believe him? Or is it more likely to be a team in-joke from down the years? Check out some previous efforts and judge for yourself...
