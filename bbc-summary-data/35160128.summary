Dan Redfern: Ex-Derbyshire batsman joins Shropshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Minor counties side Shropshire have signed the former Derbyshire and Leicestershire batsman Dan Redfern.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrewsbury-born 25-year-old will return to his home county next summer after seven seasons with Derbyshire and the last two years at Grace Road.
"I think we've got a good side," Redfern said.
"I know Shropshire finished third in the Championship last season, so hopefully we can go a couple of steps further and see if we can challenge."
Redfern, played some of his early youth cricket at Shropshire and made his first-class debut for Derbyshire as a 16-year-old in 2007 against Cambridge UCCE.
The left-hander, who can also bowl spin, is looking forward to linking up again with Shropshire director or cricket Karl Krikken, his former coach at Derbyshire.
"Krikk's been a massive influence on me since I first met him when I was a 13-year-old in the Derbyshire Academy," he said. "I've got a lot of time for him and I respect him a great deal.
"He's such a good guy so to have him at Shropshire it felt like a no-brainer for me to sign.
"I'm really looking forward to playing for Shropshire and working with Krikk again as he loves his cricket and loves coaching."
