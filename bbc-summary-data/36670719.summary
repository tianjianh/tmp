The 29-year-old has signed a four-year contract to become City's third summer signing.
New manager Pep Guardiola has already brought in Ilkay Gundogan from Borussia Dortmund for £20m, as well as Australian midfielder Aaron Mooy.
Nolito started all four of Spain's matches at Euro 2016 before they were knocked out in the last 16 by Italy.
"I think that Pep Guardiola is one of the best managers in the world," said Nolito, whose real name is Manuel Agudo Duran.
"He knows a lot about the game and he's going to help me progress as a player. I'm sure he'll get the best out of me."
