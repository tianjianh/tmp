Dr Who star David Tennant has travelled back in time to his old acting school to pick up an honorary degree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Broadchurch actor has been awarded an honorary drama doctorate from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
The 46-year-old was recognised during a ceremony in Glasgow.
Tennant studied drama at the Royal Conservatoire between 1988 and 1991, then known as the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, before enjoying success on stage and screen.
He said: "I'm honoured and rather humbled to be here - it's all quite overwhelming but lovely to be back. It evokes some very vivid memories.
"It was a very important time for me. I don't think I would have survived without my time here - for me it was essential. Three years of getting to practice in a safe environment.
"I was quite young, quite green, and I did a lot of growing up here and learned an enormous amount. They were very formative years that I look back on very fondly."
Dr Who writer Steven Moffat also received an honorary degree from the University of the West of Scotland in Paisley.
