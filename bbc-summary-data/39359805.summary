Peter Trego top-scored for Somerset, retiring on 46.
Ex-Glamorgan all-rounder Jim Allenby claimed three for 18.
Glamorgan begin their county championship campaign at Northamptonshire on Friday, 7 April.
Australian fast bowler Michael Hogan and South African batsman Colin Ingram are expected to feature later in the pre-season campaign.
Fast bowler Timm van der Gugten is in line for the season opener next month after suffering a shoulder injury while diving in the field while playing for the Netherlands last month.
