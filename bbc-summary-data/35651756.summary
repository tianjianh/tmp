The S&P 500 climbed 8.53 to 1,921.27, while the Nasdaq composite gained 39.02 points to 4,542.61.
Rumours that China was considering a stimulus package lifted US markets from falls in morning trading.

A rebound in oil prices also boosted late day trading. US crude  rose 1.1% to $32.21 a barrel and Brent crude was up 3.5% to $34.44 a barrel.
Chesapeake Energy rose 22.8% despite reporting an annual loss of $14.9bn. The company said it planned to cut spending by 57%.
Shares in JP Morgan ended the day flat. The bank fell 4% on Tuesday after announcing it would put an addition $500m aside to cover losses in its oil and gas portfolio.
Shares of retail chain, Target climbed 4% following the company's earnings release, which showed efforts to improve store sales were working. Target has been struggling to repair its image after several scandals including a massive breach of customer credit card data.
