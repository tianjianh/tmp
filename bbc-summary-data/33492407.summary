The break-in happened in Pleasance Avenue between Saturday 20 June and Friday 10 July.
Among the items taken were a tanzanite and diamond ring, bracelet and necklace, and an emerald and diamond ring, bracelet and necklace.
An undisclosed sum of cash was also stolen in the raid.
Pearl necklaces and a number of diamond rings and earrings were also taken.
Jewellery owner Carol Anne Williamson said it was her son who discovered that the items were missing.
She told BBC Scotland: "I went to look for the main jewellery in the bedroom and it was all gone - the whole box. One was emptied and the contents taken away, the other one was all gone."
While she does not expect the thief to return the items, Ms Williamson said she hoped that someone close to them might "have the integrity to help return some of the items that are more important to my family".
Det Con Lorna Douglas of Police Scotland, said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in Pleasance Avenue, in the area around Troqueer Primary School over this period."
