Work has begun on the £250,000 restoration of a 90-year-old park pavilion in Northamptonshire.

The building in Wicksteed Park, Kettering, opened in 1923 and hosted conferences and parties and served as a military base during World War II.
Edwardian features, including its clock tower, are to be restored and new lighting will be installed.
The refurbishment is expected to be finished by the middle of March.
The work is part of a £1m restoration project at Wicksteed Park, which was developed by Charles Wicksteed and claimed to be the UK's first leisure park with children's play equipment.
Mr Wicksteed died from pneumonia in 1931.
His grandson, Oliver Wicksteed, is chairman of the Wicksteed Charitable Trust and said the pavilion had provided "90 years of wonderful memories for the people of Kettering".
He said: "As with all buildings which serve a multitude of purposes, some adaptations have been made over the years which have meant guests and visitors haven't been able to fully appreciate what a unique, treasured and elegant old building we have.
"The 90th anniversary is an ideal opportunity to do this and show off the many unique features which the building has."
