Hugh Jackman's advice to Wolverine successor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After 17 years playing Wolverine in the X-Men movies, Hugh Jackman is hanging up his claws.

His latest film, Logan, sees the mutant superhero in a way we've never seen him before - older, more grizzled and working as a limo driver to support a frail Professor Charles Xavier.
It's a very different take on the comic book character we've been used to seeing the actor play across eight films, but the star says he's more than happy to bow out with this movie.
"I was very clear this was the last one when we were making it," he says. "I don't think I could've made this movie unless I knew that.
"This was the version of the movie I wanted to make - and I was surprised the studio said yes - because I felt deep down we hadn't fully cracked it.
"And I don't think I was fully OK with it until I saw it, because even though I had a good feeling, you never know until you see the final product if it's something you know you can sleep with for the rest of your life."
The Oscar-nominated actor also insists he will never return to the role, even for cameos or spin-off films.
"I'm going home - it's been a great party, thank you," he says. "I'm putting my pyjamas on and going to bed."
But he does have some words of advice for whoever takes on the Wolverine next.
"I remember running into Dougray Scott who originally had this role, but couldn't do it because he was on another film that ran over, so I got the role.
"I met him and thought this is going to be awkward, but he said: 'Logan is going to be one of the best roles you'll ever have, so go crush it'.
"I thought it was so simple and classy, so I'll say the same thing - but don't crush it too much."
Jackman's next film project, The Greatest Showman, tells the story of PT Barnum - the founder of the famous Ringling Bros and Barnum and Bailey Circus.
After that, the star says he hopes to return to the London stage, almost 20 years since he last appeared.
He was nominated for an Olivier theatre award in 1998 for his UK stage debut in Trevor Nunn's revival of Oklahoma! before his film career took off.
But he told the BBC there was another reason why he had not returned sooner.
"It's an issue of children - I love being here but I have kids at school. At some point in the future I'd love to come to the West End," he said.
"Coming here working for Trevor Nunn at the National Theatre, that was a real turning point for me.
"[My children] are 16 and 11 and they're at the age where they'd love me to go away because I'm kind of a strict guy at home, but I'd love to do that again some time."
Logan is on general release in cinemas now.
