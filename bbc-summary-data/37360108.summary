Guernsey squash player Chris Simpson has set his sights on a place in the world's top 16 this season.

The 29-year-old is currently ranked 23 in the world and reached the final of the Nantes Open in France last weekend.
"I think the last few seasons I've progressed with my squash and I've very much based it on performances rather than outcome," Simpson said.
"This season it's going to be a lot more outcome driven and trying to push up the rankings to the top 16."
Simpson has still to make a quarter-final of a World Series event, but is hopeful that will change this season.
"My draws have been quite unlucky in the last 18 months," he told BBC Radio Guernsey.
"We have two or three players who have created a bit of a gap in standard to the rest of the players, so ideally you want to try and stay away from those guys before a possible semi-final berth.
"I've managed to meet them in the first or second round in most of the events so far, so that definitely plays it's part.
"But these things are done randomly and that can't continue forever, so it's just about playing well enough that I take the opportunities that I do get."
