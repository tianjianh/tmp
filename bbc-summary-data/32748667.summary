The club reported the death threat against manager Darren Kelly, 35, to police after receiving a letter on Monday.
Police said a 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill.
Two men, aged 27 and 42, arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill on Tuesday have been bailed until 15 June.
Kelly, who was appointed as Oldham manager on 5 May, has had to deny claims he supported the IRA after he reportedly called Sinn Fein politician and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness a "legend" on Twitter.
He made the comments after Mr McGuinness retweeted a photo of him meeting the Oldham boss's mother at an event marking the 43rd anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
Det Insp Jason Byrne said: "The letter sent to the club made some extremely serious threats to a number of individuals and we are treating this matter with the utmost seriousness.
"We are also aware of equally vitriolic comments that have been made on social media and this too forms part of our investigation."
Kelly, who is from Northern Ireland, was a defender at Derry City, Carlisle, Portadown and York then coach at Sunderland.
Managing Oldham is his first managerial role after gaining his Uefa Pro Licence.
