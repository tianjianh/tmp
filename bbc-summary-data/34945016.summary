Adebayo Akinfenwa scored a hat-trick in the kit for Northampton Town and decided to donate it to a supporters' trust to raise money for the club.
The shirt had to be auctioned online for a second time after the first bidder failed to pay.
Akinfenwa, who now plays for AFC Wimbledon, described himself as a "fan from afar" and said he wanted to help.
Speaking before the sale on online auction site eBay, he said: "I was cleaning up my little girl's room and found this shirt.
"I thought I could auction it off. I thought 'every little helps'.
"Let's just say that I'm a fan from afar."
Northampton Town Supporters' Trust auctioned the shirt to raise money for the club, which is facing insolvency proceedings over a £10.25m council loan.
The trust raised more than £40,000 for the club, but has not yet decided where that money will be spent.
The auction was started in November to save the club from a winding-up petition over unpaid tax, which has since been paid.

Ben Trasler, a volunteer from the trust, said it had expected the shirt would sell for around £500.
He said: "I think the person who bought it for £7,500 was messing around - I don't think it was a real bid.  About £500 is much closer to what we thought it would sell for.
"Now the club is out of financial difficulties there will have to be a conversation on a senior level as to where the fundraised money will go."
He said the club has a partnership with breast cancer charity Coppafeel and funds from the shirt may go there.
