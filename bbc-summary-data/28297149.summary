St Mirren have signed former Hibernian striker Ross Caldwell on a one-year contract, with the option of a further year.

The 20-year-old has impressed Buddies manager Tommy Craig during a trial in pre-season.
Caldwell made his debut for Hibs in 2011 and made 19 appearances in 2012/13, scoring two goals.
"We hope that we develop him into the player that we believe he can be," said manager Craig.
Caldwell fell out of favour under boss Terry Butcher last term and was loaned to Scottish Championship side Alloa, for whom he scored twice.
"I am delighted to have joined St Mirren," the front-man said.
"Having been at the club now for a couple of weeks I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute and already feel part of the set up.
"I now want to repay the faith shown in me by Tommy, Gary [Teale] and Jim [Goodwin] in the season ahead."
