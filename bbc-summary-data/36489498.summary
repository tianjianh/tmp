[SN]TITLE[SN]
One-Day Cup: Northamptonshire and Leicestershire frustrated by rain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Only two overs were possible at the County Ground as Northamptonshire's One-Day Cup with Leicestershire was abandoned as a no-result.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rain originally reduced the game to 19 overs per side with a 16:00 BST start.
But only 12 balls were bowled as the hosts reached 12 without loss, with Josh Cobb unbeaten on three and Adam Rossington on five not out.
Both sides took a point from the game, with Northants next travelling to Yorkshire on Tuesday.
Leicestershire are in action again at Worcestershire on Wednesday.
