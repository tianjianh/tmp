The county confirmed Adelaide Strikers are looking for a second overseas player after a knee injury ruled out West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard.
Vince, 24, is one of a number of English players "under consideration".
"A tournament like that would be great exposure for him ahead of the T20 World Cup," Hampshire's director of cricket Giles White told BBC Radio Solent.
Vince, who was the leading run-scorer in the T20 Blast domestic competition last season, scored 41 off 36 balls on his England T20 debut against Pakistan in Dubai on Thursday.
India is set to host the World Twenty20 in March.
"The Big Bash would be a wonderful opportunity if that were to come through for him," White added. "Adelaide Strikers have shown an initial interest in James.
"Others have also been touted, but James is certainly on their list of people they're looking at.
"If they're looking for a top-order player who's a very good fielder and also a leader, with a good cricketing brain, then he fits the bill."
Hampshire's links with the South Australia franchise have been forged through their former Australia coach Tim Nielsen.
A number of players have been attached to the Elite International Cricket Academy at Hampshire's Ageas Bowl, playing club cricket around England.
