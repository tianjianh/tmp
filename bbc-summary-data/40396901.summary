Chat: How will you be celebrating Eid al-Fitr?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millions of Muslims all around the world will be celebrating Eid al-Fitr this week to mark the end of Ramadan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eid al-Fitr means: 'festival of the breaking of the fast' and it is one of the biggest celebrations in the Islamic year.
The date Eid falls on is decided by the cycle of the moon, and this year it's on Sunday evening.
On the day of Eid al-Fitr, Ramadan ends and Muslims often celebrate by praying, giving gifts and having a big feast with family and friends.
