[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The HGV went down the embankment on the A82 at Stuckgowan in the early hours of Friday morning.
Police Scotland said the driver was uninjured in the incident.
Traffic was queued between Tarbet and Stuckgowan throughout Friday while the rear of the lorry continued to block one carriageway.
Witnesses said the cab was stopped from entering the loch by a tree, about 3ft from the water's edge.
Temporary traffic lights have been put in place to manage Easter traffic on the popular bank holiday route.
The HGV is due to be removed early on Saturday morning when both carriageways will need to be closed.
Eddie Ross of BEAR Scotland said: "Roads are busier due to the Bank Holiday weekend. Rather than close the road to recover the vehicle, Police Scotland have arranged for temporary traffic lights to remain in place.
"We've made the area around the HGV safe for road users to get past until full recovery can be arranged."
