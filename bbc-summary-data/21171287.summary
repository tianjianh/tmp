Secondary league tables 2012: AAB scores in key subjects

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This table lists the 227 schools in England where 25% or more of pupils doing A-levels got at least grades AAB in subjects leading universities say they want.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
These "facilitating" subjects are: mathematics and further mathematics, English (literature), physics, biology, chemistry, geography, history and languages (classical and modern).
Schools are ranked on the percentage of A-level pupils achieving this and then on the percentage of students completing sixth form studies.
Schools marked IND are independent, those marked SEL select their pupils on the basis of academic activity. Schools marked AC are academies. Schools with fewer than 10 pupils are not included.
