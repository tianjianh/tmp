The body has not been formally identified but it is believed to be the 84-year-old farmer driving a ute swept away by floodwaters on Wednesday.
Heavy rains have closed roads, damaged properties, and flooded creeks and rivers across the country's southeast.
Multimillion-dollar repairs have begun as Australians brace for more wild weather conditions next week.
Residents at Charlton, a central Victorian town on the Avoca River, were told the floodwaters were due to peak overnight on Friday.
"It's anticipated there will be minimal numbers of homes or other properties impacted beyond those that have already been impacted," Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said.
"This is a really tough and proud community."
Meanwhile, the local Australian Rules football team is chasing premiership victory on Saturday after finishing runner-up in the last three grand finals.
The team are confident they will be able to make the 40km trip south to the away game in St Arnaud.
