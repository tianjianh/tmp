[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eastleigh won for a third league game in a row as Sam Matthews netted a brace of eye-catching goals against Torquay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bournemouth loanee midfielder Matthews started and finished the scoring for the visitors in an eventful game.
Ayo Obileye grabbed the Spitfires' other goal shortly after Luke Young had levelled straight from a corner for Torquay early in the second half.
Shaun Harrad's strike at 2-2 looked to have grabbed the Gulls a point before Matthews won in for Eastleigh.
