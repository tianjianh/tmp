The 21-year-old, who has represented Turkey at Under-17 and Under-18 level, has spent time in the youth set-ups of Millwall and Liverpool.
"Yusuf has a tremendous pedigree in youth football," Reds head coach Dermot Drummy told the club website.
"Things didn't work out for him in Turkey as he'd have hoped, but he got some valuable experience."
Mersin is the League Two club's sixth signing of the summer.
