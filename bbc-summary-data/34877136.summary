[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Northern Ireland's top bank officials is moving to a rival bank.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gerry Mallon has departed Danske Bank and will become chief executive of Ulster Bank in the Republic of Ireland.
Mr Mallon has been head of Danske in Belfast since 2008.
Although leaving immediately, he will not start his new job until next June.
Ulster Bank's owners, Royal Bank of Scotland, said Mr Mallon's knowledge of banking in Ireland would be "invaluable" going forward.

Until recently, Mr Kingston was president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce.
