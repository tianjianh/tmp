[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Objects that have been hidden away in storage at the Corinium Museum in Cirencester are to be put on display as part of a new project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Items including Stone Age tools and Bronze Age weapons will be put on show for the first time, if a Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) bid is successful.
The scheme will redesign the museum's prehistory and early Roman galleries.
Development funding of Â£96,300 has been awarded to allow staff to apply for further HLF money.
Museum director Amanda Hart said: "This project will transform the opening galleries, bringing the now dated displays in line with the rest of the museum.
"We're talking about our prehistoric collections - things like rock art, hand axes, beakers from beaker burials, jewellery and early Bronze Age weapons.
"They are the most amazing objects, and we're going to double the number of objects on display in those early galleries."
Ms Hart said the "really important" objects had been collected over past 20 years from excavations across the Cotswolds.
Work on the project, along with a new discovery centre and garden, is due to begin early next year.
