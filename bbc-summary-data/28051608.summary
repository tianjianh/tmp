Six-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt has been selected in the Jamaica team for this summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Bolt is expected to be named in the 4x100m relay squad when the official announcement is made on Wednesday.
He had previously ruled himself out of the 100m and 200m individual races as he was recovering from a foot injury.
The 27-year-old won gold medals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.
I have received lots of requests, invitations and messages of support from my fans in Scotland who are looking forward to a great event
Bolt announced last week that he intended to make himself available for the Games despite an injury-disrupted season.
"I am available for selection for the Commonwealth Games and have submitted the relevant documentation," he said in a statement on his website.
"I do not wish to take the place of anyone who qualifies in an individual event, but am available for relay duty if the selectors feel I can be an asset to the Jamaican team in Glasgow," Bolt added.
"I have received lots of requests, invitations and messages of support from my fans in Scotland who are looking forward to a great event."
Bolt did not attempt to qualify in the 100m and 200m at the Jamaican Championships, which took place last weekend, as he has not yet returned to full fitness.
He has never raced in the Commonwealth Games, having missed the events in Melbourne in 2006 and Delhi four years ago.
However, speaking at the IAAF Centenary Gala in Barcelona last November, he declared his interest in competing in Glasgow.
"That's the only title I don't have, so I think it's something I'd like to go for, even if I do just one event," Bolt said.
Jamaica took silver behind England in the men's 4x100m relay in 2010 but, led by Bolt, won the World Championships last year.
The heats of the event will be held at Hampden Park on Friday, 1 August, with the final the following evening.
The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has been lobbying for Bolt to compete.
Peter Murphy, a spokesman for the CGF, said in January: "We're in constant touch with his management.
"The case we'll make is that the Games offers an opportunity to break records that have been standing for decades.
"Usain has won medals at every major event, except the Commonwealth Games. He will get an unbelievable welcome. Glasgow will grind to a halt."
Glasgow 2014 ambassador Sir Chris Hoy echoed that view.
The six-time Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist said: "I think it's crucial to the success of the Games when the big names turn up and support them.
"It's still a big deal for them to be Commonwealth champion. I'm sure Usain wants to be here and take the medals back to Jamaica."
