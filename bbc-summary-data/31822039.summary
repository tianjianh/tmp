Ms French, who lives in the county, said she had never been a chancellor before and planned to find out how she could best serve the students.
Students from the university - which was inaugurated in 2013 - designed the robes for her to wear.
To mark the event, a ceremony will also take place at King Charles the Martyr Church in Falmouth.
Talking about her outfit, Ms French said: "Honestly I couldn't be more delighted, it's a very modern shape, very contemporary and I've got a crown.
"It's so beautiful, I couldn't be doing with those Tudor bonnets that people wear.
"Honestly I think they make everyone look a bit like a hobbit."
The TV star played Geraldine Granger in BBC One sitcom The Vicar of Dibley.
She also starred in sketch show French and Saunders - with her comedy partner Jennifer Saunders - and Jam and Jerusalem.
