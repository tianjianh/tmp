Hibernian 1-1 Heart of Midlothian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts rescued their unbeaten league record with a late Alim Ozturk strike that secured a draw against Hibernian.

Hibs had been the more impressive team, and led the game after Dominique Malonga's first-half effort.
Even after Callum Paterson was sent off in the 79th minute, Hearts kept pressing Hibs back.
That resolve paid off when Ozturk, with the game deep into injury time, rifled in a 40-yard shot that hit the underside of the bar on its way in.

Hibs set out to be bold and self-assured against the team that has led the league all season and seemed capable of dominating the Championship.
The Edinburgh derby has tended to rob Hibs of their self-esteem, however, Hearts having been on top for much of the past decade.
Even recent form would have nagged at the Easter Road side, the visitors having won five of the last six encounters.
In blustery conditions, it was the home side who were more sprightly and assertive.
Hearts might have felt that their powerful resilience - a feature of their commanding start to the season - would belittle the best of Hibs, but the visitors also lacked fluency in attack.
Those characteristics allowed Hibs to sketch the most inventive and hopeful patterns into the play, although the game was mostly rugged.

Passages of possession tended to be brief and hurried, but in Scott Allan and Dylan McGeouch they had players who could be artful in midfield, both in the way they moved into space and the way they carried the ball forward.
The state of the game was concerning to Hibs fans as much as it was heartening.
Their team has often impressed during these fixtures, but failed to capitalise and then seen Hearts take advantage.
There was a familiar moment of alarm, then, when Soufian El Hassnaoui found himself through on goal, but his shot was straight at Hibs goalkeeper Mark Oxley.
Hibs were unbowed, though, and when an Allan corner was headed goalward by Liam Fontaine, the ball was parried by keeper Neil Alexander. A scramble ensued, with Jason Cummings having a shot blocked before Malonga lashed the ball high into the net.
Allan remained central in the second half, delivering two crosses that Malonga headed wide.
The midfielder also went on a surging run towards the penalty area that Prince Buaben stopped on the edge of the box with a crude trip.
Hearts were best served by their width, with substitute Jamie Walker sending in one cross that Oxley fumbled, then Paterson's delivery was mis-kicked by Billy King.
Given Hibs' recent history in this fixture, a growing nervousness with the slender lead was inevitable.
They sat ever deeper, but Paterson's rashness as he leapt off the ground to lunge at Malonga was a respite.
With Hearts reduced to 10 men, Hibs ought to have seen the game out, but Ozturk's glorious strike was unstoppable, and a cruel blow to Hibs.
