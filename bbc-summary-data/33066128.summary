There were 27 motorcyclist deaths in Greater London in 2014 compared with 22 in 2013, Transport for London said.
It said the Met Police was responding by cracking down on speeding and stopping motorcyclists for careless riding and ignoring red lights.
In 2014, there were 127 total recorded road deaths in London and 2,040 people were seriously injured.
Transport for London said the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on the roads last year was the lowest since records began in 1980.
Earlier, London Mayor Boris Johnson set a new target of halving the number of KSIs in London by 2020 compared with the 2005-09 average.
He said: "These figures show quite clearly that road safety in the capital continues to head in the right direction.
"However, with a growing population and more people on our roads, we'll have to pull out all the stops to ensure that such positive trends continue."
