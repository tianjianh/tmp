Armistice Day: Isle of Man remembers war dead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A two-minute silence has been observed across the Isle of Man to remember Britain's war dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was held at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month - the time in 1918 when the guns fell silent along the Western Front.
The silence was also used to remember all of those who have died in conflicts ever since.
Veterans joined serving armed forces personnel and dignitaries for a short service at the war memorial in Douglas.
Among those paying their respects were the Mayor of Douglas and the Lieutenant Governor.
The short service was led by the Archdeacon of Sodor and Mann, the Ven Andie Brown, and followed by the laying of wreaths.
Despite heavy rain, large crowds gathered to pay their respects.
Several other gatherings were also held around the island to mark the day.
During the course of World War One, 1,165 Manxmen were killed at a time when the island's population was 50,000.
Official records show that 8,261 men enlisted in the armed forces, which was 82.3% of the Isle of Man's male population of military age.
