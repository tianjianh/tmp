Surrey Police body camera pledge by PCC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Frontline police officers in Surrey should be wearing body cameras, the county's police and crime commissioner has said.

Kevin Hurley said he was committed to providing the devices to officers.
He said the cameras offered "unprecedented advantages" in gathering evidence.
Surrey Police Chief Constable Lynne Owens has launched a public consultation on the issue.
Mr Hurley said: "These cameras will provide unprecedented advantages in gathering evidence, deterring suspects from abusive or violent behaviour, recording all conversation between the officer and the suspect, and protecting the officer from baseless complaints.
"They will mean that officers can stay on the beat instead of wasting time returning to base to write up notes.
"By providing incontrovertible evidence to juries, they will also save time and costs in the courts."
He added the cameras would be purchased as soon as the chief constable has made recommendations on procurement.
