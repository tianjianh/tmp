One of the first and most vivid pieces of footage, posted by Twitter user William Locke, recorded the entire explosion.
The person behind the camera was knocked over by the shockwave but not before they captured the scale of the blast, as the ensuing series of images from his video shows.
Others recorded the blast - a huge fireball rising above the port in Tianjin followed by a huge cloud of dust and ash rising into the sky.
In the aftermath of the explosion, thick smoke and dust could be seen in images taken on people's phones and uploaded to Weibo, the Chinese microblogging platform similar to Twitter.
