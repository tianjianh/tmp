The fire broke out beneath a pavement in Kingsway, Holborn, on Wednesday and was put out on Good Friday morning.
Matthew Gardiner from ticketing specialist Shows in London said eight theatres had to cancel 10 performances over the past two days with a loss of Â£1.2 million.
"Now one of my big concerns would have been how many small businesses are dependant on these performances," he added.
