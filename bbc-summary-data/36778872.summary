Pro12: Fewer Sunday games for Welsh regions in 2016-17

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Only three Pro12 games will be played on Sundays in the first half of the 2016-17 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two Welsh New Year's Day derbies are on Sunday as will Newport Gwent Dragons v Edinburgh on 27 November, the day after Wales' South Africa Test.
The move is because Welsh language channel S4C is moving the majority of its live games to a Saturday night.
Ospreys host Zebre in Scrum V Live's opening game of the season on 2 September while Dragons are at Ulster.
Scarlets host Munster the following day with Cardiff Blues welcoming Edinburgh on Y Clwb Rygbi on S4C.
There will also be one additional Sunday game on 27 November, when the Dragons face Edinburgh live on S4C to avoid a clash with the Wales v South Africa Test, as well clashes on New Years Day.
Welsh regional fans must wait until October to see the first derbies of the campaign.
Ospreys v Blues on 7 October is the first, before Scarlets entertain Dragons the following day.
Dragons visit Cardiff Blues on Boxing Day, while Ospreys welcome Scarlets a day later.
On New Year's Day, Scarlets are at home against Blues with Ospreys heading to Rodney Parade to play the Dragons.
Judgement Day, in which the four Welsh teams play at Principality Stadium in Cardiff is on Saturday, 15 April when Blues meet Ospreys and Dragons face Scarlets.
The regular season will culminate on Saturday, 6 May with all six games kicking off at 17:15 BST.
Play-off semi-finals take place on the weekend of 19-21 May with the final scheduled for the following weekend.
Scarlets finished fifth last season, the highest ranking of Wales' teams, to claim a place in the European Champions Cup.
Blues were seventh, Ospreys eighth and Dragons 10th in 2015-16 and they will all play in the second-tier European Challenge Cup in the coming term.
