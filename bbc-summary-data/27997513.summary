Pembrokeshire 'hobbit home': Councillors to visit site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are to visit a "hobbit-style" eco house before making a decision on whether to grant retrospective planning permission.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Megan Williams and Charlie Hague built the house using local materials in the garden of her parents home in Glandwr near Crymych, Pembrokeshire, in 2012.
They lost an appeal against a demolition order in 2013, but the council said it would consider the planning application first.
The visit will happen in July.
Mr Hague and Ms Williams have argued that the straw-walled roundhouse had low impact on the environment.
But planners have recommended turning down the retrospective planning application, claiming the house is an unjustified residential development and does not constitute an exception under the One Planet Development initiative which deals with low impact homes.
The owners had been living in a caravan for four years, before moving into the new home just before their son Eli was born.
Sculptor Mr Hague spent more than a year creating the single-storey dwelling from local materials.
The couple were helped by friends and relatives at the neighbouring Lammas eco village.
