Hull trawlermen's memorial service held

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people have attended an annual memorial service for more than 6,000 Hull trawlermen lost at sea.

The 27th annual service was held on the Saint Andrews Quay retail park, by the Humber.
The Bishop of Hull, the Right Reverend Alison White, blessed several wreaths in memory of the lost men.
Elaine Harvey, remembering her father Harry Williams and her uncle Terry, who both died at sea 42 years ago, said "It seems like yesterday."
On 30 January 1974 the Hull trawler Boston Lincoln was fishing when a cable caught Terry Williams, who was dragged overboard unconscious.
His younger bother Harry tried to save him but, despite rescue efforts, both men drowned.
Individual flowers were thrown into the Humber by many people at the ceremony.
The event, organised by the STAND fishing heritage charity, aims to maintain Hull's fishing port heritage and remember the men who worked in such a dangerous occupation.
It is always held in January or February, when many trawlers were lost.
The charity's chairman Ron Wilkinson said he hoped a new trawlermen memorial would be erected in time for the service in 2017, when Hull will be celebrating its year as Capital of Culture.
