[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 0-0 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient avoided a fourth straight League Two defeat as they ground out a 0-0 draw against Barnet at The Hive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side were dealt a blow after half an hour when Shaun Batt was forced off with a leg injury.
And Orient carved out the best chance of the first half when Paul McCallum set up Jay Simpson but his tame shot was straight at goalkeeper Josh Vickers.
Barnet did have the ball in the net seven minutes before the break after a well-worked Luke Gambin corner but it was clearly handled by Bira Dembele, who was booked for his effort.
The Bees did not truly test Alex Cisak until the 67th minute but the Orient goalkeeper produced a fine one-handed save from Sam Togwell's low 20-yard shot.
Chances were few and far between but substitute Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro found himself with space on the edge of the box, only to fail to get a shot away despite the time afforded him.
