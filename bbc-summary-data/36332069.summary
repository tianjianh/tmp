Judges have chosen their favourites from 90 entries, with the winners announced at a ceremony in Merthyr Tydfil on 21 July.
Category winners will receive a prize of Â£1,000, and the main award winners in each language an additional Â£3,000.
They will also be presented with a specially commissioned trophy by artist Angharad Pearce Jones.
Lleucu Siencyn, chief executive of Literature Wales, said they are "extremely proud" that the awards promote the richness and diversity of contemporary Welsh literature.
"The 2016 shortlist is proof, if proof was needed, that the writers of Wales continue to make their mark on the world's literary map," she said.
