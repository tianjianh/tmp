Fans travelling to Cardiff for Rugby World Cup quarter final matches have been warned to travel early to avoid disruption.

Arriva Trains Wales said pre-match rail services would be especially busy from stations feeding into the capital.
New Zealand take on France at 20:00 BST at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, while Ireland face Argentina at 13:00 on Sunday.
Cardiff's council leader said hosting the tournament had been a success.
"Hotels have been booked out and pubs, clubs and restaurants will all have enjoyed a financial boost. It is too early to put an actual figure on the economic impact but it's clearly worth millions," Cllr Phil Bale said.
"The Cardiff Fanzone has been the busiest of all the fanzone sites across the UK, surpassing its target for 100,000 visitors, and we expect to see lots more people through the gates over the weekend to see the quarter finals."
He said attractions including Cardiff Castle had seen an increase in visitors, with 10,000 more people visiting since the tournament started, compared with the same period last year.
"Cardiff has once again excelled itself, not only as an outstanding place to watch major sporting events but also a place for culture, shopping, food and drink and so much more," he added.
This weekend's matches are the last of the tournament to be played in Wales.
Arriva Trains Wales, Great Western Railway and Cross Country will be adding extra capacity to services before and after the weekend's matches.
But passengers have been warned there will likely be standing room only on some routes and they could face waits of up to two hours after the game before they can board a train.
The usual post-match queuing system into Cardiff Central Station will operate on both days and a bus shuttle will operate as the priority service for passengers travelling to Bristol Parkway.
