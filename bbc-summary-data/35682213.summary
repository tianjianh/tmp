Appeal after footballer Josh Magennis racially abused

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are appealing for witnesses following a report of racially aggravated abuse against Kilmarnock player Josh Magennis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened during the Hearts vs Kilmarnock match at Tynecastle Stadium at about 16:40 on Saturday.
A man, thought to be sitting in Lower Section E of the Wheatfield Stand, directed racial abuse towards the Northern Ireland striker.
He was white, in his mid-40s, with dark hair receding on top, and wore glasses.
He was also wearing a dark jacket that possibly had red lining and was of stocky build.
PC Gavin Stupart, of Police Scotland, said: "Racial abuse is absolutely unacceptable, in any circumstances.
"The behaviour of the majority of fans at Tynecastle on Saturday was excellent and I want to thank both clubs for their co-operation.
"We're conducting various inquiries in an effort to trace the perpetrator and I'd ask any witnesses to this abuse, or anyone who recognises the description of the suspect, to come forward."
Magennis, 25, is in his second season at Kilmarnock and has scored 10 goals this term.
