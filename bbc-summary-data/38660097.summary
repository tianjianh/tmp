Nick Kyrgios was knocked out of his home Grand Slam as he blew a two-set lead and a match point in losing to Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open.

Italy's Seppi triumphed 1-6 6-7 (1-7) 6-4 6-2 10-8 in round two against the typically unpredictable 14th seed.
Kyrgios was given two warnings, for swearing and racquet abuse, before the 89th-ranked Seppi clinched victory.
Earlier, four-time winner Roger Federer held off the challenge of American prospect Noah Rubin.
The 35-year-old Swiss, who is seeded 17th after missing the second half of the 2016 season with a knee injury, saved two set points in the third to win 7-5 6-3 7-6 (7-3). Federer will play 2010 Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych in the third round.
Kyrgios won a five-set scrap with Seppi on the same Hisense Arena court in 2015 to reach the quarter-finals, but the roles were reversed here.
The 21-year-old Australian was in control before losing his temper as he complained of a knee injury midway through the third set.
Kyrgios, returning to tennis at the Australian Open after a ban for not trying at the Shanghai Masters ended his 2016 season, was given a warning for swearing and later docked a point for his second code violation after launching his racquet into the ground in frustration.
Seppi, 32, took the match into a deciding set and served for victory at 6-5 when Kyrgios played a between-the-legs shot on the first point before winning the game.
The Italian saved a match point at 7-8 and drew level again, broke in the following game when Kyrgios sent down a double fault, and then closed out the victory.
"Maybe it was meant to be," Seppi said of avenging his 2015 loss. "I was concentrating on my game and not worrying about he was doing."
Kyrgios admitted he needed to take his preparation more seriously, having "played too much basketball" in pre-season.
The Australian, who is wiithout a coach and was booed off by some fans, said:  "I did a couple things in the off-season that I'm probably not going to do next time. My body's not in good enough shape. You live and you learn."
Kyrgrios said he was likely to pull out of the doubles with his British partner Dan Evans, who defeated seventh seed Marin Cilic in the singles.
Federer is attempting to defy a difficult draw and a lack of preparation to become the second oldest male Grand Slam winner in the Open era.
If he is to add to his 17 major titles, he will have to pass more testing examinations than that posed by world number 200 Rubin, but Federer admitted he had leaned on his experience against the 20-year-old.
"I have played out here many, many times, that's my advantage maybe," he said, after claiming victory in two hours four minutes.
"If I could have signed (a contract) to be in the third round, feeling this way, weeks or days or a month ago, I would have taken it.
"I'm still hoping to feel better and better and better as we go along."
Federer beat Berdych in straight sets in last year's quarter-finals in Melbourne, but has lost to the Czech in the US Open and at Wimbledon.
"I'm sure he would like to beat me here too," added Federer.
Fifth seed Kei Nishikori overcame France's Jeremy Chardy.
The 27-year-old from Japan, who has reached the quarter-finals in the past two years, came through 6-3 6-4 6-3 in two hours six minutes to set up a meeting with Slovak qualifier Lukas Lacko.
Nishikori is seeded to face Britain's Andy Murray in the last eight.
Fourth seed Stan Wawrinka brushed aside American Steve Johnson 6-3 6-4 6-4, while France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga also came through in straight sets, against Serbia's Dusan Lajovic.
Australia's Bernard Tomic secured a spot in the third round with a 7-5 7-6 (7-4) 4-6 7-6 (7-5) win over Dominican Victor Estrella Burgos.
