Lord Fellowes was presented with the honorary Founders award by Downton actress Elizabeth McGovern, who plays the Countess of Grantham.
The only other British winner was Sky's 50 Ways to Kill Your Mammy in the non-scripted entertainment category.
France was the big winner of the night, taking home three awards including best drama series.
That was won by crime thriller Engrenages - which is shown on BBC Four under the translated name of Spiral. It won the award for its fifth series.
Executive producer Anne Landois paid tribute to the victims of the recent Paris terror attacks and thanked police for their efforts "to preserve our values".
Engrenages star Caroline Proust added: "I would like to dedicate this award to the victims of despair and hate, and I hope that love and generosity will win in France and all over the world."
'Mum so happy!'
The Man Who Saved the Louvre - a film about Jacques Jaujard, the director of the French National Museums during the Nazi occupation of France - won best arts programming, while Soldat Blanc (White Soldier) won the TV movie/mini-series award.
It tells the story of two soldiers, former friends who become deadly enemies during the Indochina war.
50 Ways to Kill Your Mammy follows Irish TV presenter Baz Ashmawy as he takes his 71-year-old mother on thrill-seeking adventures including skydiving and alligator wrangling.
Ashmawy tweeted a picture of himself and his mother after the awards saying: "Thanks everyone for all the love I'm very touched. Mum so happy!"
Brazilian television won two Emmys: Best telenovela - a limited-run serial drama - for Imperio (Empire) and best comedy for Doce de Mae (Sweet Mother).
Best actor went to Maarten Heijmans of the Netherlands for Ramses, which chronicles the rise and fall of popular Dutch singer Ramses Shaffy.
Norway's Anneke von der Lippe won best actress Emmy for Eyewitness, in which she plays a small town police chief caught in the middle of a murder investigation.
