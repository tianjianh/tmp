[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 51-year-old man who stabbed to death two fellow care home residents faces jail after prosecutors accepted his manslaughter plea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Mallin killed Karen Reid, 53, and John Down, 86, at the Fernways sheltered housing unit in Ilford, north east London, on 5 September last year.
Prosecutors at the Old Bailey had accused Mallin of murder, but accepted his plea following "high level" reports about his mental state.
He will be sentenced at a later date.
After psychiatric reports suggested Mallin had a case for diminished responsibility, Judge Richard Marks QC said it was "entirely proper and appropriate" and praised both victims' families for accepting the decision to drop the murder charges.
He said the families had dealt with the "traumatic set of events" with "great dignity, grace and propriety and that is very much to your credit".
Mallin, who lived in the unit in Cecil Road, had admitted manslaughter on 4 January.
The judge told him he had "pleaded guilty to two extremely serious offences" and he was "likely to be detained for a considerable amount of time."
Mallin was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on a date to be fixed pending reports on his potential risk to the public.
