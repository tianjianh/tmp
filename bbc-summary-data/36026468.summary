County Championship: Durham and Somerset suffer third day wash-out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham were denied the chance to press home their advantage against Somerset as bad weather prevented any play on day three at the Riverside.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side were set to resume on 223-4, 300 runs ahead, with opener Keaton Jennings on 105 not out.
Rain during the morning meant that a prompt start was impossible.
And umpires Rob Bailey and Nigel Cowley took the decision to abandon play for the day shortly before 14:45 BST after inspecting conditions in the middle.
