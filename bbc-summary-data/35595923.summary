Ruth Moss's husband Craig spent three months sending handwritten letters to stars including Lorraine Kelly and magician Paul Daniels.
Game of Thrones actor Ian McElhinney and explorer Jason Lewis also sent video messages.
Presenter John Humphrys sent his message from the set of Mastermind.
Mrs Moss, who is a nurse at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital, said her "jaw hit the floor" when the video was shown at the couple's wedding reception in Edinburgh's George Hotel last month.
She said: "It was great. One of the best bits was that he didn't just choose any celebrities. He went to people he knew I liked.
"It was just gobsmacking. I was stunned, it's actually the best thing that anyone has ever done for me."
Mr Moss, 40, from Liff, secretly sent two handwritten letters every day for three months to a list of his fiancÃ©e's favourite celebrities.
As well as as the video messages, he received written replies from celebrities including Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench and Sir David Attenborough.
Mr Moss said: "I was keeping it from everyone. The reaction on the day created a real buzz.
"Obviously the only reaction I was really counting on was Ruth's on the day.
"She was stunned, because I picked from celebrities that meant something to her. It got the reaction I was hoping for."
Mr Moss said John Humphrys' message, recorded in front of a BBC studio audience, was "amazing."
He said: "He said the show was filming in Manchester and he would have a word with the producer to see if they could do something in the studio at the end of the show.
"When it came back it was all top and tailed, with the Mastermind logo, it was unbelievable."
Other celebrities featured in the video included The Apprentice contestant Ruth Badger and Beautiful South singer Alison Wheeler.
Mr Moss said he was advised by autograph hunters online to send hand-written letters to the celebrities rather than emails.
"I had the idea in September so it gave me a three-month window. I was expecting maybe one or two to get back to me.
"I started getting written replies back from some really big names like Stephen Fry and David Attenborough and I thought, crikey, this could really work."
