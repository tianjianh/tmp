The three-times-capped 29-year-old graduated to Scarlets via home-town club Llandovery.
He joined the west Wales region in 2008 and has made 126 appearances, but is out injured for the rest of the season.
"The recovery is going well on the knee injury and I'm very much looking forward to getting a full pre-season under my belt," said Phillips.
"It has been a frustrating couple of season with injuries, but I'm delighted to have signed an extension to my contract."
The Llanelli-based team's head coach Wayne Pivac said: "We're pleased to see Emyr joining a strong pool of current Scarlets who have already committed their futures to the region."
