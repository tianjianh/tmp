Writing on Facebook, he said he had been receiving treatment for the last week and would be voluntarily checking into rehab later this week.
The actor said he wrote the post due to concern from fans and said that he had battled alcohol addiction in the past.
"While it's not always been an easy fight, I'm willing to continue my fight day by day," he said.
He added: "I want to thank everyone that's reached out with their messages of support, it truly means the world to me. With your support, I got this."
The actor has appeared on a number of reality TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother in the UK in 2009.
In 2015 he was taken to hospital after having a seizure at a Comic Con in Texas.
But he tweeted to fans: "Everything's ok guys. Thanks for the concern."
The actor was made famous by his role as Mini-Me in two Austin Powers films alongside Mike Myers.
