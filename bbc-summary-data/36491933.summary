Liberty House has announced that it has started recruiting staff for the newly reopened Dalzell and Clydebridge steel plants in Lanarkshire.

Liberty, which acquired the former Tata Steel mills in April, aims to fill up to 100 posts in the first recruitment phase.
It expects that number to grow next year.
The recruitment drive includes production, finance, health and safety and administrative positions.
The new management team plans to restart production in mid-September.
Liberty said it hoped to re-employ some ex-Tata employees who lost their jobs when the plants were mothballed by Tata last October.
However, applications are also being encouraged from those looking to join the steel industry for the first time.
Liberty said it planned to offer apprenticeship opportunities, including modern apprenticeships in engineering, finance and commercial planning.
The Scottish government set up a steel task force after Tata announced it was mothballing the plants in Motherwell and Cambuslang.
The government later bought the mills and immediately sold them to Liberty.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown said: "I am delighted to see these plans for recruitment and the resumption of steel production at Dalzell and Clydebridge, following the concerted efforts of the task force involving unions, local authorities and the Scottish government.
"It is testament to the hard work of everyone involved and fantastic news for both the local communities and Scotland's steel industry.
"It's particularly encouraging to see Liberty opening up new apprenticeship opportunities and investing in future workers."
Jon Bolton, chief executive of Liberty's new plate division which encompasses Dalzell and Clydebridge, said: "This moment marks a significant milestone in the process of bringing the steel business in Scotland back to life.
"It is a just reward for the dedication of the skilled workers who had to leave the business and it also presents an opportunity for new employees to join the Liberty family."
