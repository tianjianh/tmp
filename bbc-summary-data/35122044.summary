The "deliberately planted" device was found in a bin at Preston's Fishergate Shopping Centre at about 09:10 GMT.
Lancashire Police said an evacuation was ordered "as a precaution" because the incendiary had "gone off, causing very minor damage and no injuries".
Ch Supt James Lee said the centre remained closed due to concerns there may be more devices.
He said the incendiary was found by a member of the public in the men's toilets.
"Something happened to it to cause a very small fire, but it was put out immediately," he said.
An Army bomb disposal unit has gone to the centre to aid investigations.
