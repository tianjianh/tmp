Conservatives propose overhaul of local party associations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives have put forward plans to change the structure of local party associations and the way that election candidates are chosen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party wants to pilot associations spanning more than one constituency and also centralise certain membership functions and create a single candidate list for UK and European elections.
Chair Lord Feldman said it would help channel resources into campaigning.
It follows a review launched in the wake of last year's election victory.
Despite the Conservatives winning their first majority since 1992, there were concerns that it struggled to match Labour's "ground campaign" in many parts of the country, in terms of mobilising activists to canvass and help get out the vote.
The party is now proposing a series of changes to how voluntary parties are structured at a local level which it says will give it a "stronger platform" from which to fight the next election.
It wants to encourage some local associations, which vary considerably in size, to combine to form multi-constituency organisations in the hope of boosting their financial strength and improving their capabilities.
Party members in those areas will be asked to vote on the plans while associations with more than 100 members and a "fully operational structure" will be able to opt out if a majority of members vote against.
Other changes would see constituency associations offer different levels of membership, with associated benefits, and for administration of membership to be centralised - although parties will be still be responsible for recruiting members locally.
The review panel has recommended an outreach programme to widen the pool of candidates for future UK and European elections amid criticism the party remains too middle class and, despite recent progress, has too few female MPs and that ethnic minorities continue to be under-represented in the parliamentary party.
Lord Feldman, a close ally of David Cameron, said the changes - which must be approved by the party's National Convention at its autumn conference - showed the party was "far from complacent" despite last year's victory.
"To continue to win elections, with the buy-in and support of our members, we need to adapt," he said.
"Currently, our associations spend less than a third of their total income on campaigning - that's not the right allocation of resources if we are going to run a really dynamic operation on the ground."
