She is also in the running for best British female, with bookmakers predicting she will lift both trophies.
Adele will also perform at the show, as will Rihanna, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd and Little Mix - who are bringing their mums to the ceremony.
Meanwhile, hosts Ant and Dec have joked that "capes are banned" after Madonna's agonising fall last year.
"They're a health and safety nightmare!" Declan Donnely told ITV news.
Adele, whose third album 25 has sold 2.73m copies in the UK, looks set to dominate the awards, with further nominations for best single and best video - both of which are decided by a public vote.
Coldplay will also make history if they win either of their categories - best album or best group.
One win would give them a career total of nine Brits, making them the event's most successful band ever (Robbie Williams is the all-time champion, with an astonishing 17 trophies to his name).

The ceremony will also feature a tribute to David Bowie, who died last month.
Details of the performance are under wraps, but Brits chairman Max Lousada said it would be "respectful and understated".
In contrast to the razzmatazz of Lady Gaga's tribute at last week's Grammy Awards, the Brits committee felt it was "too soon to have a full celebration of his life," he told Music Week.
"We want to mark it in a respectful way, rather than setting off fireworks or whatever. Hopefully people will have a time of reflection and be able to listen and take in some of his incredible body of work."
Ahead of the show, there has been some controversy over the lack of representation for BAME artists.
Singer Laura Mvula said she would not attend the awards because of "the diversity issue", adding that black children grew up feeling they were "not acknowledged in society, in media and in mainstream music".
Rapper Stormzy also released a song, One Take Freestyle, protesting at the exclusion of artists from the grime scene.
"I felt very disappointed, I wasn't angry," he told BBC Radio 1.
"It was such a great year for grime and underground music... I thought maybe this year it might get celebrated."
The ceremony, at London's O2 Arena, will be broadcast live on ITV from 20:00 GMT. You can also follow live updates on the BBC News Website from 16:30 GMT.
