Ulster Aviation Society cancels open day over Maze deadlock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An aviation society has had to cancel its open days at the former Maze prison site for the second year in a row because of a dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin over the venue's use.

The Ulster Aviation Society had planned a two-day show for later this month.
But the use of the site needs approval from Stormont by both Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness.
A spokesperson for the ministers said: "There is no current agreement on the development of Maze Long Kesh."
The DUP said Peter Robinson had signed off on the event two months ago.
The aviation society pays to house its aircraft in the hangars on the site which currently only organised groups can visit.
Ray Burrows from the society said the open days that had been planned for 22 and 23 August would have drawn 7,000 people.
"We had a meeting with Sinn Féin representatives in June, and it was made clear to us that because the prison had been stopped there would be no development on the site whatsoever," he said.
"Even though we pointed out that this was not a development, and we had held open days in 2011, 2012, 2013, I'm afraid that fell on deaf ears.
"One side won't move because the prison is closed, and the other side deems there's no way the prison is going to be opened."
Mr Burrows said the events bring in between 30% and 40% of the society's income and without that their activities would be curbed.
A similar row broke out last year, when Mr McGuinness said no development of the former prison site outside Lisburn in County Antrim would take place until a dispute on a proposed peace centre based there was "satisfactorily resolved".
Plans for a peace and reconciliation centre were halted by Peter Robinson in August 2013, causing tension between the DUP and Sinn Féin.
Ten inmates died at the Maze prison in the 1981 republican hunger strikes.
As a result, plans to redevelop the site have been controversial.
Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney blamed the DUP for the decision not to grant permission for the open days.
He said it was a "direct result" of the party "reneging on its commitment" over the site's development.
But the DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said Sinn Féin's move was "short-sighted and petty".
"The Ulster Aviation Society is run entirely by volunteers and this event is a crucial platform to showcase their work," he said.
"I trust [Mr McGuinness] will review this decision and realise the error of his ways."
