The 54-year-old from Stockport struggled to break clear of Australia's Machin, who had defeated world champion Scott Waites earlier in the tournament, in Sunday's best-of-25-legs final.
But with the score 9-9, Fitton pulled away, winning four successive legs to seal a 13-9 success in Frimley Green.
Bolton's Lisa Ashton retained her women's title, beating fellow English thrower Deta Hedman 7-4 in the final.
