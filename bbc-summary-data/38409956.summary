[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two teenage drug dealers have been convicted of fatally stabbing a 43-year-old man in a park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 16-year-old boys from Liverpool, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were cleared of murdering Lee Briggs in St Marie's Park in Widnes, Cheshire.
But a jury at Chester Crown Court found them guilty of manslaughter.
The pair, both 15 at the time of the offence on 16 May, admitted being involved in the supply of drugs in the park on the day of his death.
The jury heard the teenagers had travelled from Liverpool to Widnes to sell cocaine and heroin in the park and that Mr Briggs had tried to rob them.
One of the boys admitted stabbing drug-user Mr Briggs but said he only did so in self-defence after Mr Briggs HAD held a knife to his throat while demanding he hand over drugs and money.
The teenager, who had been concealing a flick knife in his underpants, stabbed Mr Briggs in the ribs.
The second boy was said by the prosecution to have "encouraged or assisted" the killing by picking up a machete which had been wrapped in a T-shirt and hidden in the park.
The teenagers will be sentenced on 20 January, said police.
