[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alif Miah, 33, admitted carrying out the attack on Alexandra Crawford in the city's Richmond Walk in September 2013.
He admitted assaulting the victim to her severe injury, permanent disfigurement and to the danger of her life.
Lord Stewart said it would have been a 10-year term but for his guilty plea.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard the wound suffered by the victim was described by an experienced paramedic as one of the worst he had ever seen.
She later had 16 metal staples inserted to close the wound.
Defence counsel Gareth Jones said Miah had been drinking and taking prescription drugs but was at a loss to explain what then happened.
Mr Jones said: "He is ashamed and horrified that he could behave in that way."
He said Miah had previously gone to university to take a course in quantity surveying but dropped out and began using drugs.
The judge extended his "best wishes" to Miah in addressing his drug and alcohol problems.
After the case, Det Insp Lorna Ferguson said: "Alif Miah now has to face the consequences of his abhorrent behaviour.
"I would like to commend the courage of the victim throughout the investigation."
