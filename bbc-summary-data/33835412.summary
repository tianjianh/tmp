A rare orchid has been discovered for the first time in Cumbria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The X Dactyloglossum mixtum has only been found at 15 sites in Britain since 2000 and was discovered at Plantlife's Augill Pasture reserve near Brough.
A cross between a frog orchid and a common spotted orchid, it was found by Lois Harbron who had been counting the frog orchids at the reserve.
Ms Harbron said it was something she had "always hoped" to see, but she never expected it would be at Augill.
The newly discovered orchid is so rare it does not have a common English name, charity Plantlife said.
