Lewis, 22, had spent his entire career at National League side Macclesfield, scoring 16 goals in 94 league games.
"I play as a box-to-box midfielder that likes to get forward and I'll be aiming to produce a few goals as well," he told the club website.
"The manager (Shaun Derry) played in my position at the highest level so I'll be able to learn a lot."
