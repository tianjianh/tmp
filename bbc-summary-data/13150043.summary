Central African Republic profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Radio is the most-popular medium. State-run Radio Centrafrique has limited coverage after its AM and shortwave transmitters were looted in the sectarian conflict that erupted in 2013.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Radio Ndeke Luka ("bird of luck"), run by Swiss NGO Fondation Hirondelle, provides balanced output, and rebroadcasts international news bulletins.
The UN stabilisation mission (MINUSCA) runs Guira FM, which is available in the capital and in the regions. The station is  named after a tree under which differences are solved.
There are about two dozen privately-owned radio stations. Many of them are run by religious organisations.
Newspapers are privately-owned. Their reach is limited by low literacy levels and a lack of distribution in rural areas.
BBC World Service (90.2 FM), Radio France Internationale and the Voice of America are available via local relays in Bangui.
Around 161,000 citizens were online by 2014 - around 3.4% of the population (InternetLiveStats.com). Internet access is mainly confined to Bangui.
