[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Mongan, 28, allegedly slashed the female officer across the neck and jaw at Maghaberry Prison, near Lisburn, on Monday.
The woman was taken to hospital after the incident which is said to have been carried out with some form of a blade.
Mongan appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court to face a single charge of attempted murder.
He confirmed he understood the alleged offence.
An investigating policeman said he could connect the accused to the charge.
The defence solicitor put no questions to the officer.
Mongan, a prisoner with a previous address at Riverview Meadows in Belfast, did not seek bail.
He was remanded in custody to appear again in court on April 10.
