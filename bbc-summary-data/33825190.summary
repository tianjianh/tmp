'Wasted money' accusation over women's prisons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Conservatives have accused the Scottish government of wasting money on women's prisons before changing its plans.

The Tories said it was "sheer bad planning" to spend more than ??11m on a women's prison which will not be built and another which is to be closed.
Scotland's main female prison, Cornton Vale, is to be replaced by a series of units around the country.
The Scottish Prison Service said it was required to ensure decent conditions.
The Scottish Conservatives discovered through a freedom of information request that more than ??4m had been spent on renovations at Cornton Vale.
It also said a further ??7m was wasted in Inverclyde on a site earmarked for a prison - a plan which has since been scrapped.
MSP Alex Johnstone said: "Everyone accepts conditions for prisoners have to be of an acceptable standard, and from time to time money will have to be spent on renovations.
"But people will think it is sheer bad planning for the Scottish government to spend ??4m on a prison it knew was going to close within a few years.
"There must have been a more cost-effective solution that would ensure conditions were up to standard and the taxpayer got value for money.
"But if you add that to the ??7m wasted on the axed plans for a new super prison, it paints the SNP in an extremely incompetent light."
He added: "This is potentially reckless spending by the Scottish government, only for it to settle on a plan to build a brand new prison on the current Cornton Vale site."
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: "The SPS is required to spend money renovating its estate to ensure everyone held in prison is in decent conditions.
"The money spent in Inverclyde went on the site acquisition and ground works for the site.
"The original plan for the site was to build a replacement for Greenock Prison."
Previous justice secretary Kenny MacAskill wanted to build a new 300-inmate jail in Inverclyde.
But current justice secretary Michael Matheson dropped the plan, saying Scotland needed a new, radical approach for female offenders.
The new prison, to be built near the Cornton Vale facility, will house 80 of the most serious offenders.
There will be another five regional units to house 20 female prisoners each.
They will offer help over drugs, alcohol and domestic abuse and will allow offenders to be held close to their families.
A Scottish government spokesman said: "Investment in Cornton Vale is necessary as the prison will continue to be used for several years.
"The Scottish government is keen to transform prison services to help women break the cycle of reoffending and make a positive contribution to society, and we are engaging with partners with a view to investing in smaller regional and community-based custodial facilities, in line with the recommendations of an expert group headed by Dame Elish Angiolini QC."
