The hosts reached 98-1 on the third day at Old Trafford, building on a first-innings lead of 391 after bowling Pakistan out for 198 thanks to Chris Woakes' 4-67.
Captain Alastair Cook is unbeaten on 49 and Joe Root 23, after Alex Hales fell to Mohammad Amir for 24.
No team has chased more than 418 in the fourth innings to win a Test.
Pakistan, 57-4 overnight, slipped to 119-8 before skipper Misbah-ul-Haq (52) and Wahab Riaz (39) added 60 for the ninth wicket.
They can expect to bat again early on the fourth day, as England press for the victory that would level the four-match series at 1-1.

Only 60.4 overs were bowled on a day when there were four interruptions for rain, including two during England's second innings in bowler-friendly conditions.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan said he was "absolutely staggered" by Cook's decision to bat again.
"They were 391 runs ahead - 391 runs! Win the game today - why delay it?" he said on BBC Test Match Special.
"Somebody has tweeted me to say England's sports science department want to manage the bowlers' workload.
"They've only bowled 60 overs. I know I sound like Geoffrey Boycott, but come on!"
Only two teams have won a Test after following on, with Australia beaten by England in 1894 and 1981 and by India in 2001.
Former England batsman Boycott said on TMS: "I can't help but think England have made a mistake.
"If they had enforced the follow-on, it would have been perfect because they've been on and off and the bowlers would have had a rest."
England assistant coach Paul Farbrace said it was a "pretty simple decision" not to enforce the follow-on.
"We wanted to get our runs while it's still a very good pitch, at no point putting ourselves under undue pressure, trying to chase a score. The pitch will deteriorate.
"We've got two days to bowl them out, we can bat on in the morning and get a few more then look to put them under extreme pressure."
Asked if England's decision not to enforce the follow-on was to help protect seamers James Anderson and Ben Stokes, both of whom are returning from injury after missing the first Test, Farbrace said: "No, they're both fully fit."
Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur said: "I fully expected us to be batting again, as did all our batters, who were almost padding up.
"We were probably a bit relieved that we weren't straight back out there. Our batters certainly were happy."
Pakistan, who lost four wickets in 24 overs on the second evening, fared marginally better on Sunday, with only Misbah offering sustained resistance on a pitch that remains reliable.
James Anderson, on his home ground, removed Shan Masood for 39 courtesy of an edge to Root at second slip.
Asad Shafiq drove Stuart Broad loosely to backward point, Sarfraz Ahmed edged Ben Stokes to second slip to fall for 26 off 18 balls, and Yasir Shah followed one from Woakes to give Root, England's double centurion, his fourth catch.
Struck on the helmet by a Woakes bouncer, Misbah received valuable support from Wahab, who hit Moeen Ali for six during the highest partnership of the Pakistan innings.
Misbah, in attempting to dominate Moeen - as he did in the first innings at Lord's - top-edged a sweep to Cook at short fine-leg.
Wahab, who was hit on the left elbow by Woakes and did not bowl in England's second innings, swung Moeen to Hales at deep mid-wicket to end the innings.
Boycott said: "Pakistan almost couldn't resist giving their wickets away.
"You would have thought this morning they would think about it and say 'let's show some fight'."

If it had not been for that ninth-wicket stand of 60 between Misbah and Wahab, England would probably have put Pakistan in again.
Not enforcing the follow-on will be viewed as a negative decision but it's not totally illogical as James Anderson and Ben Stokes have just returned from injuries.
It's a statement from the team on top as much as anything else, because whenever Pakistan bat again they will always have a huge target hanging over them and know they have no chance of reaching it.
But I cannot help but think that, had England bowled again, they would have done very nicely in these conditions.
