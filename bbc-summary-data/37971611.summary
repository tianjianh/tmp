Mary Berry Everyday will see the star share family classics, easy recipes and special occasion dishes.
Earlier this month it was announced that Berry, 81, would present another new show, Mary Berry's Secrets From Britain's Great Houses, on BBC One.
BBC Two boss Patrick Holland said the series was "a real treat".
He added:  "I am thrilled that Mary is returning to BBC Two to share her magic."
Berry's previous BBC Two shows, aside from Bake Off which began life there before moving to BBC One, include Mary Berry's Absolute Favourites and Mary Berry's Foolproof Cooking.
She first made her name as a cookery writer and has judged the enormously successful The Great British Bake Off, with Paul Hollywood, since its 2010 launch.
The most recent series was the last to be seen on BBC One before it moves to Channel 4 next year.
Hollywood is the only Bake Off star moving across to Channel 4 with the series.
However, Berry, Hollywood and hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc will be seen in two Bake Off Christmas specials on the BBC, which have already been filmed.
