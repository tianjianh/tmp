Minions fend off Terminator challenge at UK box office

The latest Terminator movie posed no threat to the Minions, who remain top dog at the UK and Ireland box office.

The Minions film made £6.23m in its second weekend in cinemas, comfortably besting the £3.79m Terminator: Genisys made in its first four days on release.
There was better news for Amy, Asif Kapadia's film about Amy Winehouse.
The £519,000 it took between Friday and Sunday, according to its distributor, saw it record the biggest ever opening weekend for a British documentary.
Minions, a spin-off starring the diminutive yellow henchmen from the Despicable Me films, has now made almost £21m at UK and Ireland cinemas.
That benchmark is unlikely to be reached by Terminator: Genisys, despite the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger to his signature film franchise.
The time travel-based action film was quickly followed into cinemas by another sequel, Magic Mike XXL, that also failed to challenge an existing box office champ.
Channing Tatum's follow-up to his 2012 male stripper comedy could only manage fourth place in this week's chart, one place behind Jurassic World.
Amy, in contrast, left its UK distributor jubilant after enjoying the best opening for a non-concert film documentary since Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11.
"We are delighted that audiences have chosen to celebrate the life of the truly talented musical icon," said Hamish Moseley of Altitude Film Distribution.
The continued appeal of so-called 'event cinema' is evidenced further down this week's chart by the presence of the Royal Opera House's Guillaume Tell.
Sunday's live relay of the production, whose opening night had audience members booing over at a controversial rape scene, occupies eighth place, having generated takings of £114,673.
