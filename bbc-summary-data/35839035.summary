Che Adams put the Blades in front at the break with a close-range effort and Ryan Flynn's hooked shot made it 2-0.
David Fox's long-range drive gave Crewe hope, before Harry Davis swept home Callum Ainley's cross to draw level.
Sharp then struck his 17th League One goal of the season to help United secure a third consecutive victory.
Crewe, who have won just once in 17 matches, return to the bottom and are now nine points adrift of safety with eight games left.
The Blades climb a place to 11th, within four points of the play-off places.
