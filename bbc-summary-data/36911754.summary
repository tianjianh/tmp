Two men and a woman were killed in a head-on collision with another vehicle in the Drumkeen area, near Letterkenny.
They have been named locally as Stephen McCafferty, 19, Teresa Robinson, who would have turned 21 at the weekend, and Kaylem Ó Murachaidh.
The crash happened just before 01:00 local time on Thursday.
A fourth man is in a serious condition in hospital. The youngest victim was 18.
It comes after two men were killed in a crash in the area on Wednesday.
The collision on Thursday involved a red Toyota Carina and a blue Peugeot 306.
Insp Michael Harrison said they needed to know why it had happened.
"This was quite a harrowing scene this morning and we are just now in the process of telling their families that unfortunately they have lost a child.
"The youngest was 18 and for any family to lose an 18-year-old is devastating.
"It's devastating for this community to lose five people in two days, it really is very, very difficult," he said.
"How many more young people can we lose? We have to do something to slow these people down on the road."
Insp Harrison made a fresh appeal for witnesses.
"For some reason they came together head-on on this country road and three quite young people have lost their lives and one person has been seriously injured.
"We need to know why two vehicles came together at high speed on a country road, we need this information for the families," he said.
Police said the latest fatalities brings to six the number of people who have died on Donegal roads since 1 January 2016.
