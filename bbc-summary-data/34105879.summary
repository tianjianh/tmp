The 26-year-old, who scored 18 goals in 70 Bundesliga starts, has signed a five-year deal with the Serie A club.
"I had a good time in Wolfsburg and I would like to thank them for making my move to Italy possible," Perisic said.
He was the second high-profile departure from Wolfsburg over the weekend, after midfielder Kevin De Bruyne joined Manchester City for £55m.
Perisic, who signed for Wolfsburg from Borussia Dortmund in 2013, has been capped 38 times by his country, scoring nine goals.
