[SN]TITLE[SN]
Council co-leader urged to refer himself over trip row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Aberdeenshire Council co-leader is being urged to refer himself to the Standards Commission for not staying at a foreign conference because the accommodation was not good enough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Kitts-Hayes, of the Progressive Independent Group on Aberdeenshire Council, was due to attend the North Sea Commission earlier this month.
He later said his decision to leave Legoland was a "poor one".
Councillors called for Mr Kitts-Hayes to consider referring himself.
It is believed the aborted trip cost the council a four-figure sum.
The decision to return home led to the council's chief executive announcing the circumstances would be investigated.
Mr Kitts-Hayes is the councillor for Inverurie and District, and is co council leader with the SNP's Richard Thomson.
