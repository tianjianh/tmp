[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A north Belfast woman who feared her house would be unsellable because of an invasion of Japanese knotweed, has been thrown a lifeline by the Housing Executive.

Jennifer Worbey from north Belfast discovered the plant growing at the rear of her home a number of weeks ago.
Initially no-one would accept responsibility for the piece of ground behind her house, but eventually the Housing Executive accepted it was their problem.
It has agreed to pay for treatment to remove the Japanese knotweed.
"I contacted my local MP to find out who owned the land because I knew it wasn't just my property that was affected," Mrs Worbey said.
"In a sense, it's a lot of people in Premier Drive and on the other side of the waste ground that are affected by it.
"Currently we can't use the back gate, there's no access up and down the back entry at all which means that all of our bins are kept in the front gardens which is a bit of an eyesore.
"We did have plans to do something with the second back garden which are now currently on hold until the problem gets resolved."
Mark Johnston from Knotweed Northern Ireland said it was an "annual plant".
"It dies back completely in the winter and then in the spring you'll start to notice small shoots coming through," he said.
"They'll look a bit like asparagus spears, often with a red tip.
"Don't stand looking directly down on them because they grow about two inches a day and they take on very quickly and they spread.
"If you try and pull it out, it will just spread underground and you will find you have an even wider stand of Japanese knotweed."
Mr Johnston said it was not a surprise that the Japanese Knotweed could come through concrete.
"It basically started off life on the side of Japanese volcanoes so it was well used to coming up through lava that had solidified over the top of it," he said.
Householders who have the plant growing on their property have found it difficult to sell their homes or to get a mortgage to buy a property in close proximity to where it is found.
Mrs Worbey, who lives in her home with her husband and children, said: "We've put a lot of money into it to make it a family home.
"To be told my property could be devalued due to, in a sense, a weed which is growing on a piece of land that doesn't belong to me, that has now impacted on my property.
"I'm sure there's probably a lot of people like myself who actually even don't know what it is, you just think it's overgrown weeds."
The plant, which can grow through concrete and affects drains, walls and driveways is becoming more of a problem for property owners across Northern Ireland.
The issues around Japanese Knotweed are due to brought before a Stormont committee.
