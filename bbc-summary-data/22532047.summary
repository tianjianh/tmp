Freeza Meats former director appears at Westminster committee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former director of a Newry food company which was at the centre of the horsemeat scandal has said his firm did nothing wrong.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Fairburn gave evidence to a Westminster committee on Tuesday.
In February, a consignment of beef being stored at Freeza Meats was found to contain horsemeat.
It did not belong to Freeza Meats and none of their products tested positive for horsemeat.
Mr Fairburn, who is now retired, said the beef belonged to another company, McAdam Foods, and that his firm has suffered.
He told MPs the scandal had led to his firm missing out on multi-million pound orders and had resulted in 31 jobs being lost in Newry.
Quizzed by MPs on the Environment and Rural Affairs Committee about the horsemeat scandal, Mr Fairburn described it as a "fraud" and said it was "being perpetrated by a big organisation".
He also said he suspected it had been "going on for some time".
He told MPs that the illegal meat trade originated in other parts of Europe and did not come from the UK or Ireland.
He rejected a suggestion from the Conservative MP Anne McIntosh that "all roads lead to Ireland".
Asked if the scandal originated in Ireland, Mr Fairburn said "not at all".
Mr Fairburn faced questioning from Conservative and Labour MPs and the South Down SDLP MP Margaret Ritchie.
MPs also heard evidence from the Food Standards Agency.
Tests carried out on the meat stored at Freeza Meats found that samples from the consignment contained about 80% horsemeat.
It followed the discovery of horse DNA at a plant in the Republic of Ireland.
Newry and Mourne Council confirmed that tests on Freeza Meats' burgers were free from horsemeat DNA.
Martin McAdam, whose firm owned the contaminated meat, said there was "clearly an issue" with their Polish supplier.
