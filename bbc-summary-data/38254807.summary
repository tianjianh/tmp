A man has been jailed for two years after he was caught with 220 wraps of cocaine and heroin inside his body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieron Fallon, 27 of Radway Road, Huyton in Liverpool pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply at Exeter Crown Court on Friday.
The drugs runner was caught by police on the M5 at Collompton with Â£5,500 worth of Heroin and cocaine.
Judge Geoffrey Mercer said: "People who involve themselves in the supply of drugs do so with their eyes open."
The court heard Fallon agreed to deliver drugs to Devon and Cornwall from his home in Liverpool because he had lost his job and got into debt.
He was carrying 72 wraps of crack cocaine and 152 of heroin when he was stopped by police.
He has been living with his partner and three-year-old daughter and took a job as a warehouseman since his arrest in July.
Judge Mercer said: "You have a partner and a young family. You should have thought about them before you embarked on this enterprise."
Mr Barry Smith, defending, said Fallon played a lesser role and was directed by those higher up the chain.
