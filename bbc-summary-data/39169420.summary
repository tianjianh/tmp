[SN]TITLE[SN]
Clyde draw with Forfar as Annan keep winning run going

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clyde earned hard-fought 2-2 draw against League Two leaders Forfar Athletic at Broadwood Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Annan Athletic picked up their fifth league win in a row with a 3-2 victory at Montrose.
Stirling Albion's good formed continued as they beat Cowdenbeath 2-0, while Elgin City and Arbroath played out a 0-0 draw at Borough Briggs.
The fixture between Edinburgh City and Berwick Rangers was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.
Clyde, under the guidance of stand-in bosses Peter MacDonald and Jon-Paul McGovern, fell behind to a Danny Denholm goal but MacDonald equalised from the spot and David Gormley made it 2-1.
Jim Lister levelled matters late on, despite Forfar goalkeeper Grant Adam being shown a red card.
Three first-half goals set Annan on the way to victory at Montrose. Gary Fraser cancelled out Rabin Omar's early opener, before Max Wright and Steven Swinglehurst gave the visitors a two-goal cushion. Fraser had the chance to reduce the deficit from the penalty spot but his effort was saved by Blair Currie.
Kerr Hay pulled a goal back for the hosts and Annan's Darren Ramsay received a red card late on.
Cowdenbeath's Dale Carrick had an early penalty saved by Chris Smith and his side's misery was compounded midway through the half when Ross Smith headed Stirling Albion in front. Sean Dickson secured the three points shortly after the restart.
Elgin and Arbroath's draw helps neither in their pursuit of Forfar. Ricky Little received his marching orders for Arbroath after picking up two yellow cards, whilst Elgin's Darryl McHardy came closest to breaking the deadlock when his cross struck the bar.
