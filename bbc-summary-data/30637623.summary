We're talking about the heart emoji on your phone, or emoticon, which is this year's most popular "word".
A new survey from Global Language Monitor found that the symbol appeared billions of times a day across the world.
Also making it into the top 10 of most popular words in 2014 were hashtag, vape, blood moon and nano.
The research, carried out by the Global Language Monitor in Austin, Texas, looked at blogs, Twitter, Facebook and 250,000 global news outlets over the last 12 months.
Ebola was top of the list of names with Pope Francis, World War One, Médecins Sans Frontières and Prince George behind it.
OK is the most understood word in the world.
This is the 15th year that the list has been put together.
Last year's most popular word was 404, as in a 404 internet error. Top phrase was Toxic Politics while Pope Francis was top name.
