The Canadian departs after two trophyless seasons with the Giants second in the league this year.
As the coach he posted 85 wins, 38 losses and one tie in 134 games.
"I know how challenging it can be and Derrick should be proud of his achievements," said Steve Thornton, Head of Hockey Operations.
He added: "I would like to thank Derrick for his hard work as Head Coach over the previous two seasons. We will endeavour to fill the position of Head Coach as soon as possible."
"Player recruitment is already underway for the 2017/18 season where competing for all Elite League trophies will be our main aim."
It was Walser's first taste of coaching and his time with the Giants ended with the loss against the Sheffield Steelers in last Saturday's play-offs semi-final.
Walser amassed 18 goals and 76 assists, good for 94 points and 32nd place in the Giants all-time player list.
"The Giants organisation would like to thank Derrick Walser as well as recognise the passion and dedication he brought to the Player/Coach role," said the SSE Arena side.
"We wish Derrick and the Walser family well for the future."
