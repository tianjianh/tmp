Derbyshire Police confirmed a murder investigation has been launched after a 38-year-old woman was found injured in Borrowash and later died in hospital.
Thirty minutes later, the man, 44, died in the collision on the southbound carriageway near Trowell services.
Both sides of the M1 have now reopened, Nottinghamshire Police said.
Officers were called to Station Road, Borrowash, at 11:00 GMT on Friday after a 22-year-old man - who had also been injured - raised the alarm. He is now being treated in hospital, Derbyshire Police said.
M1 closure: Latest updates
The disruption on the M1 has affected those travelling to East Midlands Airport, and several public transport providers across the region have warned of severe delays.
A cameraman for BBC East Midlands Today reported seeing a body on the carriageway, while eyewitnesses told of bloody scenes in Borrowash.
Michael Nightingale from Station Road said a "young lad" ran into a flower shop with "stab wounds over his face".
"I saw the police wrapping up a young lad in tin foil," he said.
"He was on the ground, so I drove down into my drive and then a police van turned up and cordoned off the house.
"I have lived here for 10 years and I have never seen anything like this.
"He ran over the road - that's where they wrapped him up. He was shouting: 'Help me, help me'."
Florist Louise Winson said: "I just heard shouting: 'Help me, please help me'.
"I looked round, the guy's just stood there, I couldn't even see his face for blood - it was just pouring.
"I just shut the door to be honest, I was in absolute shock and then I picked my phone up to ring 999 but somebody had already done it and then I went out and he was laying on the side of the road. [It was] just a mess."
