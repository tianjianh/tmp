The clip is a timelapse made up of photos taken once every second and sped up to be 25 times faster.
The astronaut posted: "Space Station view of an 'aurora rise' - spot the two satellites at the end?"
Auroras happen when particles from the Sun hit the Earth's atmosphere, making it glow in a greenish blue light.
An aurora rise is when you see an aurora rising above the horizon because of the way the International Space Station orbits Earth.
It's similar to a sunrise or moonrise - as with the Moon/Sun, the aurora is already there but just not visible yet.
