Care is preferred to Ben Youngs, while Marler gets in ahead of Mako Vunipola.
Back rower Jack Clifford, prop Paul Hill and centre Ollie Devoto are set to make their international debuts off the bench at Murrayfield.
Lock Courtney Lawes is included among the replacements after passing a fitness test on his hamstring injury.
"There were some tight calls on selection, but we have picked a match-day squad with a blend of experience and youth," said England head coach Eddie Jones, who succeeded Stuart Lancaster.
England: Mike Brown; Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph, Owen Farrell, Jack Nowell; George Ford, Danny Care; Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley (captain), Dan Cole, Joe Launchbury, George Kruis, Chris Robshaw, James Haskell, Billy Vunipola.
Replacements: Jamie George, Mako Vunipola, Paul Hill, Courtney Lawes, Jack Clifford, Ben Youngs, Alex Goode, Ollie Devoto.
Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley skippers an England side attempting to retain the Calcutta Cup, which they have held since 2009.
Owen Farrell, Billy Vunipola and Mike Brown have been appointed vice-captains. The starting XV boasts 512 caps, but no debutants.
Former captain Chris Robshaw is moved across the back row to blind-side flanker, with James Haskell taking over at open-side.
George Ford plays at fly-half with Farrell at inside centre in their second Test start together.
"The boys have worked hard since coming into camp to understand how I want the team to play going forward," added Australian Jones.
"We are confident we can go to Edinburgh and win, but we're in no doubt it will be a huge challenge.
"Playing at Murrayfield in front of a passionate Scottish crowd will be a real test for this team but one I know we can rise to."
BBC Sport's chief sports writer Tom Fordyce:
New head coach Eddie Jones has gone for experience over promise after selecting a battle-hardened England XV to open their Six Nations campaign against Scotland.
It means nine of the men who started England's last match - the meaningless World Cup win over Uruguay - will get the chance to kick-start the new regime.
When Stuart Lancaster's own spell began with the same fixture four years ago, his first XV featured three new caps and only six survivors of a team that had lost to France in the quarter-finals of the preceding World Cup.
Yet Jones has been far more conservative with Scotland chasing a first win over England in eight years.
It is five years now since England last won the Six Nations Championship and 13 since their last Grand Slam, but they have won on their past two visits to Murrayfield, keeping Scotland scoreless two winters ago.
However, with their hosts coming off a more successful World Cup - only a controversial late penalty decision denying them a place in the semi-finals - Saturday afternoon is likely to prove a testing baptism.
Speaking to reporters following Thursday's team announcement, Jones looked to be handling the scrutiny in his stride.
"If Eddie Jones feels under any pressure ahead of his first match in charge of England, he's not showing it so far," said Fordyce.
"He was all relaxation and smiles, combative when pushed on the lack of new faces but clearly excited.
"He admits to nerves but only positive ones: 'I don't sit there biting my nails or scratching my head.'
"With his years of international coaching experience, the former Australia and Japan coach has seen bigger occasions than this - and, in a frenetic Six Nations build-up, his calmness is so far shining through."
