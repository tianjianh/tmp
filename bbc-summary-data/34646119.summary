McAree had been working alongside Murphy, first as head coach and then first team coach, since December 2011.
Murphy stepped down after losing 1-0 at Ballymena and has become an Elite Development Coach with the Irish FA.
"I look forward to getting started with a group of players who I have a lot of time and respect for," said McAree.
The former long-serving Dungannon Swifts midfielder, 41, also played under his father, Joe, who had several spells in charge of his hometown club.
Dungannon are second from bottom in the Irish Premiership having picked up just two wins and accumulated eight points from 13 matches this season.
"Looking at our league form, we need to target picking up points, and I believe the squad of players are capable of getting the results that we need to put us in a better position," said McAree.
