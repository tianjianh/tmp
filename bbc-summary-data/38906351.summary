[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nchinumya Ntembe, 22, poured Tizer laced with the hallucinogenic into a water bottle and fed marijuana leaves to the rodent, named Mr Chow.
Footage released by the RSPCA shows Ntembe and others laughing as Mr Chow ingests the drugs.
Ntembe admitted five cruelty offences and was jailed for four months at Lancaster Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges also included failing to meet the needs of two dogs. The animals survived and were rehomed.
Ntembe, of Cypress Road, Lancaster, was also banned from keeping animals for eight years.
He was caught on camera filling Mr Chow's water bottle with the spiked soft drink before then feeding the animal with cannabis leaves at a property in Heysham.
He can be heard saying with others "this could be the end for Mr Chow" and they "egged each other on to give him more drugs", the RSPCA said.
The charity said his dogs - named Zeus and Faith - were also found in a "terrible state" and unnecessary suffering was caused to a further dog called Troy.
Police had attended the property on a warrant and discovered the animals and the footage of cruelty on mobile phones.
Ntembe admitted five offences under the Animal Welfare Act.
Last month, Corey Lee Destrow, 22, York Road, Lancaster, admitted animal cruelty offences relating to the hamster at the city's magistrates' court.
He was given 12 month community order with 80 hours unpaid work and was disqualified from keeping animals for two years, following an appeal of his eight week prison sentence.
Luke Gabriel Horn, 22, of Kingsway, Heysham, was sentenced to an 18 month community order with 250 hours unpaid work after admitted animal cruelty to a dog.
He was disqualified from keeping dogs for five years.
