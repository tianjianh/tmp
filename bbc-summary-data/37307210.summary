A taxi driver had scratches on his face and appeared "emotionally distressed and upset" after he allegedly murdered a sex worker, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Halliwell, 52, denies killing Becky Godden between 1 January 2003 and 3 April 2008.
Miss Godden was last seen alive getting into a taxi outside a club in Swindon. Later he told his GP a passenger assaulted him, the court was told.
He is already serving a life sentence for murdering Sian O'Callaghan in 2011.
Miss O'Callaghan went missing after a night out with friends in Swindon.
Her semi-naked body was discovered in undergrowth in Uffington, Oxfordshire, while the remains of Miss Godden were found in Eastleach, Gloucestershire in 2011.
In a written statement, his GP Dr Philip Mayes, told Bristol Crown Court Halliwell came into his surgery complaining of a sore hand.
He claimed he had been assaulted by a man for refusing to pick him up on the street because he was a private hire driver and that a fight had ensued.
"I... noted that Mr Halliwell had scratches to his face... consistent with a fight.
"I can remember that Mr Halliwell was emotionally distressed and upset while telling me about what had happened to him," Dr Mayes said.
Mr Halliwell, who is representing himself,  also told the detective who bought him to justice, former Det Supt Steve Fulcher, "it was a pleasure ruining your career".
After asking Mr Fulcher a few questions clarifying points the officer had made in statements relating to his leading of the investigation into the disappearance and murder of Sian O'Callaghan, Mr Halliwall indicated he had one more question to ask.
He told Mr Fulcher: "Oh and by the way, it was a pleasure ruining your career."
The case continues.
