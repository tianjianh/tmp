York Minster bells' first Christmas Day silence for 600 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The bells of York Minster were silent on Christmas Day for what is thought to be the first time in more than 600 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Minster Chapter dismissed its bell-ringers in October because of "safeguarding issues".
The bells were rung for the first time in more than 10 weeks on Thursday, for the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols.
It is thought Sunday's silence was the first Christmas Day the bells had not been rung since the 14th Century.
Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu and dean of York Minster Vivienne Faull, who both attended the Christmas Day service, supported the decision.
The dismissal of the bell-ringing team came after they refused to accept the Minster Chapter's decision not to reinstate a team member suspended following an investigation into allegations of sex offending against children.
The allegation never led to a charge.
However, the Chapter decided, after a risk assessment, the bell-ringer concerned "presented an ongoing risk" and could not be reinstated.
The bell-ringing on Thursday was carried out by a team of volunteers from across Yorkshire.
The Chapter has previously said that attempts to recruit replacement ringers had been hampered by "intimidation" - but York Minster Society of Change Ringers (YMSCR) denied this.
YMSCR's statement also said its members were willing to ring the bells for all Christmas services if asked to do so.
