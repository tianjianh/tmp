Morgan Savage, from Dublin, was found in a kayak on Yaverland beach on 11 September.
Officers released e-fit images, as well as CCTV footage of a man visiting a canoe shop in Newhaven on 8 September, in an attempt to identity him.
A post-mortem examination last month proved to be inconclusive. The coroner is awaiting further test results.
Hampshire Police tweeted "our thoughts are with his family".
