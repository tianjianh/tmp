[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paris St-Germain 2-2 Nice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nice moved back to the top of France's Ligue 1 despite throwing away a 2-0 half-time lead to draw 2-2 at reigning champions Paris St-Germain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
France Under-21 midfielder Wylan Cyprien put Nice ahead by curling a 25-yard free-kick into the top corner.
Alassane Plea then took advantage of some ponderous defending to clip in.
Edinson Cavani scored twice for PSG after the break, tapping in Serge Aurier's cross and benefiting from a howler by keeper Yoan Cardinale.
The 22-year-old Frenchman weakly punched out a cross from the left, the ball hitting defender Dante's head and allowing Cavani to prod in from close range.
Cavani twice thought he had won all three points but had efforts rightly ruled out by an offside flag.
Nice, who started the match behind Monaco on goal difference, moved back above the principality side with the point.
PSG remain in third place, four points adrift of the surprise leaders.
Manager Unai Emery, who replaced Laurent Blanc in the summer, remains under pressure after a difficult week in both domestic and European competition.
The Qatari-backed champions were humbled 3-0 by Montpellier last weekend, then scrambled a 2-2 draw against Ludogorets in midweek that allowed Arsenal to pinch top spot in their Champions League group.
And a smattering of boos could be heard from the home fans at the Parc des Princes as Nice avoided an eighth successive defeat against PSG.
