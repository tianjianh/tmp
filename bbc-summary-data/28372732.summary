John Ryan told the BBC the deal had collapsed because the Football League were not happy with the plans presented to them.
"Louis and I were just looking to do the right thing," said Ryan.
Ryan and Tomlinson were expected to complete their takeover this week.
22 year-old Louis is a lifelong Rovers fan and played for the club's reserve side against Barnsley earlier this year.
