Wales assistant coach Rob Howley says the players and coaches are "all in it together" after losing to England.

Wales will still finish second in the Six Nations if they defeat winless Italy at home on Saturday.
Asked if Wales' players would get a chance to redeem themselves, Howley said: "Please don't try to divide and conquer - we are as one.
"We're all in it together. It's not just the players, it's the coaches, it's the backroom staff."
Wales captain Sam Warburton is a doubt to face Italy as he starts head injury assessments, but prop Gethin Jenkins is back in training after missing the England match with a calf problem.
The team announcement is due on Tuesday.
Howley admits Wales' coaches are still struggling to explain the slow start against England, which saw them fall 19 points behind.
"It's about looking in the mirror, coaches included, and asking yourself the questions about the first 20-25 minutes.
"Rugby is a game of emotion and unfortunately we just didn't start well.
"Have I got the answers? Not at this moment in time. Hopefully when we've spoken to the players individually and collectively as coaches, we might have some of those answers.
"Thankfully we've got one more game in the championship and an opportunity to go second.
"Although it's a Wales-England game, we'll remember that for how many days we play them in a friendly before we go to New Zealand."
