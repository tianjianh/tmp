Plans to move Langlands School in Dumfries to new campus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dumfries school for children with severe and complex needs could be relocated to a new "learning campus" under new council plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The existing Langlands School building, which is based at Loreburn Park, is in a poor condition, according to the education department.
They have proposed moving it to a new joint campus serving the north-west of the town.
It is part of a wider scheme known as a the Dumfries Learning Town project.
According to a report to Dumfries and Galloway Council's education committee, the school for secondary age pupils would be known as New Langlands School.
It would be part of a campus at Alloway Road which would also incorporate Maxwelltown High School, and Lochside and St Ninian's primaries.
Officers have recommended a formal consultation on the plan.
They said parents and staff have reacted positively to the proposal during initial informal discussions.
