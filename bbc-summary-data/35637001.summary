Fleetwood Town 2-1 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi scored what proved the winner in a Fleetwood victory that saw Gillingham's promotion hopes take a knock.

Wes Burns' corner caught a gust of wind and clipped a Gills head before flying past stranded keeper Stuart Nelson.
The hosts went 2-0 in front when Burns crossed for Ameobi to smash home his first for the club at the far post.
Luke Norris' drive reduced Gillingham's deficit, but Elliott List missed the chance to level from six yards out.
