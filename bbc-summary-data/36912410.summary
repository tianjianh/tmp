Pakistan police probing Samia Shahid's death confirm bruise on neck

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in Pakistan investigating the death of a 28-year-old British woman have confirmed a bruise was found on her neck after her death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samia Shahid's husband claims she was murdered in a so-called honour killing.
There was a 7.5in (19cm)-long mark around her neck below her right ear, police said.
Meanwhile, her first husband has been granted "pre-arrest bail" and is expected to offer himself for interview, according to police.
The move means he cannot be arrested in connection with her death, for an as yet unspecified period.
It is a common legal move in Pakistan, but does allow police interviews with the suspect to take place.
Mukhtar Kazim, her husband, believes his wife was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage.
A murder investigation is under way into the death but her family claims she died from natural causes.
Her father has been questioned in Pakistan, although he denies any wrongdoing and no arrests have been made.
An officer told the BBC the bruise is detailed in the post-mortem report but no action was initially taken because the doctor involved had not specified it as the cause of death.
Ms Shahid had grown up in Bradford before going to live with her second husband in Dubai.
Meanwhile in the UK, two people, including a relative of Ms Shahid, have been bailed over alleged threats made to MP Naz Shah.
The arrests were made after the Bradford West MP said she was looking into the death of Samia Shahid, 28.
West Yorkshire Police were questioning a 32-year-old woman, a relative of Ms Shahid, and a 37-year-old man.
