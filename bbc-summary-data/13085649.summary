[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey's Lieutenant Governor sworn in

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guernsey's Lieutenant Governor Designate was officially sworn in to office at a ceremony led by the Bailiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Air Marshal Peter Walker filled the vacancy left by Sir Fabian Malbon's departure in February.
As Lieutenant Governor of the Bailiwick he represents the Queen in the islands.
After being sworn in on Friday he fulfilled his first official engagement by inspecting a parade, which gathered outside the Royal Court.
AM Walker served as a fighter pilot and worked in a number of senior roles in both the Royal Air Force and NATO during his 32 year career in the forces.
Former Governor Sir John Coward, who served in the post from 1994 to 2000, said the role would present AM Walker with a steep learning curve and it was "daunting but very enjoyable".
