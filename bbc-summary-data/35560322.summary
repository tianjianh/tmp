The Tower Works in Holbeck, Leeds, will see 10 new buildings built including 160 homes and new offices.
The works was founded in the 1860s but closed in 1978. Four listed buildings including the three towers are to be preserved, the council said.
Work on the site near Leeds Railway Station is scheduled to begin in June.
Councillor James McKenna, said: "Above all it is important to us to see this site protected and preserved as well as securing its future and maximising its enormous potential."
It covers almost three acres (1.2 ha) of brownfield land in the Holbeck Conservation Area and is to feature a large public space and improvements to the nearby canal towpath, said the council.
The developers of the site are Carillion and building work is expected to be completed in 2020.
The works was founded by T.R Harding in 1864-66 and the towers' design was influenced by his love of Italian architecture.
The Giotto Tower, the largest of the three, is based on Giotto's Campanile in Florence, while the Verona Tower takes its design from the Torre dei Lamberti in Verona.
The Little Tower, the smallest of the three mimics a traditional Tuscan tower house.
The site's Engine House is also listed.
