[SN]TITLE[SN]
Taylor Swift thought this lookalike girl was actually her

This is the Taylor Swift lookalike that even the superstar singer thought was her.

In fact, it's actually 21-year-old student Morgan Jensen from Arizona in America.
Taylor shared photos of Morgan (and her friend Kasey) on her Tumblr with the message "lol I thought that was me".
"I am just shocked and in disbelief that Taylor Swift saw those photos of me," Morgan told Newsbeat.
"I just find that so funny 'cause she was so casual about it. I was freaking out for so long.
"I kept refreshing it and checking it on my computer and my phone again to make sure it was real before I acknowledged it and really realised what had happened."
Morgan says she's a huge fan, but she's never met Taylor.
"If I go an hour without mentioning Taylor Swift then something's probably wrong," she joked.
"I have been compared to Taylor Swift a lot because I'm tall like her and all it takes is sunglasses and red lipstick pretty much because we have the same hair colour."
The lookalike comments started mainly among friends and family - until she went to a Taylor Swift concert in Nashville in 2013.
"I was like, I might as well wear lipstick and sunglasses to see... if anyone thinks I look like her. It turned out to be a lot bigger than I ever thought it would be.
"As soon as I got to Nashville, people were stopping me to get photos on my way into the venue.
"It got to the point when I couldn't walk through the crowd 'cause so many people were trying to get photos.
"I ended up standing outside the venue for two hours taking pictures with her fans. I explained to all of them, 'I'm not Taylor' and they were like, 'Oh that's alright'."
Morgan was also offered free food by workers at a Mexican restaurant.
She says she might "dress up" (well, wear red lipstick and sunglasses) again to one of Taylor's concerts in Arizona this summer.
There have been some negative comments online about Morgan's look.
"I don't want to be Taylor Swift," Morgan responded. "I think it's cool that I sometimes can resemble her. So far none of the negative comments have got to me.
"I'll say that the haters gonna hate!"
Morgan has no ambitions to follow her idol into music though. She's studying graphic design at university and also models part-time.
"I have no musical talent," Morgan admitted. "So if I get asked to sing, it's going to be really bad. I can draw and I can paint but music is no!"
She does have one particular ambition: "I just hope that I can maybe someday meet Taylor."
