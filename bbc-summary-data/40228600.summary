Hewett will play Argentine Fernandez in Saturday's singles final.
"Shingo played well and made me really push for the win. It was a very close one and thankfully I was able to hold serve at 5-4 on both occasions," said Hewett.
"It's a great feeling to get to my first Grand Slam final. I didn't think I would get this far.
"I'm going to give it my all against Gustavo and I expect another very strong opponent."
Hewett and Reid will play French pair Stephane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer, who beat them in the final of the 2016 Rio Olympics, in the doubles final.
Elsewhere, Britain's Jordanne Whiley lost in the women's doubles semi-final alongside the Netherlands' Diede de Groot, having been knocked out of the singles on Thursday in the quarter-final.
