The system was successfully trialled at the Club World Cup in December, and is being used for this summer's Confederations Cup.
Fifa president Sepp Blatter had previously stated his commitment to bringing in goal-line technology for the tournament in Brazil.
Fifa has invited tenders to provide the system.

Blatter has pushed for goal-line technology ever since he watched Frank Lampard denied a legitimate goal in England's defeat by Germany in the 2010 World Cup.
He subsequently said "sorry" for the mistake caused by Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda failing to spot the midfielder's shot had bounced over the line.
Blatter also insisted video technology was a "necessity" after a controversial incident in England's 1-0 win over Euro 2012 opponents Ukraine helped eliminate the co-hosts. Ukraine forward Marko Devic's shot crossed England's goal-line but a goal was not awarded.
Both Goalref and Hawkeye were used at the Club World Cup and have Fifa approval.
Goalref works by using magnetic sensors to determine whether the ball crossed the line, while Hawkeye uses a number of cameras.
Two German firms are also likely to bid, with the tender expected to be awarded by early April.
A Fifa statement said: "After a successful implementation of Goal-Line Technology (GLT) at the Club World Cup in Japan in December 2012, Fifa has decided to use GLT at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
"The aim is to use GLT in order to support the match officials and to install a system in all stadia, pending the successful installation, and pre-match referee tests."
