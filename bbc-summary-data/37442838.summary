Isle of Man Election 2016: History made as five women elected to House of Keys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A record five women were elected to the Manx parliament as a new generation swept into the House of Keys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kate Beecroft said she was "delighted" to retain her Douglas South seat.
She will be joined in the lower chamber by Ann Corlett (Douglas Central), Julie Edge (Onchan), Clare Bettison (Douglas East) and Daphne Caine (Garff).
Half of the parliament's 24 members will be newcomers - the highest number since 1976 - as former infrastructure minister Phil Gawne was edged out.
Full list of results
How the dramatic night unfolded
Mrs Beecroft said: "It's been a long campaign but I don't feel tired after hearing the result. I am ready to hit the ground running."
Mrs Edge added: "I am absolutely delighted to get the chance to represent the people of Onchan and the Isle of Man. It is a brilliant day and I thank all those who have helped me to get here."
Meanwhile Ms Bettison promised to enter the House of Keys "not as an individual but as part of a team for the benefit of the Isle of Man".
Mr Gawne, an MHK since 2003, missed out by just 19 votes in the newly formed Arbory, Castletown and Malew constituency, behind Jason Moorhouse and former minister Graham Cregeen.
After learning his fate, the former farmer said he "would be back in the garden in the morning digging up spuds".
There was better news for his erstwhile government colleagues though.
Former Health Minister Howard Quayle finished second in the Middle constituency behind Bill Shimmins.
While Lawrence Skelly (economic development) and Juan Watterson (home affairs) took the Rushen seats.
Both Mr Quayle and Mr Skelly indicated they would be willing to throw their hats in the ring to become chief minister - discussions are expected to dominate the next few days.
Chief Minister Allan Bell, as well as Environment, Food and Agriculture Minister Richard Ronan and Treasury Minister Eddie Teare all announced their retirement before the general election.
Alex Allinson topped the poll in Ramsey where Mr Bell is vacating his seat after more than 30 years.
Mr Allinson received the highest number of votes for any candidate - securing the backing of nearly 3,000 voters.
John Houghton, who in May became the first MHK to ever be suspended indefinitely from Tynwald after a row over bullying, was comprehensively beaten in Douglas North.
He secured 775 votes - some way behind the successful candidates, Ralph Peake (1177) and David Ashford (1219).
Tynwald is made up of two chambers: the directly elected House of Keys (lower house) and the Legislative Council (upper house).
As well as the 24 elected MHKs, the Legislative Council has three automatically appointed members (the Bishop of Sodor and Mann, the President, and the Attorney General) plus eight other members who are elected by MHKs.
The two chambers process legislation which requires Royal Assent but sit together as Tynwald to debate policy and financial issues.
The new MHKs will be sworn in on Tuesday.
