The 27-year-old, who was part of the Germany squad that won the 2014 World Cup, has agreed a four-year deal.
"I heard about the great atmosphere and the fans, so my first impression is very good," he told the club website.
Zieler began his professional career at Manchester United, but never played a first-team game.
He was sent out loan to League One side Northampton in 2009, for whom he played two games.
