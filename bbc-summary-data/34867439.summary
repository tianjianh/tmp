Nick Rawlins, the pro-vice-chancellor of the university, called the sitting an "exceptional occasion".
Miss Blackwood said it was important for the committee to "get out of the bounds of Parliament".
She added: "I'm pleased to be in my home city of Oxford to chair this special session... and it is inspiring to be in the Divinity School which has an historic link with Parliament."
Lorraine Lindsay Gale, the council's cabinet member for cultural and community services, called the sitting "very significant".
"It will encourage young people to understand how Parliament and democracy works," she added.
