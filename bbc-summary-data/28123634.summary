Vine introduces video Loop Counts based on user views

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vine has introduced Loop Counts, a new way of recording and displaying how popular its videos are.

Vine videos automatically play over and over again and each one of these plays is called a loop.
Every time a video is looped, it adds a number on to a counter on the Vine.
The firm said: "The number, which you can see in our mobile apps and on vine.co, updates in real time, so as you watch a video, you'll know you're watching with others at the same time."
The update has been launched and is already available to users.
Vine says that Loop Counts will not affect how Popular Now is organised on its site.
As the data on looping was only tracked from 3 April, any Vines made before that date may include a "+" by the counter, to recognise the fact earlier loops will not have been recorded.
Other changes included in the latest development include a redesign of the home screen on Android and iPhone apps.
There has also been a revamp to the Vine Activity feed.
"In addition to a new separation between New and Older Activity, you'll also see a notification when your Vines surpass milestones (eg 25 or 100 likes)," said Vine.
The video sharing app is owned by the social networking organisation Twitter. A Vine can last for no longer than six seconds.
