A rug has been removed from a sheriff's office in Florida after it was noticed that it read "in dog we trust" instead of "in God we trust".

The $500 (Â£329) mat lay at the entrance to the office in Pinellas County for two months before someone noticed, a spokeswoman said.
The error was made by the rug's manufacturer and it is being replaced.
Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said they were looking at auctioning it for charity, the Tampa Bay Times reports.
There have been several offers to buy the misprinted rug .
"I'd buy or donate to a charity to get one," wrote one user on the office's Facebook page.
"I'm a great dog person and really find that a rug like that would be wonderful for my dogs to have for beds," wrote another.
The rug was put away on Wednesday after a deputy spotted the mistake.
"In God we trust" was adopted as the national motto of the US in 1956. It is also the official motto of Florida.
