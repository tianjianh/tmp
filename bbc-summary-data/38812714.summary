Randall has not featured for Wolves' first team since arriving from Swindon in January 2016, but made five EFL Trophy appearances for their Under-21s earlier this season.
The 19-year-old played in nine League One games in his time with the Robins.
"He's quick, dynamic and he'll be a good addition to the squad," Saddlers manager Jon Whitney said.
