The three partners at the Northville Family Practice in Filton are due to leave the GP surgery in January.
NHS England's Caroline Stead, said it was looking for a new team to run the practice, which serves 5,331 patients.
She said it was "committed to providing local people with high quality GP services" and would "ensure current services continue as normal".
No reason has been given for the partners' departure and the practice has yet to comment.
But NHS England said a new management team would be taking over while it looked for a "longer-term solution".
"In the short term, it will be business as usual for patients while we quickly find a new interim management team and then oversee a seamless handover to them," said Ms Stead.
"We will then be looking at talking to local people about the types of services they need for the longer term."
