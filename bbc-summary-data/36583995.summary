The three-day Summer Days Festival at Clitheroe Castle was due to start on 6 July.
Organisers said they were "heartbroken" but factors including "rising costs" and "logistical obstacles" meant they had no choice but to call it off.
All ticket holders have been promised refunds.
But the cancellation has been criticised by fans. Samantha Baysal, said on the Summer Days' Facebook page the decision was "shameful".
She called it a "very poorly organised event" and said cancelling it two weeks before the start date "just shows the calibre of people in charge".
Rose Crawshaw posted: "Just spoke to Ticketmaster. They are aware it has been cancelled, however they have to wait for formal notification from the organisers before they issue refunds."
Meanwhile, Richard Haworth from Clitheroe band Drive, who were also booked to perform, said the group was "absolutely gutted" about the news.
"This was a big spot for us Drive lads, especially being to a home crowd."
He added it was a "big blow" as it would have been "such a positive event for the town".
Summer Days said in a statement on its website: "We have looked at every angle possible to keep the event live but due to a combination of factors including rising cost and newly arisen logistical obstacles we have no choice but to call Summer Days off.
"Support for Summer Days has been both incredible and humbling and makes this decision all the harder. You have our heartfelt apologies."
