The incident took place early Sunday morning in the central province of Xaysomboun, according to state news agency Xinhua.
Chinese diplomats have asked for a probe into the incident, Xinhua said.
It comes as US Secretary of State John Kerry is in Laos in a rare visit by a US official.
The victims were found inside a vehicle, and were believed to be linked to a mining company. China is a major investor in Laos, which is rich in minerals.
Xinhua said that one of the victims was a mining company employee. Global Times quoted a Chinese embassy official as saying that the two victims were from a small private contractor supplying oil to a Laotian mine developed by Chinese companies.
The unnamed official added that a third man who was wounded was accompanying them for a visit, and that all three were friends.
The wounded man, who has been identified by his surname Zhou in Chinese media, is currently being treated in the capital of Vientiane, which is about 230km (140 miles) away from Xaysomboun.
