[SN]TITLE[SN]
Alexander McDonald 'cannot remember fatal attack'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of sexually assaulting his mother before killing her has told a court he has no memory of the attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander McDonald, 27, admits carrying out the fatal attack but denies murdering Catherine McDonald, 57, in their home in Somerset in 2014.
He told Exeter Crown Court he got drunk and took cocaine, and could remember nothing until finding himself upside down in a crashed car near Tiverton.
The defendant, of Hilly Park, Norton Fitzwarren, admits manslaughter.
The victim was strangled and stabbed with a kitchen knife, a knitting needle and scissors.
McDonald agreed he was responsible for the killing but told the jury it happened during a nine hour period of which he has no memory.
He said he got on well with his mother and had no reason to kill and sexually assault her.
He told the court: "If I knew what had happened I would be able to shine some light on it or at least know how it started and how I could do something like that.
"I have no memory. I can't say how it happened or why it happened or anything like that.
"A horrible crime was committed but there is a distinct possibility I was off in another world."
The defendant said he could not recall an exchange of sexual text messages with a gay friend before the killing, but agreed they may have left him "sexually excited".
When asked by Simon Laws, QC, if he had intended to kill his mother when he stabbed her twice through the chest, he replied: "I don't know 100 per cent. Yes. I cannot believe I would ever have formed the intent to do anything like that.
"I can't believe I would ever have come to that decision.
"It looks that way, but I would not say it was deliberate. I can't bring myself to ever believe I would do that but I agree all the evidence points to that.
"I have never struck or punched anybody in my life. I have no memory of this.
"I realise it does not sound like a great defence but it is the truth. I cannot agree with intent. I am not closing my eyes and hoping it will go away."
The trial at Exeter Crown Court continues.
