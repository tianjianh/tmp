Hanley made his debut for Blackburn aged 18 and went on to make 201 appearances, scoring nine goals.
Now 24, he has won 23 caps for Scotland since playing his first game against Wales in 2011.
"I am very pleased to bring Grant Hanley to our project to add his hard work and potential to our squad," Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez said.
"Grant is a young player with a lot of ambition to improve and keep growing with us."
Hanley, who remained at Blackburn despite relegation from the Premier League in 2012, was captain last season under Paul Lambert.
"It is a fantastic opportunity to come and play at such a big club and one that I couldn't turn down," he said.
"It is an exciting step in my career but it doesn't stop there. This is just the start and I am looking forward to helping Newcastle get back into the Premier League."
