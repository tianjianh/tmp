Ellis Downes, 16, from Harwell near Didcot, disappeared while playing in the water with friends at Culham, near Abingdon, on Saturday evening.
His sister Alex told the BBC her family had been warned to expect the worst.
"It's just a horrible waiting game," she said. "We need as many people as possible to help find him."
Ms Downes said her brother had disappeared under the water after becoming tired while trying to swim back across the river, according to the friends he was with.
"One of his friends jumped in to try and save him," she said. "Now family and friends, everyone from Facebook is out searching."
The police launched a full-scale search with boats and divers, but Ms Downes said this had now been scaled back.
She said: "That's why I'm appealing for help, because we need as many people as possible to help find him.
"[The police] are fearing the worst and thinking it might be more of a recovery of the body."
She described the circumstances of his disappearance as "strange" because "it was so out of character... he wasn't a good swimmer at all".
She added: "He was scared of deep water, so that's why it's so unbelievable for us."
Thames Valley Police has blamed "poor visibility" in the river as having "hampered" underwater searches for Ellis.
Supt Rory Freeman said: "We are seeking support from other forces for a specialist dive team to continue with the search of the river itself.
"Road closures are in place nearby to allow the search to continue and the river is closed to all boat traffic between Abingdon lock and Culham lock."
Family friend Theresa James said Ellis's mother was "absolutely devastated, his dad is heartbroken".
"Everyone's just in limbo, they can't move forward from this until he's out of the water."
Another friend of the family, Sharon Russell, said: "I'm really angry. There's no resources down here.
"I know there are cutbacksâ€¦  but there should be divers in that water."
Martin Hogan, who has helped search the river, said: "It's not on, it's all wrongâ€¦ all the friends had to chip in and hire a boat out for ourselves. It's ridiculous."
