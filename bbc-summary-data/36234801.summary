[SN]TITLE[SN]
East Stirling 0-1 Edinburgh (agg 1-2)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh City became the first club to be promoted to Scottish League Two through the pyramid system after a dramatic win over East Stirlingshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dougie Gair scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot late on after Reece Donaldson had been sent off for conceding the spot-kick.
The 2-1 aggregate score also brought to an end East Stirlingshire's 61-year tenure in senior football.
Shire will now enter the Lowland League, which Edinburgh won this term.
The home side had the better of the opening 45 minutes with Max Wright and Tommy Orr both coming close to giving East Stirling the lead but City coped well, the experienced Joe Mbu at centre-half a rock at the back for the capital club.
In the second half City came much more into the game and Mark McConnell forced a fine save from goalkeeper Darren Dolan.
With four minutes left the tie took a dramatic turn when the visitors were awarded a penalty.
Ross Allum was through on goal when he was brought down by Donaldson, who had successfully appealed against a red card in the first leg.
Referee Don Robertson immediately pointed to the spot and issued the Shire defender a straight red card.
And Gair, who scored from the spot in last week's draw, hammered the ball down the middle of the goal to spark celebrations among the City fans.
And when the full-time whistle was blown, the players and fans rejoiced as they can now look forward to senior football next season.
