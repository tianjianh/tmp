Scottish 800m record holder Lynsey Sharp is determined to add to her family's Commonwealth Games medal haul in Australia next year.

The track and field events at Gold Coast 2018 start one year today, with Sharp looking to add to the 800m silver she won at Glasgow 2014.
Her dad Cameron also had success at the Games, winning five medals over the 1978, 1982 and 1986 editions.
"The Commonwealth Games are important to the Sharp family," she said.
Lynsey's mum, then Carol Lightfoot, also competed at the 1982 Games in Brisbane.
"You don't get all that many chances in your career to compete for Scotland in athletics - and having grown up with my dad winning five Commonwealth medals and my mum also having run for Scotland at the Commonwealths, then it is important to me," Lynsey added.
"It is nice to be in a Scotland team every so often, rather than part of a GB and NI one, and be with all these Scots who have been performing so well. Australia is quite attractive an idea, too."
Next year is set to be a busy one for Sharp, with the world indoor championships, the Commonwealth Games and the European Championships coming up.
But the 26-year-old is relaxed about her schedule.
"I'm very much committed to competing for Scotland at Gold Coast 2018," Sharp said.
"I don't see huge issues over the timing. I don't see Europeans (summer 2018) as any more important than the Commonwealths; it worked really well in 2014 when they were very close together and we went straight from Glasgow to Zurich. But I think it can work in 2018, too, with a bit of a gap."
Sharp says 2014 was a career-highlight year, with her silver medal-winning performance in Glasgow coming before she won gold at the European Championships in Zurich.
"The 2014 season was the most fun I've ever had - with Hampden and then the Europeans in Zurich pretty close together," Sharp added. "So I am really looking forward to having that again in 2018.
"Hampden will always mean so much to me and hold a lot of memories. There's been a lot of talk recently about how poor it is as a football stadium but as an athletics stadium it was brilliant."
