Tributes were paid to the late Cameroon international Patrick Ekeng at Tuesday's Romanian Cup final but his Dinamo Bucharest side lost to CFR Cluj.

Ekeng died aged 26 after collapsing on the pitch during a Dinamo match earlier this month.
There was a minute's silence before kick-off and the game was halted in the 14th minute in memory of Ekeng, who wore the number 14 shirt at the club.
Cluj won 5-4 on penalties after the game ended 2-2 following extra time.
Ekeng suffered a suspected heart attack shortly after coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute in a match against Viitorul Constanta on 6 May. He was pronounced dead two hours later.
Dinamo had said that they would honour Ekeng's memory by sending the trophy to his family in Cameroon if they had won it but despite taking a 2-0 lead it was not to be.
Spanish midfielder Juan Carlos converted the decisive spot-kick to win a fourth Romanian Cup for Cluj, who finished eighth in the domestic championship.
French striker Harlem Gnohere opened the scoring for Dinamo from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute before turning provider when he crossed for Eric Bicfalvi to head home 13 minutes later.
After scoring the goals, Gnohere and Bicfalvi ran to the touchline and lifted a shirt with Ekeng's name and number on it to the delight of Dinamo fans, who threw up large choreographed displays in memory of the Cameroon international.
Cluj reduced the deficit two minutes after the break when Juan Carlos gave keeper Vytautas Cerniauskas no chance with a powerful long-range shot.
The Railwaymen pressed forward and their Portuguese captain Camora hit the cross bar with a free-kick midway through the second half.
They were finally rewarded for their persistence a minute before the end of normal time when Spanish striker Cristian Lopez made it 2-2 with a header from Vitor Bruno's free-kick.
Neither side could find a winner in 30 minutes of extra-time and it was left to Carlos to score the crucial spot kick in the penalty shoot-out.
