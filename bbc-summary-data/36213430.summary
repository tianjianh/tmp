Barbarians v Fiji: Baa-Baas to play in Belfast for first time in 59 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Barbarians will play in Belfast for the first time in 59 years when they face Fiji at Ulster's Kingspan Stadium on 11 November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game will be part of the Barbarians' autumn tour, which also includes a match against South Africa at Wembley six days earlier.
The only time the Baa-Baas had played in Belfast before was a match against an Ulster Invitation team in 1957.
Robbie Deans and Will Greenwood will coach the Barbarians squad.
Ulster chief executive Shane Logan said the high-profile game would give Northern Ireland rugby fans an opportunity to see some of the world's best players in action.
The Kingspan Stadium will host the final of the 2017 Women's World Cup being played in August of that year.
