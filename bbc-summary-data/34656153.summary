Unite union says NI Executive needs to borrow more money

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland Executive needs to borrow more money to boost the economy, according to proposals from Britain's biggest union.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suggestion is in a discussion document launched at Stormont by Unite.
It says the Executive has "considerable unused borrowing powers" of about Â£1.2bn that could be used to fund a public sector investment programme.
The document also calls on London "to provide special support for Northern Ireland."
Unite's Ireland secretary Jimmy Kelly said: "Unite recognises that the NI Executive is facing significant budgetary constraints as a result of Conservative austerity cuts.
"But there are always choices. We want to start a dialogue about those choices."
Other proposals in the document which is entitled Growing the Economy & Living Standards are:
Unite said its ideas are "realistic and realisable", but it warned against "brutal cuts to the public sector" as a way of rebalancing the Northern Ireland economy.
"Our paper identifies some options for a more proactive approach to growing the economy," Mr Kelly said.
"The Executive needs to investigate options to invest to grow a high-value added, outward looking, export-oriented economy based on a strong manufacturing sector, a robust skills-base and world-class infrastructure."
