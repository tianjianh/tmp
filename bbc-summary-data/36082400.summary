[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Surridge, 20, of Farnham, was described by his family as "someone who always had a smile on his face".
He suffered fatal injuries on the northbound carriageway of the A3 near Guildford cathedral on Thursday.
His family said in a statement: "Sam was a larger than life character and lived life to the full.
"He was bike mad, loved everything about bikes and was studying motorcycle mechanics at college.
"Sam was close to his sisters and his family and had a tight-knit group of friends that he used to go jamming with - he loved his music."
The road was closed northbound and partially closed southbound for about five hours while emergency services, including an air ambulance, dealt with the crash.
Surrey Police has appealed for witnesses.
