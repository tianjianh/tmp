Fans are angry with Fawaz Al Hasawi over his running of the club and a failed takeover talks with a US-based consortium led by John Jay Moores.
Collymore, who played for the Reds between 1993 and 1995, said he had come to get answers for the Forest fans.
Mr Al Hasawi, a Kuwaiti businessman, insisted he was dedicated to the success of the club.
Mr Collymore was at the City Ground car-park with hundreds of fans, who want "Fawaz out" ahead of the game against Bristol City.
He told BBC Radio Nottingham: "I'm not here today to say Fawaz out, Fawaz in.
"I'm here as a former player of the club... to actually have a meeting... and get these people [fans] answers."
Mr Al Hasawi took over at the City Ground in 2012.
During his time as owner and chairman Forest have been under a transfer embargo twice and faced several winding-up petitions.
The team are currently facing a relegation battle without a full-time manager after Philippe Montanier was sacked on 14 January.
Mr Al Hasawi was due to sell the club to Mr Moores, but talks broke down.
Mr Al Hasawi said he was committed to securing Nottingham Forest's "long-term position as a thriving and successful club".
In a statement, he said: "I want to assure fans I remain as devoted as ever to this great club."
