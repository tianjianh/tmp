[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen councillors to discuss controversial cycle path work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen City Council's decision to carry out repairs to a cycle path without the correct permission will be discussed by councillors next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A report will be brought before the first meeting of the council's communities, housing and infrastructure committee on Wednesday.
Repairs to the Wellington Brae path, costing about Â£200,000, have been suspended for an investigation.
The land belongs to the father of former councillor Willie Young.
Mr Young, the city's former finance convener, lost his seat at the local government elections.
The council admitted a "serious failing" after the repairs were ordered without proper approval.
The work involved a boundary wall on Wellington Brae in the Ferryhill area.
The project was to have been fully funded by cycling charity Sustrans. It awarded just over Â£21,000 for preliminary work, with the full funding to be paid when the work was completed.
