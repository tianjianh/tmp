[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paige Chivers murder accused 'tested the water'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The alleged murderer of a teenage girl was told by police to contact social services when he sought advice about what to do with the "problem child" up to two weeks before he killed her, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Ewing, 60, is accused of killing 15-year-old Paige Chivers, who went missing in Blackpool in 2007.
Preston Crown Court has heard he rang police anonymously to say a girl had turned up on his doorstep.
Mr Ewing denies murder.
It is said that Mr Ewing, of All Hallows Road, Bispham, was "testing the water" to discover what the official reaction would be to Paige turning up on his doorstep after she had been thrown out of her home by her father.
Later that month in August 2007, Mr Ewing is alleged to have murdered Paige at his flat before he disposed of the youngster's body, which has still not been found.
The court heard the defendant told a police operator that a 15-year-old girl who he "vaguely knew" had come to his house following a family row.
He said he let her in before later sending her home but was concerned he had "left her in limbo" and wanted to know what he should do next.
During the recording, which was played to the jury, he said: "She's permanently excluded from school. She's a problem child. Drinks, smokes ...you name it she does it."
Mr Ewing revealed he knew her full name but was not asked to disclose either his or her name.
After adding he did not know her address, the operator advises him to ring social services.
Co-defendant Gareth Dewhurst, 46, of Duncan Avenue, Blackpool, has pleaded not guilty to a serious sexual act, assisting an offender in disposing a body and intending to pervert the course of public justice.
Mr Ewing also denies intending to pervert the course of public justice.
The trial continues.
