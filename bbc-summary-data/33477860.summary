'Staggeringly high' rates of autism mate crime in Wirral, report finds

More than 80% of people aged 16-25 with autism or Asperger's in Wirral have been victims of so-called mate crime, a report has found.

Wirral Autistic Society said the number young people who had suffered from mate crime was "staggeringly high".
Victims of this type of crime - by people who claim to be friends - suffer verbal and physical abuse and theft.
The survey, carried out earlier this year, collated 141 responses, which were all submitted anonymously.
In 2014, a survey by the National Autistic Society found 49% of adults with autism said they had been abused by someone they thought of as a friend.
The Wirral report found 85% of over-16s felt "lonely and left out" and all respondents said they had difficulty "distinguishing friends from those who bully or abuse."
Steve Vasey, manager of the society's Rainbow Resource Centre in Birkenhead, said: "It can range from setting someone up to take something from a shop right through to sexual abuse and posting online images."
He added previous research was with over 18s and there was "a significant spike" around the 16 to 25-year-old age range, as this was the age at which most people formed relationships outside school.
A parent of one victim surveyed said: "My daughter was diagnosed at the age of 14 with Asperger's but she has been bullied all her life from reception onwards.
"When she was older, her Â£100 iPod disappeared then her Blackberry disappeared and she was always asking for money for one thing and another."
Robin Bush, the society's chief executive, said: "Perpetrators of mate crime prey on the most vulnerable people in society and do so in the knowledge these crimes often go unreported.
"It is morally reprehensible and they are cowards."
