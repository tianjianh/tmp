The Chicago Cubs set up a World Series decider against the Cleveland Indians with a 9-3 win to level the best-of-seven series at 3-3.

The Cubs, who had trailed 3-1 overall, will now bid for their first World Series title in 108 years on Wednesday in Cleveland.
The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948.
"It's just correct and apt that we'd go seven games," said Chicago manager Joe Maddon.
The Cubs laid the platform for the victory with three runs in the first inning.
Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta went on to win his second game of the series while 22-year-old shortstop Addison Russell smashed a grand slam on his way to a World Series record-tying six runs batted in.
Kris Bryant had four hits and Anthony Rizzo also homered for Chicago, who had 13 hits off six Indians pitchers.
For the decider, Cleveland pitcher Corey Kluber, who won the opener and then game four on short rest, will take the mound for the third time in eight days against Chicago's Kyle Hendricks in a battle of right-handers, neither of whom have ever pitched in a game seven before.
