Lots of you have been in touch with us to ask questions about the attack, so we asked our reporter Leah to help answer some of them...
If you're upset by anything in the news take a look at the advice here.
Leah: I grew up in London and I was in the capital after the 7/7 bombings - I quickly realised that the capital and its people are resilient.  Today, adults will have gone back to work as normal - using the usual transport network they always did. And children will be back at school. There's also a huge Police presence not just around London but across the UK.
Leah: There's an on-going Police investigation and security forces will be working really hard to find out everything they can about the attacker and why he carried this out. police say he was British born and influenced by international terrorism.
Leah: London is the capital of the UK and Westminster is a really important place and sometimes a target for attacks.  But London has some of the best security in place to try to stop things like this happening.
Leah: The attacker tried to get into the Houses of Parliament and the police were trying to protect the people who work there.
Leah: It's perfectly normal to feel upset or even worried when something like this happens. It's really important to talk to friends, teachers or family members about how you're feeling. Always remember that attacks like this are rare and the people who were affected will be getting all the help they need to recover from what's happened.

Leah: Police were very quick to arrive on the scene and many different officers have been involved from transport police to counter-terrorism officers. The Metropolitan police say that there are police officers on duty 24 hours a day around the Palace of Westminster, and the area around that is also patrolled by police at all times.
