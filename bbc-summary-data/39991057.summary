Hopes have been raised for the well-being of an orphaned lamb and collie dog who went missing together, after clues were picked up by search parties.

Lamb Bella and her "beloved" companion Blake disappeared on 8 May from a home near Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire.
Owner Natalie Haywood says trackers have found scents and droppings in the area.
Cameras have been installed, and food including garlic chicken dropped to try to find the pair.
Mrs Haywood said trackers were considering "different trapping methods" if they were spotted.
Bella, seven weeks old, and Blake, one, went missing from a yard outside Mrs Haywood's home.
It was originally believed they may have been stolen, but recent clues found by searchers mean the pair are probably in the area, she said.
She said roast chicken cooked in garlic water had been left for Blake. About three days later some droppings were found that smelled of garlic.
Eight cameras have been set up in four locations.
Paula Strudley of FindUKDogs, co-ordinating a Facebook search page, said she was convinced they would eventually be found.
"We have found footprints and fur and droppings. We know Blake is about - we know that," she said.
One of the tracking dogs, Wispa, also reacted strongly to some scents.
Mrs Haywood added: "I trust the dogs. The dogs say they've got fresh scent, saying they're still out there."
A Â£1,000 reward for their recovery has been offered by ITV presenter Philip Schofield. Thousands of people have joined a Facebook group set up to find the pets, and many have joined the searches.
