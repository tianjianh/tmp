Highways England said the thefts, linked to electronic signs on the M5, M6 and M42, cost it ??400,000.
Michael Jensen, Jamie Thompson and Michael Thorpe-Farrell pleaded guilty to joint enterprise theft and joint enterprise criminal damage at Birmingham Crown Court.
They stole more than 1.2 miles (2 km) of cable between April and June 2014.
Jensen, 28, of Hurley Grove, Kingshurst, and Thompson, 28, of Barle Grove, Birmingham, were sentenced to three-and-a-half years.
Thorpe-Farrell, 27, of Doncaster Road, Bromford, was jailed for three years.
Det Insp Anthony Jones, of British Transport Police (BTP), the men had travelled around the West Midlands and Warwickshire stealing cable mainly from the M42, between J1 and J3a.
"Our investigation also unearthed significant forensic evidence tying each of the men to the crime scenes as well as mobile phone data which confirmed this was an organised and complex conspiracy to steal."
