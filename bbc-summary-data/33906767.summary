More than 10,000 people are expected to attend Dare ProtoPlay over the next four days.
This year's event was opened by gaming world superstar Chipzel, who uses handheld video consoles to create dance music.
The annual Dare ProtoPlay festival is held as the finale of Abertay University's Dare to be Digital game design competition.
During the event, 16 teams of students from around the world will unveil games they have created. Three of the teams will be put forward as nominees for the BAFTA Ones to Watch Award.
Prof Gregor White, head of the School of Arts, Media and Computer Games at Abertay University, said: "Inspiring young people is one very important aspect of Dare ProtoPlay, as we want children and parents to see that games are about art, creativity and design.
"The festival will show traditional digital games, but we've also got the Cardboard Challenge and Killer Queen Arcade Field Game which take game design ideas out into the real world.
"We're looking forward to another busy four days as thousands of people come to Dundee to play games, have fun and even be inspired to try making their own games."
Dare ProtoPlay runs until Sunday in Dundee's Caird Hall and City Square.
Dundee is home to dozens of video game companies and is considered a hub of the industry in the UK, with classic titles including Lemmings and Grand Theft Auto having been developed in the city.
