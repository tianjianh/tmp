[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public Health England (PHE) said a child died from suspected meningococcal infection. No further details about the death have been released.
A spokesman said people who had been in "close contact" were being identified and offered antibiotics to reduce the risk of further cases.
The risk of it spreading to other people is said to be "extremely low".
Dr Toyin Ejidokun, from the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire Public Health England Centre, said: "We are sad to hear about the death of a child from suspected meningococcal infection and wish to reassure parents that all necessary contact tracing and control procedures are being undertaken.
"Children who have attended the same class or have spent a short amount of time with the child are not classified as close contacts.
"PHE wish to reassure all concerned that apart from the very close contacts who are due to receive antibiotics, there is no need for a wider group of children to take antibiotics."
Dr Ayoola Oyinloye, from Swindon Borough Council, said: "It is important to emphasise that the risk of this suspected case spreading to others is extremely low.
"We reassure people, particularly parents who may be feeling concerned, that all necessary actions are being taken to protect the public."
Symptoms to look out for include vomiting, severe headache, a stiff neck, an unexplained temperature rise, dislike of bright light, a non-blanching rash, drowsiness and altered levels of consciousness.
