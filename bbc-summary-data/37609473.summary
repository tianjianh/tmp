Twelve finalists for the Woman's Hour Craft Prize will have their work exhibited at London's V&A Museum, with a planned touring exhibition to follow.
The winner, to be announced in November 2017, will be awarded Â£10,000.
Woman's Hour editor Alice Feinstein said the show wanted to highlight "exceptional craft makers".
She added: "We plan to support innovation, explore the history and variety of crafting practices and, of course, to celebrate the everyday creativity of our listeners.
"We are delighted to be working with The Crafts Council and the V&A to run a prize in 2017."
Presenters Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey announced the new prize during the 70th anniversary edition of the show on Monday.
Work in ceramics, metal, textiles, jewellery, glass and wood will be among those considered by the judges.
Bill Sherman, director of collections and research at the V&A, said craft had "always been at the core of the V&A's purpose".
He added: "There is currently an immense fascination with materiality and process in art, which chimes with the values of craft, and the idea of making holds huge popular appeal."
Crafts Council executive director Rosy Greenlees said British craftsmanship was "revered around the world".
She added: "It is incredibly timely to be launching this prestigious new Woman's Hour Craft Prize to recognise the creativity and calibre of British craft."
