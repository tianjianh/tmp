Playboy: Are no nudes good news?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Playboy magazine has announced it is to stop publishing pictures of fully naked women.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company's management team says the internet means that pornographic magazines are no longer commercially viable. Playboy's circulation has fallen dramatically from its peak in the mid-1970s.
We have been asking what you think of this change; on Twitter, on Facebook and on our story. Many of you think it is a most welcome move and might even help encourage a more respectful portrayal of women in the media.
Others think it is simply a smart marketing choice.
Some, rather wistfully, see it as the "end of an era".
Other people say that without the nudity, it is the beginning of the end of Playboy.
However, many others are pointing out that if you want to see naked people, you can just go online.
As Playboy's chief executive Scott Flanders put it: "You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free."
Quite.
Maybe there is a bigger problem. Is the magazine itself outdated as a form of media?
Playboy's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in the 1970s to the current 800,000.
Finally, some people are simply very happy that a certain well-known trope will now be true.
