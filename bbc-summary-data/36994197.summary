[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 1-1 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain James Coppinger's superb second-half strike earned Doncaster a draw with Crawley Town and their first point of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers were poor before the break and trailed to James Collins' 26th-minute tap-in.
Coppinger rescued a point for his side when he twisted to fire home Matty Blair's corner in the 49th minute.
Crawley started on the front foot and deservedly went ahead when Collins tapped home Jason Banton's cross.
Coppinger fired a free-kick just wide for a disjointed home side, while Rovers' Tommy Rowe saw a goalbound effort from close range blocked.
The visitors offered more of a threat and Banton saw an effort deflected just wide, while Enzio Boldewijn struck a shot onto the roof of the net from the angle of the box.
Coppinger gave the home side a much-needed confidence boost when he met Blair's corner from the right with a superb first-time finish from the edge of the box. Rovers pressed for a winner and went close through Blair, John Marquis and Andy Williams.
