Mr Jones, 61, who died on Friday at Dunkeswell Aerodrome in Honiton, was the head of chemistry at Wellington School.
Headmaster Henry Price said he was a "fine schoolmaster and a well-respected colleague".
Mr Jones' death is not being treated as suspicious.
Wellington School is an independent day and boarding school for pupils aged three to 18.
Mr Price said the "community is deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic death" and "our thoughts are with Chris' wife Liz, their three children and all of his family and friends".
He added: "Chris had worked at Wellington for 13 years and was deeply committed to his teaching of chemistry as well as serving the boarding community and much more."
Mr Jones was from the Pontyclun area of south Wales.
The British Parachute Association (BPA) has opened an investigation into the incident.
A spokesperson for Dunkeswell Aerodrome said: "The British Parachute Association board of inquiry will investigate the accident and, when completed, will submit reports to the coroner, the police, the Civil Aviation Authority, the BPA and any other relevant authorities."
