Wales football manager Chris Coleman is to receive an honorary degree from Swansea University.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coleman, 46, who is from the city, was recently appointed an OBE after guiding Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 - its first major tournament in 58 years.
He will receive the accolade at a congregation for the College of Human and Health Sciences on Wednesday.
His is one of six such degrees to be presented at the Bay Campus' Great Hall this week.
Swansea University's honorary degree awards are made annually to recognise those who have made outstanding contributions to the university, region and Wales.
It will present an honorary master of science (MSc) award to Ospreys rugby club chairman Roger Blyth on Monday, before a doctorate in science is handed to the vice-chancellor of the Universiti Malaysia Terengganu in Kuala Lumpur, Prof Dato Dr Nor Aieni Haji Mokhtar.
Former Labour AM Gwenda Thomas will receive a doctor of letters award on Tuesday, with former Plaid Cymru AM Helen Mary Jones getting the same honour.
On Wednesday, Peter Vaughan, chief constable of South Wales Police, will be given a doctor of science award before Mr Coleman receives his MSc.
Coleman, whose side was knocked out by ultimate Euro 2016 winners Portugal, was granted the freedom of Swansea in October.
