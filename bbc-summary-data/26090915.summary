The man - a Portuguese national - was hit in the head while dismantling a crane outside the stadium in the northern city of Manaus.
He is the third worker to die in an accident at the building site.
England and Italy are due to play their opening World Cup match at the Arena da Amazonia.
The city's World Cup secretary, Miguel Capobiango, said the crane was being taken apart as work at the site was almost complete.
The construction worker was taken to hospital but died a few hours later.
He was identified by the Brazilian Sports Ministry as 55-year-old Antonio Jose Pita Martins.
Mr Capobiango said the accident was being investigated and will not cause further delays to the construction work in Manaus.
The stadium is due to be finished later this month, says the BBC's Julia Carneiro.
In December, a court suspended construction after a man working on the stadium's roof plunged more than 30m (100ft) to his death.
Another worker had died at the venue in March 2013.
The authorities said working conditions were "unacceptably dangerous".
Work eventually resumed after building company Andrade Gutierrez presented a safety report that satisfied the authorities.
Five of the 12 stadiums being used in the World Cup are still under construction, including the venue where the opening match is due to be played in Sao Paulo, on 12 June.
Six workers have died in preparations for the tournament.
