They are to be brought in after the United Nations warned booster seats without backs are not safe for smaller children because they do not protect against side-on collisions.
Data obtained by the price comparison website Confused.com suggest that only 13% of parents understood the new rules.

Parents can continue to use their current model after the rule change and will not need to buy a new one for children weighing more than 15kg.
