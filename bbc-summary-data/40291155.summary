[SN]TITLE[SN]
Premier Division: Bray Wanderers 3-2 Derry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City fell to their first defeat in 11 matches when they were beaten 3-2 away by Bray Wanderers who replace them in third place in the Premier Division.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bray, without a win in five, took a sixth-minute lead through Darragh Noone but Derry levelled on 22 minutes when Ronan Curtis went through to score.
Ryan Brennan headed Wanderers 2-1 up just before half-time.
Derry equalised again through Nathan Boyle early in the second half but Tom Clancy bundled in a late winner.
Clancy had scored the winner when Bray won away to Derry earlier in the season by the same 3-2 scoreline.
It was a huge disappointment for Derry as they had looked destined to get at least a point.
They recovered from that early Noone goal to level through Republic of Ireland Under-21 player Curtis who went on to beat home keeper Peter Cherrie after a superb pass by Nicky Low.
City will be disappointed with the marking which allowed Brennan the chance to head in Bray's second from Gary McCabe's free-kick delivery.
Derry levelled again when Aaron McEneff's pass found Boyle who turned to shoot low into the corner.
The visitors were undone by a set piece for a second time when substitute Clancy forced the ball in after a corner with nine minutes left.
The defeat sees Derry slip two places to fifth as Shamrock Rovers also moved above them by winning away to Finn Harps.
