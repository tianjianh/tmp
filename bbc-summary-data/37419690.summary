The film is the third in the Bridget Jones series and the first since 2004's The Edge of Reason.
Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth have both reprised their roles in the movie, which has received warm reviews.
Over the weekend, the film took more than eight times its nearest competitor, Blair Witch, which debuted in second place with £959,000.
The horror film is also the third in its franchise, following 1999's The Blair Witch Project and 2000's Book of Shadows: Blair Witch.
The Beatles: Eight Days A Week, a documentary following the early days of the band, entered at number three after taking £655,000.
Last week's number one, Sausage Party, dropped to number four while Kubo and the Two Strings rounded off the top five.
Further down the chart, The Infiltrator, starring Bryan Cranston, entered at number nine with £370,000.
