Jesus, 19, scored on his first two league starts for City but lasted just 14 minutes at Vitality Stadium after appearing to turn his ankle.
City will find out the extent of the problem on Tuesday.
"Hopefully it won't be for a long time," City boss Pep Guardiola told the BBC. "We will have to wait."
Jesus, who arrived from Palmeiras in January, scored in wins over West Ham and Swansea and was looking to become only the third City player - after Emmanuel Adebayor and Kevin de Bruyne - to find the net on each of his first three Premier League starts for the club.
However, the injury meant the Brazil international was replaced by Sergio Aguero - the third straight game in which the Argentina striker had been left on the bench by Guardiola.
The Spaniard said: "Sergio played good. He fought and scored a goal for his confidence and I am so happy for him. He was important before the game and is still important."
Aguero's 'goal' was officially recorded as a Tyrone Mings own goal after the forward's effort was deflected in by the Bournemouth defender.
Raheem Sterling's first-half opener and Mings' own goal after the break meant City extended their unbeaten run to five games in all competitions and moved up to second in the table, eight points behind Chelsea.
Asked if they can win the title, Guardiola said: "It's so difficult. Chelsea have to lose three games and we have to win all the games. You know how difficult it is to win games in the Premier League.
"We will take it game by game. Now we are second but the gap to third, fourth, fifth and sixth is nothing. The gap to Chelsea is still massive. Game by game, we have to improve."

"I don't think City can catch Chelsea. It's too big a gap with Chelsea performing as they have done, but it was a comfortable performance - they are brilliant going forward.
"I thought (defender) John Stones was outstanding and (midfielder) David Silva majestic.
"Since being thrashed 4-0 by Everton in January they have responded superbly. Things are coming together for City at the right time."
Bournemouth had injury concerns of their own as midfielder Jack Wilshere and defender Simon Francis both limped off in the first half.
Earlier this month, the Cherries, who have now won just one of their past nine league games, lost striker Callum Wilson to a season-ending knee injury.
"Jack was just feeling his ankle," said boss Eddie Howe. "I don't think there's a major injury there but he couldn't move freely and there was pain in his ankle, so we took him off.
"We will wait and see on Simon - he is feeling his hamstring again. He went to make a pass and felt it, as he had last time [at Everton]."
