[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford eased their relegation fears and ended a four-match losing run with victory at a poor Nottingham Forest.

After a drab first half the Bees went ahead when Lasse Vibe pounced on an awful mix-up between Kelvin Wilson and keeper Dorus De Vries to poke in.
Nico Yennaris smashed home from Jake Bidwell's corner before Sergi Canos swept in a fine first-time shot.
Forest's misery was compounded when Eric Lichaj was sent off after picking up two yellow cards in four minutes.
Brentford had collected just seven points in 2016 before kick-off - the lowest tally in the Championship - but maintained their good recent record at the City Ground with a third win in four visits.
Forest captain Henri Lansbury's return as a second half substitute, after almost three months out with a knee ligament injury, provided the only cheer on a miserable afternoon for the hosts.
The Reds rarely threatened and have now failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches, with just two goals in their last seven home games.
The win moved Brentford nine points clear of the bottom three and up a place to 17th, level on points with Forest who dropped to 16th.
Nottingham Forest manager Paul Williams:
"I am really disappointed with the performance and the reaction to the fans to that performance is entirely valid.
"We did not put them under pressure. We did not get in their faces. I would not say I feel let down. They are human beings like everyone else.
"I will be looking for a reaction from this side, because that is the least the fans deserve. Can I explain it? Not really. We were second best from minute one. I thought Brentford were here for the taking and we had told the players that.
"I really do apologise to the fans for that performance. I will have a look at our preparation and see if it was too much and we will look at how we prepare for the next game now."
Brentford boss Dean Smith:

"Every win is a big win and our previous performances had merited far more than we had got. I thought it was a deserved win.
"We were defensively organised and allowed them very few chances - and Forest got very frustrated because of that.
"We capitalised on their indecision at the back, we got the first goal and that gave us renewed confidence after that.
"We have been on a bad run and they want to put that right. That was the kind of character we were always going to need."
