NI21's only councillor Johnny McCarthy quits party

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NI21's only councillor has said he has quit the party.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Johnny McCarthy, who sits on Lisburn and Castlereagh Council, said he made the decision "after a long period of consideration".
He added: "I feel I can work better outside of the party."
His departure leaves party leader Basil McCrea as NI21's last remaining elected representative, although he won his seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly on an Ulster Unionist Party ticket.
Mr McCarthy was the only member of NI21 to be elected since the party was formed in 2013, winning his seat at the 2014 council election.
He said he regretted having to make the decision, but it was "the right thing for me to do".
"Some people may wonder why I have stayed as long as I did," he added.
"It is because I fully believed in the idea of NI21 and the need for a party that is non-sectarian and promotes the use of evidence to create policy and not ideology."
Mr McCarthy's announcement is the latest blow to the party, set up by Mr McCrea and another former Ulster Unionist, John McCallister, in its short history.
The party's executive split bitterly on the eve of the council and European elections in May 2014.
Tina McKenzie, NI21's initial chairperson, quit after standing in that European election, with Mr McCallister leaving less than two months later.
