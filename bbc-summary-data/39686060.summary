Cookstown will have a second chance to go up when they meet UCD in a further play-off to decide the final place in the national league next Sunday.
Fergus Gibson and Craig Getty netted to put Annadale 2-0 up and after Ryan Millar's reply, Oli Brown made it 3-1.
Ireland star Peter Caruth set up two of Annadale's goals in Dublin.
Annadale went ahead in the 31st minute when Gibson converted a rebound after Caruth's initial shot had been saved.
Caruth was again the provider as Craig Getty made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time.
Ryan Millar pulled one back two minutes after the break but Oli Brown's 48th minute insurance goal clinched Annadale's promotion after they were relegated last season.
In the women's round-robin event, Lurgan finished runners-up and will now face Belfast Harlequins in a further play-off next Sunday to determine which team holds down the last available place in the national league next season.
Lurgan needed a draw between Trinity and Old Alex in the final game to secure an automatic place in the top flight but the students beat their local rivals 2-0 to earn promotion.
Earlier in the day Carly Johnston scored both goals for the Ulster champions in 1-1 draws with UCC and Old Alex.
