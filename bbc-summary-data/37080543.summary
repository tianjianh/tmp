However, Pat McCormack lost his light-heavyweight fight by split decision to Cuba's number two seed Yasnier Toledo.
In Rio to watch the next generation of boxers is retired former five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr.
He has spoken to Buatsi, who says the 39-year-old told him he has what it takes to go to the top.
"He said to me he had heard about me before I got here and that I was a great fighter, a future world champion," said Buatsi.
"It was good to hear that from someone like Mayweather, who I think is the greatest boxer of our generation.
"I want to dominate in every way I can, and I want more than bronze. I will give it everything that I've got to make sure I get a gold."
