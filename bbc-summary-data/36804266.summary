Doug Wilson took up his role covering Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders in April.
He said he believed the area could offer "something for everyone".
He highlighted a string of attractions including outdoor pursuits, festivals, food and drink and the common riding events.
Mr Wilson lives in the Borders but his role as regional director also covers the neighbouring region of Dumfries and Galloway.
He said he was looking forward to seeing some of the world's best cyclists in Castle Douglas in September.
He described the Tour of Britain as a "fantastic opportunity to showcase the impressive scenery and warm spirit of the region's people on a global stage".
The Borders Railway has already had a huge impact on the region and Mr Wilson said he expected its importance to grow further.
"The number of people travelling on the Borders Railway has surpassed all expectations," he said.
"As we hit the summer months we hope to see the numbers rising again.
"The last year has been incredible for the region with the launch of the Borders Railway which has opened up the region to the global market."
He listed a string of other attractions the area had to offer including:
He added that the area was "full of hidden gems" but said it was time to "share them with the rest of the world".
