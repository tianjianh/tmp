[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ofsted reports on 21 Birmingham schools - full list

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ofsted has carried out inspections of 21 schools, following claims in an anonymous letter that hardline Muslims were trying to impose their view on a group of schools in Birmingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five of the schools - including three academies from the Park View Educational Trust - are being placed in special measures. A sixth school was already in special measures for its poor educational standards.
This table shows the results of the new Ofsted inspection reports and the previous grade where appropriate.
