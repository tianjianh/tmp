One in every 6,500 babies has severe mitochondrial disease.
"They did warn us she may not reach her toddler years," her mother Victoria Holliday said.
She and partner Keith Newell want more children but are unwilling to risk another child suffering in the same way as Jessica.
"It's not fair that if there's a scientific technique out there that could stop this happening in the future that we're not using it," Victoria said.
