The 20-year old, who only agreed a one-year deal in May, follows the lead of winger Kieron Morris in rapidly extending his existing contract.
His new deal also includes the option of a further year in the club's favour.
"I'm more confident in my ability than I ever have been. It's not arrogance. I know I can go out there and do my thing now," said Sierra Leone-born Bakayoko.
He has made 15 appearances this season, hitting a hat-trick against Grimsby Town in the EFL Trophy in October before scoring against Shrewsbury Town on his full league debut.
"We're really pleased with Ama," said Walsall boss Jon Whitney. "He's a player who has always had great potential but he's now shown he's got the right work ethic and application to develop into a real asset.
"I went to see him a few times when he was on loan with Worcester City and he really stood out. He looked like a player who was a level above and he's taken those attributes into the first team."
