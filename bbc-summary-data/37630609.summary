Many analysts think Sony's kit will outsell rival headsets from HTC and Facebook's Oculus division because of its lower price and the fact that more than 43 million PS4 consoles have been shipped.
Even so, they add, it is likely to remain a niche product for some time to come.
Strategy Analytics forecasts that only 3% of Brits will own a VR headset this year and the PlayStation model will account for just 7% of that number. The bulk, it says, will instead own more basic "shells" into which they can slot a smartphone.
BBC Click's Marc Cieslak put the PS VR to the test and had reservations of his own.
