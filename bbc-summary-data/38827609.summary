Eastleigh chairman Donald has joined the committee of supporters trust OxVox, who want to buy the ground from ex-Oxford owner Firoz Kassam.
"The deal isn't a million miles away," Donald told BBC Radio Oxford.
"There's a real opportunity and desire, and I'm certain it's the best opportunity we will get."
OxVox, Kassam and Oxford City Council have been in negotiations over the 12,500-capacity stadium since October.
Oxford United's board of directors admitted their "dismay" earlier this month about the slow progress of talks.
"The reality is, it's not a straightforward deal," Donald said. "There's a few parties to put together.
"There needs to be a little bit of help and a little bit of thought or maybe just a bit of finance to get the thing over the line."
