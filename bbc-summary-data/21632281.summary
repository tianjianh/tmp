Giggs became the fourth outfield player to play in the Premier League at the age of 40, joining:
As Ryan Giggs begins life as a retired footballer he can reflect on an extraordinary career spanning more than 1,000 games and 150 goals over 22 long seasons.
The Premier League did not exist when he made his debut for Manchester United. John Major was prime minister, Bart Simpson was number one in the charts, the Birmingham Six were still in jail and Kevin Costner was about to clean up at the Oscars with Dances With Wolves.
As well as making 963 senior appearances for United, he won 64 full international caps for Wales, and a further four captaining Great Britain in last year's London Olympics.
BBC Sport takes a look at the key statistics and memorable moments of his career.
17 - Giggs was offered his first professional contract with Manchester United on his 17th birthday on 29 November, 1990.

632 - Giggs has made 632 appearances in the Premier League, starting 522 of those matches. He made his debut against Everton on 2 March 1991, coming off the bench to replace full-back Denis Irwin in a 2-0 defeat.
37 - When Giggs smashed the ball into the top corner of the Benfica goal on 14 September 2011, he became the oldest scorer in the Champions League at 37 years, 289 days.
109 - Since scoring his first Premier League goal against Tottenham in a 1-1 draw on 19 September 1992, Giggs has gone on to hit the back of the net a further 108 times in the league. This season was the first since the start of the Premier League during which he failed to score.

Tottenham 1-1 Manchester United - 19 September 1992
A sight that was to be repeated many times over the next two decades as an 18-year-old Giggs produced a classy finish against Tottenham. A defensive error allowed him to seize possession 30 yards out, before he got the better of a Spurs defender, rounded goalkeeper Ian Walker and fired home from an acute angle.
