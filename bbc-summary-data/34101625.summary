Dylan Archer, 42, and Richard Smith, 26, were killed when a vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed into the busy A27 at about 13:20 BST on 22 August.
The pair had been heading for a cycle trip on the South Downs Way when the crash happened.
The A27 has now partially reopened with a 40mph speed limit imposed, as investigations continue.
Mr Archer, the director of a Brighton IT company, leaves behind his partner Alice and their two sons, aged 15 and 12.
In a statement, his family said his "dry humour and generous nature will be greatly missed by all who knew him".
Mr Smith had worked in a bicycle shop in Cosham, Portsmouth, Hampshire, his family said.
Two years ago he moved to Hove where he worked in marketing and web development.
His family said: "Richard's passions in life were for his family, friends and his beloved bikes. His boundless enthusiasm was infectious.
"He was a truly wonderful, caring and loving person."
Victoria Marie Peck, Mr Smith's girlfriend, posted on Facebook: "I still can't put into words just how much he meant to me. He was the first person I saw in the morning and the last person I saw at night.
"It is hard to feel such pain and not be able to turn to the one person who could always make me feel better. He was my everything."
Earlier Giovanna Chirico, the fiancÃ©e of victim Mark Trussler, paid tribute to him.
She said he had taken his motorbike to Shoreham as he wanted to see the last flight of the Vulcan.
"It was a nice day and I texted him when the flight was due," she said.
"He replied saying I should get the kids ready so we could take them out to lunch on his return. I said I loved him and he replied 'I love you too, forever.'
"I didn't hear from him again."
His daughter, Samantha Hollis, said: "My dad was my best friend and the best father anyone could ask for.
"I will painfully miss him every day. I am very proud to be his daughter; he was loved by so many."
Mr Trussler, 54, leaves behind six children - Samantha, Kaitlin, Luke, 12, Mia, 10, Sophia, three, and two-year-old Alicia.
Reverend Ann Waizeneker of St Mary de Haura Church in Shoreham said many people in the town were still in shock.
"We've seen a constant stream of people through the church this week, signing the book of condolence, lighting a candle, and sitting quietly and saying a quiet prayer," she said.
"There's a great sense of love around at the moment."
On Saturday, a minute's silence was held near the site to mark one week since the air show disaster.
Hundreds of mourners gathered on a wooden toll bridge overlooking the crash site on Saturday to hold a minute's silence at the exact time the plane plummeted into traffic one week before.
Later, large crowds gathered for a candlelit vigil on the nearby the Adur Ferry Bridge to create a "bridge of light".
The West Sussex coroner, Penelope Schofield, has said all 11 victims have now been formally identified and their families informed.
Inquests into the deaths of the 11 victims will be opened and adjourned on Wednesday at County Hall North in Horsham, where all the names of those killed will be officially released.
Sussex Police said it has no reason to believe anyone else had died.
Following the crash and resulting fireball, specialists - including forensic archaeologists, anthropologists, odontologists and pathologists - had to examine DNA, teeth and human remains to discover who died.
The wreckage of the plane has been sent to Farnborough in Hampshire where the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) are trying to determine the cause of the disaster.
Their initial findings are expected to be published in the next few days.
Two lanes have been opened on the eastbound carriageway towards Brighton, together with one lane on the westbound carriageway.
A 40mph speed limit has been imposed while investigators continue to work in the area.
The pilot, Andy Hill, remains in a critical but stable condition in an unnamed specialist hospital.
