Wilkinson, 22, signed for Bolton from Millwall in July 2013, but made only 16 appearances for the Trotters.
The Republic of Ireland Under-21 international has also had loan spells with Chesterfield, Oldham and Newport.
"I'm delighted to get it over the line; it's been going on for a while now so it's nice to get here and sign everything," he said.
