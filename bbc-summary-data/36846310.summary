The programme's film crew arrived at Lough Erne earlier this week.
Presenter Adam Henson looked at ways in which the bird charity the Royal Society Protection of Birds (RSPB) works with farmers to improve the help endangered birds.
The RSPB helps to manage more than 40 islands in the lower lough.
It works closely with farmers to ensure the islands are grazed appropriately by livestock, while maintaining the right conditions for wildlife to thrive.
Ground-nesting birds need grass of various heights in which to lay eggs and raise their young successfully.
Countryfile filmed for two days as cattle and sheep were moved by boat from Rosscor and Boa Island to Muckinish Island and Hare Island.
The number of breeding waders in the area has increased after targeted management of Lough Erne by the RSPB.
While the weather and other factors can affect breeding numbers from year to year, about 250 pairs of breeding waders make their homes on the islands in the lower lough.
Countryfile will air on BBC One Northern Ireland on Sunday 31 July.
