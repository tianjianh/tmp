"That wasn't good enough. When you squander as many chances as we did then you have to be aware that the opposition are going to come back into the game.
"Second half the performance was nowhere near what we expect. I warned the players that you show your superiority on the scoreboard.
"We'll have to work hard to put it right next week."
