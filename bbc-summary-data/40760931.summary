[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jimmy Abdou's second-half goal helped AFC Wimbledon rescue a point at Scunthorpe United on the opening day of the League One season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conor Townsend gave the hosts an early lead when he fired into the top corner after being played in by Josh Morris.
Abdou grabbed Wimbledon's equaliser midway through the second-half with a volley from the edge of the penalty area.
After Townsend had put the Iron ahead, Andy Barcham curled wide against his former club as the Dons tried to respond.
Cody McDonald slashed wide after latching onto Deji Oshilaja's pass and Barcham saw another effort blocked by debutant Rory McArdle.
After the break Abdou lashed a good chance over the bar, but made a better contact to level the contest after 67 minutes.
Lyle Taylor found the side-netting and Paul Robinson saw an effort parried away by Matt Gilks as the visitors sought a winner.
