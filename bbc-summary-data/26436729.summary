The property developer involved with the sale of the three and a half acre HMP Gloucester site said it expects a "considerable" amount of interest.
Jones Lang LaSalle said despite some being listed, it hopes the buildings can be converted and modernised into housing.
The site lies in the heart of the city adjacent to Gloucester Docks.
A Jones Lang LaSalle spokeswoman said the sale has no guide price set at present.
