A memorial has been unveiled to the victims of an air crash in Oxfordshire almost 60 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eighteen people died when an RAF Blackburn Beverley aircraft came down in Sutton Wick near Drayton in 1957.
They were members of 47 Squadron, along with eight RAF police dog handlers and their dogs on their way to Cyprus, and two people on the ground.
The memorial was made by local wood carver Brian Eastoe who lived in the area at the time of the crash.
Barbara Warwick, who attended the service, said it was "very moving".
She said: "A lot of dogs were killed on the plane... and when they played the Last Post the dogs howled as if they knew."
The idea for memorial came from the Memorial Mob - a group campaigning for recognition of less well known fatal incidents involving the armed services and emergency services.
The crash was thought to be the largest single loss of life suffered by the RAF's police force.
Members of the armed services, relatives of some of those killed, and a number of RAF police dogs were present at the memorial unveiling.
