A person has died in Washington state after a partial collapse of an ice cave in an area north-east of Seattle that is popular with hikers.

Three people injured in the incident were airlifted to a nearby hospital, the local sheriff's office said.
Officials said the body of the victim is yet to be recovered from beneath the debris at the Big Four Ice Caves.
The collapse comes after authorities warned the caves were in their "most dangerous state" due to warm weather.
Formed after avalanches from the nearby Big Four Mountain, the caves were closed to the public after the collapse on Monday. Warnings about the potential dangers have been posted near the site for weeks.
On Sunday, a hiker filmed a section of the caves tumbling down. That collapse occurred while hikers were inside the cave, but no one was hurt
