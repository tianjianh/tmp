More than a third of people in England and Wales have not seen a bobby on the beat for a year, research suggests.

A survey of 26,000 people, carried out for HM Inspector of Constabulary, found 36% had not seen a police officer on patrol over a period of 12 months.
Another 23% said they had seen police on foot only once or twice over a year.
The public perception of police was "vitally important" in having the confidence to report crime, HM Inspector Mike Cunningham said.
"We will continue to work with forces to improve the way in which they engage with members of the public to ensure that people are confident in reporting crime," he added.
The study, conducted last summer but published for the first time on Wednesday, was carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary to monitor public views of policing.

The study questioned people aged over 16 years across the 43 police forces in England and Wales, between 15 July and 6 August 2015.

The BBC has asked the Home Office for a response.
Last October, chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) Sara Thornton, and Craig Mackey, deputy commissioner of the Met Police, said the era of routine patrols by "bobbies on the beat" had come to an end.
They also said funding cuts would lead to a transformation in investigating crime, but the Home Office said at the time police reform was working and crime was falling.
Police budgets in England and Wales were protected in real terms in the former Chancellor George Osborne's Spending Review last November.
