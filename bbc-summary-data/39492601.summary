Bjorn Brown, 23, known to friends as 'Bugz,' was repeatedly stabbed by two men in an attack in Thornton Heath just before 20:30 BST on Wednesday.
Mr Brown attempted to cycle away from the scene of the attack before he collapsed. He later died in hospital.
Award-winning rapper Stormzy tweeted: "Woke up to hear a childhood friend of mine ain't with us anymore R.I.P Bugz."
Reading footballer Callum Harriott also paid tribute to Mr Brown.
The former Charlton Athletic winger tweeted: "Lost my friend my brother and soldier had grown up and had the best memories until you left usâ€¦ always n forever in my heart."
A motorist who was driving past found Mr Brown, from South Norwood, lying in nearby Bensham Lane with multiple stab wounds.
He flagged down an ambulance which took Mr Brown to a south London hospital.
After his death in the early hours of Monday, a vigil was held by friends and family.
A number of Mr Brown's friends wore T-shirts with his photograph on.
Police are looking for two male suspects who wore dark-coloured, down-filled jackets and dark trousers, who they believe fled the scene towards Cameron Road.
The first is described as a black man, of a heavy build and approximately 5ft 6ins tall.
The second is described as a black man, of a slim or average build and approximately 5ft 5ins tall.
There have been no arrests and police inquiries continue.
