[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paedophile Anthony McCallen's jail term appeal refused

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former chaplain of a Roman Catholic care home who sexually abused 11 boys has failed in his bid to appeal against his 15-year jail sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony McCallen was jailed in January for abusing the boys at the now defunct St William's Children's Home near Market Weighton between 1970 and 1991.
The Court of Appeal refused his application for leave to appeal against the sentence.
McCallen claimed his jail term was too harsh and had applied for it to be cut.
The ex-chaplain, formerly of Whernside Crescent in Ingleby Barwick, Stockton-on-Tees, was convicted in December of 11 charges including a serious sexual offence, but was acquitted of eight others after a trial at Leeds Crown Court.
His co-defendant James Carragher, of Cearns Road, Merseyside, was jailed for nine years after he was found guilty of 21 indecent assaults and three serious sex offences. He was cleared of a further 30 charges.
