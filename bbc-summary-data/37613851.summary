Sakande, 22, came through the age groups at Hove, making his first-class debut with Oxford University in 2014.
The Chester-born paceman picked up the wicket of Joe Denly on his first one-day appearance in Sussex Sharks' defeat by Kent in August.
"I've been at the club since I was 12-years-old and I've wanted this for a long time," Sakande said.
"I'm really proud to have been given the opportunity to go out there and show what I can do for the first team."
The county's head coach Mark Davis said: "It is very pleasing to welcome another young Sussex-developed player into the professional squad."
