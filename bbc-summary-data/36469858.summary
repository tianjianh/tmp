Wales need to have a back-up plan if star player Gareth Bale picks up an injury at Euro 2016, according to former captain Kevin Ratcliffe.

Prior to his appearance in Wales' 3-0 defeat by Sweden, Bale had not played an international game since October.
He missed three Wales games including defeats by the Netherlands and Ukraine and a draw against Northern Ireland.
"I think we should be more prepared than we are," Ratcliffe said. "If he's not playing, what are we going to do?"
Ratcliffe, who made 59 appearances for Wales in a 12-year international career, says Chris Coleman's side are not the same with out the Real Madrid star.
"If Gareth Bale's not on the pitch, we just do not look as if we've got any creativity in the team," Ratcliffe told BBC Wales Sport.
"For me personally, I think we should be prepared that if Gareth Bale is out, what are we going to do?
"At this moment in time with the team that we play and the way that we play, it's not working."
Wales kick off their Euro 2016 campaign on Saturday, 11 June when they face Slovakia in Group B at Stade de Bordeaux (17:00 BST).
They go on to play England on Thursday, 16 June in Lens (14:00 BST) before their final group game against Russia on Monday, 20 June (20:00 BST).
