Dunfermline Athletic 1-2 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Battling Falkirk kept their grip on second place in the Championship with two second-half goals which sank 10-man Dunfermline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicky Clark had gone close for the Pars with a header before he beat Robbie Thomson with a low shot on 35 minutes.
Aaron Muirhead levelled from the penalty spot and Falkirk were boosted further when Dunfermline substitute Lewis Martin was sent off for a foul.
Nathan Austin came off the bench to head home the winner for the visitors.
Clark had looked sharp in the early stages of the match and had forced Thomson to dive full length to his right to clutch a headed effort in 13 minutes.
But Thomson was beaten at his far post when Clark struck a shot across goal from 16 yards to give the Pars a half-time lead.
However, the match sprang to life after the break.
Myles Hippolyte, who had replaced Mark Kerr two minutes earlier, was downed in the box by Pars keeper Sean Murdoch as he stretched for the loose ball. Murdoch was booked for his protests at referee Gavin Duncan's decision and then subbed because of injury, with David Hutton taking over in goal.
The home side were reduced to 10 men when Martin, who had been on for only three minutes, was red carded for downing John Baird as he headed towards goal.
But it was another substitute who had the final say on the game when, with 20 minutes remaining, Austin found himself free at the far post to head a Craig Sibbald cross over the line.
Dunfermline scrapped mightily to haul themselves back into the match but Falkirk, with numerical advantage, always looked capable on the break and held on to take the points.
