[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 1-0 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second-half goal from defender Mark Connolly secured Crawley their third win in the past four games with a 1-0 home victory over Blackpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connolly settled a tight first meeting between the clubs with his first goal since returning for a second spell with the Red Devils.
Crawley midfielder Billy Clifford put a shot across the face of the goal early on before Adi Yussuf should have hit the target for the hosts but fired over from a good position.
Blackpool winger Danny Philliskirk threatened when his header was saved by goalkeeper Glenn Morris after a ball into the area by Jack Payne.
More good work by Payne later set up striker Armand Gnanduillet, but the Frenchman headed wide.
Crawley had a let off just before the interval when Philliskirk shot wastefully wide after being set up by Kyle Vassell.
Dutch midfielder Enzio Boldewijn, put through by James Collins, was denied by visiting keeper Dean Lyness 11 minutes after the break.
But Crawley struck with 21 minutes left when a Clifford corner was flicked on by Joe McNerney and Connolly glanced home a header.
Blackpool applied some late pressure but could find no way through a stubborn home defence.
