The nine were detained at Incheon airport near Seoul and barred from the CISM games. They were then sent home.
Police said the group - five men and four women - protested noisily and blocked an aisle after Korean Air cabin crew refused them more alcohol.
CISM, in Mungyeong this year, is the world's biggest military sports event.
Yoo Ji-hyun, spokesman for the CISM organising committee, said the nine were accused of violating South Korea's aviation security law.
The Associated Press news agency said the Russians included two female swimmers, both active duty soldiers.
Only eight athletes from Russia are left to compete in the games, Yonhap news agency reports.
The games have attracted 7,000 athletes from 117 countries, competing in 24 sports disciplines. They run until 11 October.
