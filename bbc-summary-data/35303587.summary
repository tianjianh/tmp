Narrated by actor Colin Farrell, Dublin Rising 1916-2016 allows users to explore the city and view a number of audio and video pieces.
The project was created in collaboration with Ireland 2016, with input from archivists and historians.
The National Library of Ireland, the Military Archives and the Abbey Theatre contributed materials to the project.
The interactive historical feature was launched in Dublin on Tuesday.
Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said the project enables people to understand the significance of 1916.
"(It) is an important year that allows us to explore and understand the events not only of 1916, but the subsequent events that led to the establishment of our independent state," Mr Kenny said.
"In acknowledging our past, we are creating stronger foundations for a more vibrant and shared future."
The National Library's Katherine McSharry said they have received positive feedback for Dublin Rising.
"I think because it encompasses something that's visually interesting and very attractive to look," Ms McSharry said.
"It encompasses the content from partner organisations, which has that real sense of authenticity and it brings it all together with Colin Farrell's terrific voice."
Colin Farrell said the project allowed him to revisit his home city virtually.
"Growing up in Dublin, the events of 1916 are a key part of our schooling and culture," he said.
"I'm glad now that anyone around the world can learn more about it and see why it had such an impact on modern day Ireland just by picking up their phone or computer."
Irish Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Heather Humphreys said the interactive virtual tour allowed a more diverse audience to learn about 1916.
"Making material from our cultural institutions available via Google's cultural institute will open up our history to a huge global audience," Ms Humphreys said.
