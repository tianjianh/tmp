For anyone who failed to secure tickets to the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland matches this weekend, there may be one consolation - the travel costs for those who did.

On Thursday afternoon, fans booking weekend flights to Paris and Lyon were met with eye-watering prices.
Ryanair announced that it would schedule five extra return flights from Dublin to Lyon on Saturday and Sunday.
By 14:00 BST, a Dublin to Lyon return flight was priced at €629 (£482).
Flybe said on Thursday afternoon that seats were available on flights from Belfast to Paris via English airports.
However, these flights were also coming in at about £500 return.
Meanwhile, an Aer Lingus return flight from Dublin to Paris, leaving on Friday and returning on Monday, was priced at €855 (£656) on Thursday afternoon.
The only available Stena Line direct sailing from Rosslare to Cherbourg departs at 20:30 BST on Thursday evening and will see football fans arrive in France at 16:30 local time on Friday.
The website advertises sailings on this route for prices as low as £89 for a single car and adult.
However, on Thursday afternoon a single car with one adult and one seat on board rose to £297.
Northern Ireland fan Gary Arrell went online on Thursday to book return flights to Paris for himself and his wife, but decided against it when he realised it would cost £1,050.
"To be honest, I was tempted, but my wife was dead against paying that much for flights that, on Wednesday evening, were less than half that price.
"That wasn't even a direct flight - it was going through England.
"I would have booked earlier, but I thought there was no point before knowing if I'd have a ticket to the match.
"I know it's a matter of supply and demand, but it does feel like they're sticking the arm in a bit."
Mr Arrell faced further frustration when he logged on to the Irish FA site to secure one of the Northern Ireland v Wales tickets that went on sale at 13.00 on Thursday.
"After 50 minutes in an online queue, I was told all the tickets were sold," he said, although the Dundonald man managed to be philosophical about his bad luck.
"Maybe I'll get on the bike and take my chances with a ticket when I get there!
"It would have been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but it just wasn't meant to be."
Belfast International Airport said it has experienced a few knock-on delays due to French air traffic controllers strike, but no cancellations
