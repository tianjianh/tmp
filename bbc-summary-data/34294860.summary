West Yorkshire gang jailed over Makayabella cocaine plot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four people involved in an international plot to smuggle a tonne of cocaine into the UK have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dawne Powell, 56, James Hill, 31, David Webster, 44, and Philip McElhone, 29, were given sentences ranging from three to 11 years at Leeds Crown Court.
High purity blocks of the class A drug was seized from a yacht off the Irish coast in September last year.
Judge James Spencer QC described the plot as "colossal and mind boggling".
The drugs were discovered by the Irish navy on the Makayabella yacht which had been bought by Powell in the Caribbean and used to smuggle the drugs across the Atlantic Ocean from Venezuela.
She also funded a second boat, the Sea Breeze, which was bought by her husband Stephen, in cash, for £18,350. He was jailed for 16 years last year for his part in the conspiracy.
The grandmother told the court she did not know her husband was involved in the plot.
Judge Spencer told Powell: "I'm quite satisfied that you knew what [Stephen Powell] was about, I'm quite satisfied you knew what was involved.
"This was a serious conspiracy.  It involved a colossal amount of cash, or the prospect of it, because the street value of the quantity of cocaine which was planned to be imported was over £160m. And the quantities of illegal profit therefore were mind-boggling."
Hill, from Ilkley, West Yorkshire, was jailed for six years for conspiracy to import cocaine.
Powell, from Guiseley, West Yorkshire, was sentenced to three years for money laundering but cleared of a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine.
Both had denied the charges.
Webster, from Otley, West Yorkshire, and McElhone, from Halton Moor, Leeds, had both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine at an earlier hearing and were jailed for 11 years each.
Earlier this year, three other men: John Powell, 70, from Silsden, West Yorkshire, Benjamin Mellor, 35, from Bradford, and Thomas Britteon, 28, from Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, all admitted drug trafficking and importation in Ireland.
John Powell was sentenced to 10 years in jail, while Mellor and Britteon were jailed for eight years each.
