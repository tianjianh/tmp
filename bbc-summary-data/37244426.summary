The information was obtained by the BBC after a freedom of information request to the Civil Nuclear Constabulary.
The force said other incidents included the keys to Hinkley Point power station being lost and confidential information being shared.
It said it took security issues "extremely seriously".
Of the 130 breaches recorded, two were classed as high risk and two as medium risk.
Low-risk incidents included the loss of electronic equipment and papers, and windows being left open.
Chief Constable Mike Griffiths said the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), which is based in Culham near Abingdon, adheres to "stringent security regulations and protocols" put in place by the government's Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR).
He said: "We encourage our staff to self-report any potential security issues and in the majority of these cases the incident was indeed reported by the person who was responsible for the breach.
"We remain committed to maintaining a security culture at CNC and ensuring any security breaches are kept to a minimum and dealt with swiftly and robustly."
He said that after the loss of the handgun procedures were changed "to ensure this could never happen again".
