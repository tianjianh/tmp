David McNally quit Norwich City shortly before their relegation from the Premier League in May.
His departure was confirmed two days after he announced he was leaving on Twitter, before deleting the message.
The accounts show McNally was paid the money as "compensation for loss of office".
The Championship club - among the favourites for a return to the Premier League - made a post-tax profit of £9.4m, with an income of £100.6m, the newly-published accounts show.
Norwich City chairman Ed Balls, the ex-Labour shadow chancellor, said: "These figures once again underline the huge gap in revenue between the Championship and the Premier League."
News of McNally's departure first emerged after the Canaries were beaten by Manchester United on 7 May.
Replying to a fan calling for this departure, he tweeted: "I understand your view. I've resigned tonight and I hope the club can now progress."
The club confirmed his departure on 9 May.
