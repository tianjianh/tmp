Northumbria Police said the pair were arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images.
A spokesman said investigations were ongoing to "ensure the safeguarding of those involved" and to check that there was no ongoing risk of exploitation.
Both boys have been bailed pending further inquiries.
Supt Sarah Pitt said the force was working with schools across South Tyneside to make children "aware of the risks around sharing images of themselves and others via text and social network sites".
She said: "The internet is an essential tool and social networking sites are a popular way for children to communicate with their friends, but we need to make sure they stay safe online and know how to use it responsibly.
"It's very important that we make sure young people stay safe online and are aware of the risks and what they can do to avoid them.
"Anyone who may have concerns about images they have shared or received should speak with a trusted adult or the police straight away."
