Emily Bennett, 24, from Fernhill Heath, near Worcester, was first due to have the procedure at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, at the beginning of December.
The tumour was giving the 24-year-old seizures and memory loss.
The hospital said it regretted having to cancel any operation.
Her mother, Maxine Renton, said Emily was "awake and talking" following the three-hour operation.
"They think they have removed the tumour but she's going to have an MRI tomorrow to make sure," she said.
"She's just been moved into intensive care. She's very, very tired.
"I am so relieved she is ok and conscious. Hopefully now the tumour has gone she might get back to normal."
Ms Bennett first had a malignant brain tumour removed when she was eight years old but it resulted in her having a slow-growing benign tumour.
Although the tumour was not life-threatening, it was causing her health problems and she said she had found the repeated cancellations "upsetting".
A spokesperson for the trust which runs the hospital said: "We regret that any operation has to be cancelled and acknowledge the distress this can cause to both patients and their relatives."
