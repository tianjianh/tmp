[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 0-1 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mansfield Town remained in the hunt for a play-off place in League Two after Danny Rose scored the only goal of the game in a vital victory at fellow chasers Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Stags are now just one point off the top seven, while Stevenage are clinging on to their place with two games left after an insipid display that saw them rarely threaten.
Boro gave a first start to 18-year-old Mark McKee and he almost had a dream start when he half-volleyed into the side netting after nine minutes.
Mansfield ended the first half strongly and came extremely close four minutes before the break when Rose's header from Joel Byrom's corner was cleared off the line by Jobi McAnuff.
The Stags' pressure paid off, however, as Stevenage failed to get the ball clear before it eventually fell for Rose, who rifled his shot into the roof of the net.
Alex MacDonald threatened a second for the visitors when he brilliantly burst past two defenders, but he made a real hash of his finish when through on goal.
