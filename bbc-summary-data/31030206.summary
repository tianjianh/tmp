[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karolina Nowikiewicz, 25, was found with knife injuries to her neck at a property in Lowestoft Drive, Haymill in Slough, Berkshire on 17 February 2014.
Michael Wenham, 35, had pleaded not guilty to murder, but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Det Chief Insp Ailsa Kent called the killing "a premeditated and clinically executed murder".
Police said Wenham had made an appointment with Ms Nowikiewicz, taking a utility knife with him.
After attacking her, he left her for dead in the flat before going outside to call the police and his wife to admit what he had just done.
Ms Kent said: "Karolina, who was born in Poland and had moved to England about two years before her death in order to study, was working as a prostitute to fund her studies.
"It seems she was chosen at random by Wenham who had planned to kill."
Following the trial at Reading Crown Court, a statement released by her family described Ms Nowikiewicz as "a young, full of life, optimistic woman".
"This tragedy should never have taken place. Karolina should be alive.
"She had the right to live, however someone, Michael Wenham, took that choice away from her. Her death has brought great sorrow to her family."
Wenham, of Collingwood Road in Uxbridge, Hillingdon, is due to be sentenced on Friday.
