The US-based group Animal Defenders International, which was behind the rescue, says the lions would not survive in the wild.
This is because their circus owners had removed their claws and many of their teeth.
Reporters said the lions are healthy after their long journey from South America.
The lions will now live in a reserve, which has drinking pools, platforms, toys and veterinary care.
