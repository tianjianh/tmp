[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Born in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, she represented North Wales in the European Parliament from 1979 to 1989.
Miss Brookes, who had also been a social worker and company director, joined UKIP in 2013, "disillusioned" with David Cameron's leadership.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies described her as "an incredibly talented politician who will be very sadly missed".
Miss Brookes, who came from a farming family, was chairwoman of the Welsh Conservative Party and became chairwoman of the Welsh Consumer Council after losing her seat in the 1989 European election.
Despite several attempts, she never succeeded in being elected to Westminster.
Miss Brookes was awarded a CBE in 1996.
"Her career was varied and always hugely successful and I pay tribute to everything she did within public life, the voluntary sector and for the Welsh Conservative party," said Mr Davies.
