[SN]TITLE[SN]
Troubled Sandown Bay Academy 'to be closed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An academy chain has said it plans to close a school which has "halved in size and income".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Academies Enterprise Trust (AET) said income at Sandown Bay Academy had dropped by £5m in five years because of a "rapid fall" in pupil numbers.
It said a previously-announced merger with Ryde Academy would now involve the closure of the Sandown site.
Isle of Wight councillors recently voted to ask the government to oust AET "off the island altogether".
More on this and other stories from across the South of England.
In a consultation document, AET said student numbers had fallen from 2,084 in 2011/12 to 1,122 five years later.
It said many schools were seeing the same pattern, and the island had "many more secondary school places than students to fill them".
AET said income for the current year was £7m, compared with £12m in 2012/13.
The trust, which previously described the school's academic performance as "very weak", said it lacked teachers and resources.
AET plans to transfer most pupils and teachers to its Ryde Academy, 6 miles (10km) away.
A final decision on the proposed merger will be made by the government following a six-week consultation  which runs until 6 July.
