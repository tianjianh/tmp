Chester responded well, with James Alabi firing in his second goal in as many games to equalise in the 31st minute after good work from Kane Richards.
Alabi went close again minutes later, but Ben Greenhalgh changed the momentum of the match with a bundled effort to make it 2-1 after 57 minutes and Alex Flisher completed the scoring in the 64th minute.
