Groundhog Day: Liverpool cinema plans 24-hour marathon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An independent cinema is to give fans a taste of Groundhog Day - by screening the film 12 times in 24 hours.

The 1993 comedy stars Bill Murray as TV weatherman Phil Connors having to relive the same day over and over again.
Liverpool's Small Cinema hopes a "hardcore" will try the challenge on 2 February, the day depicted in the film.
The cinema will provide cups of tea "to keep people going" and people will not be told off "for nodding off".
Christopher Brown, who works at the 56-seat cinema, said the idea was "a mixture of silliness and a genuine endurance challenge".
Mr Brown said it would be like "trying to eat crackers without a glass of water [or] having a doughnut without licking your lips".
He added: "At the very least, it'll give the audience a new-found appreciation for Bill Murray's character's plight."
The event, which will run from 06:00 GMT until the same time the following day, will include a 20-minute break between each screening.
People only have to pay once.
