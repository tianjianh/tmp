It's after our big food survey, which showed more than half of kids don't eat any vegetables on a daily basis.
But there are big differences in what people eat depending on where they live in the world and this can affect how healthy they are.
With the help of the charity Oxfam, Newsround rated countries on how healthy their food is.
We looked at whether the food people eat is good quality, whether it's cheap or expensive, if there's enough to go around and how many people are overweight, obese or have type 2 diabetes in the country.
Watch Ricky's report to see how different countries did and where the UK came in the list.
