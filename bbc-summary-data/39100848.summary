Engineers were working to repair the line over the weekend after a tree fell onto the track between Llanrwst and Blaenau Ffestiniog on Thursday.
But the work uncovered unstable rocks by the track, requiring extra work.
Arriva Trains Wales said a replacement bus service between North Llanrwst and Blaenau Ffestiniog would run until Friday.
