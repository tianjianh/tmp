Two men who denied assaulting a motorist have been jailed for grievous bodily harm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph Doherty, 31, of Lowedges Road, Sheffield, and Rueben Ingleton, 32, of Fox Hill Crescent, Sheffield, attacked Tony Sharman, 49, on 5 September 2012.
Mr Sharman had pulled over to make a phone call when he was assaulted. He died a month later.
Doherty was jailed for eight years and Ingleton for 10 years at Sheffield Crown Court.
Mr Sharman had pulled into Frith Close, Sheffield, when he was punched in the face by Doherty and Ingleton, the court was told.
He had managed to reach a nearby property to summon help.
South Yorkshire Police said it had not been proven that Mr Sharman, who was in poor health, had died as a result of the injuries he sustained on 5 September.
Terri Underhay, Mr Sharman's eldest sister, thanked the police for their support after Ingelton and Doherty were convicted.
She said: "Tony was a loyal and caring son, brother and friend and his death has had a great impact on all of us, especially our mother.
"Tony was the apple of her eye and she doted on him as any mother would."
