Johnson-Thompson came into the final event, the 800m, needing a 17-second swing to finish with bronze but failed to achieve the improbable feat.
Belgium's Olympic champion Nafissatou Thiam won gold with 6,784 points.
Meanwhile, Briton Holly Bradshaw finished sixth in the pole vault after failing to clear 4.75m.
The 25-year-old, who set a new British record of 4.80m in May, cleared 4.65m on her third attempt.
Johnson-Thompson came into the second day of competition in fourth place after a mixed Saturday.
She produced only 1.86m in the high jump and was 13th in the field after a 12.47m shot-put. However, a superb 200m saw her move her up to fourth by the end of the first day.
The 24-year-old then improved a place with a leap of 6.56m in the long jump. However, both Dutch athlete Anouk Vetter (58.41) and Cuba's Yorgelis Rodriguez (47.41m) threw much further than Johnson-Thompson (41.72m) in the javelin to leapfrog the Briton going into the final event.

The 24-year-old said she would focus on the positives.
"I feel like one of these days it will happen for me," she tells BBC Sport.
"There is a lot to work on. It's been completely stripped down... my mental attitude, the way I approach training, the way I approach each competition.
"Everyone said it was going to take a couple of years but I wanted it to come together at London 2017. But I feel very positive for the future."
Germany's Carolin Schafer took silver with 6,696 points and Vetter of the Netherlands, who produced a championship best javelin throw of 58.41m, claimed bronze with 6,636.
Three-time world champion Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill suggested that Johnson-Thompson could seek advice from her former coach Toni Minichello.
"I would offer advice if she came to me and if she wanted to hear my experiences. But the mental side of things is quite a hard thing to master and that is part of our event, unfortunately," she said.
"Toni is a fantastic coach. He's been brilliant for me throughout my career and we've worked really well together.
"She could definitely take advice from him but it's her decision, it's her path that she wants to take and she's made a big decision to move to France already and I'm imagining she's going to want to see that through a bit longer and see where that takes her next year."

"It was really frustrating," Bradshaw told BBC Sport. "I'm not sure what happened because I am in great shape, but the conditions were difficult.
"I don't want to use that as an excuse but everything seemed to go against me, but fair play to the other women who performed out there.
"I am really heartbroken. I've worked so hard over the last few years to overcome injuries and I'm in the best shape of my life, but I am just really confused and disappointed.
"Just to be here is such a privilege and I'm trying not to lose sight of that. The crowd were amazing and I need to look to the future now and move on."
Greece's Katerina Stefanidi's took gold with 4.91m and American Sandi Morris (4.75m) claimed silver. Venezuela's Robeilys Peinado and Cuba's Yarisley Silva both took bronze with 4.65m after clearing the height by fewer attempts than Bradshaw.
UK Sport has set Great Britain a target of six to eight medals. Mo Farah's gold in the 10,000m on Friday is the only medal Britain has won so far. That total could improve on Monday as double European indoor champion Laura Muir goes in the 1500m final.
Kelly Sotherton, former British heptathlete, told BBC Radio 5 live: "We're supposed to have home advantage and the team will look at things they can do better, but it's a bit premature to judge the British performance this early. We should have this conversation next weekend.
"There are lots of great youngsters who could potentially use this home advantage and step up. We can't be too downbeat at the moment.
"We have put so much pressure on the team and that hasn't been dealt with very well. The success of the championships - are they viewed on how many medals the team win or how well we've hosted the championships?"
