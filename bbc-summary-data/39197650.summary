Francis, who retired in 2015, was diagnosed by doctors in January.
Haskins wants to help raise Â£100,000 towards the cost of private treatments.
James DeGale, the current IBF super-middleweight champion, is among the professionals to have voiced support for Francis on social media.
Francis won 34 of his 40 professional fights, with five defeats and a draw.
He won the WBO intercontinental, European and British titles at super-middleweight, before moving up to the light-heavyweight division and winning the British, Commonwealth and intercontinental belts.
"He's always been a mentally strong person," Haskins told BBC Radio Bristol.
"He's an amazing man, he's mentally strong, I'm going to be just as strong for him and we all are together."
