[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fare-dodging barrister Peter Barnett struck off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lawyer who commuted by train for two years without paying has been disbarred.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Peter Barnett, 44, used an Oyster card to avoid paying the full fare for his journey from Oxford to London.
The barrister was given a suspended prison sentence last September after he admitted failing to pay for journeys on 655 days.
A Bar Standards Board (BSB) tribunal said Barnett's "dishonest conduct" was incompatible with membership.
Barnett travelled from Haddenham and Thame Parkway to London Marylebone, but claimed his journey began at Wembley.
He admitted fraud by false representation and was given a suspended 16-week prison sentence.
The Oxford graduate and former Rhodes scholar failed to pay for journeys on Chiltern Railways on 655 days between April 2012 and November 2014, City of London Magistrates' Court heard in September 2015.
It was thought he "tapped out" with an Oyster card, automatically being charged the maximum Transport for London fare rather than a rail fare.
Barnett did not hold a practising certificate as a barrister in England and Wales but was Called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in 2007, the BSB said.
He was a qualified solicitor in England and Wales and in New South Wales, Australia where the relevant regulators have been informed of the tribunal's decision.
Chiltern Railways had argued he should pay back nearly Â£20,000 in lost fares but the defence said the true value was Â£6,000 which he was ordered to pay back.
Barnett was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and be supervised for 12 months.
