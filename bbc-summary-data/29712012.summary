Sir Alex Ferguson: My Man Utd squad was not 'antiquated'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sir Alex Ferguson has denied successor David Moyes inherited an "antiquated" structure at Manchester United.

In an update of his 2013 autobiography, excerpts of which have appeared in the Guardian, the former boss also responds to claims Moyes was hand-picked by him.
"Antiquated was a bizarre description of the structure I left behind," said Ferguson, who retired in 2013.
He added: "There appears to be a view out there that there was no process [appointing Moyes]. Nonsense."
Moyes was sacked by United in April 2014 after just 10 months in charge.
He left the club seventh in the table and they finished with 64 points - their lowest total in the Premier League era. The Old Trafford club also had their worst home record since 1978 during his reign.

Ferguson said that his fellow Scot had found the move from Everton to United "a massive jump".
He added: "As the results deteriorated, each defeat was a hammer blow to him.
"I could see that in his demeanour. In January we bought Juan Mata and that gave everyone a lift but I could see the walls squeezing in, leaving David with less and less room to breathe.
"I know that feeling from 1989, when we went through a terrible spell. You feel you are being crushed. The results gnawed away at David. Nobody could dispute how disappointing the season was. And it cost a man his job."
According to The Guardian, Ferguson also says that he was not consulted when the decision was made to sack the 51-year-old.
In response to suggestions that an ageing squad was handed to Moyes, Ferguson states that 11 of the side that won the title by 11 points in 2012-13 were 25 or under.
"Chelsea started the current season as favourites for the title, with a squad that also had six players in their 30s. I don't hear any grumbles about the age of their group," he added.
