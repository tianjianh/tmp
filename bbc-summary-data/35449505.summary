The 29-year-old is accused of causing the death of Joetta Shumba in a crash on the M62 on 24 January.
Ms Shumba, 25, was in a grey Audi S3 that collided with a lorry near the Eccles Interchange, Greater Manchester.
The injured driver of the car was arrested on Friday after trying to leave hospital, police said.
The crash caused the lorry to overturn and the road was closed for more than 11 hours.
The family of Ms Shumba, a mother of one, paid tribute to her, saying: "Joetta was our everything. She loved her son more than life itself."
PC Paul Joynson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "Fortunately we had a plan in place to prevent this man absconding from the area, and he is now under guard at hospital while he awaits an operation.
"I also think it is necessary to clarify some of the details of the collision, as there has been some misreporting in the press about exactly what happened.
"The Audi collided with the back of the HGV with such force that it caused it to overturn, but at no point did the lorry land on top of the car."
