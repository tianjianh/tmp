Aviation enthusiasts have bought a 1950s RAF aircraft that has stood outside RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall for more than 25 years.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) put the Avro Shackleton MR2C up for sale in 2014.
The MoD confirmed the Save our Shackleton group, which feared it would be scrapped, had bought the aircraft for an undisclosed amount.
The Shackleton flew with the RAF for 40 years until it was retired in 1991.
The MoD put it on the market due to maintenance costs and health and safety issues.
Gary Perkin, from the Save Our Shackleton group, confirmed its purchase but declined to say how much it had paid.
The group is launching a Â£50,000 crowdfunding campaign on Monday to help finance the purchase and find a permanent home for the aircraft.
Members hope the plane will be part of an exhibition of engineering at a site that has yet to be found.
Mr Perkin said: "My dad was an engineer in the RAF and I've always had an interest in aviation.
"I just felt that Cornwall needed to hold onto her and there was no time to wait.
"I'm really pleased we have been successful."
An MoD spokesperson said: "We can confirm we have sold this aircraft to the Save Our Shackleton organisation and they intend on moving the aircraft to its new home shortly."
