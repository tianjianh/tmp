[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Northern Ireland woman, who used dozens of different aliases, died in an apparent suicide pact with her partner, named locally as Thomas Ruttle.
Their bodies were discovered in an upstairs bedroom of the farmhouse they shared at Boolaglass, Askeaton.
A police spokesman confirmed Ms Holmes was identified on Wednesday following tests at a Limerick hospital.
She had been on the run from the Police Service of Northern Ireland and had more than 20 previous convictions for fraud.
Known to have used false identities, Julia Holmes, originally from Castlederg in County Tyrone, was deported from the US in 2006, after serving a jail sentence for a $500,000 property scam in Texas.
After returning to Northern Ireland, she was jailed in 2009 for 21 months for fraud.
Two years later, she skipped bail while living in Ballynahinch, County Down.
The couple were last seen on 14 March.
