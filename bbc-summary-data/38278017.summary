Swansea City manager Bob Bradley has warned his side they still have "plenty of work to do" despite climbing out of the Premier League relegation zone.

The Swans were bottom of the table before beating fellow strugglers Sunderland 3-0 on Saturday.
Bradley had been under pressure having won only one of his first seven games in charge - but insisted he was not worried about his own future.
"It's not about me, it's about the work," Bradley said.
"I don't spend all week worrying about myself. I only know one way to work, and that's to think about the team, engage the staff, engage the players.
"Criticism is part of the job for a manager in the Premier League. I don't think I was the only one to be criticised in the last week."
The win against Sunderland was a fine response from Bradley and his players after they were humiliated 5-0 at Tottenham a week earlier.
Victory over the Black Cats means Swansea are now above the Premier League's bottom three by virtue of goal difference.
"We did get a good response. The players deserve full credit. That's the part of the job, a result gets a little bit out of hand, you can cry about it but you have to look at it in a strong way," said Bradley.
"This is a step but we have to build upon it, there's still plenty of work to do. It's a nice bonus to be out of the bottom three, but the work is still there and we can't get ahead of ourselves.
"The word many players used when we talked this week was 'pride' and the only thing I did was I tried to get back at them and say: 'What does pride look like actually on the pitch?'
"Pride has to turn into intensity, pride has to turn into clean sheets. Don't just talk about pride - put it into something more. At the end of that, for a few seconds you can look at the table and say you're not there yet, but it looks better than last week and we can continue move forward."
