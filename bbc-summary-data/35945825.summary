[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There could be long delays at the units at the Royal Gwent in Newport and Nevill Hall in Monmouthshire, Aneurin Bevan health board said.
A high number of emergency cases has followed a busy week, the board said.
Staff are prioritising "very sick patients", a spokeswoman said.
The board said people should consider calling NHS Direct Wales or out-of-hours GP service, visit a pharmacist or the minor injury unit at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in Ystrad Mynach.
