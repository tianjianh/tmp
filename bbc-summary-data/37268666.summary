FC Schalke 0-2 Bayern Munich

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Robert Lewandowski scored his fourth goal in two Bundesliga games this season to help Bayern Munich see off a spirited Schalke.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The German champions looked set for a frustrating draw when Lewandowski missed from six yards.
But the Poland striker put his side ahead after Javi Martinez's threaded pass, then set up Joshua Kimmich for the second.
Schalke's Klaas-Jan Huntelaar hit the crossbar when the game was goalless.
Substitute Kimmich, 21, followed up his first goal for world champions Germany on Sunday - in a 3-0 World Cup qualifying win in Norway - with his first for Bayern.
Bayern's 19-year-old midfielder Renato Sanches, who helped Portugal win Euro 2016, made his Bundesliga debut following his summer move from Benfica.
Bayern have taken six points from Carlo Ancelotti's first two league games in charge.
