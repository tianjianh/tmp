Willstrop, 32, had beaten world number one Mohamed Elshorbagy and fifth seed Miguel Angel Rodriguez to reach the last four in Bellevue.
But third seed Gaultier, also 32, ended his run - winning 11-1 11-8 11-8 in just 50 minutes.
"It's been an absolute pleasure to play here," said Willstrop.
Four-time runner-up Gaultier will face Egypt's Omar Mosaad in the final.
Willstrop, who has slipped to world number 24 after a career-threatening hip injury, reached the semi-finals for the first time since 2012.
"I've put it together and have only dreamed about doing what I've done this week," he added.
"I'm a little bit disappointed now but reaching the semi-final has been beyond whatever I could have expected and hoped for.
"It's been fantastic and hopefully I can just move on a bit now."
