Saturday's 46-22 defeat of Munster in Dublin resulted in the Scarlets' first league success for 14 years.
Pivac, who has been in charge for three seasons, has assembled a coaching team that includes Stephen Jones, Byron Hayward and Ioan Cunningham,
"I know Wales have talked about playing a similar sort of style in the future and I hope they do," he said.
"Wales can play a great brand of rugby and I am sure they will going forward."
Former Wales outside-half Jonathan Davies has suggested the national team are not allowed to play like the Scarlets, who have been moulded by backs coach Jones.
"We have some players that have a lot of X-factor but it's about getting them the ball," said Pivac.
"You have to have the skillset. They understand their roles and are disciplined and have come a long way and it's not happened overnight.
"You are seeing some of the players representing Wales representing the Scarlets who are playing very well.
"We know they can play this sort of game and they are showing what they can do.
"We have some great athletes in Wales, not only at the Scarlets but also at the Ospreys, Blues and the Dragons."

Pivac says Scarlets' Pro12 success is the result of "three years of hard work" since his arrival from Auckland.
"You inherit staff and players and have an idea on how you want to play the game," he said.
"It takes time and if there are guys who can't perform the roles you have to move them on.
"It took a couple of years to get the squad that we wanted."
Scarlets' chances of winning Pro12 seemed slim when they lost their first three matches of the season.
"We talked about the start of the season a lot and if we hadn't have been making line breaks and chances we would have been concerned," said Pivac.
"Jonathan Davies and Rhys Patchell came in and we had our internationals come back in after the New Zealand tour, so it was probably understandable we weren't hitting our straps at the start.
"But we worked hard and enjoyed the style of rugby we were playing and we have the athletes to play that style of game."
The Scarlets will have players to replace next season, with Wales and Lions back Liam Williams heading to Saracens and Canada wing DTH van der Merwe moving to Newcastle. Both players scored in the Pro12 final.
Pivac knows replacing Williams might be the hardest task.
"He is a real competitor," said Pivac. "If we had 15 of him, we would be unbeatable.
He is that sort of character and someone you want in your group, he lifts players around him.
"He got named as British Lion but you would not know that because his focus has been with the Scarlets.
"We are going to miss him. It's hard to put into words the contribution he has put into this club but I have a sneaking suspicion he will be back.
"I hope he gets the opportunity with the Lions because you saw what he did with Wales in New Zealand last summer. He offers everything Warren Gatland will be looking for."
Scarlets will return to Wales on Sunday for a homecoming celebration.
