It is understood that 20 of the 50 holding cells in Musgrave PSNI station in Belfast city centre are not currently operational.
Sources said a deep clean of the facility was to begin early on Tuesday morning.
Solicitors have been told clients may have to be taken to other police stations later.
The Law Society for Northern Ireland, which regulates and represents solicitors, says it expects Musgrave station to be fully operational by 07:00 BST on Wednesday.
It issued a statement about the situation to solicitors on Monday afternoon.
The society said contingency plans have been put in place to take people to holding cells in Antrim, Armagh and Bangor if needed.
