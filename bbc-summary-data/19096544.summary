The demolition of flats in Flint town centre is due to get under way as part of a major redevelopment of housing.

Alex Aldridge, a former leader of Flintshire council, has previously called the 1970s maisonettes a "straitjacket" restricting development.
Tenants have been rehoused in the first of the 240 homes to be flattened and workers are disconnecting services.
The work is starting earlier than expected as it had been scheduled for later in the year.
The demolition of Coleshill Lea flats is expected to extend into September.
Other residents still need to be rehoused in other sections of the maisonettes.
Flintshire council warns that the work in August and September could cause some disruption, which it hopes to keep to a minimum.
The plan is to rebuild a mix of social housing and other community facilities, selling off some land to developers to finance other parts of the project.
Mr Aldridge said he was delighted that the beginning of the demolition process was under way as formal talks about flattening the flats began in 2003.
"This unit is the first, however, others will follow in due course as they become vacant and the people living there-in have been provided with homes of their choice," he said.
Helen Brown, the cabinet member for housing, said: "The tenants and residents have been remarkable, and I would like to thank them for their co-operation and the way they have worked with us, which has helped us to reach this point earlier than expected."
