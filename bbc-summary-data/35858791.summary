Luke Norris got the only goal as he reacted quickest after Josh Wright's shot was blocked by a defender to calmly shoot home from eight yards out.
Ryan Jackson had a second-half shot saved by Bury's Chris Neal while Gills' Andrew Crofts also went close.
Bury fruitlessly pushed for an equaliser late on as Chris Hussey's free-kick went wide while Danny Rose forced a save from Stuart Nelson.
Gillingham, in fourth, now have a four-point cushion to seventh-placed Barnsley.
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"It was a really sloppy goal, we had opportunities to clear it. When they went up 1-0, they made it very difficult for us to get some fluidity in the game.
"Fair play to them, they produced three points from it. I don't think they offered much to the game going forward but defensively they stuck to the task.
"We moved the ball well, got it wide early and put some fantastic crosses in but we just weren't ruthless enough in both boxes."
