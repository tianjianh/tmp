Like many other major oil companies, PetroChina's profits have been hit by the fall in oil prices over the past year.
Net profits were 35.51bn yuan ($5.46bn; Â£3.85bn) in 2015, down from 107.17bn yuan the year before, the company said.
PetroChina is one of the largest oil firms in the world.
Based in Beijing, it is the listed arm of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).
Earlier this year, it warned it would report about a 70% fall in net profits.
"In 2015, the global economic recovery slowed down, the downward pressure on China's economy continuously intensified, the overall supply in the oil and gas market was sufficient and the international oil prices kept dropping at a low level," the company said.
However, it added that despite the "complicated and severe domestic and international economic environment", its production and operations were "stable and under control".
The company's main activities include exploration as well as development and production of crude oil and natural gas, among others.
