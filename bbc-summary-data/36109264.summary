A father-of-four died after hitting a road sign at about 40mph in the closing metres of a cycling race, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Catley, 44, was riding in the Curve of Doom race around Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire when he lost control of his bike.
Witnesses said he clipped another rider's wheel, then hit a step ladder before colliding with the road sign.
A coroner concluded he died as a result of the accident.
Mr Catley, a civil engineer, grew up in Deganwy in Wales but lived in Screveton, Nottinghamshire, with his wife and four children.
He competed in numerous cycling events to raise money for the British Heart Foundation in memory of his elder brother Greg, 33, who died of a heart attack in 2001 while rugby training.
His wife, Sarah, told the Daily Post that he was "a brilliantly cool and devoted dad to his four children and a loving husband".
The race, held on 20 June, was organised by the West Bridgford-based Ã˜VB cycling club in Nottinghamshire.
Jack Storey, a member of Ã˜VB, who rode with Mr Catley that day, said: "Jason was known as a extraordinarily passionate competitor and talented cyclist.
"You could rely on Jason to lift your spirits whilst on the bike and his encouragement was felt by many who raced with him."
Mr Catley suffered serious head injuries in the crash and went into cardiac arrest.
Trevor Kirkman, senior coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire, said his death was "tragic and untimely" and recorded the cause of death as head injuries.
People have continued to donate money to the British Heart Foundation since Mr Catley's death. His JustGiving page has raised more than Â£3,000.
