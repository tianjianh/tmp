David Beckett said his beloved wife has passed away peacefully in a Manchester hospital.
"David and the programme's cast and crew are heartbroken and deeply saddened at the loss of Anne," said a statement on the ITV website.
She had starred on the soap opera for more than 40 years.
William Roache, who played Anne's onscreen husband Ken Barlow, said: "I feel Anne's loss so personally having worked closely with her for over 40 years.
"She was such a loving and vibrant person. You always knew she was there because her laugh was never far away.
"She was an impeccable performer with superb comedy timing and an immense gift for really heightened drama.
"We had some rows over the years as Ken and Deirdre and it was wonderful to play those scenes opposite her.
"Coronation Street has lost one of its iconic characters and Anne will be greatly missed."
Executive producer Kieran Roberts said: "We know only too acutely how much Anne meant to the millions of people who watched her create the legendary character of Deirdre Barlow."
