Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 Barnsley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday moved inside the play-off places as they beat Barnsley courtesy of goals in each half in the South Yorkshire derby at Hillsborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wednesday led against the run of play courtesy of Angus MacDonald's own goal towards the end of the first half.
Barnsley rallied after the break as chances for Tom Bradshaw and Stefan Payne were saved by Keiren Westwood.
But Sam Hutchinson's half-volley inside the area doubled the hosts' lead before Barnsley's Adam Hammill was sent off.
Confusion followed the Barnsley midfielder's dismissal, following a challenge on Hutchinson, when referee Peter Bankes initially appeared to show Hutchison the red card.
After the protests on the touchline, Tykes manager Paul Heckingbottom was sent to the stands while Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal was given a warning.
A second successive home win for Wednesday takes them to sixth and above Birmingham on goal difference, while Barnsley drop to 11th following their back-to-back victories.
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal:
"I think we prepared very well. I'm happy my team understands the moments of the game very well.
"I saw my team try to press up, try to play fast attack, sometimes all the players back together, not taking one goal when we were winning 1-0 and try to get the second.
"And I saw my team after the second goal and when Barnsley had 10 players press high and moving the ball until the game finished. These kind of things I like in my team."
Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom:
"You get what you deserve and Wednesday won 2-0, they deserved to win because they took their chances.
"My frustration is I saw the ref give Sam Hutchinson a red card, and then I knew Adam had been sent off, but it wasn't until I got upstairs that I realised Wednesday had 11 men. I know I saw him give him a red card.
"I think me and Bully will end up suffering for mismanagement. When you turn around after an incident and there's four or five of their staff in your technical area and the fourth official trying to get them out it's only going to end one way."
