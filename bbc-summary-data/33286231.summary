Cow attack survivor calls for safer footpaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who survived a cow trampling attack in which his brother was killed has told the BBC public footpaths need to be made safer.

John Porter's brother Mike, 66, died at the scene after the men were knocked to the ground by cows in Wiltshire.
After an inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death, he said he hoped more could be done to prevent a further tragedy.
The jury noted that there had been previous attacks in the same fields.
And jurors noted a lack of separation between cattle and public, in a narrative accompanying their verdict.
Mr Porter, 74, from Monkton Combe, near Bath, told the BBC: "Accidents will always happen, sadly. But I do think that we do need to look at ways in which we can make our footpaths safer."
His brother was visiting from Edinburgh in May 2013 when they walked dogs on leads across a public footpath through Elbow Field, Turleigh. They were knocked to the ground by two cows and stamped on. Mike died at the scene of internal bleeding.
The inquest heard that Simon Dark, Bleddyn Griffiths and David Billington had also suffered injuries after being trampled in the fields in 2008 and 2011 - although it was not possible to say whether the same cows were involved.
The farmer Brian Godwin, 81, had been visited by the Health and Safety Executive after Mr Billington was injured. He had put in place some safety measures, including signs and some electric fencing. He has since sold the cattle and is trying to establish a new herd.
The lawyers representing Mike Porter's partner Adrienne Sillar and their two sons said there was a "clear issue" about whether Elbow Field should remain a public right of way and "whether cows should share the enclosure".
