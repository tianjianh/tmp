Josh Brown case: Domestic abuse will not be tolerated by NFL, says Roger Goodell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell insists the league takes the issue of domestic abuse "incredibly seriously" and is "not going to tolerate it".

New York Giants kicker Josh Brown admitted physically abusing his ex-wife in documents released by police from an investigation in 2015.
No criminal charges were brought at the time but the NFL banned Brown for one game and will now review the documents.
"We have some new information here," Goodell told BBC Sport.
"We'll evaluate that in the context of our policy and we'll take it from there."
Goodell was speaking before it emerged that Brown had been placed on the commissioner's "exempt list" while the NFL investigates his case.
This means Brown, 37, will still be paid but cannot attend practices or Giants games and will not be counted on the Giants' 53-man roster.
Brown has not travelled with the Giants to London for this weekend's game against the Los Angeles Rams at Twickenham.
Giants co-owner John Mara has admitted in the build-up to the game that Brown told the club about the domestic abuse.
"We'd like to speak to the people involved, whether it's the victim or the people involved that may have information, including law enforcement," added Goodell.
"But we understand that in certain cases they may not be permitted to talk to us, or want to talk to us, and we don't make judgments on people where they do that.
"What we want to do is get the facts and when we get the facts, we're going to aggressively pursue that, and we'll apply our policy."
The NFL toughened its domestic violence policy after it was criticised when Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice received only a two-game suspension in July 2014 for assaulting his then fiancee, now his wife.
He was later banned indefinitely when a video emerged of him punching his fiancee in the face but won an appeal against the punishment.
The new rules could lead to a six-game suspension or a lifetime ban for a second offence.
The NFL has also been condemned for imposing one-game bans for domestic abuse when players have been fined for excessive touchdown celebrations.
"I understand the public's misunderstanding of those things and how that can be difficult for them to understand how we get to those positions," added Goodell.
"But those are things that we have to do. I think it's a lot deeper and a lot more complicated than it appears, but it gets a lot of focus."
