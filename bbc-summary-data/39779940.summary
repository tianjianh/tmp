WSL 1 Spring Series: Arsenal Ladies 4-4 Liverpool Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal Ladies recovered from 3-1 down at half-time against Liverpool Ladies to draw an eight-goal thriller in the Women's Super League One Spring Series.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Greenwood scored straight from a Liverpool corner before Chloe Kelly levelled for Arsenal from close range.
Natasha Harding then diverted in a Sari van Veenendaal clearance and a Caroline Weir header extended Liverpool's lead.
Arsenal hit back to lead with two from Danielle Carter and Jordan Nobbs' shot, but Gemma Bonner's header made it 4-4.
The result leaves Arsenal with two draws from two league games so far in 2017, while Liverpool - who have played an extra game - remain unbeaten and go top.
Centre-back Bonner's late equaliser from a corner ensured the first 4-4 result in the history of the Women's Super League - founded in 2011 - and the highest scoring draw ever in either WSL 1 or WSL 2.
