William Lauder, 48, of Buccleuch Street, Hawick, was found guilty after trial in April of stealing jeans, jackets and other items.
He took the goods from Aero Leather Clothing Ltd in Galashiels, Hawick and elsewhere between 2004 and 2013.
Sheriff Alistair Noble jailed him at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
"You were held in high esteem and trusted completely and you betrayed that trust," he told Lauder.
Defence advocate, Victoria Dow, told Sheriff Noble that her client continued to deny the allegations against him.
He lived in Hawick with his wife and son and she said the financing of their home "could be compromised by any element of custody".
Lauder, she added, had no previous convictions and was assessed as being at low risk of re-offending, adding: "Therefore he is suitable for a community-based disposal.
"He is fit, able and capable of carrying out such a disposal."
A large amount of the materials taken had been recovered, she told the sheriff.
However, the sheriff told Lauder: "You were convicted of stealing just under £195,000 of property from a company of which you were the managing director.
"In part, this may have been you felt you were being insufficiently rewarded for the work you were doing for the company.
"You had been in substantial control of the company and it is clear you were held in high esteem and trusted completely. You betrayed that trust."
Sheriff Noble acknowledged that a substantial amount of the property had been recovered.
He said: "Despite these factors, it is clear in my view the offences can only be dealt with by a custodial sentence.
"Giving you as much credit as I can, you are sentenced to 21 months imprisonment from today."
