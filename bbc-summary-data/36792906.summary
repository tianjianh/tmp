NHS Tayside said the open access GP clinics at Brechin Health Centre will stop taking patients with immediate effect.
NHS Tayside apologised for the decision, which it said was made "despite the best efforts of staff".
It said prescription requests could still be dropped off and collected from the centre.
Prof Andrew Russell, medical director with NHS Tayside, said: "We are sorry that we have had to withdraw the walk-in clinics at short notice, however, despite the best efforts of staff, it has proved impossible to secure the GP cover needed.
"There is no change to those services delivered by practice nurses and so those patients who have an appointment at the health centre for Thursday or Friday should attend as it is business as usual for practice nursing services."
NHS Tayside said patients who needed an appointment on Thursday or Friday would be directed to the "most appropriate healthcare professional or service."
Prof Russell said: "GP cover at the practice continues to be challenging, especially over the holiday period as it is more difficult to secure locum doctors due to the increased demand for locums across the country.
"We are working hard to put sustainable arrangements in place at Brechin Health Centre over the summer holidays, however, the open access clinics will be withdrawn for the remainder of July and August.
"We are actively recruiting to the vacant posts at Brechin but the situation remains a big challenge and our doctors and nurses are working really hard every day to deliver a safe and sustainable service for the people of Brechin."
