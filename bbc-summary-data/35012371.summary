[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malheeha Mir was sacked after a hearing that took place before Chief Constable Francis Habgood earlier.
A spokesman said she also failed to disclose an association she had with known criminals.
She had already been given a final written warning for accessing police systems for no policing purpose.
Thames Valley Police said she had "breached the standards of professional behaviour relating to discreditable conduct and honesty and integrity".
