[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cub Scout leader who did not allow a girl to join his pack "did not fully comply with the rules," the Scout Association has said.

They launched an investigation after Eloise Bemand-Wright's mother claimed the eight-year-old was refused entry because she is a girl.
The leader responsible will be leaving after the summer term, the association said.
Mother Jane Bemand-Wright said "Eloise has not even received an apology".

Originally a member of the Beavers, Eloise wanted to move up to 1st Kingskerswell Cubs when she turned eight, which meets in the same hall in Devon.
But Mrs Bemand-Wright said she was told by a male leader that she could not join because he "can't put her in a tent with men".
He told her the helpers were "young single males" and he did not think "it was appropriate".
The Scout Association said it was sorry Eloise had a "bad experience" and that girls were welcome at 1st Kingskerswell Cubs.
But Mrs Bemand-Wright said Eloise has not yet been offered a place there.
"I think my daughter deserves a written apology... but as yet we have heard nothing," she said.
Eloise has since joined a pack in Newton Abbot, but her mum says she would rather be with friends from her old group.
"We have to travel further to take her to this group which is not near her home," Mrs Bemand-Wright said.
In a statement, the Scout Association said: "We have clear policies in place that ensure all our Scout Groups are open to young women.
"We are confident that any young girl who wants to join the Kingskerwell Pack in the future will be welcomed into the full life of the pack."
