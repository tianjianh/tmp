Why the Taliban targets schools

When the Pakistani Taliban attacked a school in Peshawar they claimed the lives of 132 children and nine school staff.

The militants say it was revenge for an army offensive which they say killed around 1,000 of their members.
This is the Pakistani Taliban's deadliest attack to date.
The Taliban emerged in northern Pakistan in the early 1990s and rose to power in Afghanistan just 20 years ago - in 1994.
Vowing they would restore peace and security, they also imposed their own version of Islamic law.
This led to public executions and the banning of both television and some music.
Following the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York in September 2001, the attention of the world was drawn to the Taliban in Afghanistan.
They were driven from power shortly after but have re-emerged in recent years.
The Taliban has also grown stronger in Pakistan where the group has carried out suicide bombings and other attacks.
In June the Pakistani army began an operation against militant groups in the north of the country, killing hundreds of Taliban fighters.
The Pakistani Taliban doesn't agree with Western-style education for children and particularly girls.
Mosharraf Zaidi is the campaign director for Alif Ailaan which works to bring about better education in Pakistan.
"Education teaches people to think for themselves and decide what is good for us. It opens up our minds," he told Newsbeat.
"The Taliban wants to control the minds of people. One way to do this is to prevent young people from getting an education.
"In the eyes of the Taliban every educated boy or girl represents a threat."
In October 2012 the Pakistani Taliban shot schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai when she was on a school bus in the town of Mingora.
They were unhappy that she was speaking up for the rights of girls to be educated.
We all know the story from here. Malala now campaigns around the world for equality for women in education.
She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts.
In the past militants have attacked schools during the night, when the risk to students was small. Their aim was to shut them down.
Dr Gareth Price is an expert on Pakistan at Chatham House, a group which studies foreign policy across the world.
He told Newsbeat that the Taliban have used tactics like the intimidation of teachers as well as sending letters to parents urging them not to send their children to school.
Price thinks this latest attack - during the school day - could suggest the group is becoming more desperate.
"The plan seems to have been to do something so barbaric that it would make people question whether the government was right to stand up against them.
"But it has had the opposite effect."
He adds that school buildings are often easy targets because of a lack of security.
World leaders have condemned the attack. Even the Afghan Taliban has criticised it, calling it "un-Islamic".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif says he will "continue the war against terrorism until the last terrorist is eliminated".
