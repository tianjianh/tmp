The Scottish SPCA said the discovery was made at St Combs on Wednesday.
A male swan was hit by four shotgun pellets and one pellet was found inside a female.
Scottish SPCA inspector Fiona Shand said: "A post mortem has revealed the pair died from a massive haemorrhage caused by gunshot trauma. The bodies may have been dumped there or could have been washed ashore."
She added: "This sort of animal cruelty is completely unacceptable and we are urging people with any information to contact us in an effort to trace whoever is responsible."
