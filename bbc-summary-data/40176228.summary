Frankie Donaldson admitted assaulting Jane Clarke on a number of occasions spanning almost a decade.
Police conducted a large-scale abuse inquiry after the 58-year-old was reported to them in 2013.
Their investigation uncovered years of violence during Donaldson's 22-year relationship with Ms Clarke.
Donaldson, of Possilpark, Glasgow, hit his partner with a wet towel before throttling her with it. He also threw a dumbbell at her - but hit a wall.
On one occasion, a child in the house was so concerned that he hit Donaldson with a lamp in a bid stop him hitting Ms Clarke on the face with a car key.
The court was told of other incidents of Ms Clarke being pulled from a bed, held by the throat, punched, pulled by the ears and hit with a mobile phone and remote control.
Earlier this year at Glasgow Sheriff Court, Donaldson pled guilty to nine charges of assault.
Seven were against Ms Clarke between January 2005 and June 2013, and two were against her sister Elizabeth Harrison in March 2001 and October 2004.
Donaldson and Ms Clarke lived together during their relationship.
Procurator fiscal depute Harry Findlay told the court Donaldson was reported to police in December 2013 and it was passed to the domestic abuse investigations unit which then broadened its scope to look a earlier incidents.
Jailing Donaldson for 26 months, Sheriff Joan Kerr said: "I have reached the conclusion that the offences are so grave that no suitable alternative to a custodial sentence is possible."
She also imposed a four-year non-harassment order meaning Donaldson cannot contact Ms Clarke in any way during that period.
