[SN]TITLE[SN]
Banbury nurse Julia Knight 'poisoned mother with insulin', court told

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse forged a prescription and poisoned her mother with a potentially lethal dose of insulin while she was in hospital, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits administering the insulin.
Oxford Crown Court heard Ms Knight had researched different types of insulin at the surgery where she worked.
She also denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
Prosecutor John Price told the court it was not thought Ms Robson was the target of a mercy killing, or that there was a financial motive involved.
He added that she had been in poor health before being admitted to hospital.
The court heard the pensioner fell unconscious after being given the insulin and was revived by medical staff at the hospital.
Mr Price said there was "clear evidence" Ms Knight, of Sycamore Drive, Banbury, had researched different types of insulin at work and forged a doctor's prescription in a patient's name who was diabetic.
She is then alleged to have collected the prescription from a nearby Sainsbury's pharmacy, before driving to the Horton Hospital to see her mother.
The court was told Ms Robson died last month, but Judge Ian Pringle said her death was not relevant to the case and had no bearing on the issues they had to consider.
The trial continues.
