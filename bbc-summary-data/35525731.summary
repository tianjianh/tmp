Yeovil Town 0-0 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil Town moved out of the League Two relegation zone thanks to a goalless draw with promotion-chasing Plymouth Argyle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brandon Goodship almost put the hosts ahead after three minutes but he fired wide from Connor Roberts' delivery.
Plymouth came close when Graham Carey half-volleyed wide and later headed Kelvin Mellor's chance over the bar.
Goodship could have sealed a Yeovil win but shot straight at Luke McCormick after Oscar Threlkeld played him in.
