South Asia: Where 'facts are sometimes stranger than fiction'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wow. Delhi correspondent.  I still can't really believe I've bagged such an enviable job.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Every reporter wants to be assigned to the big story and the continued rise of South Asia has to be one of the biggest stories on earth.
This colourful, complex and challenging region contains something like a fifth of the world's population and I intend to give my all to reporting events and developments here.
This blog is where I'll be giving my thoughts and reflections on what I see and do - but I'll be honest, I'm going to need your help.
I've read about the region and reported from here many times before.  A couple of years back I spent a month driving a Hindustan Ambassador around India for a documentary series on BBC 2.  I even have some rather dark family history here (something I intend to come back to). But I am still a rookie.
So I'm going to need a corrective every now and then and I'm hoping that you'll offer me just that.
I want you to cast a critical eye over my work and to tell me when I get something wrong or hit a bum note. Feel free to offer occasional praise too, if you see fit.
In the meantime I plan to roll up my sleeves and get to work.
A couple of days ago I contacted one of the most influential and experienced newspaper editors in South Asia.
"Welcome to a region where facts are sometimes stranger than fiction," he said.
I can't imagine a more alluring introduction!
