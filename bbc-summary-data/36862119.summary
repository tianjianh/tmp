A spokesman for Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan, who lead the group, said the delay was caused by "a dispute between two minority shareholders".
An agreement seemed in place after Levien and Kaplan met Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins on Wednesday.
The deal, which has been ratified by the Premier League, is still expected to be completed on Thursday night.
The dispute is understood to involve the 21.1% stake owned by South African-born Brian Katzen and his business partner Jeffrey Crevoiserat.
Levien will stay in Swansea to oversee the remaining details of the agreement, while Kaplan is due to fly to California for a meeting on Friday.
