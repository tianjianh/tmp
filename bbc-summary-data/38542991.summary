Tube strike to go ahead as RMT walks out of talks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A strike by Tube workers is to go ahead after the biggest rail union, the RMT, walked out of talks.

The 24-hour action from 18:00 GMT on Sunday is expected to cause mass station closures.
The strike is organised in protest at plans to close ticket offices. LU has warned travellers to expect major disruption to services.
The TSSA said London Underground offered it a "new" deal during talks at the conciliation service Acas.
It will put the offer to members.
But in a message to RMT members, regional organiser John Leach said the talks had "failed" and the strike by his union would go ahead.
BBC London transport correspondent Tom Edwards said all previous warnings about strike action "still stand... whatever happens with TSSA" because the RMT represents nearly 10 times as many workers.
Talks between both unions and LU had previously broken down on Friday afternoon.
Mr Leach told members of the RMT that LU had "given exactly the same offer again" during Saturday's last-ditch talks.
"This is just not acceptable. The unsafe practices and pressure on staff and passengers have to be resisted and will be," he said.

There is no doubt this is a blow to the Mayor Sadiq Khan who said he would reduce the number of strikes.
Just yesterday he said strikes were a sign of failure.
This acrimonious dispute though has been rumbling through three mayoralties and the unions have always hated the policy of closing ticket offices and reducing staff numbers.
And even now it's not over.
The TSSA said its talks with London Underground had ended, with a new offer being made.
General secretary Manuel Cortes said the union would now go back to its members and "seek their views" on whether to join the RMT on strike.
Transport for London (TfL) previously said it would address the recommendations of a recent report, which found the closure of ticket offices had caused "significant issues" for Tube passengers.
Before the talks Steve Griffiths, chief operating officer for LU, said there was "no need" for the strike as more workers were already being employed and "around 500 staff will be recruited for stations this year".
TfL told the BBC it was "still inviting the RMT" to the conciliation talks.
A source said the RMT left the talks before TfL had the opportunity to share any further proposals, a point the RMT disputed.
