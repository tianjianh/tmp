Henry Patterson, of Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire, was spotted by specialist search officers on Thursday near the town's Cawder golf club and the Forth and Clyde Canal.
He was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary in a critical condition but later died.
Mr Patterson had early stage dementia and his family said he rarely left the house alone.
Insp Duncan Evans of Police Scotland said: "Our thoughts, the thoughts of those in the local community and all those who shared our appeals for information, will no doubt be with the family of Mr Patterson this evening."
