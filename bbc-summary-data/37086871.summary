Firm wants to find 'honest boy Daniel' over 10p toy mistake

One of Scotland's largest energy firms is hoping to trace a boy who returned a 10p gift shop souvenir by post after realising his mum had not paid for it.

The boy, named Daniel, sent the stretchy man toy back to Whitelee Windfarm visitor centre along with a letter explaining the mix-up.
Scottish Power, which runs the facility on Eaglesham Moor in East Renfrewshire, now wants Daniel to get in touch.
The firm said it wanted to send him a "gesture of thanks" for his honesty.
The letter said: "Dear sir/madam, I was in the shop and picked up the enclosed thinking that my mum had paid for it. Unfortunately, she had not so I am returning the item."
Whitelee Windfarm visitor centre manager, Ian Parkinson, said: "We're often contacted by people wishing to find out more about the UK's biggest windfarm, but it's not often we receive mail like this.
"I'd certainly like to praise this very honest young boy for admitting his mistake, and for his sincerity in his actions.
"It's certainly heart-warming to think that someone would go to such lengths to return an item of very small value to us."
Mr Parkinson added: "Unfortunately we don't have Daniel's return address to send him back our own gesture of thanks, but I do hope he gets touch or visits us again with his mum."
