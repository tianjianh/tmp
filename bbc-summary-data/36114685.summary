Aftab Hussain, 37, of Holywell Place, Rotherham admitted two counts of inciting sexual activity with a child at Sheffield Crown Court last month.

He was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

South Yorkshire Police said Hussain first contacted the girl in September 2015 via social media.
Officers found Hussain, who worked as a takeaway delivery driver, met the girl and took her out in his car while he was making deliveries.
Det Insp John Fitzgibbons said: "I hope that the positive result at court today offers further reassurance to the victim in this case, as well as victims out there who are yet to come forward, that we will do whatever we can to bring these vile criminals before the courts.
"Hussain is now behind bars where he can cause no further harm and I hope this allows the victim, who has been so brave throughout the investigation and court process, a chance to begin to rebuild her life."
