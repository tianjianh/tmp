Tributes have been paid to an "always smiling" toddler whose mother and stepfather have been accused of his murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeremiah Regis, aged two-and-a-half, was found injured at an address in Wolverhampton on November 20.
Sindyann Regis and Chevaze Mcgregor appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday charged with murder.
The court heard Jeremiah was found with more than 100 injuries, including a bite to the chest.
A tribute released by his family said: "Jeremiah was a lovely, quiet, innocent little boy who was always smiling.
"He will be greatly missed by his Nanna and entire family."
At Friday's hearing, Ms Regis, 25, of High Street, Wednesfield, and Mr Mcgregor, 27, of New Road in Rainford, Essex, spoke only to confirm their names.
Judge James Burbidge adjourned the case until December and set a provisional trial date of 25 April.
Jeremiah was found with head and body injuries when police and paramedics were called to an address in High Street, Wednesfield, shortly before midnight on Sunday.
He was pronounced dead in hospital on 21 November.
A post-mortem examination showed he died of abdominal peritonitis caused by blunt force trauma.
