Police said that a "significant amount of cash" was stolen from the safe at All Children's Integrated Primary School.
The burglary happened sometime between Friday 15 January and Monday morning.
The school's principal said that some pupils were "shocked" to see the damage when they arrived for class on Monday.
"We've had to spend the day reassuring them that nobody was hurt and that we will hopefully have our lovely school back up and running as soon as possible," said Jonathan Beattie.
He said that the burglars had removed two windows, broken the window frames and smashed a stud wall in order to gain access to the school's office.
"The office has been ransacked as they were looking for things and then eventually they were able to find some money," he said.
"They also caused some damage to office equipment as well.
"We are extremely disappointed that some people would want to steal from a place that is so very important to our local community," Mr Beattie said.
"The money that has been stolen would be used to fund other projects that the school is involved in.
"So, whenever any money is stolen from any school it obviously has an impact on the quality of the provision of the education for the children."
