Goodfellow, 19, won Team GB's fourth Rio 2016 medal, alongside Tom Daley.
"[Goodfellow] damaged his long thoracic nerve, so couldn't control his scapula and shoulder blade. We feared he would be out of the sport," said Holdsworth.
"We found a specialist and he strapped him to the table on Christmas Eve 2014 and managed to fix him."
Goodfellow only partnered with Daley, one of Britain's most recognisable Olympians, in October last year.
The athlete from Cambridgeshire moved in with his 22-year-old team-mate in London as a lodger before the Games and the pair were fancied to win a synchro medal after taking European silver in May.

And coach Holdsworth, who is not in Rio, spoke to Goodfellow over the phone after he helped clinch only GB's eighth Olympic diving medal after pipping Germany to third place in a tense finish.
"Me and him had a little bit of a tear over the phone," Holdsworth told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"To have the honour and privilege to work with him and create the athlete he is today is just incredible."
After months of toning your body and eating right, some athletes may take just one night off the stringent regime to party after winning a medal.
But not for Goodfellow, who celebrated in relatively quiet fashion, by playing a fighting game on a games console with his friends.
"The rest of the diving team still have competition to go so I just went back and played a bit of PS4 with the boys that have still got to compete," he said.
"I didn't celebrate that immensely, but everything in my head was spinning.
"I'm sure there'll be time for celebrations. We were playing UFC but usually we play Destiny."
