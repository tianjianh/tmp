Yangtze sinking: Stories from the Eastern Star

Rescue work is continuing at the Eastern Star cruise ship which capsized in the Yangtze River.

So far only 14 people are known to have survived, including several pulled out by divers from inside the hull, long after the ship overturned. They and their rescuers have been speaking about their ordeal.
Zhang Hui was rescued on Tuesday after floating for 10 hours clinging to a life jacket.
The 43-year-old worked for Xiehe Travel and was accompanying retirees who, like most of those on board, had booked their package tour with the company.
He told the Xinhua state news agency that he was in his room at around 9.20pm when a storm hit and he felt the boat tilt. "It was tilting very badly, maybe at around a 45-degree angle," he said.
The boat capsized "incredibly fast", he said. He and his colleague grabbed life jackets and floated to the nearest window to escape. By this time, the water was up to their necks.
He spent the night in the river as the storm continued to rage, struggling to keep afloat as waves swamped him four times. A passing ship failed to spot him.
"I told myself, I just needed to hold on and everything would be okay," he said.
Dawn broke, and Mr Zhang made it to the shoreline. He staggered to the nearest jetty where he received help.
Ship crew member Chen Shuhan was stuck in an air pocket when the ship capsized. The 21-year-old was found by rescue diver Guan Dong on Tuesday.
"The bottom of the ship had a layer of air cushion, which was 1.5 to 2m thick. The victim was sitting on a water pipe in the upside down ship bottom," Mr Guan told China Central Television (CCTV).
Mr Guan gave Mr Chen his specialised equipment to ascend, accompanied by other divers, and was himself left with equipment meant for shallow dives. He was swept by undercurrents to even deeper depths.
With air in his tank running out, Mr Guan decided to rapidly swim to the surface from 30m below. He emerged with reddened eyes, ringing ears, and a severe nosebleed.
Mr Guan had earlier found 65-year-old Zhu Hongmei in another air pocket, taught her how to use diving equipment, and took her to the surface.
Local media splashed Mr Guan's pictures online, while netizens lauded his bravery. "He's both handsome and kind," said Weibo user Meibaba.
But the Chinese public was more reserved on the Eastern Star's captain and chief engineer, whose names have not been released to the media.
The two were rescued on Monday night. The captain was dragged out of the water just before midnight.
They claimed that the ship ran into difficulties after it hit a cyclone. The two have since been detained by police for questioning.
Relatives of passengers and others online have questioned why the two were able to escape the ship so swiftly, and why the ship had not issued a rescue alert.
"Why didn't the captain raise the alarm the moment the ship began to run into difficulties?" wrote Weibo user Airisland123.
Meanwhile the captain of a freighter that passed Eastern Star shortly before it capsized told Xinhua that he experienced fog-like conditions and that the rain interfered with his radar "so you couldn't make anything out".
He said the weather was so bad that at around 9.30pm - the time when Eastern Star capsized - Mr Li had to anchor his ship on the north shore.
Forty minutes later, he heard people crying out for help, and spotted at least one person in the river clutching a life ring. "The rain was just too heavy, there was no way to mount a rescue, so I shouted over 'Swim to the bank!'," he said.
