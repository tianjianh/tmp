The artwork is called Ten Million and stands on top of the Golden Cap above cliffs between Charmouth and Bridport in Dorset.
It was created by Zac Greening to highlight pollution around the coast.
The "light cube" symbolises one of the 10m metric tonnes of plastic that researchers believe are dumped into the sea every year.
It will be in place until early January, and will be illuminated from late afternoon until around 21:00 GMT.
The sculpture has been installed as part of the National Trust's 2015 Coastal Festival.
Helen Mann, the trust's general manager for west and north Dorset, said the sculpture was "an innovative way to help highlight the issues of plastic pollution in our seas and around our coast".
