None of the injuries was life-threatening and emergency services were at the scene, the company said in a statement.
There were 128 passengers and 14 crew on board the train when the accident happened just after midnight local time (05:00 GMT).
US Highway 50 has been closed as a result, Reuters reported.
Eight people were killed last May when a New York-bound Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia.
That train was travelling at over twice the speed limit, safety experts say.
