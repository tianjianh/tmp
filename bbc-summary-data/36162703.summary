Francesco Guidolin: Swansea City are not 'on the beach'

Francesco Guidolin has dismissed suggestions that Swansea City's players are 'already on the beach' and maintains they played well during last weekend's 4-0 thrashing by Leicester.

The defeat means they have won just one of their last four matches and are not yet certain of avoiding relegation.
But Guidolin insists the players haven't given up on the season.
"This [being on the beach] is a new phrase for me but this is not us at the moment," he said.
"I've seen my team work very well in training.
"Against Newcastle it's true, we didn't play well.
"After the win against Chelsea we had a moment where we relaxed, but not against Leicester."
Guidolin feels a number of sides are still looking over their shoulders.
"I don't know in the Premier League if this is a usual situation because there are other teams the same as us," he said.
"Bournemouth, Stoke, Watford, Crystal Palace and West Brom (are) also all in our situation (on) around 40 points.
"I spoke with my players and they are convinced to play the right way and play the remaining games as three finals."
Guidolin's future at the Liberty Stadium beyond the end of the season remains uncertain but he is not concerned that his situation is yet to be resolved.
The Italian says it is more important that Swansea mathematically secure their top flight status rather than focus on his future.
"Every week I speak with my players about this," Guidolin added.
"At the moment we are not mathematically safe and we need points.
"We are in a good position but I am focused to improve our position in the table."
Former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers has been strongly linked with a return to the Liberty Stadium.
Guidolin confirmed that Alberto Paloschi and Leroy Fer are set to miss out on Saturday's home clash with Liverpool due to hamstring injuries.
