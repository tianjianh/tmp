The famous Dundee-born comic character Oor Wullie has been given a makeover as part of a city-wide cultural charity project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
V&A Dundee invited graduate designers who are Scottish or trained in Scotland to submit ideas for an Oor Wullie statue to represent the museum.
Winner Ellen Brown's design was inspired by the work of textile designer William Morris.
Ms Brown is a graphic designer and video game artist.
The Abertay University graduate said she was honoured to represent the museum in the Oor Wullie Bucket Trail, which will see 50 sculptures displayed throughout the city during the summer.
She said: "As I'm primarily a digital artist, painting the sculpture has been a really interesting challenge and I have found it so rewarding seeing my William Morris-inspired Strawberry Thief design come together.
"It's wonderful to bring the design back to Dundee and combine it with such an iconic part of Dundee's artistic history."
The sculpture will be displayed in the Overgate shopping centre until 15 June.
It will then be displayed with the other designs for 10 weeks before going to auction to help raise funds for the ARCHIE Foundation's appeal to create a twin theatre suite for Tayside Children's Hospital in Dundee.
