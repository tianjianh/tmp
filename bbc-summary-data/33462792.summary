The first public misconduct hearing held by Northamptonshire Police has seen the case of two officers accused of beating a man being dismissed.

The alleged victim said PCs David Scott and Greg Mead punched him "20 to 30 times" and smashed his head on his kitchen floor, in September 2013.
But the panel said the evidence was unreliable and the case was dismissed.
Observers at the hearing were told not to use social media while evidence was presented and to remain silent.
They had to pledge not to leave the room until a break in proceedings and were not allowed to enter the room until there was a break.
Northamptonshire Police said 12 conditions were set to ensure" as little disruption as possible.
The move followed a Home Office directive earlier this year that such cases should be held in public.
