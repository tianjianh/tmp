[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning permission has been granted for the long-awaited Bristol Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A decision on the 12,000-capacity venue was deferred by councillors earlier this month because of concerns about how people would get to and from it.
However, it was given unanimous approval by Bristol City Council's Development Control Committee after revised plans were submitted.
These include a shuttle service from Bristol Parkway, more bike spaces and stewards to guide pedestrians.
The Â£92.5m city centre venue had been due to open in 2018. But there were concerns that, without a car park, concert-goers would clog up nearby streets.
The council has now allocated Â£7.75m of the project's budget to fund coach drop-off bays, taxi spaces and increased cycle parking.
It will also make use of park-and-ride sites and work with First Group and Great Western Railway to provide additional buses and a shuttle service to the railway station after events.
