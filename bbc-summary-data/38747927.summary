Bed-blocking patient 'declined' all available help, council says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A patient evicted from hospital after spending more than two years in a bed "declined" all options offered, a council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adriano Guedes, 63, who was paralysed by a stroke in 2008, was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk, in 2014.
He was evicted two weeks ago after the hospital obtained a court order and is now in a council flat in Suffolk.
It was granted as Mr Guedes repeatedly turned down offers of care and housing.
In a statement, Suffolk County Council - which is responsible for his care since he left hospital - said it had worked "extensively" with the patient, along with other agencies.
"We explored all options available, but they were declined by him," it said.
"We will continue to work with our partners and Mr Guedes to ensure he continues to receive appropriate levels of care and support."
On Tuesday, Mr Guedes told the BBC the hospital had "forced" him to to stay.
He said: "It's very bad to occupy a place which should be used by someone in need, but I didn't cause the situation. On the contrary - I tried to get out of there.
"I wanted to leave but they always offered what they knew I would refuse."
Mr Guedes said he had been admitted to hospital on mental health grounds.
He said he has been on a hunger strike since he left on 10 January.
It is understood he is visited by carers four times a day in his new home.
