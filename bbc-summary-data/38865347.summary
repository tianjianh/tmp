But defenders Ben Richards-Everton and Ryan Williamson remain sidelined.
Defender Scott McMann returns to the Accies squad after illness.
Gramoz Kurtaj faces a late fitness test following an ankle problem, fellow midfielder Ali Crawford is likely to miss out again through injury, while four other players remain sidelined.
Georgios Sarris continues his recovery on the sidelines after knee surgery, while fellow defender Jesus Garcia Tena and midfielders Greg Docherty and Darren Lyon miss out.
Dunfermline lie sixth in the Scottish Championship, while Hamilton are second bottom in the Premiership.
Dunfermline Athletic manager Allan Johnston told his club website: "The pressure is all on Hamilton as the Premiership club to go and win the game.
"They probably don't deserve to be in the position they are just now. They have put in a lot of good performances this season and maybe not got the rewards they deserved at times.
"Hamilton have a lot of quality going forward and are well established in the Premiership now.
"We know that it is going to be a hard tie and we are going to have to play a lot better than last week, probably at our best, to get a result.
"With the players that we have got, we are capable of causing any team a problem, especially going forward.
"It is a chance for our boys to go and compete against a Premiership club. The last time we got into the quarter-finals was 2009, so it would be a great achievement.
"When you look at the clubs that are likely going to be left, it is a magnificent chance to get through to progress further in the cup."
Hamilton Academical defender Blair Adams: ""It is my first taste of the Scottish Cup and I am looking forward to it.
"Obviously I played on Saturday and had 60 minutes on Tuesday, so I have settled in quick and am just hoping to start on Saturday as well and get a good run in the team.
"Of course I have heard of Dunfermline, but I can't stand here and say I know much about them.
"I am just sort of getting to grips with the league and even my own team-mates as well, so I can't say that I know much about them.
"But we won't be taking them lightly because they are in the Championship here.
"Everyone wants to have a good cup run. It is a good opportunity to progress into the quarter-finals on Saturday so we are looking forward to it."
