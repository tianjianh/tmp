Guernsey inspector warns over ash tree imports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guernsey's plant health inspector has urged islanders to follow a voluntary ban on the import of ash trees.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK and Jersey have imposed bans on imports following the discovery of the fungus Chalara fraxinea in the UK.
Charlara dieback, caused by the fungus, has killed 90% of Denmark's trees and could devastate the UK's ash trees, which make up 30% of natural woodland.
Nigel Clark urged people to be vigilant and to cancel any orders for ash trees they may have placed.
He said garden centres and growers were cooperating with the voluntary ban, but there were concerns private individuals may order trees online or bring saplings in from mainland Europe.
Mr Clark said anyone who had planted ash trees in the past two to three years could contact him to have them inspected.
He has put forward proposals for a full ban, which are due to be discussed by the Commerce and Employment Department board on Tuesday.
