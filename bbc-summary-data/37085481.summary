Loch of the Lowes osprey "Lassie" has left a Perthshire nature reserve after successfully rearing a full brood of three chicks over the summer.

The bird, officially known as LF15, is believed to have started its migration to Africa after departing the Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve near Dunkeld.
The osprey had returned to the reserve for her second season on 18 March followed by her mate a week later.
The male osprey, called LM12, and the chicks are expected to leave soon.
Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: "We haven't seen LF15 since Friday so it's now extremely likely that she has started her long migration south to Africa.
"Last year she left the reserve on 7 August, it's possible that blustery winds kept her here slightly longer than usual."
"The male LM12 and the three young birds should hang around for a little bit longer before departing, so there is still a good chance to watch ospreys at the reserve this month."
The webcam that monitors the ospreys' nest has been viewed more than one million times since their arrival.
