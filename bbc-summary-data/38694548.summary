Callum Bedford, 28, of Lairgate Place, Cleethorpes, was caught after Canadian authorities spotted indecent images he posted on social media and contacted the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA).
Humberside officers then arrested Bedford within 24 hours.
He earlier pleaded guilty to attempted rape and taking and distributing indecent images of children.

Det Con Steve Bury, from Humberside Police, said: "This was a particularly harrowing case - one of the worst I have dealt with in my 10 years in this role.
"We take some comfort in the speed with which we were able to arrest and charge Bedford, ensuring this little girl was protected and safe from further harm."
"Offences of this kind are extremely serious and we and our partner agencies around the world work tirelessly to identify those who create and distribute indecent images of children, so that they can be stopped and brought to justice and their victims can be protected from further harm."
