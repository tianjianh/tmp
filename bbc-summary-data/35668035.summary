Shipbuilding looked to have ended at the Inverclyde site when the yard went into administration in August 2014.
It was later taken over by Clyde Blowers Capital and now has about Â£110m worth of orders and a workforce of 150.
Ferguson made the announcement to coincide with the start of Scottish Apprenticeship Week.
Director Liam Campbell said: "Apprenticeships are extremely important to us and our business, forming the backbone of our future growth.
"We are a company experiencing rapid growth and change that will ensure our position as a leading European fabricator in offshore, subsea, renewables and shipbuilding."
Fair Work and Skills Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the announcement was "great news, not only for Ferguson Marine, and the young people that will benefit, but also for Scotland as a whole".
