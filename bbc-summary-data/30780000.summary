Death of missing Daniel Entwistle's father 'not suspicious'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a man whose seven-year-old son disappeared more than a decade ago is no longer being investigated by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Entwistle was last seen on CCTV at a shop in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 3 May 2003.
His bike was found near Trinity Quay, sparking a harbour and river search.
Daniel's father David was found dead at his home at Lowestoft in Suffolk on Wednesday. Police said his death was not suspicious.
The coroner has been informed and a post-mortem examination will be carried out to ascertain what caused Mr Entwistle's death.
He and his estranged wife Paula had been involved in several campaigns to find Daniel.
