[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Joe Root completed a double century for Yorkshire before rain washed out most of the third day's play against Surrey at Headingley.

Root took his score from 190 not out to 213 before seamer Ravi Rampaul (4-153) had him caught at mid-off.
Only 13.2 overs of play were possible, with champions Yorkshire advancing to 557-6, a lead of 227.
All-rounder Adil Rashid was 60 not out, having been dropped on 30 and 57, with Liam Plunkett on four.
Having drawn their opening three matches, Yorkshire still have a chance of victory if the weather improves on the final day.
Root brought up the fourth double century of his career, from 232 balls, with a single off Rampaul, and hit a six and 22 fours in total.
His partnership with Rashid was worth 95, the latter riding his luck to reach a 70-ball half-century with the help of 10 fours.
Rashid's first let-off came when Jason Roy failed to hold on to a slip chance, and Matt Dunn was later unable to hold a catch off his own bowling.
Surrey batsman Ben Foakes told BBC Radio London:
"We started quite well (on day two) and took three early wickets, but with Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root in bat you have to take your hats off to them and accept that they did play very well.
"Yes, we could have done a little better, but it was two very good innings from the England players.
"Bairstow and Root made it look easy, and once the new ball went it made it even easier for them.
"The rain has helped us out so far and there's everything chance we can draw the game. The new ball could be crucial.
"If you get to the crease you can stay in. The wicket looked to be a good one for batting. Hopefully nothing changes."
