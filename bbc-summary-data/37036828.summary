The 36-year-old front-rower had played 14 games for the Dragons following his move to Perpignan in February.
However an avulsion fracture and ankle ligament tears ended his involvement for Laurent Frayssinous' side.
Mason played 290 NRL games, represented New South Wales in State of Origin and appeared in 24 Tests for the Kangaroos.
It was his second Super League spell, following a six-game stint with Hull KR in 2011.
"He will remain among the great players who have worn the Catalans Dragons jersey," chief executive Christophe Jouffret said.
