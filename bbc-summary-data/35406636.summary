Kieran Lee's second-half leveller earned Sheffield Wednesday a draw and halted Burnley's charge towards the automatic Championship promotion spots.

Sam Vokes turned Owls captain Glenn Loovens, squaring for strike partner Andre Gray to tap in for the visitors.
Wednesday equalised when Atdhe Nuhiu headed down Barry Bannan's centre for the onrushing Lee to tuck home.
The Clarets could have won it but Vokes could not get a clean contact on substitute Matt Taylor's ball in.
The result leaves the hosts a point outside the Championship play-offs, while Burnley are three points behind second-placed Middlesbrough, having played two games more.
Burnley had the better of the first half, Kieren Westwood saving superbly on his line from Vokes' header, although their Yorkshire opponents had a penalty appeal waved away by referee Andy Woolmer after Daniel Pudil went down in the box.
The Owls threatened more after the interval and new loan signing Aiden McGeady came on for his debut in the final few minutes after joining the club on transfer deadline day.
Wednesday have not lost in the Championship at home since the end of August, going 12 games unbeaten, and are level on points with Birmingham, who they visit on Saturday.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"We tried to find the second goal but we just couldn't. I think if anyone was going to win it, it was us. We'll take the point against one of the strongest teams in the competition.
"The second half was nearer to what we can do. A draw is the correct score in my opinion, but if anyone was going to win it was us.
"The negative was that we conceded so early. The positive is that we got back into it using our heads and our hearts."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"I think we arguably had the best chance of the game which we didn't take, but really both teams attempted to play on a really tough pitch. Overall, it was just about right.
"I have been pleased with the players and I'm pleased again. It's hard to dominate every game and we have dominated a lot lately.
"We were really secure in our third and the middle third, I just felt we didn't keep the ball well enough in the final third."
