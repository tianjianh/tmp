The 25-year-old is currently playing with France at Euro 2016 and scored for Les Bleus in the 2-0 win over Albania.
Griezmann, who scored 32 goals in 54 appearances last season, has been linked with a move away from Madrid, including to the Premier League.
Last week Atletico agreed to sign striker Nicolas Gaitan from Benfica.
Griezmann told the club website: "I'm very satisfied, very happy to keep belonging to this family and this project.
"I want to improve every year, and the club, the coaches and my team-mates can help me to reach this goal."
