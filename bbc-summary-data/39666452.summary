The building of a new water park in Rhyl has moved a step closer after plans were submitted to the council.

The Sun Centre was demolished in September to pave way for the regeneration, despite a 300-name petition to save it.
Plans include the building of a new water park, an outside splash pool, sun lounger areas, cafe terraces and a bar.
Denbighshire Council said it would attract 350,000 new visitors a year to Rhyl.
If full planning permission is approved, work will begin in September 2017 and the new facilities will open in early 2019.
The council supported outline proposals for the development of the scheme earlier this year.
As part of the redevelopment Rhyl's skate park and paddling pool will be moved.
The council said it would consult with young people on the design of the park.
Jamie Groves, head of facilities, assets and housing, said the submission of the plans was a "significant milestone" for the development.
"There is a lot of anticipation into how the new water park will look," he said.
