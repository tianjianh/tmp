[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salisbury City has been placed in administration at the High Court after an application through creditors was granted by Mr Justice Birss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Owner Outail Touzar was not present, and BBC Wiltshire understands the petition was lodged by LED Synergy.
LED Synergy are creditors and owner Jeremy Harewood is part of a consortium bidding to take control of the club.
The two parties had been at the High Court on 4 September regarding the ownership, but the case was adjourned.
"This is a group of business people who have tried everything in their power to regain control of the football club," consortium head Paul Smith told BBC Wiltshire.
"We didn't feel we were going anywhere, there was enormous pressure from certain creditors, companies that were threatening to wind the club up.
"We took the decision collectively in co-operating with a number of creditors to take action and take it to the High Court. We feel it was in the best interests of the football club."
It has been a difficult four months for Salisbury since Touzar and Mark Winter took ownership, as the latter went on to take legal action to overturn the Moroccan's 98% stake ownership.
On the field the club has been thrown out of the Football Conference and are currently without membership of any division.
