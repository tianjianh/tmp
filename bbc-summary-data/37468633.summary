Ryan Moore has been named as the final wildcard pick for the United States Ryder Cup team.

Moore, 33, was picked by captain Davis Love III after losing to Rory McIlroy in a play-off at the Tour Championship.
Love III, who skippered the US team beaten in 2012, named Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar and JB Holmes as his other wildcard choices on 12 September.
This year's Ryder Cup will take place at Hazeltine National in Minnesota from 30 September to 2 October.
Love III made the announcement during the half-time break of Sunday night's televised NFL match between Chicago Bears and Dallas Cowboys.
The selection of rookie Moore, who is the world number 42, means there is no place in the US Ryder Cup team for two-time Masters champion and world number seven Bubba Watson, 37.
"Ryan fits so well with what we have in place. He's an easy-going, thoughtful guy, but don't be fooled. Ryan's a great match-play player with an incredible match-play record," said Love.
"He has guts and determination and everyone saw that on Sunday. We are thrilled to have him with us."
Brooks Koepka is the only other rookie in the US team.
Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Jimmy Walker, Brooks Koepka, Brandt Snedeker and Zach Johnson qualified automatically by making the top eight of the money list.

Two years ago the American team travelled to Scotland in the knowledge that they would not be fielding their strongest possible line-up.
At the time, the most in-form US player was Billy Horschel. He had not been selected because the team was picked before his late surge through the PGA Tour play-offs, culminating in Tour Championship victory at East Lake.
Chris Kirk was similarly inspired, winning the Deutsche Bank Championship, finishing fourth at the season finale and second to Horschel in the play-off standings. He too was absent from the American team.
The US have ensured they don't suffer a similar fate this time by introducing what is unofficially known as the "Horschel rule".
