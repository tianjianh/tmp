Number one seed Glen Durrant lost just one leg as he beat Larry Butler 4-0 to reach the last eight of the BDO World Championships at Lakeside.

Englishman Durrant, 45, produced a ruthless display at Lakeside to repeat his win over the 58-year-old American in October's World Masters final.
He will face either Geert de Vos or 2013 champion Scott Waites next.
Jamie Hughes, Wesley Harms, Dennis Harbour and Jeff Smith also secured quarter-final spots on Wednesday.
Unseeded Canadian Smith, who knocked out three-time champion Martin Adams in round one, maintained his excellent form with a 4-1 victory over England's Brian Dawson.
Dutch fifth seed Harms beat Jim Williams of Wales 4-3, while English pair Harbour and Hughes both won 4-1 - against Wales captain Martin Phillips and Latvia's Madars Razma respectively.

Lorraine Winstanley defeated Rachel Brooks 2-0 to complete the women's quarter-final line-up.
Playing in the opening match of the second round, Durrant had the opportunity to make a statement to the rest of the field - and did so in fine style.
The world number one from Middlesbrough says he is enjoying being the favourite for the Lakeside title, and against Butler he showed why many are tipping him to become world champion on Sunday.
He landed checkouts of 141 and 104 in the first set and later hit a 148 finish as he won the opening eight legs.
Butler ended that run in the third set but it was only a brief respite for the American, who had no answer to Durrant's scoring power and clinical finishing.
• Durrant is yet to lose a set in this year's World Championships, winning 21 of the 26 legs he has played.
• Harms has been taken to a deciding set in both of his matches so far. He beat Japan's Seigo Asada 3-2 in the first round.
• Smith is aiming to become the third non-European winner of the BDO world title, following fellow Canadian John Part (1994) and Tony David of Australia (2002).
Glen Durrant: "I won my first game 3-0 [against Dean Reynolds] but I was a little bit disappointed. I thought I'd given a little bit too much respect to my opponent. For the past couple of days, I've been working on the fact that I'm the man to beat. It's time to get a little bit nastier on the oche and I felt wonderful today."
BBC pundit Bobby George on Durrant's win: "He played very well - a 95 average and 57% on the checkouts. The more he wins, the more confidence he gets. He's winning all the biggest tournaments in the BDO and the more oches you tread, the better you get."
Scott Mitchell continues the defence of his title with an all-English second-round tie against Mark McGeeney (live on BBC Two, coverage starts at 13:00 GMT), while Waites' match against De Vos is the highlight of the late session.
All four women's quarter-finals take place on Thursday, with number one seed Lisa Ashton facing Trina Gulliver. Ashton is the two-time defending champion, while Gulliver has won the Lakeside title on nine occasions.
