DeGale confirmed the Las Vegas fight on Instagram, saying: "I told you it was coming!"
The Londoner, 30, became a world champion in May 2015 by beating American Andre Dirrell.
DeGale outpointed Mexico's Rogelio Medina in his most recent fight in Washington last April.
Sweden's Jack, 32, won his title by defeating Andre Dirrell's younger brother Anthony in April 2015 and he has defended the belt twice, including against Britain's George Groves.
DeGale's only defeat in his 24-fight professional career came against Groves in 2011.
Confirmation of the DeGale versus Jack fight came on the same day Northern Ireland's Carl Frampton announced his WBA world featherweight title rematch against former champion Leo Santa Cruz would take place in Las Vegas on 28 January.
