She also admitted keeping Â£21,000, including money intended for a trust fund for Miss Ferguson's daughter.
Sentencing her to 16 months at Liverpool Crown Court, the judge said Taylor had betrayed the singer's trust.

In it she said: "As a result of what happened I trust nobody and question everybody.
"My heart is broken."
She said Rachel Taylor's "crimes go deeper than money".
"She became obsessed with me and my family and sought not only to steal from me but rob everything that I had worked hard for," she said.
Taylor's husband Raymond, 62, was also in court after previously admitting charging the singer for services as a solicitor, even though he was not qualified.
He also admitted applying for a Â£32,000 student grant he was not entitled to and was jailed for five months.
