The memorial has been placed on his childhood home at 43 Waverley Gardens in Barking, east London, where he first learned to play football.
As well as captaining the team, Moore set up two of Geoff Hurst's goals in the 1966 final before receiving the Jules Rimet trophy from the Queen.
He was described as "one of the greatest" by ex-FA chairman Greg Dyke.
Mr Dyke, who is an English Heritage Blue Plaque Panel member, said the plaque "honours... the house and the streets where he grew up and first learned his footballing skills".
Bobby Moore, who was born at Upney Hospital in Barking in 1941, developed his footballing skills while playing with his father and uncle in Greatfields Park, near to 43 Waverley Gardens.
He was living in the house when he won his first silverware, the Crisp Shield in the 1950-51 season, and when he joined West Ham United at the age of 16.
At the time, a scout for the club said Moore "would not set the world alight" but praised his "tenacity and industry".
He was appointed England captain in 1963, a year after being a surprise call-up for the 1962 World Cup.
Moore's father, known as Big Bob, watched the 1966 final on television at 43 Waverley Gardens, although his mother was too nervous so spent the game potting plants in the garden.
After retiring, Moore enjoyed a career in the media as lead sports columnist for the Sunday Sport and a football analyst on radio for Capital Gold.
He died from cancer on 24 February 1993, aged 51, a week after making his final radio commentary.
His daughter Roberta said her father would be "truly humbled and deeply touched" by the blue plaque.
