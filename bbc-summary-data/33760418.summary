Four people were taken to hospital after the roof of a double-decker bus was ripped off in central London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
London Fire Brigade was called at 13:10 BST to Woburn Place, Bloomsbury, after a tour bus collided with a tree branch.
The injuries were reported to be "non-life threatening".
Roads around the site were closed, including nearby Tavistock Square -  the scene of a bus attack in the 7 July 2005 London bombings.
Passenger Joseph Whelan, who was on board with his wife and two children, described the scene as "chaos" and said there was "blood all over the floor".
He said one of those taken to hospital was a woman who got married on Saturday. She was with a party of Canadians in the UK to attend the wedding.
In addition to those taken to hospital, a further nine people were checked over at the scene while fire crews had to lower one person down from the top deck of the bus.
Those on the top floor were also involved in patching up the injured with makeshift bandages before firefighters could lead them to safety.
London's Air Ambulance also attended the incident.
The bus was operated by Golden Tours, which was set up in 1984 and runs tours around London and to locations such as Bath and Stonehenge.
