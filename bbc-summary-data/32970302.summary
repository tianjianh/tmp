The Sale Sharks fly-half was unhurt in a collision between his Mercedes and a Toyota in Chelsea, west London, at about 05:15 BST on Monday.
Cipriani, 27, was breath-tested and taken to a west London police station before being released on bail.
In 2013 he was hit by a bus while on a night out with team-mates, suffering concussion.
A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said officers were called to reports of two cars in collision on Imperial Road, London SW6.
There were no reports of any injuries.
"The cars involved were a silver Toyota Prius and a black Mercedes C63," she said.
"The driver of the Mercedes, a 27-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.
"He was taken to a west London police station where he was later released on police bail. Return date to be confirmed."
Cipriani, who starred for England in the 73-12 triumph over the Barbarians on Sunday, is hopeful of a place in head coach Stuart Lancaster's squad for this year's Rugby World Cup.
