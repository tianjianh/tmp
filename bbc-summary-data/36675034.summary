[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Athletic midfielder Jordan Flores has signed a new one-year deal at the Championship club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He is a product of the Latics academy and scored once in six outings last season before a shoulder injury meant he missed most of the campaign.
The Wigan-born 20-year-old was part of the club's League One winning season.
"On the ball his quality is undoubted, he's a fantastic technical footballer," boss Gary Caldwell told the club website.
"He has to continue to work on his fitness for the new season, it's a massive part of football now especially in midfield."
