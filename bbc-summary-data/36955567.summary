George Williams' try opened the scoring, and Sam Powell, Josh Charnley, Sam Tomkins, John Bateman and Oliver Gildart also crossed before half-time.
Joe Arundel's try put Wakefield on the board, but Dom Manfredi crossed to extend the lead soon after half-time.
Dan Sarginson and Matty Smith also went over, while Tomkins and Williams scored their second tries late on.
Craig Hall intercepted a pass and ran in 30 metres for Wakefield's only try of the second half, but it would have been little consolation after his side were outclassed by the Warriors.
Tomkins' two tries took his total in a Wigan shirt to 150, while Jake Shorrocks scored his first points for the club as he converted all five of his kicks at goal.
Wigan climb above Warrington to second in the table after the first game of the Super 8s, but they remain behind Hull FC - who lost to Castleford on Friday - on points difference.
Wakefield stay eighth, 10 points outside the play-off places with six games to play.
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane: "I'm very pleased but I'm not getting carried away.
"I understand what we were up against, a very spirited Wakefield who were very low on numbers, but I'm very happy with what we did with the ball and our defence was good.
"We tweaked a few things in training and it just clicked. We saw a different class of attack tonight."
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester: "I thought we very dishonest in that first 40 minutes with the things that we did.
"I thought we showed in spells what we can do but I just felt there were too many blokes out there today who felt a little bit sorry for themselves.
"We're a little bit busted at the minute but I didn't see 17 guys willing to die for each other out on the field like there has been in recent weeks, which is disappointing."
