Tributes have been paid to a US woman with colon cancer whose appearances in a six-game series of wins on the popular quiz show Jeopardy were first broadcast eight days after she died.

Cindy Stowell was recorded appearing in the show between August and September.
The science content developer, 41, needed to take painkillers to do so, at one point becoming so weak that her voice was barely audible.
The show's producers say she bravely gave her prize money to cancer groups.
"When she taped her episodes in August and September of this year, she had stage four cancer, and she lost her battle with the disease on 5 December," the Jeopardy! website says.
"Cindy won her first game, unseating reigning seven-game champ Tim Aten and claiming $22,801, then went on to win the remaining three games that day.
"She returned [to Texas] for a short break before the next tape session on 13 September, when she won two more games and brought her final total to $103,801."
Jeopardy host Alex Trebek concluded the show on Wednesday with a tribute to Cindy.
"Appearing on the show was the fulfilment of a lifelong ambition for that lady," he said.
"What you did not know is that when we taped these programmes with her a few weeks ago, she was suffering from stage four cancer.
"Sadly, Cindy Stowell has passed away. So from all of us here at Jeopardy our sincere condolences to her family and her friends."
The winning contestant was shown a recording of three of her appearances on the show while in hospital.
