Midfielder Danny Williams returns from suspension but James McPake and Julen Etxabeguren are long term absentees.
Hamilton defender Giannis Skondras is free to play after successfully appealing against the red card picked up against Ross County last week.
Darian MacKinnon returns from a ban but Ali Crawford is suspended and Grant Gillespie is injured.
Accies nudged out of the relegation play-off place last weekend and are just one point behind the hosts.
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "If I start being edgy and down then it spreads to the players.
"We were positive after the Hearts game and training has been really upbeat all week. I know what it's like and I feel for the players, especially because it is not a good run that we are on.
"We know we have to start winning games of football. It is a must and it must start on Saturday."
Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning: "It is similar to the last time we played Dundee.
"They were bottom of the league with six points, they hadn't won in so many games and came here and won 1-0 and managed to get themselves right back up the table.
"I don't think you can look too much into form because every game means so much, there is so much pressure on every game, it changes drastically.
"You can't think that, because they have lost five or six, they are going to lose again.
"I am pretty sure they will be desperate to turn it round and they will see it as a big opportunity for them.
"But it is a massive game again for us. They are all huge between now and the end of the season."
