Music photographer Emmanuel Wino has shared his pictures of the Eagles of Death Metal concert which came under attack at the Bataclan theatre in Paris on 13 November.

Gunmen entered and killed 89 people, critically injuring more than 100.
Mr Wino says that before the attack, the theatre was full of smiles that should not be forgotten.
As a result, he decided to share pictures of the Eagles of Death Metal on his Facebook page.
Wino was among seven or eight photographers taking pictures of the concert.
In an interview with France's Les Inrocks (in French) magazine, Wino said he had come down from the first floor to the theatre bar to join friends, adjacent to the emergency exit.
He said he had heard screams, followed by a stampede of people running for the exits.
"People were screaming for us to leave, to run away," he said. "Then I heard the shots. Twenty, thirty, fifty - I do not know."
He said he thought it was a shooting, but not a terrorist act. "I thought it was the act of a madman," he told the magazine.
Wino said he had made a quick escape, without seeing the attackers.
Eagles of Death Metal band members were unhurt, but Nick Alexander (not pictured), a Briton selling merchandise at the gig, was among those killed.
With a camera memory card full of pictures, Mr Wino said that initially he had wanted nothing more to do with it.
But slowly the shock wore off and after talking with friends, he said he felt it would be important to remember the positive aspects of that night.
"I wanted to remember the smiles and the rock and roll, and that we were all there to party," he said.
He decided to publish the photographs on his Facebook account, for all to see and use. The photos are of a happy crowd, arms in the air, smiles on their faces.
Mr Wino said he had received hundreds of messages within hours.
"People thanked me because they had seen someone close to them on the photos, looking like they were having fun."
