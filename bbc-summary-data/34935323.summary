Slough Queensmere tower blocks get go-ahead after three rejections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to revamp a shopping centre in Slough and build new flats have been approved after years of rejections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Queensmere and Observatory shopping centres are to be expanded, with five tower blocks planned for 675 flats.
Designs for the blocks were rejected three times for being too tall and for its outer design, and were criticised by residents for ruining views.
The height of the shortest tower has now been reduced by four storeys, with two others getting two extra storeys.
The plan is for four of the blocks to be built on top of the shops, with one stand alone tower.
Councillors on Slough Borough Council's planning committee approved the plans on condition there are minor design alterations, such as the height of the centre's facade.
The towers will now range between 15 storeys and 23 storeys in height, measuring between 61.1m (200ft) and 79.8m (262 ft) above pavement level in Wellington Street.
The project submitted in 2012 was originally for 908 flats in the same number of towers.
