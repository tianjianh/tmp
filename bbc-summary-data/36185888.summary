In February, the internet company announced it was offering its core business for sale, after several years of falling advertising sales.
She has attempted to turn the company's fortunes around with a mobile-first strategy since 2012.
But critics say she has failed to stem the decline.
A filing to the US Securities and Exchanges Commission says Ms Mayer will receive a package of cash, stock and other benefits if she is removed as chief executive within a year of any sale.
The internet media company's fortunes have changed drastically in the past decade, with sales falling from $7.2bn in 2008 to $4.6bn last year.
Ms Mayer received $36m in compensation last year, compared to $42.1m in 2014.
Other executives will also receive big severance packages in the event of of a sale. The company's chief financial officer, Ken Goldman, would receive more than $16.1m, and chief revenue officer Lisa Utzschneider would net $19.9m.
"I don't think this management team has done anything to merit a huge payout," Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management - a Yahoo shareholder - told the Associated Press.
A large part of the internet company's $32bn value is attributed to its shareholding in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. It also owns the online blogging platform Tumblr and photo-sharing site Flickr.
Companies including US communications giant Verizon and the UK-based owner of the Daily Mail newspaper have been linked to the sale of Yahoo, and analysts believe a deal could be agreed this year.
