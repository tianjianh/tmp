Members of Duns Summer Festival called in the police, saying discrepancies had come to light.
This year's festival will go ahead as planned as local residents have pledged enough money to enable the town's Reiver's Week to proceed as normal.
The celebrations in the Berwickshire town will get under way on Sunday 5 July.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Police in the Borders are investigating following a report of account irregularities by members of Duns Summer Festival.
"Inquiries are ongoing."
