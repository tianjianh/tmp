George Barker murder: Police plea over his whereabouts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives investigating the murder of a man who was stabbed outside a gym are appealing for information regarding his movements prior to his death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Barker was found at the Double K Gym in Stable Lane, Bexley, south-east London, at about 09:40 GMT on Monday.
Officers want to hear from anyone who saw, spoke or knows where the 24-year-old was during the weekend before.
They specifically want to know where he spent Sunday evening into Monday and where he was before he went to the gym.
Mr Barker, of South Darenth, in Kent, died of stab wounds to his chest and abdomen. He was the father of a week-old baby girl.
Det Ch Insp Laurence Smith, who is leading the murder investigation, said Mr Barker had been a regular user of the gym and had arrived there at about 09:15, and was attacked shortly after.
"Our enquiries so far have led me to believe that there were five men inside the gym who were waiting for George Barker to arrive.
"Following the brutal assault on George the men left the gym and I am appealing to anyone who saw the men arriving in Stable Lane prior to the murder, or saw them leaving, to contact the police," he said.
Det Ch Insp Smith added that he "retained an open mind as to the motive" for the killing.
