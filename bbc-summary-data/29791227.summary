Margot Martini, who had two forms of leukaemia, "died peacefully and was surrounded by those who love her," her family said in a statement.
Margot, from Roehampton in London, had a bone marrow transplant in February but the cancer later returned.
Earlier this month her parents, from Essington, Staffordshire, said Margot was unable to fight an infection.
The appeal for Margot inspired "tens of thousands" of people to register as potential stem cell donors, a spokeswoman for Delete Blood Cancer UK said.
Richard Branson, Boris Becker and David Tennant were among those who backed the Team Margot campaign.
Tributes for Margot are being left on the Team Margot Facebook page, where people described the toddler and her family as "inspirational".
The statement from her parents Vicki and Yaser and their two older sons said Margot died on Monday morning.
"Thank you all for your love and support," it added.
