Grieving relatives of a victim of Australia's Dreamworld ride tragedy have criticised police for not contacting them.

Roozbeh Araghi's family said no-one had been in touch and their own attempts to get information from police had failed.
Four people died on the Thunder River Rapids ride at the Gold Coast theme park on Tuesday.
Queensland Police said it had contacted members of the family but would review how next of kin were notified.
Roozbeh Araghi, 38, died alongside partner Luke Dorsett, 35, Mr Dorsett's sister Kate Goodchild, 32, and Cindy Low, 42.
"We resorted to even ringing [emergency telephone number] triple-0 and trying to get through to the police station via that," Mr Araghi's brother, Simon, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Thursday.
"We had three of us on hold for well over an hour."
But Queensland Police said it had been in touch with the family.
"Officers have been in contact with members of the family from the beginning of this tragic event and will continue to maintain contact and support with the family through the investigation team's dedicated Family Liaison Officer," police said in a statement.
Dreamworld's parent company Ardent Leisure contacted the Araghi family on Thursday to express their condolences and offer support.
Ardent Leisure CEO Deborah Thomas said she would phone the families personally. She said she would also donate her company bonus to them via the Red Cross.
But Mr Araghi said he would have preferred Ms Thomas's call earlier.
"They apologised and I think wanted to see if they can work through things with us privately, but to be honest it's not really on our radar at the moment," he said.
Dreamworld cancelled a planned memorial re-opening on Friday and will remain closed until at least Monday.
