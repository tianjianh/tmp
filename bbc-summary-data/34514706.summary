Sir Bruce Forsyth returns to Strictly Come Dancing for Children In Need

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sir Bruce Forsyth is to return to Strictly Come Dancing for a special Children In Need edition of the show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Bruce hosted Strictly for a decade until he stepped down last year.
Last week, he was forced to pull out of presenting a BBC variety show after slipping and falling at his home.
But the 87-year-old is expected to recover in time to co-host Strictly's Children In Need special, which will feature four stars from Call The Midwife, to be aired on 13 November.
Actors Jenny Agutter, Laura Main, Stephen McGann and Jack Ashton will compete in the one-off contest as part of BBC One's Children In Need telethon.
Children In Need will be hosted by Sir Terry Wogan, Tess Daly, Fearne Cotton, Rochelle Humes and Nick Grimshaw.
The evening will also feature Harry Hill giving his own history of television, while The One Show's Matt Baker and Alex Jones will perform the lead roles in the West End version of The Rocky Horror Show.
EastEnders pub The Queen Vic will host "a house band with a special guest lead vocalist" and stars including Ellie Goulding, Rod Stewart and Selena Gomez will be in the studio.
