Kajsa Tylen, 39, from Nottingham, will begin her attempt to beat Billie Fleming's 1938 record, in January.
Ms Tylen began planning the feat following Mrs Fleming's death last year.
She said she wants to motivate people to exercise rather than raise money for charitable causes.
Billie Fleming, who died aged 100, pedalled for 29,603 miles (47,641km) to set the record and inspire others to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
It has not been bettered in 77 years but Ms Tylen, who said she did practically no exercise until she was 26, has taken up the challenge.
She said: "I felt really inspired by her and the whole challenge and I thought 'I could do that' and it planted a seed."
Ms Tylen got in touch with Mrs Fleming's stepson who said she would have been "delighted" someone else was attempting the feat.
Since then the business analyst has been getting up at 04:30 and doing three hours of training before she starts work.
Her evenings have been spent building up her core strength and sorting out the paperwork that Guinness World Records requires.
Ms Tylen, who is originally from Sweden, will be assisted by her mother who will follow her, with a caravan, across England and mainland Europe.
"She's a bit nuts but loves adventure," said Ms Tylen.
The cyclist is hoping to put some distance between her attempt and Mrs Fleming's record by cycling about 100 miles (160km) a day.
She said: "I'll see how my body reacts, see if it's possible to do more, I'll listen to my body."
Kajsa Tylen is due to start her challenge at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, on New Year's Day.
