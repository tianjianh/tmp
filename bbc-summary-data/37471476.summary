Westminster Bridge is one of London's busiest tourist spots, connecting the Houses of Parliament with the London Eye and the attractions on London's South Bank.
At a workshop led by Magnum photographer Bruce Gilden, Jim Grover was set a number of tasks, including "look for interesting faces". But Grover decided to go against the grain and deliberately exclude faces from his pictures.
The resulting 24 images seen here capture those he met on the bridge, from tourists to lovers.
In some cases, Grover urged his subjects to hold still, as he closed in on them while simultaneously explaining why his camera was ignoring their face.
At other times, he was invisible among brief surges of tourists taking pictures of London's landmarks or each other.
