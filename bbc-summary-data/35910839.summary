[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bodies of Tim Newton, 27, and Rachel Slater, 24, who both lived in Bradford, were found on the north face of Ben Nevis on 23 March.
The experienced climbers had been missing since 15 February.
A "celebration of life" service will be held for friends and family in the Leicester area on 16 April.
A statement from his family said they wanted to "say a huge thank you to all of the peopleâ€¦ [who] extended kind wishes and prayer.
"The kind words since Tim and Rachel were found have been much appreciated. The support of so many people has meant so much."
The family also thanked the mountain rescue teams for their "relentless hard work and support".
Ms Slater was a graduate of Manchester University and employed as an environmental consultant near Bradford.
She spent some time living and climbing in Canada, where her parents are still based.
Mr Newton, originally from Leicester, studied physics at Manchester and Leeds universities.
He joined Hinckley Mountaineering Club in Leicestershire in 2010 before he moved away to university, with fellow climbers there calling him a "natural".
