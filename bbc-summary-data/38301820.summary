Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo 'dazzle' in Othello

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Critics have heaped praise on a New York staging of Othello starring David Oyelowo and Daniel Craig, with one calling it "nervy and outstanding".

Bond actor Craig gives a "chilling" portrayal of Iago in the modern-dress production of Shakespeare's tragedy, writes Diane Snyder in the Telegraph.
His villainous performance, writes Ben Brantley in the New York Times, is "embodied with gritty brilliance".
Variety's reviewer, meanwhile, saluted Oyelowo for his "fierce" Othello.
Sam Gold's production at the New York Theatre Workshop runs until 18 January and is already sold out.
A transfer to Broadway or London is unlikely to follow given its lead actors' limited availability.
Shakespeare's play, here set in a military barracks, tells of an army general driven into a jealous rage by a duplicitous lieutenant.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, the result is a "visceral death match fought by actors at the peak of their powers".
Time Out's critic was impressed by Gold's "incisive, brutalist staging" and the "two ferocious performances" at its centre.
Newsday's critic expressed similar sentiments while highlighting the topicality of a reference to Aleppo in Othello's final speech.
Barbara Broccoli, co-producer of the James Bond film series, is among the producers of the off-Broadway production.
