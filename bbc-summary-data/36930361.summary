[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 1-1 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promotion hopefuls Portsmouth opened their season with a frustrating draw at home to 10-man Carlisle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former MK Dons midfielder Carl Baker rescued a point for Pompey with a debut goal to cancel out Reggie Lambe's opener for the Cumbrians, who had Jamie Devitt sent off before half-time.
Portsmouth started the brighter, with summer signing Milan Lalkovic forcing Carlisle goalkeeper Mark Gillespie into a good save just five minutes in.
But five minutes later the away side took the lead. A neat through-ball from Mike Jones was latched onto by Lambe, who calmly slotted past David Forde.
Carlisle were reduced to 10 men just before the half-hour mark when Devitt was shown a second yellow card for a tug on Gary Roberts.
Just before the break, Portsmouth levelled through Baker, who drilled a low shot past Gillespie.
Michael Smith missed an open goal early in the second half for the home side, before Roberts and substitute Kyle Bennett were both wasteful late on.
