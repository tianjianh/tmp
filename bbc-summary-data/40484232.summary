The home side had the better chances as Darren McCauley went close early on before having another effort tipped on to the crossbar before half-time.
Eoin Bradley volleyed the ball into Haugesund's net in the second half but the effort was ruled out for offside.
Coleraine's Jamie McGonigle also tested Haugesund keeper Helge Sandvik.
The Bannsiders were without injured trio Lyndon Kane, David Kee and Gareth McConnaghie, while central defender David Ogilby missed the game because he is on holiday.
Haugesund will face Lech Poznan in the second qualifying round after the Polish club overcame Pelister of Macedonia 7-0 on aggregate.
