The Toby Carvery in Middlemoor, Exeter, closed on Tuesday but reopened on Friday.
However, it was shut again on Sunday, along with the adjoining hotel, "due to technical difficulties", a company spokeswoman said.
She said the firm was working with environmental health officers but was unable to say when either would reopen.
"We will advise when both the Toby Carvery and the hotel will be reopened," she said.
The sickness and diarrhoea bug affected a number of customers and staff between 30 March and Easter Sunday.
On Friday, the firm had said: "Environmental health officers and the business were confident that the virus had been eradicated and the carvery re-opened at 12 o'clock."
Norovirus is a highly-contagious, airborne virus with first symptoms showing between 24 and 48 hours.
