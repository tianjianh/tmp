[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rickie Lambert's deflected shot earned West Brom a point against a West Ham side who have gone four Premier League games without a win.

The Hammers took the lead when Mauro Zarate curled an exquisite 25-yard free-kick high into the net.
But the visitors equalised when a Lambert shot was deflected into his own goal by Hammers defender Winston Reid.
Salomon Rondon had a promising chance but his header from six yards was excellently saved by keeper Adrian.
West Ham were the dominant team in the first half and Zarate sliced a shot into the side-netting when well-placed before he put the home side in front with his sumptuous free-kick.

With the Baggies rocking, Cheikhou Kouyate got in between the visitors' two centre-backs but glanced a header wide from Aaron Cresswell's cross.
West Brom keeper Boaz Myhill then had to pull off two smart saves from the lively Manuel Lanzini, keeping out a swerving long range strike and a first-time effort from the Argentine midfielder.
Diafra Sakho also had a clear sight of goal late on at the end of a counter-attack but his effort was blocked by the sliding leg of defender Jonas Olsson, before the Hammers striker limped off injured.
"I was very pleased with the way we played in the first half but I thought we should have been at least two up," said West Ham boss Slaven Bilic.
West Brom improved after the break, with striker Lambert coming on to join fellow forward Rondon in attack.
Lambert made an immediate impact as his shot led to the equaliser, and he caused plenty of problems for the home side.
The former Southampton and Liverpool player also played a lovely ball over the top of the home defence late on only for James McClean - at full stretch - to fail to get enough power on his shot.
"Rick has been a wonderful signing for us. He hasn't played that many games but his attitude and focus is spot on," said West Brom manager Tony Pulis.
"If James had a little bit more composure he could have passed it into the bottom corner."
West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "Mauro Zarate is practicing these free-kicks and usually when the ball goes over the wall the way he wants it is tough to stop it.

"It's a difficult league and home games are a lot about confidence. Like today, after we scored we were excellent until we conceded."
West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "It was a soft free-kick which led to their goal and we were a bit fortunate to come in only one down at half-time.
"We were better in the second half, there's no doubt about that."
West Ham travel to Old Trafford to play Manchester United in their next league game, while West Brom are next in action when they host Tottenham in the top flight.
