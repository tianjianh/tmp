The Liberal Democrats have been ousted from their only two seats in the West Midlands.

John Hemming had correctly predicted on Thursday evening that he would lose Birmingham Yardley to Labour's Jess Phillips.
A year after competing to become deputy leader of the Lib Dems, Lorely Burt saw her seat in Solihull taken by Conservative Julian Knight.
The results completed a disastrous night for the Lib Dems.
"The national strategy is what did it for so many of the Lib Dem seats. So the architect of that strategy has to accept some responsibility for that - Nick Clegg," Mr Hemming said.
Mr Clegg later resigned as party leader.
Labour, meanwhile, claimed Wolverhampton South West from the Conservatives, to complete a clean sweep in the city.
Rob Marris, returning to the seat he last held in 2005, said he was "delighted" to be elected, despite "not a good night" for Labour nationally.
Elsewhere, Birmingham Labour MPs Shabana Mahmood and Liam Byrne retained their seats in Ladywood and Hodge Hill respectively, more than doubling their majorities.
Labour MP Steve McCabe also saw his majority in Birmingham Selly Oak rise, while Roger Godsiff saw his majority in Hall Green rocket from less than 4,000 in 2010 to almost 20,000.
Other seats in the West Midlands remained unchanged, with Labour holding all nine Birmingham seats.
The party successfully held off a challenge from UKIP in Dudley North, with Ian Austin increasing his majority to 4,181
But Labour failed to make significant inroads against the Conservatives in the West Midlands.
Julian Knight said he was "stunned" by the size of the result after taking Solihull with a majority of 12,902.
"I'm humbled by the faith people of Solihull have shown in me," he said.
In Meriden, fellow Conservative MP Caroline Spelman increased her majority from 16,253 in 2010 to 18,795.
The party also saw increased majorities in Stourbridge and Dudley South, while former minister Andrew Mitchell held his seat in Sutton Coldfield, with a slightly reduced majority.
It was a remarkable night. John Hemming was telling everyone he'd lose his Birmingham Yardley seat and he was right.
Labour's Jess Phillips, meanwhile, looked like she'd won the lottery but was bundled away from the press, saying she had to relieve her babysitter.
In Hodge Hill, Liam Byrne might have held on to his seat for Labour, but his now infamous note to the incoming government in 2010 saying "I'm afraid there's no money" dogged his party throughout this campaign.
