The haul was made when police stopped a car on Thursday evening.
Two men aged 39 and 40 were arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.
Police said the arrests were part of an "investigation into an organised crime group".
"Significant finds in recent weeks show the PSNI's commitment to keeping our community safer by frustrating, disrupting and dismantling organised crime gangs,"  Detective Inspector Trevor Stevenson from the Police Service of Northern Ireland's Organised Crime Branch said.
Last month, about 50kg of the drug was found packed into suitcases at premises in Ballygawley, County Tyrone.
In an unconnected incident, 20 kg of cocaine was seized in a shipment police believe was bound for Fermanagh.
