The harsh winter of 2013 was really bad news for many animals, and especially barn owls because they weren't able to hunt for food.
The birds have also been hit by other factors such as lack of habitat, road traffic accidents, and rat poison used by farmers.
Now a study by the Barn Owl Trust shows they're back from the brink thanks to a baby boom.
Martin meets Andrew Campbell from The Owl Experience and Bird of Prey Rescue Centre in Stafford - and barn owl Lilly! - to talk about the work being done to help barn owls.
