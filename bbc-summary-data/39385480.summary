St Mirren: Boss Jack Ross thankful for taking transfer window gamble

St Mirren manager Jack Ross says a January transfer window gamble helped turn his team's fortunes around.

The Buddies, who face Dundee United in the Challenge Cup final on Saturday, had won just two league games before the turn of the year.
But after shipping out 10 players and bringing in 10 in January, the club's form picked up and they have won four of their last six Championship outings.
"We took an educated gamble in terms of making so many changes," Ross said.
The Buddies remain bottom of the Championship table but their fine recent run has brought them within one point of Ayr United, having played a game more, and a further three behind Dumbarton.
Players such as Rory Loy, Stelios Demetriou, Stephen McGinn and Cammy Smith signed on at St Mirren during the January window.
And while Ross credits January's sizeable squad overhaul for getting the Buddies back in the survival fight, it is not something he would want to repeat.
"Before the January transfer window opened, James (Fowler, his assistant) and myself spent a long time assessing what we needed to do and, for want of a better expression, we rolled the dice," Ross said on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
"We ended up with 10 players going out and 10 coming in, which is pretty remarkable and something, as a manager, I would prefer not to do ever again.
"However, with the ones we managed to recruit, some of those players I had worked with before and I trusted. Some we've been fortunate with, they've just been the right characters and the right fit for what we've wanted to try and do.
"The chemistry within the group off the pitch and on it is very good and that's been reflected in the performances and the results."
Ross took charge of the Paisley outfit in October 2016 following the sacking of Alex Rae, with the Buddies still without a league win at that stage.
As well as kick-starting their league campaign, Ross has helped guide them to the Challenge Cup final and is desperate to ensure they do not leave Fir Park empty-handed.
"For us it's a terrific opportunity to go and lift silverware and for the players to win a medal," he added.
"In an ideal world a cup win for us and a draw down at Somerset Park (where Ayr United host Dumbarton in the league) would be perfect, but let's get the cup win first and whatever happens there we'll deal with afterwards."
