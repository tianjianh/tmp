Seven public toilets closing in Cardiff due to cost

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven public toilets across Cardiff are to shut due to high running costs - estimated at about Â£16 each time they are used.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff council said the automated units would close on 31 March before being removed.
Its 20-year operational contract was meant to run until April 2025.
The seven toilets are on Penlline Road, Ty Glas Road, Albany Road, Four Elms Road, Frederick Street, Delta Street and Harrowby Street.
Cabinet member for environment, Bob Derbyshire, said the running costs could "no longer be justified".
