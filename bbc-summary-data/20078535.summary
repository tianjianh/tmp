[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton Pier has been taken off the market after its owners said the attraction now forms part of its long-term plans.

The Noble Group which took over the Grade II* listed structure in 1984, put the pier up for sale in June 2011.
The move comes despite the firm receiving several offers for the attraction, which has funfair rides, two amusement arcades and bars.
About Â£35m has been invested by the present owners.
In a statement, the Noble Group said: "Last year's marketing exercise generated a great deal of interest in the pier and a number of substantial offers.
"However, a change in strategy led us to conclude the pier will now form part of the longer term group plans."
It is not clear what is being considered by the firm.
Work started on the construction of the 1,760ft (533.3m) pier in 1891 at a cost of Â£27,000. It was opened in May 1899.
In May 1940, on the War Office's instruction, part of the pier was dismantled as it was seen as being of potential use to forces invading from the sea.
During a storm in 1973, the pier was damaged by a barge which had broken loose from its moorings and it suffered limited damage in a fire in February 2003.
At the height of the tourist season, the pier, one of the south coast's most famous landmarks, employs about 300 people.
