Cheshire East Council will not renew Core Fit deal

Contracts to run school fitness programmes in east Cheshire will not be renewed by the council.

Cheshire East Council Leader Michael Jones stepped down last year following pressure over three deals given to his personal physiotherapist's firm.
The council blamed the ending of the deal on "budget constraints" despite an academic report saying Core Fit Ltd's classes "worked well".
A Cheshire Police probe into Mr Jones' links to the firm's owner is under way.
Core Fit founder Amanda Morris branded the council's decision to stop funding the classes "disgusting".
About 3,600 children in 28 schools, and 200 adults aged over 50 have participated in classes run by Core Fit Ltd under its council contracts since 2014.
A report by the Centre for Public Health at Liverpool John Moores University, commissioned by the council, found the programme had "an impact on both the physical [and] overall wellbeing of the children".
The report said adults who took part "reported greater mobility which enabled them to live more independently", and claimed potential savings to the NHS and social care teams would outweigh the cost of delivering the classes.
Cheshire East Council said: "Owing to budget constraints, the council is not in a position to continue to commission these services.
"However, the council understands that a number of schools in Cheshire East, and on a wider footprint, have purchased the service independently."
But Ms Morris said: "If the council's policies are that they're fundamentally looking at improving mental health, its disgusting that they're not putting money into this sort of thing."
"It doesn't make sense."
Mr Jones has previously denied wrongdoing after the council waived its own financial rules three times when granting contracts worth Â£156,000 to Core Fit.
He stepped down in December 2015 to avoid "infighting" after fellow Conservatives called for an external investigation.
The police investigation was launched 11 months ago.
