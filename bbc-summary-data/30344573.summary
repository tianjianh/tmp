Police have maintained a high-profile presence in a Clackmannanshire town after the death of a five-year-old boy.

A woman has been detained in connection with the death.
Police were called to an address on Carnaughton Place in Alva at 08:50 on Friday over concerns for the child's welfare.
He was found with a "significant" injury to his body and was pronounced dead by the Scottish Ambulance Service at the scene.
It is understood that the woman, 32, detained in connection with the incident is the child's mother.
A report has been prepared for the procurator fiscal.
Another child, believed to be the boy's sister, is said by police to be safe and well. Neighbours said the family had only recently moved into the area.
A number of streets have been cordoned off as inquiries into the full circumstances of the incident continue.
Local police commander Ch Insp Stephen Sneddon said: "This is a quiet area and I would emphasise that this is a very unusual incident which poses no risk to others.
"Police officers will be carrying out various enquiries in the area and I would ask the public to continue to give us the full support they have shown so far, to allow us to conclude these investigations as soon as possible and allow the area to return to normal."
Floral tributes have been laid along side teddy bears and a number of candles have been lit by locals outside the house where the boy was found.
Anne Blair, who delivered flowers from the local bowling club, said "I'm so sorry to hear about the youngster's death. Why in this day and age? There is just no logic to it."
David Gibson, a local postal worker, said the boy had waved to him a few times while he was making his deliveries. Mr Gibson said people were "flabbergasted".
The police inquiry was launched hours after a woman's body was found sparking a murder probe in an unrelated incident in Falkirk.
Forth Valley police commander Ch Supt Davie Flynn said: "Officers today launched two significant investigations in Falkirk and Alva, which are being treated as critical incidents.
"I would like to stress that in both cases individuals have been detained by police and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with them.
"I have been able to draw on resources from across Police Scotland to support our activity around these incidents.
"We work closely with our communities in the Forth Valley and will continue to provide reassurance to the public in Falkirk and Alva."
Ochil MSP Keith Brown urged residents to support the police investigation in Alva in any way possible.
He said: "I am shocked and saddened to learn of this tragic event, and having represented the community of Alva for over 16 years, I know the community will share these feelings.
"It is now important to allow the police and other emergency services to do their job and carry out a full investigation into the situation.
"I would encourage the local community to continue to support this process."
