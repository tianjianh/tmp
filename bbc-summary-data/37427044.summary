Football fans who missed kick-off after queues built up at AFC Bournemouth's ticket booths have blasted the delay as an "absolute farce".

Some supporters said children were crying outside the ground and many fans gave up and went home, missing the team's EFL cup clash against Preston North End on Tuesday.
The club said queues were caused by a high number of people buying tickets for the first time.
It said the process would be reviewed.
Posting on Facebook ahead of the game at the Vitality Stadium, Dave Crawford said: "We are stuck outside waiting to collect pre-paid tickets. 45 mins queuing so far.
"Will we get in by half time? It's an absolute farce."
AFC Bournemouth fan Sam Davis said: "It was absolute mayhem - I gave up. I can usually pick up my ticket within about two or three minutes.
"It was a disgrace, I saw kids crying walking away with their dads.
"It was a gargantuan match and it was a chance for new fans to start supporting the team."
AFC Bournemouth said the club "very much appreciates supporters' patience on this matter".
The club said it had made "every effort" to advise supporters to pre-purchase and collect their tickets as far in advance of the match as possible and to arrive early to avoid queues.
