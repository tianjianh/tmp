Paddy Barnes: Second professional fight on 18 February

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two-time Olympic medallist Paddy Barnes will have his second fight as a professional on 18 February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old flyweight from Belfast will be on the card at the Waterfront Hall in his home city when Jamie Conlan tops the bill.
An opponent has not yet been named for Barnes who won his first pro fight in unusual circumstances.
Stefan Slavchev was disqualified in the fourth round on 5 November for hoisting Barnes off his feet and shoulder high.
Light-flyweight Conlan beat Hungarian David Koos on points at the Titanic Exhibition Centre that right to stay on course for a world title shot.
Conlan, brother of 2015 world amateur bantamweight champion Michael, has won all 18 of his fights since turning professional in 2009.
