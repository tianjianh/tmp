Australia have pulled out of the tournament, which starts on 27 January, because of safety and security concerns.
Donald, 19, has been recalled to the England squad and reassured over safety.
"We're not worried at all and looking forward to getting out there," said the Glamorgan player.
"The ECB have been very strict and have sent many security guys over there, speaking with the Bangladesh Cricket Board and the ICC [International Cricket Council].
"They're very happy with it going ahead. We've made preparations and have plenty of security, and it's going to be monitored the whole time."
Ireland will replace Australia in the tournament while Scotland are also scheduled to take part.
Donald captained England's Under-19 side in a one-day series against Australia in 2015, but missed the subsequent tournament against India and Sri Lanka.
He spent the UK winter at the Darren Lehmann Cricket Academy in Adelaide and playing club cricket in Australia.
Swansea-born Donald will now travel to Dubai for a week of practice in January, including a warm-up match against South Africa.
