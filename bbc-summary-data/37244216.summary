It was at Everton where he first worked for Villa chief executive Keith Wyness, who was then chief executive at Goodison Park.
He has also worked in various backroom roles with England, Manchester City, Newcastle, Middlesbrough and Derby.
He will be based at the Championship club's Bodymoor Heath training ground, where he has already officially started in his new role, alongside manager Roberto Di Matteo and his supporting staff, Steve Clarke and Kevin Bond.
