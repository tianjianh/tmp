Parker joined the Gills in January on a deal until the end of last season, following a two-week stint with National League South club Wealdstone.
The 26-year-old has had spells with 11 other clubs, including QPR, Aberdeen and Red Star Belgrade.
"I'm delighted to be back at Gillingham as a full-time professional," he told the club website.
Analysis - BBC Radio Kent's Gillingham commentator Ben Watts:
"Josh Parker's new deal at Priestfield is good news for Gills fans, who have called his displays one of the few positives from a poor term last season.
"Although the 26-year-old didn't establish himself as a regular until late in the campaign, his attitude and work rate quickly endeared him to many supporters.
"After at first being preferred as a central striker, Parker showed off his speed and willingness to take on defenders when playing out wide in an impressive substitute appearance against Charlton at the Valley.
"Having started the final two fixtures in that role, he could well be deployed on the wing on a more regular basis by boss Ady Pennock next season."
