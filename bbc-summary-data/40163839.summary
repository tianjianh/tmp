Craig Steadman, 28, died after his motorbike collided with a vehicle near Llanfairpwll in August 2015.
He was a volunteer with Holyhead RNLI and a fundraising appeal was launched to pay for a new inshore lifeboat.
The Â£48,000 target has now been reached thanks to the efforts of Holyhead and Barmouth lifeboat stations and Mr Steadman's family.
His mother Sharon Steadman said it was "great to know his memory will live on helping save lives at sea".
She said her son loved being on the lifeboat crew and the family was looking forward to seeing the lifeboat "in pride of place in Barmouth" later this year.
