The Scottish Premiership match between Aberdeen and Motherwell was abandoned after floodlight failure at Pittodrie.

The lights in the stadium had been running on a generator following recent power problems in the area but went out at one end after six minutes.
After an 18-minute break, play resumed at 0-0 but, almost immediately, the ground plunged into near darkness.
The match had been rearranged because of Aberdeen's involvement in the League Cup final last month.
The floodlights had been powered by the generator with no problems for last Tuesday's win over Kilmarnock and the weekend draw with St Johnstone.
Aberdeen chief executive Duncan Fraser told BBC Scotland: "We brought in two generators and tested them - they've be working fine for the last week and a half, but tonight the generator tripped.
"We powered it up again but when it tripped again, we had no option but to call the game off.
"We can only apologise to both sets of supporters."
With the December schedule already packed, it is unlikely the game will be replayed before January's winter break.
"It is outwith our control and Aberdeen's as well," said Motherwell chief operating officer Alan Burrows.
"At Motherwell we have had problems with floodlights in the past too, so they have my sympathy. Unfortunately, these things happen.
"My sympathy is with the Motherwell fans and we will see what we can do in terms of helping them with travel for coming back up here for whenever the game is played again. We will discuss the options with them.
"The key thing is the safety of the players and the people in the ground. I think it is the right decision by Aberdeen, and they made it promptly.   These things happen unfortunately, we just have to get on with it."
