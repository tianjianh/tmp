The event is celebrated on the first Saturday of May each year and encourages free-spirited gardeners to embrace nature in the nude.
The hashtag #nakedgardeningday was trending on Twitter.
Award-winning gardeners at RHS Malvern Spring Festival in Worcestershire marked the occasion.
Hardy souls sat amongst their cultivated creations and were photographed as nature intended.
Now in its third day, more 90,000 people are expected to attend the Malvern festival over the course of the four-day event.
