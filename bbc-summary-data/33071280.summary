Mossley Manor: Liverpool care home closure criticised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Families of residents at a Liverpool care home have criticised a decision to close it following a damning inspection report by a health watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mossley Manor Care Home was shut after the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found it was "dangerous" and "dirty" with an "overpowering smell of urine".
Samih Kalakeche, from Liverpool City Council, said the care provider failed to comply with CQC guidelines.
The home's owners were not available for comment.
Reverend Alan Kennedy, from Mossley Hill Parish Church, said: "The staff have been absolutely committed to the patients over many years I've been coming to this nursing home. There's a nice atmosphere, a friendly atmosphere."
Susan Kelly, whose relative stayed at the home, said she saw "no problems at all".
Other people also told the BBC about their relatives being well-looked after by staff.
Last year a CQC report said the care home had fulfilled the required standards.
But a fortnight ago they received complaints that prompted the inspection.
Mr Kalakeche said the closure came after the "CQC gave so many chances to the owner to put things right".
He added the home's 42 residents would be moved to other accommodation by Friday.
Debbie Westhead, from the CQC, said: "We took this decision because we believed there were serious risks to the health, safety and welfare of people."
