[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The North East/North West Action Plan for Jobs is aimed at delivering 10-15% employment growth in a number of areas over the coming years.
The areas included in the plans are Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.
Jobs Minister Richard Bruton said the jobs could be in place by 2015.
"Jobs are growing right across the country, but they are growing faster in some regions than in others," he said.
"That is why we have put in place the 250m euros regional jobs strategy, to support regions to play to their strengths and accelerate jobs growth in every area."
Mr Bruton acknowledged that the north east/north west region had had "historic problems" with unemployment but said in recent years it had "performed extremely strongly".
"I am convinced that with the right support from government through the North East/North West Plan, and by continuing the collaborative approach right across the region, we can deliver 28,000 extra jobs over the coming years," he said.
"This would be 28,000 extra pay packets coming into communities and 25,000 lives back on track - a goal well worth fighting for."
