The 21-year-old England international asked to leave on Tuesday after the Toffees refused three bids from Chelsea, the last for £30m.
"John is not for sale," said Everton chairman Bill Kenwright.
It is understood Chelsea feel they have gone as far as they can and do not currently intend to make another offer for the central defender.
Stones played the full 120 minutes of Everton's 5-3 extra-time victory over Barnsley in the League Cup second round on Wednesday.
After the game, manager Roberto Martinez said Everton would turn down any bids for the player.
"Sometimes money can't buy everything and that is going to be a very strong statement at Everton," said Martinez.
Stones, who arrived from Barnsley for £3m in February 2013, has four years left on his contract after signing an extension in August 2014.
He was seen as a possible replacement for Chelsea captain John Terry, who was substituted at half-time during his side's 3-0 defeat by Manchester City and then sent off against West Brom on Sunday.
