A huge tea cosy knitted by more than 100 people has been dropped into place over a community cafe in Bristol.

About 3,500 8-inch squares have been knitted and crocheted since the start of 2015, to mark four years in business for community-run Cafe on the Square.
The building, in Sea Mills, used to be a public toilet but was bought as a charitable venture by three churches.
The tea cosy, which measures about 11m (36ft) by 5m (16ft) is part of a world record bid.
A quantity surveyor and witness were at the cafe on Saturday to measure up - although it will be some time before Guinness World Records will confirm whether a new record has been set.
Volunteers managed to pitch the tea cosy into place despite blustery weather.
The cafe is hosting a fair inside the cosy-clad building, before taking the tea cosy down and picking it apart into 130 blankets to be given to local charities.
Visitors to the area have joined in the community effort over the past 12 months.
"A lot of people have been involved, knitting, sewing it together, thinking about it, planning it. It's been incredibly time consuming," said one of the cafe's managers Heidi Simpson.
"Over this whole year, we have had people knitting squares in Africa, France, people all over this country as well."
