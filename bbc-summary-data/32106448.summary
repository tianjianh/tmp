[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP will support the introduction of a 50p top rate of income tax across the UK after the general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The promise was made by Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney at his party's conference in Glasgow.
The rate would apply to those earning more than Â£150,000 - which matches Labour party policy.
Mr Swinney said the Scottish government wanted to bring an end to what he called the "moral obscenity" of poverty.
He promised that the Holyrood administration would deliver opportunities for "every one of our people to make their way in the world".
Mr Swinney, who is the country's finance secretary, added: "And fairness extends to taxation. This afternoon, our Deputy Leader Stewart Hosie will set out just some of the arguments we will make to deliver fairness at Westminster, some of the policies for which we will argue, including a return of the 50p rate of income tax.
"Your SNP Government has worked hard to win the trust of our people. We have done that by keeping faith with their hopes and aspirations.
"Your SNP government has worked hard to earn a reputation for competence. We have done that by careful management of our public finances and by effective stewardship of major projects.
"Your SNP Government has a record of delivering for the people. We have done that by keeping our promises and being straight with the people.
"And your SNP Government has the ambition to tackle inequality and grow the Scottish economy."
He said the party wanted to take Scotland on a journey to "being the nation it should be".
