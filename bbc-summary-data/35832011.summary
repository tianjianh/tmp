The plant's operators, EDF Energy, said the incident was unplanned and the manual shutdown took place on Wednesday during routine maintenance.
The station's director has issued a statement that said there were no safety, health or environmental impacts.
It is the first unplanned shutdown this year.
Paul Winkle, Torness Power Station director, said: "Whilst carrying out routine maintenance in the conventional turbine part of the plant there was an issue with a valve and our operations team took prompt action and manually shutdown the reactor, putting safety first.
"Cooling to the reactor was maintained at all times and there were no safety, health or environmental impacts.
"The reactor will be returned to power as soon as maintenance is satisfactorily completed."
Lang Banks, WWF Scotland director, said: "This might be the first unplanned shutdown at Torness this year, but given similar incidents in the past few years it's clear that nuclear power is showing itself to be an increasingly unreliable source of energy.
"It underlines why Scotland is right to be choosing to harness more power from renewable energy sources."
Torness power station's two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.
The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.
