Police have confirmed paint was thrown over doors and windows at Crumlin Orange Hall some time between 2300 BST on Monday and 1000 BST on Tuesday.
SDLP South Antrim MLA Thomas Burns condemned those behind the attack which he said was "pointless".
"They can only harm and destroy, they can only cause pain and hardship and useless expense to taxpayers and ratepayers," he said.
