Yulia Efimova: Swimming's governing body criticised after doping charge dropped

Swimming's governing body has been criticised after dropping a doping charge against Russia's Yulia Efimova.

Efimova, who won 200m breaststroke bronze at London 2012, could compete at the Rio Olympics after a provisional ban - imposed following a positive test for meldonium - was lifted by Fina.
Jon Rudd, who coaches Ruta Meilutyte - one of Efimova's rivals, said Fina "seem to be very easily manipulated".
British swimmer Michael Jamieson accused Fina of "disgracing our sport".
The London Olympic silver medallist added on Twitter: "You are... destroying the career of honest athletes - shame on you all Fina."
Four-time world champion Efimova, 24, said the ban caused her "irreparable harm".
"My temporary suspension was not lifted in time and I lost the chance to qualify for the Olympic Games at the national championship," she said.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) added meldonium to its list of banned substances at the start of 2016, but recently gave those athletes who had since failed tests a lifeline with the admission it was unclear how long the substance took to clear the body.
Efimova previously served a 16-month ban after traces of anabolic steroid DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) were found in her system at an out-of-competition test in Los Angeles in 2013.
Efimova now appears likely to race in Brazil against Plymouth-based Lithuanian Meilutyte, the reigning Olympic 100m breaststroke champion.
Reacting to Efimova's reprieve, Rudd told BBC Sport: "Fina are very good at the soundbites of zero tolerance and stamping doping out of sport, but when they have an opportunity to stand by that conviction, unfortunately they have a habit of capitulating, and here we have it again.
"The longer and longer this matter was in Fina's hands and they were the ones to make a decision, I almost expected this to happen because it's happened before.
"A twisted part of this is I'm kind of glad she's there because I want her beaten."
