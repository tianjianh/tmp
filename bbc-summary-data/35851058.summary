More than 100 people have taken part in a run at a Manchester park a week after a jogger was attacked.

"Run toward, don't run away!" was organised after a man tried to strangle a woman, 25, with the wire from her headphones in Fog Lane Park, Didsbury.
Runners set off at 15:00 - the time the victim was attacked.
Organiser Louise Hudson said many people had been shocked by the attack but added "we're not afraid" and said a new runners' network has been set up.
Ms Hudson, from West Didsbury, said: "It is shocking what's happened. It startles people and frightens them.
"My hope is that we might meet new people, new friends to go running with."
Runners of different abilities did laps around the park during the event.
Ms Hudson said it was about "feeling safer in numbers and feeling that we're not detracted or deterred by this but actually more enthused".
