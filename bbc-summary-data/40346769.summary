Wrexham stadium investment call by Plaid Cymru AM

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wrexham's Racecourse ground deserves a boost if government money is available to back a new arena in Cardiff, a Plaid Cymru AM has said.

Llyr Gruffydd said he "read with amazement" that Economy Secretary Ken Skates supported proposals for another venue in the capital.
The Plaid AM for North Wales said there was already "a plethora of venues along the M4 corridor".
The Welsh Government said it would be for the club to put forward plans.
"We're not getting our share and we deserve better," said Mr Gruffydd.
He asked where the "vision and ambition" was "to develop similar centres of excellence here in the north".
Mr Gruffydd said Eirias Park in Colwyn Bay had been developed as a rugby and entertainment hub, but the Racecourse football ground could do with more support.
In 2008, the stadium was officially recognised as the oldest football stadium in the world still hosting international games, with a 200-year history as a sporting venue.
Wrexham AFC fans, who run the club, signed a 99-year lease to take it over last year.
Mr Gruffydd described it as "the oldest surviving international football stadium in the world" and "the spiritual home of Welsh football" which was "moving forward" under community ownership.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "Wrexham AFC and the Racecourse have a long and proud history. It would be for the club and its owners to put forward plans and a sustainable business case for any improvements to the stadium.
"The Welsh Government has been engaging with the club over future plans and we have also held discussions with other groups concerning other facilities in the north of Wales.
"No financial support for an arena in Cardiff has been promised and the Welsh Government is keen to support the development of strategy for sports facilities fit for the 21st Century across Wales."
