The founder of the French National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has said he is pulling out of regional elections amid a row with his daughter.

Marine Le Pen, who now leads the far-right party, condemned her father for his recently repeated claims Nazi gas chambers were a "detail of history".
Mr Le Pen told the Figaro newspaper he would not be standing in the south-eastern Paca region.
But he said he thought he was "the best candidate for the National Front".
Mr Le Pen said his granddaughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen would be the best person to stand in his place.
"If she accepts, I think she would head a very good list [of candidates]. She is certainly the best, I am not going to say after me, but she is," he told the newspaper.
Mr Le Pen, who is honorary president of party, did not make it clear whether he would seek a place as a candidate on the list of his granddaughter for the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region.
Last week, in a television interview, Mr Le Pen defended his description of the Holocaust as "a detail" of World War Two - prompting Ms Le Pen to say she would block his candidacy in the December polls.
Ms Le Pen has tried to rid the party of its racist image, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris reports.
