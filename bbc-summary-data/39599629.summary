Tewkesbury Town council cat eviction decision deferred

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The fate of a town council moggy lies in the hands of its own members after a decision to evict her was deferred.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Missy the cat is caught up in a row with Tewkesbury Town Council over whether or not it's appropriate for a cat to be in a business environment.
Town mayor Karen Brennan wants to ban the feline, described as the council's "morale officer and town cat" on its website.
A complaints panel will meet next week to discuss Missy's future.
At a meeting on Thursday night, councillors were told a complaint had been made which needs to be investigated. It is not known who made the complaint.
