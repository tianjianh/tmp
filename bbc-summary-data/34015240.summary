A Berwickshire councillor has said people remain "bemused" and "angry" at the decision to close St Abbs lifeboat station next month.

Michael Cook said the fight would go on to convince the RNLI that it was a very bad move.
The charity has confirmed the closure date at St Abbs of 8 September.
Thousands of people have signed a petition against the move but the RNLI has said an additional inshore boat will be provided at nearby Eyemouth.
Mr Cook said he believed the organisation had got its decision wrong.
"The simple fact is that they seem to be creating enhanced risk on the coastline around Berwickshire, particularly around St Abbs Head, by reducing the number of stations that they have available," he said.
"Try as everybody might, the effort to secure an explanation which really sets out the stall of the RNLI really hasn't availed us of anything at all.
"Their explanation seems to be caught up in the cost of alterations to the lifeboat house to accommodate a different type of boat.
"It really isn't very clever at all - and I think people are still bemused and they are angry."
An RNLI statement said it understood the disappointment in the area but said the "difficult decision" was "unanimous and final".
It added: "After the RNLI announced in May that the St Abbs lifeboat station was to close, there has been a hard-fought campaign by the station's volunteers and the community to keep it open.
"However, the charity is committed to putting another lifeboat at Eyemouth to cover St Abbs, which is only two nautical miles away.
"The crew at St Abbs have proved themselves to be committed and courageous in their service to the RNLI in the 104 years that the station has helped save lives at sea and the RNLI is very grateful to them and the community that has supported them.'"
