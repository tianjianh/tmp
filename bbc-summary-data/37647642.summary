Wrexham manager Gary Mills has left the National League club after 18 months in charge.

The ex-Nottingham Forest and Leicester City midfielder left Gateshead to succeed Kevin Wilkin in April 2015.
Wrexham missed out on the play-offs during his first season in charge and are currently 15th, having lost four of their last six games.
"We have therefore made the difficult decision that a change is needed," the club said in a statement.
"This was a difficult decision but despite some exciting and entertaining football last season, our main priority is promotion back to the Football League.
"We have not made the progress expected towards that aim, falling short of the play off places last season, and currently out of touch with the table leaders with a third of the season already gone."
Reserve team manager Joey Jones, head of youth Andy Davies and former club captain Dean Keates will be in charge for Saturday's FA Cup fourth qualifying round tie at Stamford.
Mills, 54, who has also managed York City and Notts County, is the fourth manager at a Welsh club to lose his job in the past 15 days.
Warren Feeney was sacked by Newport County, Cardiff City dismissed Paul Trollope and Swansea City parted company with Francesco Guidolin.
