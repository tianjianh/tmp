The Fochabers Fish Bar will now go up against nine other regional winners for the UK award in the Seafish-run 2017 National Fish and Chip Awards.
Fochabers Fish Bar owner Darren Boothroyd said: "We're completely over the moon to have made it to the top 10, it's a real testament to all the hard work we've put into the business."
The overall winner will be announced in January.
