Scott Quigg & Carl Frampton in dressing room row ahead of title fight

A row over who gets the best dressing room is threatening to derail Saturday's super-bantamweight unification match between Scott Quigg and Carl Frampton.

With the fight taking place at the Manchester Arena, Bury's Quigg is adamant he is the home fighter and should therefore get the 'star' dressing room.
However, Belfast's Frampton believes he should get the roomier quarters because he is the bigger draw.
"I'm sure it will drag on, be childish and pathetic and everyone will lose their rag. But we will find a resolution," said Quigg's promoter Eddie Hearn.
"We had to bend over backwards to make the fight happen. Carl had to be on the left-hand side of the poster, had to enter the ring second, had to have American officials. We let him have all the little things that he cared about.

"But Scott is the home fighter in Manchester and he gets the home dressing room."
Quigg will be putting his WBA belt on the line against IBF title-holder Frampton in a rare all-British world title unification match.
And at an ill-tempered final news conference, which ended with the fighters pushing and shoving after the face-off, it became clear how just how fractious the relationships are between the two camps.
"Scott wants the dressing room that the star of the show usually gets," said the 29-year-old Frampton, who is undefeated in 21 professional fights.
"It's a matter of principle. I'm the A side of the fight and I'm entitled to that dressing room. The best solution is that we lock that dressing room and each use different ones."

Quigg, who is unbeaten in 33 pro fights, replied: "What makes you think you're coming to my arena and choosing the dressing room? That's the dressing room I'm having and that's that."
Later, Frampton played the Stevie Wonder song 'Superstition' into his microphone before adding: "He's wants the dressing room because he's very superstitious and that's a sign of weakness."

As the row rumbled on, Hearn was heard to mutter: "I've lost the will to live."
The fighters' respective trainers also traded verbal blows. When Quigg's trainer Joe Gallagher questioned Shane McGuigan's credentials, Frampton's trainer replied: "Hopefully after the fight, he'll finally respect me."
In addition, Quigg's camp suggested Frampton had struggled to make the 122lb super-bantamweight limit, while Frampton's camp thought Quigg might have weight issues of his own.
The governing bodies have agreed to a Saturday morning re-weigh, at which neither boxer should be more than 10lb above his weight at Friday's official weigh-in.

"My weight is fine," said Frampton, who was knocked down twice in his last fight before beating unheralded Mexican Alejandro Gonzalez on points.
"I've spent 17 weeks in training camp, the longest I've ever had. I've missed my son taking his first steps, his birthday and my daughter's birthday. There's absolutely no way I'm going to let this guy rip this away from me.
"I just believe I'm a better fighter in every single department. I have the punching power to knock him out in any round but I've also got the boxing brain to beat him comfortably on points."
Quigg, who knocked out Spain's Kiko Martinez in his last fight, said: "I believe I'll be the bigger man in the ring but it's my boxing ability that will win this fight.
"This fight is everything I've worked towards since the age of 15. I've put in too much for anyone to stop me. I'll win by knockout."
