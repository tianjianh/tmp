Ships have been advised not to anchor in part of Scapa Flow where an item thought to be torpedo has been found.

The seven metre (22ft) long object was discovered on the seabed during a routine sonar survey on Saturday.
A remote operated vehicle (ROV) has also captured video footage of the weapon, which is lying 32m (104ft) below the water's surface.
The Orkney Harbour Master has asked shipping vessels not to anchor within 1,000m (1093 yards) of the torpedo.
Royal Navy divers from the Northern Diving Group at Faslane are expected to view the video footage when they visit Orkney later this week.
The Martime and Coastguard Agency said it poses no immediate danger.
Bev Allen, duty controller for the UK Coastguard, said: "Until the Royal Navy divers have had a chance to examine the footage and the object we are asking that vessels and divers keep at a safe distance and follow the instructions of the Harbour Master and the UK Coastguard."
Scapa Flow was used as a Royal Navy base in both world wars and is now popular with divers due to the British and German relics lying on the seabed.
More than 50 German ships were deliberately sunk in the area at the end of World War One by their commanders to stop them being divided among the Allies.
