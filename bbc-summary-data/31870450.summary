Happy? The Gayes are furious with Pharrell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walking away from court with a ruling that could pocket them $7.3m (Â£4.8m), you'd think Marvin Gaye's family would be more than satisfied.

But after proving Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke breached the copyright of Gaye's 1977 hit Got To Give It Up, they're apparently now looking at other songs in his back catalogue.
And next in their sights is Williams' hit Happy.
Gaye's daughter Nona says it's similar to his 1966 song Ain't That Peculiar.
"I'm not going to lie. I do think they sound alike," she told CBS News,
Gaye's ex-wife Janis agrees. "I heard the mash-ups, but I didn't really need to hear them. I know Ain't That Peculiar and I've heard Happy."
But for the moment Janis says they're not taking any further action.
"We're not in that that space. We're just in the moment today and we're satisfied."
On Tuesday, a US jury decided the 2013 single Blurred Line breached the copyright of Gaye's 1977 hit Got To Give It Up.
Thicke, Williams and TI - who also features on the track - denied copying the song and their lawyer said the ruling set a "horrible precedent" for creativity in music.
During the trial Williams admitted that Blurred Lines channels "that 70s feeling" and that he looked up to Gaye, but that creating a similar feel or mood with a song isn't copyright infringement.
"The last thing you want to do as a creator is take something of someone else's when you love him," said Williams.
But Nona disagrees. "I don't think there's anything wrong with being inspired. I've been inspired when I made music before. Inspiration's fine, but the line is when you decide to take the complete and utter essence out of the song. When you take all the meat, and leave the bones."
