The thieves, who had Scottish accents, threatened them with a weapon, which was not a gun, before stealing thousands of pounds worth of jewellery and cash.
The incident happened in Crewe Road South just before 02:00.
Police are carrying out inquiries and have increased high-visibility patrols.
Detectives have appealed for information but are particularly keen to hear about someone someone seen at the back of the property  between 11:00 and midday on Saturday 20 September.
Det Ch Inspector Stuart Houston, of Police Scotland, said: "It's too early to say if that is directly connected but obviously it's part of our investigation."
He added: "The occupants of the house were awoken in the night to four masked intruders, who threatened them with a weapon and demanded cash.
"This was obviously a terrifying experience for them, and we are looking for any information to help us trace those responsible.
"I would be particularly keen to trace the drivers or occupants of any vehicles that were within the area at the time of the incident.
"We don't have a clear description of the men as they were wearing masks, but they were all wearing dark clothing, and we are working to establish further details."
