Plan to ban smoking on beach and in parks in Pembrokeshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Smoking could be banned in parks, sports grounds, playing fields, car parks and one beach in Pembrokeshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council is looking at trialling a plan to ban smoking on one, yet to be selected, beach in a bid to discourage young people from taking up the habit.
E-cigarettes and vaporisers would also be banned.
The proposals were backed by the council's environment overview and scrutiny committee on Thursday.
They will now go to the council's older persons, health and well-being overview and scrutiny before going to cabinet.
The council said it would be "difficult to police" but hopes signs will help change attitudes and limit children's exposure to second-hand smoke.
A group will be set up to pick which beach will be made smoke-free for the pilot scheme.
There are about 100 play areas across Pembrokeshire owned by the county and community councils.
