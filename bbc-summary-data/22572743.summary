Pakistan finished their 50-over innings on 231-7 despite a decent bowling performance from the hosts at The Grange.
Three wickets from Majid Haq meant he became Scotland's leading wicket-taker in one-day international matches.
However, Scotland only managed 135 as Pakistan bowled out their opponents in the 40th over.
Head coach Pete Steindl's Scotland side faced Pakistan for the first time in seven years.
Pakistan last visited Scotland in 2006, winning by five wickets with 37 balls to spare at The Grange.
The two matches in Edinburgh precede a game against Ireland as Dav Whatmore's team prepare for the Champions Trophy.
Misbah-ul-Haq's 78 not out spearheaded Pakistan's attack while opener Imran Farhat was dismissed for 49.
In addition to Haq's hat-trick for Scotland, Neil Carter, Iain Wardlaw, Rob Taylor and Matt Machan also took wickets for the hosts before lunch.
Off-spinner Haq made it 44 wickets in one-day internationals to overtake John Blain, who he was previously tied with on 41.
Scotland began batting at 15:00 BST but it did not start well as Carter was dismissed for a duck.
New captain Kyle Coetzer top scored for the hosts by reaching 32 but Pakistan's Junaid Khan and Saeed Ajmal each took three wickets of their own to bring about Scotland's demise.
The two sides meet again on Sunday at The Grange.
