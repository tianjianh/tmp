The company revealed its cheapest tablet yet, costing less than £50, which it said was designed to be used for entertainment.
The updated devices automatically download taster episodes of Amazon's original TV programmes.
Amazon said the feature would mean customers always had something to watch.
But it will also be hoping to entice people to pay for its premium Amazon Prime services.
The updated Fire TV box is capable of streaming ultra high-definition 4K programmes and films, something Apple's revamped TV box is not yet capable of.
"This new range could cement Amazon's tablets as the low-cost alternative to the iPad," commented the tech consultancy CCS Insight.
"A strong content offering elevates Fire TV over rivals, despite a lack of [Sky's] Now TV in the UK."
"The devices will be high on holiday wish lists."
The BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones went hands on with the new devices.
