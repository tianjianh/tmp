Eight people have been killed when a storm lashed the South African city of Cape Town following months of drought.

Among the dead is a family of four killed in a fire started by lightning, officials say. Thousands of people have been left homeless.
The storm comes two weeks after the region declared a drought disaster.
The BBC's Mo Allie in Cape Town reports that before the storm, there had been several interfaith meetings to pray for rain.
Our correspondent adds that the storm was anticipated and warnings have been made by the local authorities for the last week.
It is the worst winter storm for 30 years, according to the South African Weather Service, while local media have dubbed it "the mother of all storms".
Schools and universities have shut, roofs were blown off and shelters have been opened for those left destitute.
Many people have been injured by flying debris.
Residents of the city's many shanty towns have been worst hit as their fragile homes have been unable to resist the strong winds and heavy rain.
Onele Ndesi from Western Cape Disaster Management predicts that "the worst is yet to come".
President Jacob Zuma has cancelled a trip to Cape Town to open the World News Media Congress because it is not possible to fly there.
BBC weather forecaster Philip Avery warns that Wednesday could bring in excess of 50mm of rain to some western areas of South Africa, accompanied by winds of 60-90km/h.
Coastal areas face the additional hazard of high tides, reinforced by storm waves, some of which may reach 10m.
Thursday should see conditions easing but a passing cold front will introduce much cooler weather in all areas.
He also warns that the strong winds could lead to wildfires because the countryside is so dry.
In May, the Western Cape province declared a drought disaster after two reservoirs had completely dried up. It was said to have been the region's worst drought in more than a century.
Several other southern African nations were also affected by the two-year drought, which was caused by the El Nino climate phenomenon.
However, many parts of the region are now experiencing bumper maize harvests.
