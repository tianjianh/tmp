The first match will take place on 9 October with further contests on 11 and 13 October.
A four-day game against Zimbabwe A will follow on 17 October before the Irish start their Intercontinental Cup match in Namibia on 24 October.
Ireland beat Zimbabwe in a thrilling World Cup game in Hobart last March.
Ed Joyce was the Irish hero in that game as he hit 112 as they posted their highest ever one-day international total of 331-8.
Zimbabwe came close to achieving the target as Brendan Taylor hit four sixes in his 121 but eventually fell five runs short.
Ireland coach John Bracewell said that the Zimbabwe games would offer his side a "really competitive series".
"Ireland have enjoyed some really hard tussles with Zimbabwe over the years and I expect these games will be equally as tough," added the Irish coach.
The Irish have played only six one-day games against Zimbabwe.
Their first meeting at the 2007 World Cup ended in a dramatic tie before Zimbabwe beat Ireland convincingly in Nairobi in a one-off game in 2008.
Zimbabwe also earned a 2-1 victory in the only ever series between the countries in 2010.
