Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez has made huge mistake, says Liam Smith's trainer

Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez should have taken the money and faced Gennady Golovkin rather than Liam Smith, according to the British fighter's trainer.

Smith, 27, will defend his WBO light-middleweight title against Alvarez at Texas' AT&T Stadium on 17 September.
Mexico's Alvarez, who has won 47 of his 48 fights, goes into the bout after a brutal defeat of Briton Amir Khan.
"I feel Alvarez has made a huge mistake," said Joe Gallagher, who trains Liverpudlian Smith.
"Alvarez is a very, very good fighter. You only have to look at his record to see who he's been in with, but I feel they should have taken the Golovkin fight and got paid well."
Smith, who has won 23 of his 24 fights, will make the third defence of the title he claimed by beating American John Thompson in October last year.
Undefeated Kazakh Golovkin had been tipped to face Alvarez but will instead fight Britain's Kell Brook at London's O2 on 10 September.
