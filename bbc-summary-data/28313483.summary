[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man with a cannibalism fetish planned to kill a 14-year-old girl with an axe before eating her, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nurse Dale Bolinger, 57, used the online Dark Fetish Network (DFN) to discuss beheading and eating women and girls for sexual gratification, Canterbury Crown Court was told.
He bought an axe in Broadstairs, Kent, in September 2012, the day before he was due to meet the girl, it was said.
Mr Bolinger denies attempting to meet a child under 16 after sexual grooming.
The court was told an email address being used by Mr Bolinger was traced by the FBI.
Prosecuting, Martin Yale told the jury they were investigating internet chats about the rape, killing and cannibalism of women.
Det Con Nicola Griffith, from Kent Police, told the court the FBI had passed chat logs on to detectives containing online conversations on DFN.
Mr Yale read out chat logs between Bolinger and other users to the court, in which he allegedly referred to beheading a 14-year-old, eating children while their mothers watched, and cooking and eating a pregnant woman and her foetus.
Many of the conversations involved discussions of eating children, which the court was told he referred to as "nice veal", including eating a newborn female baby.
The court heard how Mr Bolinger's online profile listed his interests as "cannibalism, mainly the hunting and preparation of young but sometime not so young women".
Jurors heard that Mr Bolinger, formerly of Canterbury, thought he had been chatting to a 14-year-old Mexican girl called Eva, who was living in Germany.
During their chats he proposed to meet her at Ashford International station and discussed the sexual acts he would perform before and after her death.
Mr Yale said: "He said he would murder her with an axe or a cleaver and then he would eat her."
Jurors heard that Mr Bolinger told the girl: "The idea of making love and then eating you is a very great turn-on.
"I have been called a very generous lover and I would be very generous to you before I prepped you for the table."
But Eva, whose identity has never been established, did not arrive and Mr Bolinger went home.
He said he had only gone to Ashford station because he feared for the girl's safety.
Mr Bolinger's trial heard how he claimed to have eaten a 39-year-old woman and a five-year-old child during chats with other users on the Dark Fetish Network.
While searching Mr Bolinger's phone and computer, police found indecent images of children with titles including "dinner; one in, one waiting", "the BBQ", "the BBQ2" and "the BBQ3", the jury was told.
He was arrested by Kent Police in February following liaison with FBI officers in the United States and charged seven months later.
The trial continues.
