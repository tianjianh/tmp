Sheena Warner, 65, stole £514,679 from Julian Palmer's quarry firms over four years, Gloucester Crown Court heard.
Warner, of Tredwell Court, Evesham, pleaded guilty to one count of fraud between January 2009 and November 2013.
The personal assistant holidayed three times a year in Egypt and invested in an overseas leisure complex.
Prosecutor Alistair Haggerty told the court the fraud was uncovered in 2013 when Mr Palmer's bank manager told him his business account was £20,000 over an agreed overdraft limit.
Further inquiries revealed £40,000 in outstanding bills and that the Cheltenham firm owed £233,000 in unpaid taxes, the prosecutor said.
"There was clearly an element of planning and the fraud went on for a period of time. There was a large degree of trust and autonomy that Mrs Warner enjoyed," he said.
When Mr Palmer confronted Warner she admitted to stealing more than £100,000 in 2013 and agreed to sell her house, car and other assets.
She paid him £142,000 but hid the extent of her fraud, the court heard.
"When Mr Palmer ordered bank statements from all three accounts it became clear she had stolen over £514,000 since 2009," Mr Haggerty said.
Mr Palmer said in his victim impact statement the theft had changed his life "considerably".
He said: "We thought we would be declared bankrupt and the stress was too much for my wife, who left me.
"I cannot sleep, I lost two stone in weight and I ended up on medication."
He said his retirement fund "has been stolen" and he feared for his 30 employees' jobs.
The 66-year-old said he had known Warner for 15 years and "trusted her so much".
His statement said: "The betrayal is as bad as the actual stealing and I never thought she would steal from me.
"The deception has affected me badly and I no longer trust anybody."
Alison Scott-Jones, defending, said: "My client was flattered by the attention of a younger man, who didn't exactly con her but certainly tricked her.
"She got herself into a long-term relationship and allowed herself to be used to channel monies which she didn't get the benefit of."
