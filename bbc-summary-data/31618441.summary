A derelict bingo hall destroyed by a large fire is being demolished by hand, Cardiff council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work has begun to take down the building in Pearl St, Adamsdown, following the blaze on Monday.
It ripped through the three-storey property and 60 residents who lived nearby have been temporarily re-housed.
Homes in Pearl St, Agate St and Diamond St were affected and the Old Illtydians Rugby Club on Splott Road remains sealed off.
Many residents are now staying with friends and family and others are being put up in hotels.
A Cardiff council spokesman said the operation would be "slow" as a police and fire service investigation must be completed before demolition work can begin.
Once it starts, work will be initially carried out by hand because of the risk of damage to homes from a wrecking ball.
The British Red Cross has set up a rest centre at the Star Centre nearby.
Cardiff council says the owner of the property will have to bear the cost of the demolition work.
