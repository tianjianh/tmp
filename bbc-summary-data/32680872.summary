Durham's Wharton Park to close for one year for £3m revamp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wharton Park in Durham City is to close for one year as work gets under way on a £3m restoration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The park was opened to the public in 1858 and was the site of the first Durham Miners' Gala in 1871.
The project will see a new heritage centre, cafe and play areas built, along with the restoration of the park's amphitheatre and footpaths.
A Durham County Council spokesman said it was great to see work getting under way on the city's "hidden gem".
The project received a £2.45m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and additional funding from Durham County Council and the council's Durham Area Action Partnership.
Wharton Park closes for 12 months on 11 May.
