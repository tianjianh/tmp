UK Championship: Mark Selby through with second whitewash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World number one Mark Selby maintained his run of not losing a frame in this season's UK Championship with a 6-0 whitewash of Oliver Lines.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 2012 UK champion started with a break of 133 and clinched a place in the last 32 with a 97 clearance.
Judd Trump was 2-2 at the interval with Stuart Carrington but went through 6-3.
Northern Ireland's Mark Allen, the 2011 finalist, won 6-2 against Michael Georgiou and 2013 winner Neil Robertson beat India's Aditya Mehta 6-3.
Selby came close to making a 147 in the final frame against world number 67 Lines but, after potting 13 reds and 12 blacks, his next black wriggled out of the bottom right-hand pocket.
"I just took my eye off it," Selby said, before referring to the 147 he made in this event in 2013. "I had that in my mind and perhaps I got ahead of myself."
Trump was not at his best against Carrington, with a top break of 101 courtesy of a fluked final brown which rebounded off a corner pocket into the centre, taking him to a century.
There was something of a surprise result as Thailand's world number 51 Dechawat Poomjaeng eliminated Welshman Ryan Day, ranked 18th, 6-2.
Elsewhere, Michael Holt took a 6-2 win over Chris Wakelin with a century, Mark Joyce beat Sydney Wilson 6-2, Ali Carter saw off Welshman Daniel Wells 6-3 to set up a third-round meeting with three-time former champion John Higgins, and Matthew Selt defeated Sean O'Sullivan 6-4.
Robertson lost the opening frame against India's world number 64 Mehta, but the world number three made a 114 to establish a 3-1 lead at the interval.
Australian Robertson saw a break of 93 end in a foul after part of his clothing was deemed to have touched the black, but he closed out the match in style with a 120 clearance.
In round three he will play Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh, who went 3-0 ahead against Irishman Fergal O'Brien before scraping through in the deciding frame.
World number eight Barry Hawkins, the 2013 world finalist, took the first frame but then dropped four in a row and lost 6-3 to Finnish world number 59 Robin Hull.
Scotsman Stephen Maguire, the 2004 champion, thrashed Jamie Cope 6-0, finishing with a break of 89, and David Grace beat Rob Milkins 6-2.
Jamie Jones of Wales ousted China's Xiao Guodong 6-1 and he now faces world number one Mark Selby.
But Jones' compatriot, Dominic Dale, lost 6-5 to Peter Ebdon.
