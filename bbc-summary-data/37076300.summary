[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Improved weather conditions have seen two mass ascents at this year's Bristol International Balloon Fiesta.

The first on Saturday evening saw a total of 71 balloons take off, and earlier on Sunday, some 115 took part.
Planned ascents on Thursday and Friday had to be cancelled due to gusty conditions.
Last year's parking problems saw the event close its gates for the first time. This time, car park spaces had to be pre-booked.
Saturday saw 90-minute long shuttle bus delays while a closed bridge at the Cumberland basin also caused traffic problems.
However, thousands of people turned up to watch the evening nightglow and fireworks display.
A final mass ascent is expected at 18:00 BST to round off the festival which closes at 20:30 BST
