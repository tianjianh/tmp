Bath head coach Mike Ford believes his side's six-match losing streak could benefit them in the long run.

Ford guided the Blue, Black and Whites to last year's Premiership final, but they are currently ninth and just six points above the foot of the table.
"This losing run will make us stronger and a better organised team.
"We're going to get through this, we're going to fight our way back to form and winning ways," 50-year-old Ford told BBC Points West.
"It is not quite clicking at the moment, but we have to get through it."
Bath were beaten 15-11 by West Country rivals Gloucester at the Rec last Friday, despite racing into an 8-0 lead.
They have won just two of their last 11 games in all competitions and have already lost seven Premiership matches this season - more than in the entire campaign in 2014-15.
Ford continues to meet Bath chairman Bruce Craig, who he insists has given him his full backing despite the run of defeats, on a weekly basis.
"Bruce (Craig) has been really supportive," Ford added. "We have a long-term plan and we are sticking to that, looking at the bigger picture.
"He asks questions and I answer them. We talk a load of things through and we are trying as hard as we can to get through it.
Ford is hopeful Bath's fortunes will soon turn, starting with their game at fellow strugglers Worcester Warriors on Saturday.
He continued: "I am confident that we will come through this and I trust the players 100% to do that.
"We believe in what we are doing, we believe in our vision, believe in the way we coach and play."
