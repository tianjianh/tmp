[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former chief executive of William Hill bookmakers is likely to remain until a successor is appointed in July.
He said his time in the post had been "an enormous honour".
"I am hugely grateful to the people who have made it such an enjoyable seven years," said Topping, who plans to focus on other business interests.
"The SPFL has made significant progress in recent seasons, despite the many pressures and challenges of being Scotland's national sport and I believe it is in a stronger position than for several years", he continued.
"The smooth amalgamation of the SPL [Scottish Premier League] and the SFL [Scottish Football League] in 2013, the successful restructuring of the SPFL's cup competitions and the major advances in club fees are three prime examples of the professional game in Scotland working together for the greater good and I'm sure that the SPFL will continue its current upward progress in the years ahead."
SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said Topping had "earned the respect of senior boardroom figures throughout the Scottish game".
