[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey has admitted safety breaches after a girl of four fell 14ft (4.2m) and suffered a bleed on the brain.

The girl's skull was fractured in 2012 when she fell from the queue for the Tomb Blaster ride.
Guildford Crown Court was told that water dripping from a roof had rotted fence posts lining the queue to the ride.
The theme park will be sentenced on Monday.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) brought the prosecution accusing it of failing to properly inspect and maintain fences.
It said there had been systemic failures by Chessington in the way it maintained the queuing area and that it failed to record its maintenance schedule although the route was checked every day.
The court was told that on the day the girl, from Kent, was injured another family further up in the queue had to grab their daughter by her coat to stop her falling over the fence.
