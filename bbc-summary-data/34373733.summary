Statues of barons that were part of a Magna Carta trail in Lincoln have gone on show at the city's castle.

The 25 figures, designed by Lincolnshire artists, will be on display until Tuesday before being auctioned for charity.
Money raised from the auction, taking place on Lincolnshire Day, will go to The Trussell Trust.
Themes for the barons include Truck Driver Baron, the Graduate Baron and the Beekeeper Baron.
The Lincoln Business Improvement Group (BIG) said they had attracted a lot of interest.
Spokesman Matt Corrigan said: "People have been asking how much they are all going to sell for - and it's very difficult to say."
The barons will be auctioned on 1 October.
A set of 25 other barons, which featured on a similar trail in Salisbury, will be auctioned on the same night at Salisbury Cathedral.
The baron trail was part of the 800th anniversary celebrations of the sealing of Magna Carta.
Lincoln holds one of four remaining original copies of the charter, which was sealed by King John at Runnymede in 1215.
Donations made during tours of the baron trail will be given to the city's first responders service.
