Aston Villa have appointed former Brighton coach Colin Calderwood as their assistant manager to Steve Bruce.

The ex-Villa player and Nottingham Forest boss, 51, quit his role as Chris Hughton's number two prior to Friday's 1-1 draw between the two sides.
"When I heard Colin was interested he shot to the top of the pile," Villa boss Steve Bruce told the club website.
"We interviewed two or three people but once I knew Colin was available there was only one person I wanted here."
The move to the West Midlands gives Calderwood, who also previously managed Hibernian and Northampton Town, a shorter daily commuting distance from his Northampton home.

A Brighton statement released on Friday said Calderwood, who was placed on gardening leave on 12 November, had left the club for a job "elsewhere".
"We have to move on," added Hughton. "We have a team that is very well drilled at this moment. My main concern is that we have no disruption here. I will think long and hard about bringing someone in that position."
Bruce took over as Villa boss on 12 October, bringing in former Birmingham City player Stephen Clemence as head coach, having had him as part of his backroom team at Sunderland and Hull City. The club also named Ian Atkins as their new chief scout/head of European recruitment.
Villa director of football Steve Round added: "We are delighted to secure the services of Colin. He is an excellent coach and an outstanding person.
"He has a wealth of experience at the highest level and will be a great addition to our management team."
