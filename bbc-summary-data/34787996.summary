[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior teaching union boss has been accused of fostering a "hostile, sexist and discriminatory environment".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The allegations against Jim Quigley, of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), were made at a tribunal hearing in Exeter.
Charlotte Revely, 51, a former union employee, is making a whistleblower and sexual discrimination claim.
The NASUWT has strongly denied the claims.
Ms Revely, from Hinton St George, Somerset, worked for the union as a professional assistant in its South West regional centre in Exeter from January 2013 until she quit in August 2014.
She told an Exeter employment tribunal: "During my period of employment I witnessed colleagues being bullied and female colleagues treated less favourably than their male counterparts.
"I suffered direct discrimination and victimisation."
She said: "At the end of April I became ill because I could no longer cope with such a hostile and aggressive working environment.
"I felt that my work was being closely scrutinised and that Mr Quigley was waiting for me to make a mistake."
She said a regional official vacancy was advertised when she was ill, but feared she would not be treated fairly.
After she made a complaint against Mr Quigley she was left "shocked and dismayed" by a "brutal character assassination" from Mr Quigley, which stated she was "malicious, vexatious, dishonest and lazy".
It was "clearly a response to my whistleblowing", she said.
Ms Revely claimed other workers, male and female, were also being bullied.
The NASUWT "wilfully ignores their own policies and procedures" and "turns a blind eye to discrimination", she said.
"I am a passionate and lifelong trade unionist and I feel utterly betrayed by the conduct of my former employer."
The tribunal continues.
