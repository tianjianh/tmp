Thousands of people have lined Liverpool's waterfront to watch the last of Cunard's "three queens" leave the port after a historic rendezvous.

The Queen Mary 2, the Queen Victoria and the Queen Elizabeth sailed together for the first time on Monday to celebrate Cunard's 175th anniversary.
Performing a synchronised sailing display, they saluted the city where Samuel Cunard founded the line in 1840.
Liverpool City Council estimated the ships attracted more than 1m visitors.
Labour Councillor Wendy Simon said: "To have that many people and for them all to have a great time, we just think it's fantastic."
People waved flags and banners on the quayside as the ship left port to the sound of its horn reverberating around the city.
On board, passengers and crew displayed banners celebrating the city's football teams and musical heritage.
Mary 2 will return in July to recreate Cunard's first transatlantic crossing to Canada and New York.
