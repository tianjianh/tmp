The Czech, seeded 14th, won 6-1 6-1 in 63 minutes to claim her second Wuhan title and her first of the 2016 season.
Kvitova had beaten world number one Angelique Kerber, Britain's Johanna Konta and fourth seed Simona Halep on her way to the final.
She will move up to 11th in the new world rankings on Monday.
Kvitova, 26, could yet qualify for the season-ending WTA Finals with another good run at next week's China Open - she currently lies 12th in the Race to Singapore, four places off qualification.
"It's great for sure to win it for a second time," said Kvitova "I'm happy for that, how I played all week. I think it was amazing really.
"I do like the conditions here. I feel that it's a little bit faster. I really can play my game here."
She made a blistering start to Sunday's final, firing down five aces as she won 17 of the first 18 points to take a grip on the contest.
Cibulkova, who will return to the top 10 next week, could make little impact, managing one break of serve in the first set and a solitary hold in the second as Kvitova hammered 28 winners.
"She was just really hitting everything full power," said the Slovak. "She was just serving really well, going for returns.
"I couldn't really play my game that I played during this week. I Couldn't get in the long rallies or in the rhythm because she didn't let me.
"She was really powerful from the first strokes. That's how she overpowered me today."
