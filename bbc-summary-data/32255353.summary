Safety barriers fitted at Swansea's Kingsway after deaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Safety barriers have been installed on The Kingsway in Swansea ahead of a council meeting on potential changes to the road layout.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 1.2m-high barriers were being put in place following the death of off-duty police officer Sgt Louise Lucas.
The 41-year-old died after being hit by a bus on the road on 31 March.
Swansea council is due to meet on Tuesday to consider changes to The Kingsway as well as measures to prevent east-bound traffic on the road.
Cabinet members will also look at what further safety measures could be introduced and make funding available for the changes as quickly as possible.
The proposals will be forwarded to the Traffic Commissioner who will have to agree any changes to Swansea bus routes.
The move follows a call for "urgent action" from a coroner investigating the earlier death of Daniel Foss, 37, who died after he was hit by a bus on the road in 2013.
Swansea's acting senior coroner Colin Phillips said the road had a "serious design issue", which "must be addressed" by Swansea council.
