Paddy McCourt looks set to play in the Irish League after his hometown club Derry City opted not to sign the Northern Ireland international winger.

Derry boss Kenny Shiels says the progress of the youngsters in his squad has made him reluctantly decide not to sign the 32-year-old.
Glenavon and Linfield are now being linked with the player.
McCourt left Luton Town to return home in May after his wife Laura was diagnosed with a brain tumour.
Laura underwent a successful operation last month and doctors are optimistic that she will make a full recovery.
McCourt had a previous spell at his hometown club between 2006 and 2008 and helped the Candystripes win the FAI Cup and two League Cups.
The Derry native helped Celtic land Scottish Premier League titles and the Scottish Cup during his stint with the Glasgow club before moving to Barnsley in August 2013.
He spent further spells at Brighton and Luton and also had a loan stint at Notts County.
Luton were keen to retain McCourt's services but his wife's illness led to his decision to return home.
