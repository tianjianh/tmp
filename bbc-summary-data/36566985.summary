The empty train was automatically derailed after passing a red signal outside Paddington.
Although the train has been shifted, engineers will continue to work on the site throughout the night to repair damage to the line, Network Rail said.
A damaged gantry which the train crashed into was removed earlier.
Platforms one to five remain closed at Paddington, and in total Network Rail has so far deployed 50 engineers to work on the incident.
Network Rail had originally hoped to remove the train at about 22:00 BST on Friday.
A Network Rail spokesperson said earlier that work would be ongoing throughout Saturday now that the "complicated" work to clear electric power cables had been completed.
With the train lifted clear, the track will be inspected for damage and the electrical cabling will be reconnected, he said.
No timescale has been given for when a full service will be running again.
Great Western Railway have advised passengers to "travel only if necessary and arrive in plenty of time", although a limited service is running.
The derailment has been referred to the Rail Accident Investigation Branch to investigate why the driver passed a red signal.
Network Rail has said it will "await the conclusion of the official investigation" before commenting on the cause of the crash.
