Newcastleton cannabis farm charges deserted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four people have walked free after charges of running a cannabis farm in the Scottish Borders were deserted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plants and drugs to the value of Â£30,000 were seized following a police raid on a remote property at Whisgills Farm near Newcastleton last July.
Mattias Berry, 45, Shelby Gilligan, 22, and Wayne Chadwick, 42, all from Manchester and Peter Leicester, 68, of Bury, had denied producing the drug.
Procurator Fiscal Graham Fraser said the Crown was deserting the case.
The four had also denied being concerned in the supply of cannabis and stealing a quantity of electricity.
Mr Leicester pled not guilty to knowingly permitting premises to be used for producing a controlled drug.
They were due to stand trial by jury at Jedburgh Sheriff Court next week.
However, it was confirmed at an intermediate hearing that the case against all of them was being deserted.
