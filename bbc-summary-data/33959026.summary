BBC licence fee: Wales at risk of getting 'worst deal'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Wales should be given an extra £30m of funding to make TV programmes to properly reflect the people of Wales, the first minister has said.

Carwyn Jones has written to BBC director-general Lord Hall about a "growing gulf" in funding between Wales and the rest of the UK.
He said Welsh audiences "risk being dealt the worst deal" of any UK nation.
The BBC said it believed it offered "value for money" to viewers in Wales.
The letter, released on Monday, comes as the BBC as a whole faces the prospect of programme budget cuts as a result of taking on extra responsibilities following the licence fee settlement in July.
The first minister and other Welsh politicians have claimed that Wales is not getting its fair share of the BBC budget compared to other parts of the UK.
Non-news TV production was a particular area of concern, Mr Jones said, with the BBC's Audience Council for Wales review saying cuts had brought such programmes "closer to the cliff-edge".
"BBC Wales is no longer able to provide quality comedy or drama specifically for Welsh audiences, due to a lack of resources - these should be the kind of programmes that reflect our lives and our unique culture," he said.
He added that funding for English-language programmes about Wales should not be at the expense of Welsh language services on S4C and BBC Radio Cymru.
In 2014/15 BBC Wales spent £20.8m on English-language TV programmes specifically for Wales, and £19.7m on Welsh-language TV programmes for broadcast on S4C.
A BBC spokesperson said the corporation had "a good track-record" in Wales, but said the need to make savings of £700m a year meant there was "a challenge to reflect all aspects of life in all parts of the UK back to itself on our TV services".
"Despite this, we continue to deliver high-quality programmes in Wales such as the popular drama series Hinterland, the consumer-affairs programme, X-Ray the recent seasons of programmes about north Wales and the Valleys as well as news, current affairs and politics tailored for Wales," the spokesperson added.
"Blended with popular English-language shows that are enjoyed across the UK, we believe we offer value for money to Welsh audiences."
