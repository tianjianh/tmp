A national resilience centre to deal with issues such as flooding will be up and running within a year, according to the Scottish government.

The facility will operate from the Crichton Campus in Dumfries and is expected to employ about six people.
It will help communities and local emergency services prepare for a predicted increase in severe weather.
The details emerged after the government announced their commitment to the project in August 2014.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said Environment Minister Aileen McLeod met with an implementation board in March.
Since then, the board has met with Dumfries and Galloway Council and other local organisations to discuss setting up the centre.
She added: "The exact staff structure needs to be agreed following further consultation with stakeholders, however the proposed core staffing presence will indicatively consist of up to six members of staff.
"The implementation process is on track and it is expected that the centre will be up and running within the financial year 2015/16."
Earlier this week, local Labour MSP Elaine Murray wrote to Ms McLeod to establish what progress had been made with the National Centre for Resilience (NCR).
She said: "The Scottish government have previously said that the NCR would be up and running in the Crichton by now, and with that, the jobs created to compensate for the axing of 46 police and fire control room positions in the town.
"However, there is no sign of the NCR at the Crichton or any new posts being created."
She added: "They now need to ensure they stick to that promise and show the people of this region they are happy to deliver a fair show of government funded posts."
