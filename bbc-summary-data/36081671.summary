Police said no-one was injured when a lorry hit the central reservation after a tyre blew out near the Calder junction on the A720, at about 07:20.
Footage from a dashcam filmed from on the other side of the road shows the lorry hurtling down the steel barrier.
The lorry appears to have mounted the central barrier and comes close to crossing into oncoming traffic.
The bypass was closed eastbound throughout the morning but reopened at about 14:30.
There were queues several miles long following the crash, which also affected the M8 heading into Edinburgh, back to Junction 3 at Livingston.
There were also queues on the M9 southbound heading down to the M8, with traffic back to 1a at Kirkliston.
There were further queues on all routes heading to the bypass, the A71, the A70 and the A772 Gilmerton Road.
