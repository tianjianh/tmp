[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial has begun in Belfast of a man and woman accused of murdering a County Armagh man and dumping his body in a wheelie bin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is alleged Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, and Shaunean Boyle, 25, were responsible for the serious assault and subsequent death of Owen Creaney from Lurgan on 5 July 2014.
The 40-year-old's body was found at a house in Moyraverty Court in Craigavon.
Both Mr Hughes and Ms Boyle deny the charges.
Mr Creaney's body was "callously dumped" in a green recycling bin and covered with cardboard, Belfast Crown Court heard on Monday.
Opening the murder trial, the prosecution said police were tipped off about the dead man. When officers arrived at the Craigavon house, the two accused were present.
Police found windows open, a mop and bucket at the back door and the smell of bleach, said the prosecution.
There was evidence carpets had recently been cleaned and there were blood stains under the stairs, the court was told.
It was also alleged in court that Mr Creaney had most likely suffered a serious assault at the house in the early hours of 3 July.
A post mortem examination concluded that it most likely took two days for him to die.
In police interviews, both defendants said their co-accused was responsible for what was called in court a "deliberate and frenzied attack".
Stephen Thomas Hughes' address was given as Maghaberry Prison, but with a previous address in Moyraverty Court in Craigavon.
Shaunean Boyle's address was given as Hydebank Prison, but with a previous address in Edenderry Park, Banbridge.
The prosecution say given that both Mr Hughes and Ms Boyle admit they were in the house at the time of the attack, it was incredible that someone who was innocent would leave the victim on the sofa for two days without seeking medical help.
The trial is likely to last three weeks.
Both defendants were remanded back into custody.
