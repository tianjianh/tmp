For Hibernian defender Darren McGregor, the new campaign cannot come quick enough.
"It's great to be back with the big boys," he said. "We've got an opening day game with Partick Thistle who last year acquitted themselves really well.
"I was half panicking the first game would be against the Jambos but fortunately enough that will be the tail end of October. It's a Wednesday night under the lights at Easter Road and we've always done well under the lights so I'm looking forward to that.
"Being in the Championship for three years you want to get back up to the top table, play the big teams, play at Ibrox, Parkhead, Pittodrie and Tynecastle.
"All the boys are buzzing now and really looking forward to the season ahead."
