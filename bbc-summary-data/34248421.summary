East in the cold under Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What does Jeremy Corby's leadership mean for the Labour Party in the our region?

The party could return to the glory days when it held more than 20 seats in the East - or it could lose the precious few it already has. There are questions over how important he will be to Labour's plans.
Even though Mr Corbyn had the backing of two of our MPs - Luton's Kelvin Hopkins and Norwich South's Clive Lewis - many of those who stood for Labour at the last election voted for other candidates.
Most have not voiced criticism of Mr Corbyn, preferring instead to focus on what they hope will be the positive impact of the new leader.
"The enthusiasm which he has unleashed is fantastic," said Cambridge MP, Daniel Zeichner, who had voted for Yvette Cooper.
"He has touched a chord within the British public and I am excited about the future."
Euro MEP Richard Howitt, who also supported Yvette Cooper said: "We must now unite behind the new. Any party that does not stay united will not win elections and Labour knows that to its cost."
There are others within the party who are worried about what Jeremy Corbyn will mean for the party in the region.
Former Norwich MP and Home Secretary Charles Clarke said: "I think it is very serious problem for Labour and very difficult for us to gain the confidence of people at a general election."
Although the former home secretary said he did not think Labour had given up on the East, he added: "There is no doubt that the election we've gone through in the Labour Party makes it more difficult rather than easier.
"Labour can win back the East but it has to have the right policies, the right approach and the right people."
Former Northampton North MP Sally Keeble, speaking before the result, warned a Corbyn leadership would "be very damaging indeed".
"I think it would make it extraordinarily difficult going into the next election because we would be going in with commitments on more spending which people would know to be unaffordable.
"We would also be going in with positions on some foreign affairs which would be really difficult for the public to accept," she said.
When Tony Blair swept to victory in 1997, Labour won 25 seats across he eastern counties - its best result ever. In 2010 it was all but wiped out, holding just two constituencies, both in Luton.
This year Labour added Cambridge and Norwich South but both those wins took seats from Liberal Democrats.
Labour failed to gain any Conservative seats in this region and in nearly every other seat which it contested in the East, the Tory majority went up.
That is why there is a lot of unease among some local members about whether a move to the left will really work.
They accept that Jeremy Corbyn played to packed crowds when he spoke around the country, but they question if that will be enough to win in former Labour target seats like Norwich North, Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, Waveney and Bedford.
They also say that Mr Corbyn's more left-wing message may play better in parts of the country with a traditional working class vote but less well in this more affluent region.
In fact some within the Corbyn camp have told us that the East is not seen as a priority.
"I am not writing off the East of England, I am an MP there," said Clive Lewis, a key member of the Corbyn campaign.
"But you have to realise that for us the elephant in the room is Scotland, we need to win it back and win big again in the North of England.
"Of all four candidates Jeremy Corbyn was the best placed person to do that and that was the game changer," he added.
Others too in the Labour camp have told us that they also expect Scotland and the North of England to be the main focus of Labour's efforts under Corbyn rather than the East of England.
After Labour's dismal defeat under Michael Foot, the then shadow minister Giles Radice was asked to look at where Labour had gone wrong.
In his report "Southern Discomfort," he concluded Labour could never win power again unless it could win seats like Ipswich.
After the 2010 defeat the former MP for Waveney wrote a report saying that winning in the East was essential to Labour's future success.
The policy  was embraced by Ed Miliband who beefed up the regional office and regularly visited the region.
Could the East be forgotten again under Jeremy Corbyn, or will the new leader surprise us all?
