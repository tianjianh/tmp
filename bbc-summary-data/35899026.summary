Plans for a £17.1m infrastructure development project near junction 36 of the M1 have been announced.

Sheffield City Region (SCR) said the money will fund the redevelopment of about 34 hectares of land and has the potential to create 4,500 jobs.
Funding for the project, which is expected to start later this year, will come from the SCR and private investors.
SCR leader Sir Steve Houghton described the plans as a "huge opportunity".
He said: "This £17.1m investment will open up all that land for future business investment, as well as solving the congestion problems that we've got at Junction 36.
"The infrastructure work will take about 18 months to complete; then we'll be talking to businesses about coming and relocating to this part of the region and hopefully providing those much-needed jobs."
