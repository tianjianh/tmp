Oxford United manager Michael Appleton believes there is more to come from his side after they secured their first victory in League One on Saturday.

The U's edged out Peterborough 2-1 with an injury time-winning penalty from Chris Maguire at the Kassam Stadium.
The win also came off the back of two consecutive defeats away from home.
"I thought we made massive improvements in our performance," Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford. "We hadn't been doing enough to make the keeper work before."
Oxford, who finished second last season in League Two to gain automatic promotion, have had to rebuild the squad following injuries and the sale of midfielders Kemar Roofe and Callum O'Dowda in pre-season.
"We're a side at the moment who are still searching for that rhythm we had last season," Appleton added.
"But I have to give the players credit for how they responded and the resilience they showed after conceding."
