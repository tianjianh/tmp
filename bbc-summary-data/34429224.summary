[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second man has been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a 50-year-old woman police now believe was murdered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalia Doherty was last seen on 15 April 2003 in Eastbourne, where she was living at the time.
On Wednesday a Luton man, aged 66, was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and preventing a lawful burial
Last week a 71-year-old man from Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, was arrested on suspicion of the same offences.
A house in Icknield Way in Luton has been searched as part of the investigation.
When Ms Doherty disappeared she was thought to have travelled to Luton to stay with her ex-husband, Gerald Doherty, who has since died.
Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit launched an investigation in January 2014 into the case, which has led them to believe Ms Doherty was murdered in 2003.
A police spokesman said: "Proof-of-life enquiries have since failed to show any sign she is alive.
"Investigators are keen to trace Natalia's final movements and anyone who recognises her or Gerald from their time at the now-demolished pub, the Regents Arms in Hastings Street, Luton, or has any information relating to her disappearance, is asked to contact the police."
