He had trouble breathing when emergency services were called to Frank's Flooring Store in Darlington on Sunday.
It was thought the boy was trying to climb the plasterboard wall when it fell on top of him, Durham Police said.
The force said his injuries were not life-threatening and he was in a stable condition. He was kept in hospital overnight as a precaution.
The boy was treated at the scene by paramedics before being flown to Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital.
Frank's Flooring Store could not be reached for comment.
