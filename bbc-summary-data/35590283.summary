[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lottie Pauling-Chamberlain, who sleeps outside Lush in Oxford, said she challenged a thief as they left the store early last Wednesday.
A woman, 29, of no fixed abode, has been held on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and possessing Class A drugs, police said.
A man, 42, also of no fixed abode, has been arrested on suspicion of burglary.
Thames Valley Police said its policy was not to name those arrested.
Staff at the shop in Cornmarket Street realised a laptop and large box of cosmetics had disappeared when they opened the shop last week.
The next day Ms Pauling-Chamberlain, who sleeps rough in the area with her dog Marley, returned the stolen items.
Staff started a fundraising bid to thank her which has reached Â£9,000.
