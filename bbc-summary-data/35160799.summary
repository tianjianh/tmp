Man admits rape and sexual abuse of girls over 25-year period

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted 21 counts of rape and sexual abuse against girls as young as four over a 25-year-period has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Roach, 62, pleaded guilty to two counts of rape, 17 of indecent assault and two of sexual assault at Liverpool Crown Court.
Police said Roach, of Maghull, had attacked five girls aged four to 11 between 1986 and 2011.
He was sentenced to a total of 17 years and six months.
He was also made the subject of an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order.
Speaking after sentencing, Det Insp Jimmy Belmar said Roach was a "determined sexual predator".
He added that Roach had only been stopped because "thankfully, in some cases, parents recognised the warning signs and called police when they realised something serious had happened".
