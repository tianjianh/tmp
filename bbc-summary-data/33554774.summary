Jagged metalwork, laid to thwart a Nazi invasion during World War Two, has been exposed on a Hampshire beach.

Warning buoys have been placed alongside the scaffold-like structure which has emerged following erosion at Hordle Beach, near Lymington.
New Forest District Council said the "difficult and costly" work to remove the metalwork is due to be carried out during low tides in August.
It said people should avoid swimming in the area.
The line of metal scaffold, or trellis, is believed to have been placed in the sea along the New Forest's coast by the Wiltshire Regiment in 1940-41, designed to thwart invading troops and their landing craft.
However, within two tides of being installed, it had sunk into the sea bed by 40cm (16in).
Parts of the structure have emerged over the decades since the war, but the council said more metalwork was now being uncovered at a "rapid rate".
There are also known to be remains of other wartime metal and concrete structures in the sea to the east of Barton beach.
