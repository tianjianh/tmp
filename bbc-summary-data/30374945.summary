X Factor 2014: Fleur East number one on iTunes

X Factor finalist Fleur East already has a number one.

The 26-year-old has topped the iTunes chart after performing Uptown Funk during Saturday night's semi-final of the ITV competition.
The tune, by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars, is only available digitally and features on Ronson's upcoming album Uptown Special due out next year.
Fleur's mentor Simon Cowell said the performance was one of the top three in the show's 10-year history.
He said it had all the makings of being "one to remember".
So, last-minute song change. Check.
Singing AND dancing. Check.
Being a little known track, as it's not physically been released yet. Check.
While the viewing public were clearly impressed they downloaded it so much it hit the top spot on iTunes, one person had something else to say.
And shock, horror, it was Lily Allen.
She tweeted: "Is this even out yet? #XFactor ... Well done to @sony for managing to get a not yet released song of theirs sung on prime time weekend telly. #uptownfunk #shazam #airplay
"It is an amazing song and Fleur did it justice but it's still a great example of music industry corruption. #uptown funk"
The so-called "corruption" she's talking about is more just clever song choice by Simon Cowell, surely?
Note that Mark Ronson's track is physically released on 11 January on Columbia Records which, along with Simon Cowell's label Syco, are both part of Sony Music.
After Fleur belted out the tune wearing black hotpants and a gold jacket there was a standing ovation from the judges and gushing comments from Simon.
"Let this moment sink in because this is the moment that you went from a contestant to a star," he said.
"That was in the top three best performance I've seen on the show."
When Fleur was told the good news about grabbing number one on the iTunes singles chart on The Xtra Factor she was obviously thrilled: "Oh my god! I can't believe it! Right now I am literally lost for words, but feel on top of the world," she said.
So that was Sunday night and as I write it's still at the top spot now (the only of the current X Factor contestants in the top 40), while the video of her performance has already racked up more than 670,000 hits on YouTube.
Seventeen-year-old Lauren Platt was kicked out of the competition on Sunday leaving Fleur East, Ben Haenow and Andrea Faustini to battle it out in next weekend's final.
