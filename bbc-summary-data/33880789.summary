[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dentist Philip Lamey allowed to practice under strict conditions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior dentist who was found guilty of more than 100 charges of misconduct is to be allowed to practice again after his suspension was lifted by the General Dental Council (GDC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In April, Prof Philip Lamey won his appeal against being struck off.
A further review has now concluded that subject to very strict conditions the dentist can return to work.
Prof Lamey can start to treat dental patients again but will have to undergo regular supervision.
Last year, the GDC, the body that regulates dentists, found him guilty of serious misconduct and removed him from the dental register.
The action came after Prof Lamey, who was a consultant in oral medicine at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, had 135 patients recalled after 35 of them developed cancer. Four of them died.
A lengthy investigation found him guilty of failing to diagnose cancer in patients and poor record keeping.
The latest review means the dentist can practice so long as he agrees to continuous assessment and a personal development plan that acknowledges his deficiencies.
