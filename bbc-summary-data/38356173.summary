The competition had been filled with highs and lows for the three finalists which included surviving the dreaded dance-off and scoring 10s from notoriously difficult judge Craig Revel-Horwood.
Here we look at what Danny Mac, Ore Oduba and Louise Redknapp brought to the 2016 show:
Famous for: Being an actor - he appeared on long-running soap Hollyoaks.
Known on Strictly for: His shirt "accidentally" coming undone - and occasionally being so good he is confused for one of the professional dancers.
Grand final dances: The couple's favourite dance was their samba to Magalenha by Sergio Mendes. Their showdance was performed to Set Fire to the Rain by Adele. Mabuse said the dance expressed Mac's journey on Strictly Come Dancing and how "Strictly has made him a better person".
Best moment: "The best moment for a high was probably the samba and getting that score - the first time everything went as good as it could possibly have been."
Worst moment: "It was the foxtrot, the disappointment Oti felt that she hadn't done enough. It broke my heart that she felt she hadn't done enough for me."
Key quotes:
Famous for: Being a BBC sports presenter.
Known on Strictly for: Getting emotional and shedding a few tears - on more than one occasion.
Grand final dances: Oduba and Clifton took to the dancefloor with a jive to Runaway Baby by Bruno Mars, their favourite of the series. Their showdance was set to I Got Rhythm by George and Ira Gershwin.
Best moment: "For me, the best thing has been learning to dance with such an amazing friend."
Worst moment: "Being in the dance-off for the first time for the salsa. In that moment, the whole Strictly experience flashes before your eyes and within a dance, you might not be able to do this again. And it's crushing."
Key quotes:
Famous for: Performing with girl band Eternal and as a solo singer.
Grand final dances: The dance picked by the pair to repeat for the final was their Argentine Tango to Tanguera by Sexteto Mayor. Their showdance was to One Moment in Time by Whitney Houston, which Clifton said was "based on Louise... her story on Strictly, how she's developed from the beginning to the end".
Best moment: "The moment I enjoyed most was probably with my feathers, in Big Spender - getting to stand up there with two big feathers, shimmying, it's good fun."
Worst moment: "Apart from wearing a fruit hat on Saturday, which wasn't one of my finest moments - I had a slight meltdown over wearing the fruit hat - I cried in rehearsals trying to learn the rumba and I'm not that person - I don't cry when I can't get something. I just get on with it. I never thought Strictly would affect me like that."
