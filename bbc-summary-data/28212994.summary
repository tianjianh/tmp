Edinburgh Zoo's Giant Panda Tian Tian has conceived after being artificially inseminated earlier this year.

Experts say this doesn't mean she is technically pregnant and have urged people "not to get too excited."
However, they say that if everything goes to plan, they will be able to confirm the pregnancy within 20 to 30 days with a potential birth in August.
The procedure was carried out after attempts to bring her together with male partner, Yang Guang, failed.
Tian Tian also conceived last year and hopes were high for a rare birth in captivity.
But Edinburgh Zoo announced in October that she was no longer pregnant.
Staff had said the panda was showing signs of pregnancy, but that she had lost the cub.
Experts said at the time her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term.
Tian Tian had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks.
However, the zoo said she later returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda.
Tian Tian and Yang Guang arrived in Scotland from China in 2011.
