The British Red Cross, Mercy Corps, Glasgow the Caring City and Edinburgh Direct Aid will share the money.
International Development Minister Humza Yousaf is due to visit the Greek island of Lesbos to see first hand how the aid effort is working.

Mr Yousaf said: "The Scottish government and the people of Scotland are committed to helping the most vulnerable people in their hour of need.
"We know we must do more to help those men, women and children coming to Europe seeking protection and refuge.
"I hope that today's announcement of £300,000 will go some way towards helping those who most need our help."
