The singer was headlining the event with his Africa Express project and was joined on stage by artists like Laura Mvula and Yeah Yeah Yeah's Nick Zinner.
The set - which overran until 04:00 - included covers of Randy Newman and reinterpretations of Gorillaz tracks.
After playing The Clash's Should I Stay Or Should I Go, he encouraged the crowd to protest at the plug being pulled.
"You want more, we're going to give you more," the singer declared before a man, thought to be the stage manager, emerged, put the singer's jacket over his shoulders and lifted him off stage.
In a video, filmed by someone in the audience, Albarn - who had refused to leave the stage- egged on fans who chanted "we want more".
Albarn's Africa Express collective, a collaboration between African and Western musicians, has played at events such as Glastonbury and the BBC's Electric Proms.
It has also seen Albarn travel to countries including Mali to play with local musicians.
Saturday night's performance included appearances by Nigerian artist Seye Adelekan and Malian band Songhoy Blues.
Albarn is currently on tour with Blur who are playing dates across the world this summer following the release of album The Magic Whip.
Albarn also recently unveiled wonder.land, his reworking of Alice in Wonderland, at the Manchester International Festival.
