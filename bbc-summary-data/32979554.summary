The 30-year-old helped the Shrimpers earn promotion to League One in 2014-15, scoring 15 league goals - including one in the League Two play-off semi-final, first leg tie at Stevenage.
Corr was out of contract and ends a five-year spell at Roots Hall, in which he netted 63 times in 185 games.
"There were a few clubs interested, but I've got a good feeling about here," he told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"Some people from the outside might wonder whether it's the right decision, but I think maybe at the end of next season people won't be wondering why I've come here.
"The club's going places, the players that are coming in are good; there's good plans here."
The former Sheffield Wednesday and Exeter forward also paid tribute to his former club as they prepare to play in the division above him.
"I've had a great time there, the fans have always been very good to me," he said.
"It was a difficult decision to leave, but I think it was probably the right time for me to leave."
