Markets closed little changed, in spite of steep declines in supermarket chains, with Kroger down 9.2%, and Target and Walmart falling about 5%.
Shares in Amazon rose 2.4% while Whole Foods jumped 29% to $42.68, above the price of Amazon's bid.
Analysts said the deal was potentially a seismic shift in the sector.
The S&P 500 index held steady edging up 0.69 points to close at 2,433.15 in early trade.
The Dow Jones climbed 0.11% to 21,384.28, while the Nasdaq slid 13.74 points to 6,151.76.
A report from the US census also showed new housing construction slowed in May, a sign of economic weakness that pushed Treasury yields lower.
