A Virgin Australia plane has been evacuated after a threatening note was found on a domestic flight from Sydney to Albury, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Passengers were forced out an emergency exit window of the 68-seat plane after it landed safely in Albury on Tuesday.
A male passenger, 30, was arrested and charged over a "document threatening death or grievous bodily harm".
Police did not disclose the alleged details of the note, found in a toilet, but said it was not terror-related.
A Virgin Australia spokesman said flight VA1174 arrived safely at Albury airport and was met by police.
Authorities said they were called about 15 minutes before the turboprop landed.
The man was arrested at the airport.
One passenger, Wendy Willett, said passengers did not know about the incident until police arrived on the tarmac.
"There was nothing unusual about [the man arrested]," she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
"He read a book most of the flight."
The man was granted bail and will face court on 4 July.
