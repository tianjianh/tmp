Caledonian MacBrayne is to reverse its decision to change the ferry operating on its Mallaig to Armadale on Skye service, BBC Scotland understands.

The ferry MV Coruisk was used for the route before being redeployed to CalMac's Oban-Mull route.
People on Skye have complained that the two smaller replacement ferries have been prone to disruption.
Ian Blackford, MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, said MV Coruisk's return would be welcomed.
A CalMac spokesperson could not confirm the redeployment, but said the company was looking at all options to improve reliability on the Mallaig to Armadale route.
Mr Blackford told BBC Radio Scotland that the Coruisk was ideally suited to operating on the Skye route while the replacement vessels' operation was dictated by tidal conditions.
But the MP added that he did not want the situation to be "a fight between Skye and Mull" and wanted all ferry routes to have the appropriate vessel.
