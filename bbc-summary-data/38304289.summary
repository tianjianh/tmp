The American, 31, won his 23rd Olympic gold in his final Games in Rio.
The most decorated Olympian of all time, he claimed five golds and a silver this year.
He joins a star-studded list of previous lifetime award winners also including former footballer Pele and ex-golfer Seve Ballesteros.

"I'm thrilled to receive the prestigious Sports Personality lifetime achievement award and follow in the footsteps of so many sporting greats," said Phelps.
"It is a fitting way to end what has been an unbelievable year for me and I'm looking forward to what will be a great night."
Phelps came out of retirement to compete in Rio, his fifth Olympics, and won golds in the 200m butterfly, 200m medley, 4x100m freestyle, 4x200m freestyle and 4x100m medley.
He has amassed 28 medals since making his Games debut in 2000.
That is 10 more than the next best - gymnast Larisa Latynina, who competed for the Soviet Union between 1956 and 1964, winning 18 medals, nine of them gold.
The lifetime award is one of several prizes to be awarded during the Sports Personality programme, which will be broadcast live from the Genting Arena in Birmingham.
A public vote on the night decides the winner of the main award, with 16 contenders on the shortlist.
