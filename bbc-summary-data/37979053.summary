[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher 'had sex with pupil on wife's wedding dress'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An independent school teacher had sex with a pupil on top of his wife's wedding dress, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Ball has admitted five counts of engaging in sexual activity while in a position of trust at a Cambridgeshire school and was suspended last year.
But he had previously abused three pupils at another school and escaped prosecution, Peterborough Crown Court heard.
Mr Ball denies indecency and sexual assault charges.
The court heard Mr Ball, 42, of Greenwich in London, was a teacher at a North Yorkshire school when the first alleged offences happened in the early 2000s.
He accepted a job at an independent school in Cambridgeshire while an investigation into the allegations was continuing, was given a positive reference from the North Yorkshire school and was not charged, Gregory Perrins, prosecuting, said.
Mr Ball was suspended from the Cambridgeshire school last year following allegations made by another pupil.
Mr Perrins told jurors: "You're going to hear he has pleaded guilty to a number of charges arising out of those allegations.
"Police then had cause to revisit allegations made at his previous school and that's why there's been a significant delay between the offences we say were committed then and 2015."
Mr Perrins said Mr Ball had sex with one of the girls in different locations and on multiple occasions, including in the school music room and on top of his wife's wedding dress at his house.
Mr Ball has since separated from his wife, who is expected to give evidence in the trial, Mr Perrins said.
He denies four counts of indecent assault and five counts of engaging in sexual activity while in a position of trust at the school in North Yorkshire.
The court heard that allegations were made at the time but the school's investigation was "seriously lacking".
The trial continues.
