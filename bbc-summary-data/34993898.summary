Both sides were chasing a top-two spot in the qualifying tournament and progression to India in 2016.
Scotland made just 77-9 in their 20 overs, with Fiona Urquhart hitting 21 while Lucy O'Reilly took three wickets.
Clare Shillington (34) and Cecelia Joyce (36no) eased Ireland to the target and a final against Bangladesh.
Bangladesh beat Zimbabwe by 31 runs in the other semi-final.
Liz Priddle (11) was the only other Scottish batter to manage double figures as the wickets tumbled.
Six Irish bowlers took wickets, with Robyn Lewis claiming 2-8.
An opening partnership of 58 between Shillington and Cecelia Joyce laid the foundations for a comfortable run-chase.
Kim Garth hit a winning four to spark celebrations as the Irish finished on 79-1 in the 12th over.
