Chris Lait's fierce 18-yard left foot shot just inside the left upright put the Glassboys ahead on 51 minutes.
Lait was then denied by Spanish keeper Adria, only for Luke Benbow to drill in the rebound from the edge of the box.
Benbow then curled in a right-footed free-kick from 18 yards to seal victory in the 76th minute.
Northampton manager Rob Page was among a 1,993 crowd to see seventh-tier Northern Premier League side Stourbridge upset their sixth-tier National League South opponents.
The first game in Brighton nine days ago had ended in controversy when the home side thought they had hit a late winner, only for substitute Javier Favarel's 30-yard strike to be ruled out by referee Robert Whitton as he had just blown for full-time.
Home keeper Ross Flitney was so angry that he ran more than half the length of the field to remonstrate with the official, earning himself a red card, a three-game ban - and a call-up for Adria as his replacement.
In a quiet first half, neither keeper saw much action, the closest to an opener being when Benbow flashed a shot across the face of goal.
But it all changed when Lait broke the deadlock, before two-goal Benbow ended hopes of a reunion for Whitehawk boss Richard Hill against his former club Northampton.
