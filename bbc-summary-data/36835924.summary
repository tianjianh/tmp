The real-time monster-hunting game has become wildly popular since its UK release on 14 July.
One post by Police Scotland's Stirling division, saying someone found on a shop roof used the game as an excuse, got over 7,000 retweets in 24 hours.
Police Scotland confirmed that the tweet was a joke.
The official police accounts have become known for posting cheeky humour amongst police updates.
The Twitter account covering Glasgow North used the Pokemon slogan 'gotta catch 'em all' to refer to the apprehension of four people.
The phrase 'Pokemon Go' has now been tweeted over 15 million times across the world
The game, which comes in the form of a mobile app, combines reality with gaming and requires players to walk around outside to find Pokemon.
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service also used the trend to encourage people to test their fire alarms.
Jokes aside, Ayrshire Police Division relayed a safety message to those taking part in the gaming craze.
