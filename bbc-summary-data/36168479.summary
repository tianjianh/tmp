He was at the motor racing circuit for the media preview of the Silverstone Classic festival which takes place in July this year, where he will mark the 40th anniversary of his father winning the F1 championship in 1976.
Freddie Hunt was greeted in the pit lane by former motor sport commentator Murray Walker (left) and Alastair Caldwell, who was team manager at McLaren when Hunt won the championship.
Freddie Hunt drove his father's title-winning McLaren-Ford M23.  James Hunt died in 1993 at the age of just 45.
"I know the crowds at Silverstone back in the seventies really took my dad's heroics to their hearts, so it's going to be very special for all of us in the family to be marking the 40th anniversary of his World Championship at this summer's Silverstone Classic," said Freddie Hunt.
Classic vehicles of all ages and types had gathered for the preview of the summer event.
The world's biggest historic motor racing festival expects to attract more than 100,000 visitors.
The preview day saw a wide range of vehicles take to the track.
From open-wheel cars like this Lotus 20/22...
To the Austin Mini Cooper S of Graham Churchill and Peter Baldwin.
Supercars were also on show, such as this Lamborghini Diablo.
Silverstone Classic takes place from 29-31 July.
