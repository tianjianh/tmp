Mitchell, 34, followed manager Mauricio Pochettino from Southampton to White Hart Lane in 2014.
He has helped recruit players like England midfielder Dele Alli and Belgium defender Toby Alderweireld.
"Whilst most of our business has been completed, Mitch is keen to ensure we start the season in the best position," Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said.
"We understand and respect his wish to consider new avenues. The priority right now is the final few weeks of the transfer window."
