Three of the Spice Girls have released a video hinting at a possible reunion.

Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Melanie Brown - also known as Baby, Ginger and Scary - all appear in the video, which was released on YouTube on Friday.
The trio say they want to thank their fans by having a party to celebrate two decades since their debut single Wannabe was released.
"You've stood by us for 20 years, and we want to say a big thank you," Horner says in the video.
"And we want to celebrate and have a party. And when we do, you're all invited," continues Brown - commonly known as Mel B.
The text which then appears across the screen suggests further news about the group's exact plans will be announced later.
"We hope to tell you soon what you really really want," the written message reads - a reference to Wannabe's lyrics.
A website has also been set up to host the video - called Spice Girls GEM - thought to stand for Geri, Emma, Mel B.
Victoria Beckham and Melanie Chisholm - Posh and Sporty Spice - are notably absent.
However, Chisholm did tweet on Friday morning: "Happy 20th birthday Wannabe - you haven't aged a bit!"
The video comes the day after The Sun reported the trio are planning a reunion concert in London's Hyde Park next summer.
The band and their management have not yet confirmed any live dates - but music producer Eliot Kennedy, who has frequently worked with The Spice Girls, has confirmed Bunton, Brown and Horner have been working on new music.
He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "We have been in the studio, with just three of them - Mel B and Geri and Emma - and we had a fantastic couple of days.
"We wrote a brilliant song and the energy was exactly like it was 20 years ago, just as enthusiastic, just as much to say, just as much to celebrate.
"I think they have something to do with way female artists are perceived in the pop charts nowadays, I think they've had a massive effect on pop music and pop culture, so it's a good time to celebrate."
