Tries from Ben Smith, Israel Dagg, Julian Savea and TJ Perenara - plus 14 points from the boot of Beauden Barrett - helped the World Cup holders win the title with a game to spare.
Horacio Agulla scored the home side's only try two minutes from time.
Captain Richie McCaw made his 133rd appearance for the All Blacks, equalling Colin Meads's record.
The 33-year-old flanker said: "They were wonderful conditions to play in and I'm really proud of the way the guys took their opportunities."
South Africa's 28-10 victory over Australia earlier in the day meant New Zealand needed a bonus-point victory to wrap up the title.
And with 12 minutes gone they led 13-0, with Smith crossing after good work by Dagg and Barrett adding the conversion to two early penalties.
Nicolas Sanchez kicked two first-half penalties for the hosts, but they sandwiched another converted All Blacks try, with Dagg going over after linking again with Smith.
Savea shrugged off three opponents to power over just before the hour mark and Perenara secured the bonus-point try after Jerome Kaino's burst.
Argentina's spirit was rewarded with Agulla's late converted try, but the Pumas remain without a win in 20 Tests against the All Blacks.
New Zealand coach Steve Hansen: "I'm very pleased with the way we've played throughout the tournament.
"We've had to win many different ways because of the weather and because of the opposition playing as well as they have."
Argentina coach Daniel Hourcade: "They played a great game. The simple way they do things is awesome.
"They played the breakdown much better and made a difference there. Also, we could not make the most of our clean breaks."
