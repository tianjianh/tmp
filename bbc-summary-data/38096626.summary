Torquay United midfielder Damon Lathrope has been ruled out for much of the rest of the season.

The 27-year-old needs surgery on a groin injury that has restricted him to just 10 appearances this season.
"The chances are he's going to be out until sometime around April," manager Kevin Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"It's really unfortunate for him as his season never really got going and it looks like it's virtually ended before he had had a chance to do anything."
He continued: "At least he'll get to the bottom of that problem and that'll be the last he'll see of it in his career."
Lathrope rejoined Torquay in the summer after two years at Aldershot.
He played 122 games for the Devon club in his first spell between 2010 and 2014 and played in their League Two play-off final defeat against Stevenage in 2011.
