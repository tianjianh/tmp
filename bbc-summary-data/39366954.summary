Sandie Bowen, 53, was murdered by Michael Bowen in 1997 - he never revealed where he hid her body.
Her remains were discovered at Wentwood Reservoir, near Newport, on 2 February.
After talks with the Crown Prosecution Service, Gwent Police said no further action would be taken against Bowen, who was jailed for life in 1998 but was recently released on licence.
Mrs Bowen, originally from Folkestone, Kent, was living in Llandogo, Monmouthshire, when she was killed.
