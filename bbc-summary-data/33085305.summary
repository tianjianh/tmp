It is thought someone tried to throw the items over the wall of HMP Bristol but they rebounded and fell into the playground at Bishop Road Primary.
Parents were warned that "illicit items" had been found in a letter from the deputy head.
Bishop Road Primary School told the BBC it did not want to comment.
One mother told the BBC: "It really concerns me that things like this are being found in the playground."
"I don't want my child touching these sorts of things. We're waiting to hear what the school and prison are going to do about it."
Bishop Road Primary backs onto HMP Bristol in Horfield, a category B men's prison, with some young offenders.
The school's deputy head Joe Emissah wrote to parents on Wednesday, praising the prison for its work with the school.
But he added: "Recently there have been a number of incidents in which items intended to be illicitly passed over the prison wall to inmates, have found their way into the Silverthorne playground.
"I am proud to say that children at Bishop Road always impress staff, parents and visitors alike with their great maturity, awareness and responsibility in raising any concerns of this nature."
Avon and Somerset Police said they were using dogs and officers to search people coming into the prison, which has security cameras on its perimeter.
Inspector Mark Runacres said: "We believe someone has tried to get these items into the prison by attempting to throw them over the prison wall.
"We always work closely with our partners at HMP Bristol. We are already aware of this issue and we are actively working to tackle it."
A prison source said they were working with police to catch those responsible.
