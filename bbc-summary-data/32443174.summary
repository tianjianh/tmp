[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fire crews were called to Maghaberry prison at about 16.30 BST after a fire started in a wing of Roe House, where integrated prisoners are housed.
A Prison Service spokesperson said "it was necessary to move some prisoners outside and bring in the fire service".
They said no-one was injured and the incident ended at 21:30 BST.
Roe House also houses dissident republican prisoners, who are segregated from other inmates.
It is understood that no dissident republicans were involved in the incident, and were not removed from their cells.
Neither the Prison Service nor the Fire and Rescue Service would comment on the cause of the fire.
