Edinburgh said 1,231,712 passengers passed through the airport last month - a 10.8% year-on-year increase.
International traffic was up by 15.6% at just over 766,000.
Glasgow recorded a 16.5% increase in international passengers, with overall traffic climbing by 10% to more than 910,000.
The airport said there had been strong demand for European city destinations, including Eurowings' Dusseldorf route and Ryanair services to Brussels, Sofia and Valencia.
May also saw the airport's long-haul services climb by 15% as a result of greater demand for North American flights, while Easyjet's Bristol services and Loganair's Highlands and Islands routes helped boost domestic travel.
Glasgow Airport managing director Amanda McMillan said: "As we look ahead this month, the airport is gearing up for what is set to be our busiest June on record as the school term comes to an end and tens of thousands of families pass through our doors to head off on their holidays."
