M20 bridge collapse in Kent: Lorry driver in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry driver has appeared in court accused of causing a pedestrian bridge to collapse on to a motorway by driving dangerously.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A motorcyclist suffered broken ribs when the bridge fell on to the London-bound carriageway of the M20 in Kent on 27 August last year.
Alan Austen, 63, from Darlington, in Durham, did not enter a plea when he appeared before Maidstone magistrates.
The case was sent to crown court, with the next date set for 17 March.
Mr Austen is accused of dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
He also faces three counts of criminal damage.
The bridge collapse happened between junctions four and three, near the junction with the M26, which links the M25 London orbital with the M20.
The road, which is the main route to the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover, had to be shut while two large cranes worked to clear the debris.
