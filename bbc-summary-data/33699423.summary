Barclays reports 25% rise in profits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barclays bank has reported a 25% rise in statutory pre-tax profits to £3.14bn for the six months to the end of June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Profits last year were £2.55bn. The bank also set aside  a further £850m to compensate customers - including further claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance.
The results come less than a month after the bank's new chairman John McFarlane sacked Antony Jenkins.
In total, Barclays has now set aside £6bn to compensate for PPI mis-selling.
Mr McFarlane is expected set out plans to speed up reform at the bank later.
In April, Barclays set aside a further £800m, largely to cover potential further legal action and penalties for alleged foreign exchange manipulation.
That resulted in Barclays reporting a 26% fall in its first quarter statutory profits to £1.34bn.
Mr McFarlane, who took over as executive chairman of insurance giant Aviva in 2012 after sacking then chief executive Andrew Moss, believes Barclays' turnaround is not happening quickly enough.
As he did at Aviva, Mr McFarlane, who only joined the bank in April, will take on executive duties, spearheading a quest for higher returns until a replacement is found, which is it thought is unlikely to be before spring next year.
