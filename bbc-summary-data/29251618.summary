[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham kept their heads in a tense finish as they beat Warwickshire by three wickets to win the One-Day Cup.

Bears skipper Varun Chopra made 64 as the Bears, having lost the toss and been put in, were dismissed cheaply in bowler-friendly conditions for 165.
Opener Mark Stoneman's 52 rescued Durham from 12-2 before spinner Jeetan Patel took 4-25 to give the Bears hope.

But Ben Stokes (38) and Gareth Breese (15) restored calm to get home on 166-7 with more than nine overs in hand.
Breese, one of only three survivors from Durham's only previous one-day final appearance (their Friends Provident Trophy win over Hampshire in 2007), struck the winning runs in what was likely to be his final appearance for the county.
He had also contributed wonderfully with the ball earlier in the day, taking 3-30 from seven overs.
But man of the match Stokes was even more influential. After returning figures of 2-25 with the ball, despite two dropped catches, he kept a cool head with the bat in a nail-biting finale that was in marked contrast to his heroic semi-final innings, when he blasted 164 off 113 balls to see off Notts.
Having lost the toss on an hugely overcast day, when the Lord's lights were on from the outset, the Bears had already avoided a couple of early scares when Will Porterfield edged the first ball of the fifth over to Durham wicketkeeper Phil Mustard, who took a good low catch.
Jonathan Trott laboured for 15 balls before being trapped leg before in Paul Collingwood's first over to make it 29-2.
Collingwood then dropped Tim Ambrose at slip off Stokes on three before making amends without too much damage done when he himself had the Bears wicketkeeper caught at slip - a similar sharp chance to his right snapped up by Breese.
The 50 came up in the 17th over when Chopra guided only the third boundary of the innings through extra cover, but Ambrose's dismissal led to three wickets going down for just five runs in 18 deliveries.
Laurie Evans gloved a lifter from Stokes to the safe hands of Breese at second slip and, although he then had Rikki Clarke dropped one-handed by Mustard in his next over, Stokes soon rearranged the Warwickshire all-rounder's stumps to make it 68-5.
Chopra and Woakes helped to make a game of it with a sixth-wicket stand of 47, but a brilliant one-handed catch running back by Scotsman Calum MacLeod - who spent two seasons on Warwickshire's books in 2008 and 2009 - accounted for Woakes.
Shortly after, Rushworth returned to remove Chopra's leg stump, and Patel perished at short third man after hitting Breese for six off the previous ball.
Breese collected his third wicket when Ollie Hannon-Dolby spooned to mid-on before the innings ended with three overs unused when Boyd Rankin was run out going for a second.
Warwickshire needed early wickets to stand a chance and Clarke quickly struck twice, hitting Mustard's middle stump before having MacLeod caught at first slip.
Skipper Stoneman responded by bludgeoning 10 boundaries before becoming one of three lbw decisions for Patel as Durham were sent sliding from 60-2 to 86-5.
Durham skipper Collingwood and Stokes appeared to have restored calm with a stand of 31.
But, with 49 needed, Collingwood steered Hannon-Dolby to point, and then Gordon Muchall became Patel's fourth lbw victim (all from fast balls from the Pavilion End which kept low) to make it 130-7.
However, Stokes stood firm and when his fortuitous attempted reverse sweep narrowly missed the stumps to run away for four in Patel's final over, Durham finally sensed that they had it won.
It was left to 38-year-old Jamaican Breese to carve the winning runs to third man and make it two victories out of two for Durham in Lord's finals.
BBC Radio Newcastle's Martin Emmerson:
"If you had told me a month ago that Durham would be safe from relegation in Division One and winning a cup at Lord's I would have told you you were mad.
"Things were grim. They'd just lost a crucial relegation clash to Lancashire and the One-Day Cup looked to be fizzling out.
"But, in the last three seasons, Durham have come into their own with a stunning run of late season form.
"Two years ago they won five out of six to stay up. Last year it was five in a row to win the title and this year three in a row to achieve safety in the four-day game and six in a row to win the cup.
"And the backbone of the team has been produced via the academy. Those who had the vision to go first-class in 1992 deserve praise. The players don't seem to know when they're beaten and have such determination.
"Fitting too that it should be Gareth Breese who scored the winning runs in his last one day appearance."
BBC WM's Clive Eakin:
"Warwickshire will take some credit for making a contest of a match which had looked decided at the halfway stage.
"Jeetan Patel was outstanding with the ball and may even have merited a Man of the Match award despite being on the losing side.
"In the end, the Bears will reflect that even 30 more runs might have been enough to win but Durham, whose bowlers were unerringly accurate, deserved to win."
