He became a superstar at the age of sixteen, as lead singer of iconic 1960s rock band The Easybeats.
Their song, Friday On My Mind, became a global hit and was voted the best Australian song ever in a 2001 poll.
The group broke up after five years, but their music was later covered by David Bowie, INXS and many others.
Ordinary Australians as well as high profile figures in the music industry have been posting their memories of Wright on social media.
Battling drug and alcohol addiction, he underwent electric shock treatments and "deep sleep therapy" - medically induced comas - in the 1970s, that left him with long-term after-effects.
The Sydney private hospital that treated him was later the subject of a Royal Commission after dozens of patients died.
He passed away in hospital on Sunday night.
