[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett inspired his team to a draw in his first game in charge as their derby at Wolves ended goalless.

Just a week on from losing 8-0 at home to Bournemouth in a club record home defeat, Blues kept only their second clean sheet of the season.
Wolves sub Dave Edwards' left-foot chip clipped the top of the bar.
Blues' best chance fell to Jonathan Grounds, whose header was parried by Wolves keeper Carl Ikeme.
Grounds was also the man involved in a penalty shout when James Henry's cross struck his outstretched left arm.
Wolves' point from the lunchtime derby was enough to take them briefly to the top of the Championship for the first time this season, before dropping down to fourth later in the day.
Rowett, a former Birmingham defender, left his job at Burton to join Blues on Monday, two days after the thrashing by Bournemouth and a week after Lee Clark's departure.
And the new man made changes to his side, drafting in loan signing Michael Morrison, signed from Charlton Athletic on Friday, while Andrew Shinnie was recalled alongside Wolves old boy David Davis.
After an early onslaught from the home team, it all worked for the new-look line-up before the break as Wolves quickly ran out of ideas.
Blues, by contrast, visibly grew in confidence, creating two chances for youngster Koby Arthur and another for Clayton Donaldson.
The second half proved more lively, both sets of fans becoming animated following the handball shout against Grounds.
After Ikeme had saved a header from the Blues left-back, Wolves began to create chances following the arrival of substitutes Edwards and Bakary Sako.
Kevin McDonald rifled a low shot just wide, before Edwards was twice denied by keeper Darren Randolph.
Sako's low cross was then somehow allowed to pass across the face of goal, just inches away from Leon Clarke, who also saw a near-post header fly just over.
But, although the dangerous Edwards then saw his chip hit the bar, that was as close as Wolves got to forcing a winner.
Wolves boss Kenny Jackett told BBC WM:
"We huffed and puffed and we had a lot of the ball but we didn't do enough going forward in the final third.
"It didn't surprise me the way they set up, playing 5-4-1. But it was down to us to break them down.
"As for the penalty shout, sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't. It could have gone either way."
Birmingham City boss Gary Rowett told BBC WM:
"It's been a fresh start this week. Last week's result really wasn't mentioned. It's all been about looking forward and I'm very pleased with what I saw.
"I didn't expect us to come and keep a clean sheet at Molineux. But I'd certainly have taken that. It's something to build on now.
"Most of our focus this week has been working on our defensive shape and structure, but we also broke into some good areas and, with a bit more composure, that could have have brought us something."
