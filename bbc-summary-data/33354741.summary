SSE Renewables applies to build NI's largest wind farm near Draperstown

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A planning application has been submitted for what would be Northern Ireland largest wind farm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
SSE Renewables wants to install 36 turbines in the Sperrin mountains near Draperstown in County Londonderry.
The project known, as the Doraville Wind Farm, could provide 115 MW of power.
The planning application also states that minor works would be needed to roads in the area to facilitate turbine delivery.
Twenty five of the turbines would have a maximum height of 140m, with the other 11 having a maximum height of 126.5m.
SSE began engagement with the Planning Service in 2013 and has also held a series of community consultations.
It is anticipated that the windfarm would connect to the grid at the Magherafelt substation.
