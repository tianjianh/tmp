The 7ft bronze statue of the legendary Middlesbrough FC goal scorer who went on to become a successful manager has been standing at the town's Albert Park since 2007.
However, in July a crack was found above Clough's bronze ankle, and the statue was fenced off.
Experts have now carried out repairs and the fencing has been removed.
Clough, who made more than 200 appearances for Boro between 1955 and 1961, would often walk through the park on his way to the club's former ground.
The statue by sculptor Vivien Mallock stands the park's Cenotaph entrance.
Councillor Tracy Harvey, Middlesbrough Council's executive member for environment, said: "Cloughie wasn't quite fit for Boro's return to the top flight, but I'd like to think his restoration will serve as a good omen for the rest of the season.
"The statue is a hugely popular tribute to one of the true legends to pull on a Boro shirt, so I'm delighted visitors to Albert Park can once again enjoy it in all its glory."
