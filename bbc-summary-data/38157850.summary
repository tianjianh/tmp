It comes after several players or ex-players made allegations against football coaches in other areas.
The North Yorkshire force has been contacted by Operation Hydrant, the national body which co-ordinates the response to past child abuse, in relation to allegations in the county.
It is urging anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse to get in touch.
An NSPCC hotline was set up after a number of footballers spoke out about sexual abuse they suffered as children at the hands of coaches.
Former football coach Barry Bennell has been charged with eight offences of sexual assault against a boy aged under 14, prosecutors have said.
The Crown Prosecution Service said it had received a file of evidence from Cheshire Police relating to allegations of historical abuse.
Mr Bennell, 62, is a former youth coach at Crewe Alexandra.
The offences are alleged to have been committed between 1981 and 1985.
Police Scotland, North Wales, Greater Manchester, Hampshire, Cheshire, Northumbria and Metropolitan forces have all said they have received reports of allegations of abuse.
