[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motorists are saving up to five minutes a day on some journeys on the M62 after the introduction of a "smart motorway" scheme, Highways England has said.

The Â£136m scheme covers 15 miles (25km) near Bradford and Leeds.
Technology has been installed to monitor traffic, provide information and ease congestion with variable speed limits and utilising the hard shoulder.
Up to 160,000 vehicles use the section of road, between junctions 25 and 30, on the busiest days.

The greatest time savings are being made by drivers travelling westbound during the afternoon peak, between Rothwell and Brighouse, according to Highways England statistics.
However, the AA has told Parliament it has concerns about the smart motorways, and believes "all lane running" is not sustainable in the long term.
Its concerns include the safety of drivers who have broken down, and access for emergency services who need to reach major incidents.
