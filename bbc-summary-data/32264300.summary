The fire, which covered 13 sq km (5 sq miles) have been burning since about 12:30 on Thursday.
A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze was finally extinguished at 03:45.
At the height of the incident eight appliances and four other units were involved in tackling the flames.
Other incidents were reported near Golspie, Lochinver, Cluanie, Balintore and Loch Broom and on Skye and Benbecula.
The heath and grass fires have come during a spell of dry and windy weather and a warning of an increased risk of wildfires in Scotland.
