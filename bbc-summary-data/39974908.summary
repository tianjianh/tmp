[SN]TITLE[SN]
Girl, 15, accused of school blade charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 15-year-old girl is to stand trial accused of taking a blade into a Dundee school and attacking a girl before holding the weapon to her face.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly took a bladed multi-tool into the school on 10 March.
She is alleged to have assaulted a 12-year-old girl, struck her on the face with her hand before seizing and pulling her by the hair.
The girl denied the charges through her solicitor Anika Jethwa.
Prosecutors allege the teenager pinned the girl against the wall and placed the blade against her face.
Depute fiscal Jennifer Johnston asked that early trial dates be set because of the age of the accused.
Sheriff Tom Hughes set a trial date in August and ordered the girl to appear in court for a pre-trial hearing in July.
