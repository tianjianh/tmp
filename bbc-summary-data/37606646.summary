Labour MPs return to Jeremy Corbyn's front bench team

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two more Welsh Labour MPs have rejoined Jeremy Corbyn's front bench team having resigned from it in June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Torfaen MP Nick Thomas-Symonds has been named shadow solicitor-general while Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan is appointed shadow arts minister.
Both said it was time to hold the UK government to account.
Last week, Nia Griffith returned to the front bench as shadow defence secretary while Jo Stevens was named shadow Welsh secretary.
Mr Corbyn had been forced to replace most of his front bench team following mass resignations and a vote of no confidence in his leadership by MPs.
But some of Mr Corbyn's critics have returned to the shadow cabinet since he was re-elected leader in September, defeating a challenge from Pontypridd MP Owen Smith.
Llanelli MP Ms Griffith had been shadow Welsh secretary, while Mr Thomas-Symonds and Mr Brennan were junior spokesmen on employment and business respectively.
Mr Thomas-Symonds said on Twitter he would be "exposing the Tories' failure on access to justice", condemning the party for an "appalling" record on legal aid cuts and tribunal fees.
Mr Brennan, also on Twitter, said he was "Pleased to join Labour DCMS team as shadow minister for arts and Heritage and deputy to shadow secretary of state - time to hold (government) to account".
Mr Smith, who quit as shadow work and pensions secretary before mounting his leadership challenge, has called for party unity but has said he would not return to the front bench.
Newport West MP Paul Flynn has returned to the backbenches having served as both shadow leader of the Commons and shadow Welsh secretary over the summer.
Writing on his blog, he said it had been a "worthwhile and thoroughly enjoyable" experience.
Meanwhile Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris has kept her post as a junior Home Office spokesperson.
