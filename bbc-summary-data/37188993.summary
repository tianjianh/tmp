Lawro's Premier League predictions v Final Score actor Dave Bautista

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of different guests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this week's Premier League fixtures is former WWE star and Hollywood actor Dave Bautista.
Along with Pierce Brosnan, Bautista is the star of Final Score, an action movie being filmed at Upton Park, but the American admits he does not know much about West Ham, who left the stadium after 112 years at the end of last season.
He told BBC Sport: "The first day we started filming, we did a scene where we were walking through the crowd and they were singing about bubbles.
"I could not understand how that related to football so I had to ask, and I think it has made it into one of the edits."
You can make your own predictions now, compare them to Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
In the last round of fixtures before the international break, Lawro got eight correct results, including two perfect scores, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 140 points.
He beat four-time Olympic cycling champion Laura Trott, who got five correct results, with no perfect scores, for a total of 50 points.
All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.
Sergio Aguero's suspension is a big loss to Manchester City, whose only specialist back-up striker is Kelechi Iheanacho. He is very promising, but still very young.
It is strange that one of the world's wealthiest clubs allowed Wilfried Bony to join Stoke on loan on deadline day without replacing him, which reduced their options further.
At the start of the season I wondered what would happen if Aguero does not play, and we are about to find out.

Looking at the game, the biggest difference between the two teams is that Manchester United can change things around with their strikers if they have to.
Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial both have pace to burn through the middle if it is not working for Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Because of that, I am going to go for United win. I don't think City will be able to hold out for 90 minutes.
Lawro's prediction: 1-0
Dave's prediction: I have personal reasons for going with United here - I have a lot of friends who support them, and also because Noel Gallagher gave me major harassment when I did Soccer AM with him - and he is a huge City fan. So I am picking against his team, and I think they are going to get crushed. 5-0
Signing Deportivo La Coruna forward Lucas Perez and Valencia defender Shkodran Mustafi has added more depth to the Gunners squad and I think they have got the competition for places they needed.
Arsenal brushed aside Watford in their last game, with Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez both impressing, and I can see a similar outcome here.
It is early days but Southampton have stumbled a bit so far - with their only points coming in two draws at home - and the signs are they are in for a tougher season this time around.
Lawro's prediction: 3-0
Dave's prediction: 2-1
I think Bournemouth signing Jack Wilshere on loan will suit both club and player.
The only problem I can foresee is that, from his time at Arsenal, Wilshere has only ever played for a team that dominate possession and it will not be the same for him at the Cherries.

They will have to fashion a role for him that will mean he is generally on or around the ball. Wilshere is very talented, but this is a crossroads season for him.
I am tempted to go with him starting by helping Bournemouth end their eight-game winless run in the league - but I don't see West Brom being beaten.
Baggies boss Tony Pulis did not get some of the players he wanted in the transfer window, but I think most managers were the same and his squad still looks pretty solid.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Dave's prediction: This is a hard one for me because I am not familiar with either of these teams. I have actually never heard of them. 1-1
Hull made some interesting signings before the transfer window closed but it is going to take them some time to bed in. There is still uncertainty over the future of caretaker manager Mike Phelan too.

Both of these teams are going to end up at the wrong end of the table and, for that reason, this is a game they both really need to win.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Dave's prediction: 2-3
Middlesbrough are unbeaten so far, but this is a game they will expect to win and I think they will find it difficult.
Crystal Palace have only picked up one point so far but they have made some good signings and, when I look at them, I think they will get better.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Dave's prediction: 0-1
Like Palace, Stoke are another team who have made a slow start but I am sure will improve.
Getting Bony on loan from Manchester City was a great signing for the Potters because a goalscorer was the thing they lacked last season.
Bony likes playing on his own, which suits Stoke, and he will be playing regularly, which makes a big difference. He will be a good acquisition.
Tottenham won 4-0 at Stoke in April, but I do not see things being anywhere near as easy this time.
I am still waiting for Spurs to really hit their stride this season but they remain hard to beat - so a draw is the most likely outcome.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Dave's prediction: That's a Spurs win for sure. Go Spurs! 1-3
West Ham have been hit by a few early injuries but Dimitri Payet should be back this weekend and he has been badly missed.

Watford only have one point so far, although it should be factored in that they have played Chelsea and Arsenal in two of their three games.
I don't see them getting anything at the London Stadium either, though, and it looks like being a tough season for the Hornets.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Dave's prediction: I am going to this one - it is my first football game and I can't wait. Watford, you are getting spanked. 4-1
Leicester rolled Swansea over easily enough but never really looked like scoring against Arsenal, so it will be interesting to see how they get on against Liverpool's defence.
What will help the Reds is that they have pretty much all of their squad available.
This is Liverpool's first home game of the season, now that the new Main Stand at Anfield is finished, and I think they will mark it with a win.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Dave's prediction: I've been to Liverpool and they are a bunch of tough blokes from that city. I'm going with them to win this one. 2-1
Swansea have lost both games since their opening-day win at Burnley and they barely had a sniff against Leicester. Things will not be any easier for them against Chelsea.
The Blues have won three out of three so far and I don't see that sequence stopping against the Swans.

I also think bringing David Luiz back to the club will turn out to be a good signing for Chelsea.
It seemed a bit bizarre at the time, but they have made money on the deal and he can play alongside Gary Cahill or John Terry in the centre of defence, as well at left-back.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Dave's prediction: 0-3
Everton have started very brightly and I think everyone likes the look of them under Ronald Koeman so far.
The only position in their team I have any doubts about is at goalkeeper, because Maarten Stekelenburg struggled at Fulham and I am not convinced by Joel Robles.
Koeman knows Stekelenburg after taking him on loan at Southampton last season, so he must have faith in him, but I am left wondering why he did not go in for Manchester City's Joe Hart.
Sunderland made a few signings before the window closed, and they should be solid enough - but I am still not sure about where their creativity will come from in midfield.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Dave's prediction: 3-1
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 140 points (week three v Laura Trott)
Lawro's worst score: 70 points (week one v Blossoms)
