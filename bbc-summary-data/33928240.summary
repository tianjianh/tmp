Tourism bosses hope that worldwide interest in Sir Walter Scott will draw visitors to the Borders Railway after it opens in just over three weeks.

VisitScotland said the route would give visitors the chance to follow in the footsteps of the renowned writer.
The line begins in Edinburgh - site of The Scott Monument - and ends near his former home Abbotsford House.
Scott's birthday, this Saturday, marks the start of the three-week countdown until the opening of the route.
Two Dandie Dinmont Terriers, the dog breed named and owned by the Ivanhoe author, travelled to Edinburgh's Waverley station this week to mark the forthcoming occasion.
Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, said: "Sir Walter Scott's birth date is an appropriate landmark to celebrate three weeks to go until the Borders Railway opens up Scott country to the world.
"The Dandie Dinmont is such an iconic, rare breed, originating from the Scottish Borders, I would not be surprised if there was another rush to own one in the future.
"We are excited that we are moving ever closer to the launch of this magnificent new line and we are working with partners to ensure the tourism potential of our Borders Railway is fully realised both nationally and internationally, encouraging visitors to explore yet more of Scotland's beautiful urban and rural landscapes."
The railway will begin service on Saturday 5 September when local community members will get the chance to ride on the new line a day before the first paying customers come on board.
