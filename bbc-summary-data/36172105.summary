Wayne Shiel, from Doncaster, 35, was jailed for 27 months at Bradford Crown Court after admitting conspiracy to steal at an earlier hearing.
He was part of a gang which took posing and grinning selfies after the thefts.
Benjamin Robinson, 30, and Daniel Hutchinson, 24, were sentenced earlier this month.
North Yorkshire Police said the men wore balaclavas to disguise themselves during the fruit machine raids, which they carried out across the UK.
They were caught after police stopped their car near Skipton in 2014 for speeding.
During a search of their Vauxhall Insignia, police discovered more than a thousand £1 coins and £2,000 in notes.
