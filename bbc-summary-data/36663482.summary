Byrne, 20, has represented the Republic of Ireland at Under-21 level and was called up to train with the senior squad in the lead-up to Euro 2016, only to miss out on a spot in France.
He spent last season on loan with SC Cambuur in the Dutch Eredivisie, scoring four goals in 27 games.
"He is a wonderful young player who can only get better," boss Owen Coyle said.
Talking to BBC Radio Lancashire, Coyle added: "At 19 he went to a foreign country and showed he was a top player in that league and now he's ready to step into the Championship and show his quality."
The signing is new boss Coyle's fifth addition of the summer.
