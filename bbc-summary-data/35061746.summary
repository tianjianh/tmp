[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said the UK government is "absolutely committed" to electrifying the main rail line between London and Swansea.

He said he had an "unmissable view" of the effects of the upgrade so far from the driver's cab of the 0815 from Paddington to Cardiff on Thursday.
Mr Crabb said the route was a "vital link" between Wales and the capital.
Electrification to Cardiff is due to be completed by 2019, with hopes of reaching Swansea by 2020 or 2021.
In June, Transport Secretary Patrick McLouglin said the Great Western line remained "a top priority" in Network Rail's upgrading programme, despite concerns about delays and rising costs.
