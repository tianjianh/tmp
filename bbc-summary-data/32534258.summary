[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A narrow section of the Bristol and Bath cycle route has reopened as part of Â£80,000 improvements.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The section between Teewell Hill and west of Staple Hill tunnel was closed for bridge-widening work and for new foundations to be put in place.
New pedestrian footways and improved cycle facilities were also installed.
Mark King from South Gloucestershire Council apologised for any inconvenience to local people but stressed the work was "essential".
"Additional work to complete the bridge widening improvements will continue over the next three months which will require short-term closures from time to time," he added.
"Any such closures will be clearly signposted in advance and we will keep residents notified via our website and social media."
During the path closure, South Gloucestershire Council also carried out "essential maintenance work" to the Staple Hill tunnel, which included re-pointing the arch and airshafts.
