Plymouth Argyle 2-3 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In-form striker Gavin Massey scored an 88th-minute leveller and set up Sandro Semedo's stoppage-time winner as Leyton Orient won 3-2 at second-placed Plymouth Argyle in League Two.

Antoni Sarcevic fired Argyle into a 10th-minute lead from close range after target man Ryan Taylor nodded down left-back Gary Sawyer's deep far-post cross.
Sarcevic later hobbled off with an ankle injury - on 37 minutes - and within six minutes Orient levelled.
Left-winger Massey took his tally to three goals in three games with a superb solo effort, cutting in before letting fly with a low 18-yard shot into the far corner.
On-loan Cardiff City winger Matty Kennedy restored Argyle's lead on 53 minutes, smashing home from outside the box for his second goal in two home games.
On the hour Kennedy curled another 18 yarder off the outside of the post with O's teenage keeper Sam Sargeant beaten.
Orient, who were without a win this year before Tuesday, equalised when Massey thumped home from Sandro's cross and completed the comeback when Semedo tapped home the winner in the last of four minutes of stoppage-time.
