[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sevilla full-back Aleix Vidal scored twice as the defending Europa League champions took control of their semi-final tie with Fiorentina.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Serie A visitors had the better chances in the first half but Vidal gave Sevilla a half-time lead when he steered home from the edge of the box after being picked out by Carlos Bacca.
After the break, Vitolo played Vidal in to send Neto the wrong way.
Kevin Gameiro added a third 28 seconds after coming off the bench.
This season's tournament takes on extra significance with the winners qualifying for next season's Champions League group stages. Neither Sevilla nor Fiorentina are on course to qualify through the league.
However, Sevilla already take the tournament seriously, as they look to successfully defend the trophy for the second time in a decade, having won it in 2006 and 2007. No team have ever won the Uefa Cup or Europa League four times.
But the visitors started brighter with Mario Gomez firing over twice in the opening 15 minutes.
They were punished for their wastefulness when Vitolo found Bacca, who in turn played the ball to Vidal to fire in from 18 yards out.
Fiorentina should have been level moments later as Matias Fernandez somehow missed from six yards after being picked out by Joaquin. The Chilean was then denied by keeper Sergio Rico, who also kept out an effort from Chelsea loanee Mohamed Salah.
There was a hugely controversial moment on half-time when Sevilla midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak appeared to be fouled by Stefan Savic in the box - just as referee Felix Brych blew the whistle to end the half.
Fiorentina - who brought on English defender Micah Richards at half-time - were not able to take advantage of that good fortune and Vidal burst into the box to score his second.
The champions then put themselves in a great position to reach the Warsaw final when Gameiro converted Vidal's ball with his first touch after coming on as a substitute.
The second leg is in Florence next Thursday. The winners face Napoli or Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, who drew 1-1 in Italy, in the final.
