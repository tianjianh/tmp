The 61,000-seat stadium will be the largest-capacity football club ground in the capital when it opens in 2018.
It will include what is believed to be the longest general admission bar in a UK stadium as well as heated seats, a micro-brewery and an in-house bakery.
Chairman Daniel Levy said the ground would "redefine sports and entertainment experiences".
The stadium will have a retractable grass field and an artificial surface underneath it allowing the ground to host football games, NFL matches, concerts and other events.
Other features in the stadium include:
The new stadium is expected to cost Â£750m but will create about 3,500 jobs in the area when it is finished, according to the club.
Mauricio Pochettino's side will temporarily relocate for the 2017/18 season as the stadium is being built.
The Football Association (FA) has given Tottenham the option to hire Wembley but Conservative MP Bob Blackman warned in the Commons this could lead to the "potential abuse" of the "national treasure".
Wembley has also been suggested as a temporary home for Chelsea when a new 60,000-seat stadium is built at Stamford Bridge.
