Bradley intercepted a loose pass near the halfway line and chipped Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa from 40 yards to give the visitors the lead.
Former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela equalised with a low, 20-yard shot.
Mexico are top of the qualifying group on 14 points with four matches left. The US are third on eight points.
The top three qualify automatically for next year's World Cup in Russia, while the fourth-placed team face an Asian confederation team in a play-off.
"Any time you can get a point here that's great," said Bradley.
"The mentality and the commitment from every guy was really, really good and now we keep moving ourselves forward."
