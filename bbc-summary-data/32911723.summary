[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new science, technology, engineering and maths centre has been proposed for its current site at the Markeaton Street campus.
The university said the facility, which will include workshop space and a wind tunnel, would help meet growing demand for its engineering courses.
The four-storey building will accommodate up to 400 students, according to the university.
Its law school is also moving from the current Kedleston Road campus to Friar Gate Square at the end of the year.
The university will lease the £20m copper-clad city centre building, which will include two mock courtrooms and a specialist library.
