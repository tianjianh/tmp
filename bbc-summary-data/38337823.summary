The woman called for help to remove the tiger snake from her suburban home in Melbourne, Victoria, on Sunday.
Snake catcher Barry Goldsmith said the reptile entered through an open door before curling up among the decorations.
Tiger snakes, found along Australia's coast, are highly venomous.
Mr Goldsmith said the woman "reacted quite well" after making the discovery.
"She left the room, put a towel down as a door jam and came and rang me," he told the BBC.
The snake was released back into the wild. The species is protected in most Australian states.
Mr Goldsmith said he was used to finding snakes in unusual places.
"I've found them in ugg boots, washing machines, dog kennels, cat boxes, toilets, kitchen cupboards and bookcases," he said.
