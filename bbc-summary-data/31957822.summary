There's a lot going on for Robin Thicke at the moment.

Not only has his divorce from Paula Patton been granted, but the family of Marvin Gaye also wants to put a stop to Blurred Lines.
Gaye's children filed a court injunction on Tuesday to prevent the song being copied, distributed or performed.
On the same day he was told his divorce would go ahead, with the final stage of the legal split happening on 14 April.
"With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist," the family said in a statement released on Wednesday.
"It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued."
Last week Thicke and Pharrell, who features on Blurred Lines, were told they had to pay $7.3m (??4.8m) to three of Gaye's children after a jury decided they had copied elements of his hit track Got To Give It Up.
The family is also looking to get the verdict to include TI, who also appears on Blurred Lines and whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr.
They want it amended so that it also names labels Universal Music, Interscope and Star Trak Entertainment.
Their injunction against Blurred Lines could give the family a chance to negotiate for royalties and songwriting credits.
The song was the biggest hit of 2013, selling more than seven million copies in the US.
Last year Thicke revealed he and his wife, who have a four-year-old son together, were separating after nine years of marriage.
She had previously featured in a number of his videos and his latest album was named after her.
