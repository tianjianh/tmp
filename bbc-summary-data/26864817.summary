Che Cruz was arrested on Sunday and accused of breaking into the star's guesthouse in Calabasas, California, while she was at home.
The 20-year-old admitted trespassing at a court appearance on Wednesday and was immediately sentenced.
He was also given three years probation and ordered to stay away from Gomez.
Los Angeles police said Cruz was arrested after Gomez heard a noise at her home on Sunday night and called security.
Cruz then knocked on the door of her $3 million (Â£1.8m) property. A friend answered but slammed it shut when he asked for Gomez.
Security guards later found him in the guesthouse and held him until police arrived.
Gomez rose to fame in the TV series Wizards of Waverly Place but is now better known for her pop career.
She scored a Top 10 hit in the UK last year with Come and Get It and was named favourite female singer at Saturday's Kids' Choice Awards.
The 21-year-old is also known for her on-off relationship with fellow pop singer Justin Bieber.
