Cheque processing centres 'set to close'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cheque-processing company iPSL is set to close seven centres, according to the Unite union.

Officials said they had been warned of the plan to end operations at Scottish sites in Edinburgh and Clydebank.
Other centres under threat are reported to be Bootle, Bradford, Copley, Chelmsford and Camberley.
The company has confirmed it is looking at the "potential consolidation" of sites, but did not identify which were at risk.
It said the changes were result of a plan to introduce a "quicker and easier way of clearing cheques in the UK", which will start in October 2017.
Unite said it believed work would be consolidated at Northampton and Milton Keynes.
The closures would take place in 2018. A total of 600 jobs are thought to be at risk.
Unite official Dominic Hook said the announcement was "tragic news" for the workforce.
He said: "This consolidation strategy is deeply disappointing and the impact will be felt widely.
"This proposal will leave a workforce of just over 700 at iPSL which handles around 80% of cheques issued in the UK each year."
Cheques have become a less important part of the banking system as electronic transactions increase in popularity.
Although figures for 2015 showed 500 million cheques were written in the UK, this represented a year-on-year decline of 13%.
Mr Hook added: "The tide of digitalisation across the financial services brings with it huge challenges as organisations have to adapt the way they work.
"The changing face of cheque processing, with new digital imaging, has brought considerable difficulties for this industry. Unite wants to see iPSL make the necessary investment through new technology to secure as many jobs as is possible.
"This news will be a bitter blow for iPSL colleagues and Unite has pressed the company to provide the workforce with support and guidance with two training programmes and outplacement support to be offered to staff."
In a statement, iPSL said: "Following Government legislation in April 2015, the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company (C&CCC) is managing a programme to introduce a quicker and easier way of clearing cheques in the UK.
"The Image Clearing System (ICS), will enable images of cheques to be exchanged between banks and building societies, instead of moving paper around the country.
"This will enable money from cheques being available for withdrawal much sooner than is currently the case."
The company said its recognised unions - Unite and CWU - were "fully engaged and aware of these proposals".
It added: "The introduction of ICS will have a huge impact on the current cheque clearing process and for the last 12 months iPSL has been sharing developments and potential implications with our employees and bank customers.
"Its introduction will remove the requirement for remote data capture and processing, therefore reducing site requirements and a subsequent reduction in staffing numbers."
