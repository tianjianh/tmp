Middlesbrough missed the chance to go top of the Championship as they were held to a goalless draw by Leeds United at Elland Road.

Before kick-off Leeds fans projected images on to one of the stands urging chairman Massimo Cellino to quit.
And there was little to cheer during the game as Leeds' best chance saw Souleymane Doukara's header saved.
Boro's Jordan Rhodes missed when clean through, before team-mate Ben Gibson saw red for two yellow cards late on.
Rhodes, a £9m signing from Blackburn, was handed his first start by Aitor Karanka, but shot straight at Marco Silvestri first time when he perhaps should have taken an extra touch midway through the second half.
The Scotland striker, who had scored five goals in his past four appearances against the Whites, had a first-half header ruled out after the ball was deemed to go out of play before Ritchie De Laet put in the cross and also nodded wide late on.
All of the focus before the match was once again off the pitch as home supporters urged Cellino to sell his 75% share in the club.
Several images lit up the East Stand including 'Time to go Massimo' and 'Billy [Bremner] wouldn't accept this… so why should we? Sell the club' and remained on show during the match.
Cellino agreed in principle to sell his majority share to supporters' group Leeds Fans United at the end of last October, but changed his mind a week later. Numerous protests against the Italian businessman have taken place since.
Middlesbrough are now without a win in five games and remain one point behind leaders Hull in second, while Leeds stay 16th.
Leeds manager Steve Evans said: "It's not my job to get involved with supporters.
"I think supporters are quite rightfully the lifeblood of every club. I am a Glasgow Celtic supporter and Glasgow Celtic supporters are the lifeblood of that club.
"Leeds United supporters are long here before any owner arrives or head coach, manager, player, and they will be here for a long time after.
"But our supporters want to see performances on the pitch. That's what disappoints them more than anything."
