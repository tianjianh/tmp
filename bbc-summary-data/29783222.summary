Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner allowed just four hits, becoming the first pitcher in the World Series to shutout the opposition since the Florida Marlins' Josh Beckett in 2003.
Since trailing 4-1 in Game Four, San Francisco have now hit 15 runs without reply.
The sides will contest Game Six on Tuesday at the Kauffman Stadium.
The Giants have now won back-to-back matches, and victory in Game Six would see the West Coast outfit lift their third World Series championship in five years.
San Francisco's Hunter Pence was at the heart of the action once more for Giants, with the right fielder now 9 for 19 in five games.
Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford heaped praise on pitcher Bumgarner: "You look at (Bumgarner) and he looks like he's pitching in the middle of June," Crawford said. "He takes the pressure off everyone."
