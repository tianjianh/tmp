The 27-year-old former Peterborough player joined the Cherries for Â£3m from Middlesbrough last summer.
But he has been limited to just three starts in the Premier League this term, and scored his only goal in Bournemouth's 2-1 FA Cup win at Birmingham earlier this month.
He will go straight into the squad to face Birmingham City on Saturday.
"We've been monitoring his situation at Bournemouth and it's great that we've been able to bring him on board," said Bristol City's interim manager John Pemberton.
