[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andre Murphy, 56, a horse transporter of Wexford, Ireland, was changing a horsebox tyre on a slip road near the Tredegar Park roundabout at the time of the crash in December.
Gwent Police said a Merthyr Tydfil man, 45, has now been charged over his death.
He will appear at Newport Magistrates' Court later this month.
Mr Murphy, known as Nick, had been on his way back to Ireland after picking up a horse in Wales at the time of the fatal crash.
After his death, tributes were paid to the father-of-two, a keen huntsman, former show jumper and showing enthusiast, described as "very family-orientated" by relatives.
Mr Murphy's partner, Julie Redden, said: "He touched so many people and he was so well-known and so well-loved across Ireland and England."
