Lawro's opponents for this weekend Premier League fixtures and FA Cup semi-finals is world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua.
Joshua, who beat Charles Martin to take the IBF title earlier this month, supports his hometown team Watford, and recently trained with Hornets striker Troy Deeney.
"I've known Troy for a while, we linked up in a barber shop," Joshua told BBC Sport. "From there, I saw he was training with a coach in Birmingham.
"I liked the way his training was different to what I was used to so I linked up with him too. We were training together, footballer and boxer, and we had a great coach.
"Did Troy keep up with me? Definitely. He is a beast, he knows how to handle himself in the gym."
The 26-year-old will not be at Wembley for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final, but has a message for Deeney and his Hornets' team-mates.
"I will be supporting you from a distance," Joshua said. "Good luck to everyone at Watford, you have come this far and the hard work is done. Enjoy it and get the job done."
Joshua, who admits he chooses Real Madrid ahead of Watford when he plays on Fifa, met former Real and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho after the Martin fight.
"Yes, he is a special one," he added. "Cool, calm and collected - the triple c's."
You can hear more of Joshua's tales of following Watford on Football Focus at 12:10 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Lawro got four correct results and no perfect scores from last weekend's matches, to give him a total of 40 points.
He was beaten by actors Idris Elba and Richard Madden, who got six results correct, with no perfect scores, for a total of 60 points.
Ahead of Arsenal's game with West Brom, Lawro picked up an extra 60 points from his midweek predictions. Nobby Butcher and Carl Frampton also added to their scores.

Match report
Sunderland's win at relegation rivals Norwich last week was an excellent result.
The Black Cats seem to have tightened up defensively because they have now had two clean sheets in their last three games.
I am backing them to pick up another point here, because I am not sure what to expect from Arsenal at the moment.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Joshua's prediction: 0-3
Match preview
I know Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew changed his team around for Wednesday's defeat by Manchester United but, before then, they were coming into a bit of form after a long run without a league win.
I think Palace will fancy their chances against Watford. The Hornets also made lots of changes in their defeat by West Ham, but they were fortunate to beat West Brom at the weekend and I don't think they are in a good place at the moment.
There seems to be a bit of speculation over Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores' future too. That seems harsh after the season they have had.
Lawro's prediction: 1-2
Joshua's prediction: 1-2
Match preview
I was at the King Power Stadium last week for Radio 5 live and the atmosphere felt a bit strange before kick-off.
You could sense West Ham were going to cause Leicester problems and, when the game started, the Foxes looked heavy-legged and leaden-footed.
It is going to be interesting to see how they cope without the suspended Jamie Vardy.

Shinji Okazaki, who spends more time on the floor than any other player I've seen, and Leonardo Ulloa are their only other options up front.
Without Vardy's pace, teams can really squeeze Leicester because nobody is going to run in behind them.
I think that is a real worry, so I am going to go for another draw here - although Swansea did look like they had just booked their summer holidays in Benidorm against Newcastle last weekend.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Joshua's prediction: 2-0
Match preview
It is always much easier to be the chasing club in the title race but, even so, Tottenham are playing extremely well at the moment.
They have always had skilful players but they have now got application and endeavour too, and they never roll over. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has done a wonderful job.

Tottenham are built from the back but they have developed as the season has gone on and, at the moment, they are the best team in the league in every department.
West Brom have taken only one point from their last four games and it is hard to see their form improving on Monday.
However Leicester do on Sunday, Spurs will win this and keep the pressure on.
Lawro's prediction: 3-0
Joshua's prediction: 2-0
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
