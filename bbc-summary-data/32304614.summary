The 47-year-old man was arrested on 23 July 2014 on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.
Miss Lawrence, who was 35 and lived in York, has not been seen since she disappeared in 2009.
The decision to release the man from his bail conditions was made following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, police said.
Miss Lawrence, who worked as a chef at the University of York, disappeared after leaving her house in Heworth Road on 19 March 2009.
North Yorkshire Police believe she was murdered but her body has not been found.
A review of the case began in 2013 and led to three arrests but no charges have been brought in connection with the case.
Det Supt Dai Malyn, senior investigating officer in the case, said: "Our investigation into the disappearance and suspected murder of Claudia Lawrence continues to focus on key lines of enquiry that the on-going review is identifying.
"I am convinced the breakthrough in the investigation will be from this relentless pursuit for the truth."
A local man, in his 50s, arrested on suspicion of murder on 23 March this year remains on bail.
