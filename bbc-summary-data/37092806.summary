Lawro's Premier League predictions v Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of different guests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponents for this week's Premier League fixtures are comedians Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson, who are behind the Athletico Mince podcast.
Mortimer is a Middlesbrough fan, while Dawson supports Sunderland and they decided on their joint prediction for Sunday's Wear-Tees derby by each of them independently choosing how many goals their team would score.
You can make your own predictions now, compare them to Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
On the opening weekend of the season, Lawro got four correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 70 points.
He beat Stockport indie band Blossoms, who got three correct results, with no perfect scores, for a total of 30 points.
All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.
