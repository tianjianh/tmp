[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mitch Claydon (4-35) dismissed Gloucestershire's top-scorer Chris Dent (67) before three quick wickets left the away side on 115-8.
David Payne (20) and Chris Liddle added valuable runs, but Kent extended their first-innings lead of 149 through Joe Weatherley's 34 and Joe Denly's 59.
Kent finished day two with a commanding lead of 267 runs and six wickets left.
Gloucestershire began the day on 9-1, but their batting effort was undermined by the loss of regular wickets, with James Harris (3-42) continuing his impressive debut and Darren Stevens taking 2-42.
After the early loss of Daniel Bell-Drummond to Liam Norwell (2-38), Kent progressed steadily and although they lost Weatherley, Denly and captain Sam Northeast, they hold the upper hand with six second-innings wickets remaining.
