Jeremy Corbyn to campaign in 'all parts of the UK'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will campaign in "all parts of the UK" in 2016, and the party was "united" despite criticism from MPs this week.

He said he would be "going for a cup of tea" with Caerphilly MP Wayne David, who said on Tuesday Mr Corbyn had "a heck of a lot to learn" on leadership.
Mr Corbyn also told BBC Wales said there was "no problem" with greater autonomy for the Welsh Labour party.
He is in Swansea, on his first visit to Wales as Labour leader.
"I will be campaigning in all parts of the UK - of course I will be campaigning in Wales," Mr Corbyn said.
"This is a big electoral possibility next year for Labour, to show that we're gaining support and that the increased membership of the party, now nearly 400,000, means something on the ground."
On greater autonomy for the Welsh party - something First Minister Carwyn Jones has called for - he said: "I'm very supportive of what Carwyn has put forward; there is no problem on this.
"I look forward to that autonomy that will come forward, but obviously it has to be agreed through the Labour Party structure.
"I'm the leader of the party, I'm not the controller of the party."
He backed the Welsh government's record on health - subject of persistent criticism from opposition parties - saying the Welsh NHS had a 91% approval rating, with the policy of offering free prescriptions proving popular.
Mr Corbyn was given a tour of Swansea University's new bay campus, alongside Mr Jones.
The first minister said it was important for all party members to be careful not to jeopardise Labour's chances in 2016, suggesting Labour MPs who criticise leader Jeremy Corbyn were "not helpful".
"Any party needs to show it's united going in to that election, and we need to make sure that's the case in May," he said
"It's not helpful, particularly, for the party, that's what we need to remember, and for the people who vote for us."
Mr Corbyn also called for a political settlement in Syria and described events in the country as "beyond appalling".
He said there was a "long way" to go before the implications of any UN resolutions on Syria could be considered.
The Labour leader also said it was not too late for the UK government to prevent the strike by junior doctors in England, suggesting ministers could learn from the approach taken by the Welsh government.
Mr Corbyn will join a rally of Labour party members in Swansea later.
It is unclear how often Jeremy Corbyn will be campaigning in Wales in the run up to the assembly election.
He has said himself he will be here "plenty of times".
The reality is he has a strong vested interest with the result in Wales, together with Labour's performance in the Scottish parliament and London mayoral elections, being a major test of his leadership.
The expectation is that his involvement will prove popular in Labour heartland areas, but some senior figures in the party are concerned about his impact in more marginal seats.
