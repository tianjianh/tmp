A Royal Mail spokesperson said: "Royal Mail has lodged an injunction application at the High Court to prevent the CWU taking strike action.
"The court hearing will take place on the afternoon of 16 June.
"Any action or threat of industrial action is damaging to our business and our customers and that is why we are taking this action."
