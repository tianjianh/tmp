Gareth Anscombe: Cardiff Blues utility back looks to Wales chance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues' Gareth Anscombe is hoping for a Six Nations call-up after returning from injury just two days before Wales' squad announcement.

Utility back Anscombe, 24, played the final 25 minutes of the Blues' 34-26 Challenge Cup loss at Harlequins.
"I got a taste of it in terms of being part of the squad for the last Six Nations," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"It would be nice to get on the field after the World Cup success and failure at the same time."
Anscombe had ankle surgery after Wales' World Cup quarter-final exit to South Africa.
The New Zealand-born player also started at full-back in the group-stage loss to Australia after making his debut as a replacement fly-half in a pre-tournament friendly against Ireland.
He could be in line for another appearance at full-back against Ireland in Dublin in February if Liam Williams is not fit, despite being seen more as a fly-half by his region.
"There's a lot of competition for places in that [Wales] team, that's really helped with the performance of that team over the last couple of years" said Anscombe.
"Liam's a quality player and he's coming back from that foot injury, and Hallam [Amos] certainly showed what he can do [in his try-scoring return for the Dragons]. They've got their options."
Blues head coach Danny Wilson has no doubt that Anscombe is ready for a Six Nations role.
"It was just great to get him back on there," Wilson said. "I thought he looked good picking different options in our attacking game that he hasn't had much time to fit into.
"Like all these boys, it'll take a bit of time to get the lungs and legs going at that kind of intensity but we all know what kind of quality player he is."
Wilson is hoping that Wales captain Sam Warburton can make his return from an ankle injury against Calvisano on Friday.
"I'm hoping that Sam will come through this very short week's training and if he does, and passes the relevant tests, he'll be available for selection on Friday."
Cardiff Blues will have to win well against the Italians and hope that other results go their way to have any chance of a quarter-final place in Europe's second-tier competition.
