"Strong words of advice" were given to a mother who left her three children in a car on one of the hottest days of the year, police have said.

Shoppers called Hertfordshire Police at 12:40 GMT on Monday, after spotting the children, aged seven, three and one, in the car at a retail park in Watford.
Temperatures in the town reached 30C (86F) on Monday.
Officers were called to Waterfields Retail Park where they found and spoke to the mother.
A spokesman for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said: "When left alone in a vehicle, young children can very quickly start to get anxious and distressed.
"There are clear added dangers when temperatures are extremely hot, as has been the case this week."
He added the charity advised parents and carers to never leave babies or very young children alone, whether in a vehicle or at home.
