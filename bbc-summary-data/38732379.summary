[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A PE teacher who repeatedly had sex with a 15-year-old pupil has been banned from teaching indefinitely.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A professional conduct panel ruled Alexandra Sharman, 31, who worked at Marriotts School in Stevenage, was guilty of unacceptable professional conduct.
The relationship came to light after the boy confided in his doctor.
A school spokesman said it takes safeguarding issues "extremely seriously".
Hertfordshire Constabulary did not pursue a criminal case against Ms Sharman.
The National College for Teaching and Leadership professional conduct panel, which met this month, found Ms Sharman had sex with the pupil "on more than one occasion".
The hearing was told Ms Sharman, who joined the secondary school in 2007, had been an "outstanding and popular teacher".
However, another teacher at the school and its former head of behaviour said Ms Sharman told them she had "a sexual relationship" with a student.
One witness told the hearing, which Ms Sharman did not attend, she had been present when the PE teacher told her parents, sister and ex-partner about the sex.
In June 2015, the boy told his GP he had been the victim of alleged sexual abuse when asked why he was "depressed". The doctor informed Hertfordshire Police.
In the same month, Ms Sharman told a colleague she had received a threatening letter from the pupil. Her friend told the school's head teacher and Ms Sharman was suspended.
The pupil did not make a formal complaint when interviewed by police and in December 2015 officers told the school there would not be a criminal case.
In January 2016, the school launched its own investigation and, despite Ms Sharman's voluntary resignation, a disciplinary hearing in March 2016 dismissed her for gross misconduct.
Marriotts School was rated "highly effective" for safeguarding by Ofsted at its last inspection in October.
