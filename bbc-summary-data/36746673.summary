Blackpool owner Owen Oyston has agreed to meet the Supporters' Trust (BST) on Saturday to hear their concerns.

The relationship with the board and fans has been fractious at the League Two side with a number of protests over how the club has been run.
Trust chairman Steve Rowland met with Oyston to personally invite him.
"We are quite surprised as we have been trying for some considerable time to engage with the Oystons," said BST deputy chairman Christine Seddon.
She told BBC Radio Lancashire: "It's never too late so at least he's accepted our offer now and he's going to come and speak to the fans directly and hear from the fans what it is that they want."
After their one-season stay in the Premier League in 2010-11, the Seasiders have suffered back-to-back relegations and are in the fourth tier for the first time since 2000-01.
BST launched a Â£16m bid to buy the Tangerines in July 2015 but Oyston, whose son Karl is Blackpool's chairman, eventually ended those takeover talks.
"I believe the fact that so many fans have had enough - season ticket sales are very poor indeed - and many fans have vowed they will not come back until the Oystons have left," added Seddon.
"I hope he's suddenly realised we're not kidding because the football club, the fans and the local community are suffering terribly because of this stand off - it's a terrible state of affairs."
The event will take place at 12:30 BST at Hilton Hotel, North Promenade in Blackpool.
