Previously code-named Project Scorpio - take a look at the new Xbox One X console.
Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, said it was the "most powerful console ever made."
The console was revealed at this year's E3 conference - one of the world's biggest gaming and technology shows.
It runs from 13 to 15 June in Los Angeles, America.
The console will feature six teraflops of processing power.
A single teraflop can make a trillion calculations or 'floating point operations' per second.
To keep the console from overheating, there's a supercharger-style fan and a vapour chamber, where cooling liquid helps the engine stay cool.
The console will be able to play games in super high quality 4K.
How does it compare to the PS4 Pro and the Nintendo Switch?
Xbox One games and accessories will still be compatible with the new console.
It is also the smallest Xbox console yet.
A slimmer, cheaper version of the console named the Xbox One S was also announced.
The head of Xbox games marketing Aaron Greenburg has said it will "change the way we think about the future of console gaming."
However, the PS4 Pro console also has 4K graphics and has been out since November last year.
People have criticised the new Xbox, saying you wouldn't really notice a difference in the quality of the new console, unless you have a high-quality 4K TV and surround sound system to do the new hardware justice.
The console will be released on 7 November and will cost $499 - or Â£449 in the UK.
Other announcements this year include the brand new Super Mario Odessy game and Splatoon 2.
