[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners are making a last-ditch bid to reopen a Denbighshire cinema and arts centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scala in Prestatyn, which opened in 2009 after a Â£3.5m refurbishment, closed last week with the loss of five jobs.
Now, officials from the Scala Trust are holding a drop-in session on 16 January at the town's Beaches Hotel.
They are looking for members of the public to attend and help generate suggestions for fundraising.
