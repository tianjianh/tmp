The former high school principal and father of five children died of kidney failure in a care facility on Sunday.
He had been named the oldest man by Guinness World Records in August.
In April the world's oldest person and oldest woman, Misao Okawa from Japan, died at the age of 117. Her titles are now held by 116-year-old American Susannah Mushatt Jones.
Born in 1903 in Fukushima, Mr Momoi - whose death was announced on Tuesday - first worked as a teacher and later became a principal in high schools in his home prefecture as well as neighbouring Saitama.
He enjoyed reading, especially Chinese poetry, and also travelling around Japan with his late wife, according to Guinness.
When he received his certificate from Guinness in August, he told reporters: "I want to live for about two more years."
Guinness has not announced who is now the world's oldest man, although it may well be 112-year-old Japanese Yasutaro Koide who was born a month after Mr Momoi, according to wire agencies.
Susannah Mushatt Jones celebrated her 116th birthday on Monday with friends and family in New York.
Known as T to her 100 nieces and nephews - the nickname is short for "auntie" - she has said the secret to her longevity is sleep.
The oldest person who has ever lived according to Guinness was Jeanne Calment of France, who lived 122 years and 164 days. She died in August 1997.
