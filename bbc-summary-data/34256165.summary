Egypt attack: Mexico confirms eight nationals died

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Mexican official confirmed on Tuesday that eight Mexican tourists were among the 12 people who died in an attack by the Egyptian army.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 12 were mistakenly killed by Egyptian security forces in an anti-terror operation on Sunday.
Egypt says it mistook the tourists for Islamist militants, whom its forces were pursuing in the Western Desert.
It has apologised, but has insisted the group were in a restricted area. Local sources deny the claim.
Egypt has been battling Islamist militants for years, with attacks escalating since the 2013 ousting of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.
Until recently most of the fighting has taken place in the Sinai Peninsula with occasional attacks taking place in Cairo and other cities.
Two of the dead have been identified as Luis Barajas Fernandez and Maria de Lourdes Fernandez Rubio.
Another one of those dead is believed to be Rafael Bejarano Rangel, whose relatives were told by tour organisers that he was among those killed.
Reyna Torres, who heads the Mexican foreign ministry's department for the protection of nationals abroad, said forensic test were still being carried out on the other bodies.
Ten people, among them six Mexicans were also injured in the attack.
Mexico's Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu is travelling to Cairo with some of the relatives.
The tour group had been travelling in a convoy of four 4x4s near the Bahariya oasis, a popular tourist location. The organisers said they had stopped for a picnic when the group was attacked.
The interior ministry said an Apache helicopter targeted the tourists "by mistake".
Egypt's ambassador to Mexico City, Yasser Shaban, said the tourists' 4x4 vehicles resembled those used by the militants the security forces were chasing.
David Diaz Bejarano, the nephew of Rafael Bejarano Rangel, said his relatives regularly travelled to the area.
"They've been going to Egypt for the past 10 years and every year they go to this place once or twice," he told BBC Mundo.
He said that his uncle's idea of travelling to the Western Desert was to find space to reflect. "It was a spiritual journey," he said.
Mr Bejarano Rangel's mother, Maricela Rangel, is among those wounded.
According to relatives, Ms Rangel was the one who had been organising the trips from Mexico to Egypt for a decade.
They said that she had been using the same group of guides, whom she trusted.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated that the relatives had already arrived in Egypt.
