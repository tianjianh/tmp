The 47-year-old took over at Valley Parade in August 2011 and helped the club to promotion from League Two in 2012-13.
He guided the Bantams to the League Cup final in that same year and last season led them to the FA Cup quarter-finals.
"I'm very proud of my record here so far but I've been very lucky to receive the backing I've had from the chairmen and board," he told the club website.
"You always need good people around you as a manager, and I think we have a very good team both above me at boardroom level and around me at the training ground.
"We are all still striving to keep improving - that is the key. Hopefully we can continue to do that and make this season a successful one.
"It is a fantastic honour to be the manager of this football club. Every time I drive to the ground for a match day, I always get a feeling of immense pride that I am the manager of Bradford City."
Parkinson's assistant Steve Parkin, goalkeeping coach Lee Butler and head of sport science Nick Allamby have also signed new three-year deals.
The Bantams are currently 11th in League One with eight points from their first six matches this season.
