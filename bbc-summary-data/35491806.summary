Controversial Cwmgwili waste plant plans rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a controversial waste processing and energy generation facility in Carmarthenshire have been unanimously rejected by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clean Power Properties hoped to build a plant in Cwmgwili for a pyrolysis unit which uses heat treatment of organic waste to generate gas and electricity.
The company said it would reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.
More than 330 letters of objection were sent to the council, with about 500 people signing a petition against it.
A protest was also held before the planning meeting to discuss the plant, which would have been the first of its kind in Wales.
Llanelli MP Nia Griffith, who joined the protest, previously said residents "don't really want to be the guinea pigs here."
The planning meeting heard Clean Power Properties had submitted applications for 12 sites across the UK, but none had yet been built.
Councillors raised concerns during the meeting about potentially harmful emissions and the possibility that waste and rubbish from all parts of Wales and England could eventually be processed at the site.
Council leader Emlyn Dole said it was the "last thing" Carmarthenshire needed while trying to build a tourism industry.
Clean Power Properties has been asked to comment on the decision.
It previously said the plant would have generated up to 18 megawatts of electricity, which is enough to power more than 20,000 homes.
