[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dan Evans will carry British hopes on day one of the French Open on Sunday, while Petra Kvitova returns to action following a knife attack in December.

British number four Evans takes on Spain's Tommy Robredo on Court Two at about 15:00 BST.
Czech Kvitova, 27, opens play on the main Philippe Chatrier Court at 10:00 against American Julia Boserup.
She has recovered after an intruder caused damage to her playing hand during a break-in five months ago.
Kvitova will be followed onto court by Germany's world number one Angelique Kerber, who has been struggling for form and faces a severe test against Russia's Ekaterina Makarova.
Evans is one of five British players in the singles draws at Roland Garros, with Andy Murray, Johanna Konta, Aljaz Bedene and Kyle Edmund all set to start on Monday or Tuesday.
It will be a first appearance in the main draw for Evans, who has previously only played once each in the juniors and the qualifiers.
"I'm still finding my way around a bit," the 27-year-old from Solihull told BBC Sport.
He will start as an outsider against Robredo, a four-time quarter-finalist in Paris, but now 35 and ranked 271st.

Evans, meanwhile, has risen to 55 in the world and showed some form on the clay with two wins in Barcelona in April.
"I had a good week in Barcelona but obviously haven't had any wins since, but I'll keep trying hard and hopefully get one or two this week," said Evans.
"Robredo's been very good on clay, still is very good, and he's the favourite going into it, but five sets are long matches and we'll see what happens."
Kvitova said on Friday that her left playing hand is "still not 100% ready", but such is her eagerness to get back into action, the two-time Wimbledon champion is trying it out on the Paris clay.
"I'm happy that when I'm playing I don't have pain in my hand," said Kvitova, shortly after she had been drawn against Boserup, the world number 86.
"I didn't test it in a match, of course. Maybe it will be different when the nerves comes and I'm going to be tight and everything. But so far it's OK."
In the absence of American Serena Williams, Russia's Maria Sharapova and Belarusian Victoria Azarenka, the women's tournament appears to be wide open.
Top seed Kerber has won just three matches on clay this year and is widely expected to struggle against Makarova, the world number 40.
"I think it's for sure not an easy first round," said Kerber.
"But, I mean, which round is easy here? You have to be ready from the first round, from the first point here."
