York's Russell Penn had an effort cleared off the line by Lee Martin, before Martin's corner set up John-Joe O'Toole to head the hosts in front.
Marc Richards doubled the lead after the break when he collected Ricky Holmes' pass to fire into the net.
The Minstermen were then reduced to 10 men when Luke Hendrie was shown a straight red card for a foul on Holmes.
The result meant the Minstermen remain bottom of League Two, four points adrift of safety.

"The conditions were unbelievable but we tried to get the ball down and play.
"As always the result was most important and we looked dangerous in real tough conditions.
"We are after points and we just have to keep rolling the wins out if we want to achieve."
York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York:

"I was disappointed with the goals we lost, one from their corner and one from a breakaway from our corner.
"Before both goals we had chances ourselves that were cleared off the line.
"It was never a red card. I've seen it back. I think the referee's decision was influenced by certain things going on."
