Saudi Arabia has executed an Indonesian domestic worker, two days after beheading another Indonesian woman.

In the latest case, Karni Binti Medi Tarsim was convicted of murdering a child in her care, the Indonesian foreign ministry told the BBC.
In both cases Indonesia's government summoned Saudi Arabia's ambassador in Jakarta in protest.
Indonesia is due to execute several foreigners convicted of drug crimes, despite international criticism.
Thursday's execution in western Saudi Arabia came two days after Siti Zainab was beheaded for murder.
In neither case, Indonesia says, was advanced given to its consular staff in Saudi Arabia.
In a statement about Tarsim's case, the Indonesian foreign ministry expressed "regret and  disappointment" that its representatives had obtained no information about the time, place or method of execution - even though an Indonesian official visited her a day before the sentence was carried out.
Officials say the 37-year-old stabbed a four-year-old boy to death in the city of Yanbu in 2012. The victim's family refused to have her sentence commuted as they are entitled to do under Islamic law.
"The government of Indonesia has done its utmost to provide legal protection and has sought forgiveness from the victim's family with the aim of getting Tarsim's death sentence commuted," the foreign ministry said.
Migrant Care, an NGO that campaigns on behalf of Indonesian expatriate workers, alleged that Zainab had been acting in self-defence against an employer who had abused her.
Amnesty International said she had made a "confession" during police interrogation but she had had no legal representation or access to a consular representative.
Indonesia itself resumed executions in 2013 after a four-year moratorium. None were carried out during 2014, but six people, including five foreigners, were put to death in January.
