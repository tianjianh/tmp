Blackwall Tunnel lane closure causes five-mile traffic queues in south east London

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fuel spillage in the Blackwall Tunnel has caused major disruption for commuters in south-east London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Buses are delayed by up to three hours and traffic is severely congested, with queues up to five miles long.
The northbound tunnel will remain closed for the rest of the day while Transport for London (TfL) cleans up the spill and resurfaces the road.
TfL said CCTV footage showed that the spill at about 07:00 BST had been caused by a mobile crane.
It warned of "severe delays" in Woolwich, Charlton, Blackheath, Eltham and Greenwich.
The spill covered more than 1km of the northbound tunnel with corrosive liquid which made the surface of the road unsafe for drivers.
