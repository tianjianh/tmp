Olympic champion Jack Laugher is among those in North Yorkshire recognised in the New Year Honours list.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old has been awarded an MBE for services to diving, along with his diving partner Chris Mears.
Laugher won gold in the men's synchronised 3m springboard with Mears, six days before taking silver in the individual category in Rio.
Paralympic rower Laurence Whiteley and classical singer Iestyn Davies are also honoured with MBEs.
Whiteley is to receive the accolade for services to rowing after winning gold in the mixed trunk and arm double sculls with Lauren Rowles.
The 25-year-old from Northallerton waited two years for a suitable rowing partner to come along, and the pair won silver in their first major competition together at the 2015 World Championships.
Countertenor Davies, from York, is appointed for services to music.
He has sung for a number of opera companies including the English National, Welsh National and New York City before his time as a Cambridge chorister under the music director George Guest.
