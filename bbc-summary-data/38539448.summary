Watford 0-0 Middlesbrough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watford and Middlesbrough played out an uninspiring goalless draw as Hornets fans paid tribute to former manager Graham Taylor, who died earlier this week.

After a first half that only had three shots - the lowest in any match in the Premier League this season - Watford created the best chances in the second period.
On-loan substitute Tom Cleverley hit the post late on, Etienne Capoue shot over and Abdoulaye Doucoure headed wide on an emotional afternoon at Vicarage Road.
Middlesbrough's best chance fell to debutant Rudy Gestede, but he shot narrowly over.
The result means Watford remain 14th, with Middlesbrough in 16th position, four points above the relegation zone.
Former England manager Taylor died on Thursday, aged 72, and fans paid their respects to the man regarded as the best Hornets boss of all time.
He took the club from the old Fourth Division to a second-placed finish in the top flight in five seasons, and also led them to the 1984 FA Cup final, which they lost 2-0 to Everton.
Before the game there was a mosaic from the Watford fans spelling out the initials GT and a heart. A minute's applause was also heard before the match and chants of 'only one Graham Taylor' were a frequent part of the afternoon.
The game was also attended by Taylor's wife Rita and daughters Joanne and Karen while at half-time a number of former Watford players went on to the pitch to talk about their memories of Taylor.
Aitor Karanka's side are the lowest goalscorers in the Premier League with only 17 in 21 matches.
They only had one effort on target - a Fabio shot palmed away by Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, who later suffered a back injury when he landed badly after he punched the ball away from Alvaro Negredo.
Cristhian Stuani wasted another rare chance for Boro as his lofted shot ended on top of the net.
However, Karanka will be optimistic by Gestede's performance when he came on for the last 25 minutes following a £6m move from Aston Villa earlier this month.
Watford also have problems getting goals with captain Troy Deeney - one of three players to be booked along with team-mate Miguel Britos and Watford's Fabio in a late scuffle - now on a run of one goal in 14 games.
He did, however, set up Cleverley with a flick-on after a long throw but the midfielder, on loan from Everton, could only hit the post.
Boro goalkeeper Victor Valdes also did well to save a shot from Doucoure and a header from Stefano Okaka.
Watford manager Walter Mazzarri said: "In the second half we had six or seven very good chances and hit the post so we were unlucky but I'm happy with the performance.
"In some of the games we were not lucky at all and today we were very unlucky, the important thing is to keep playing and the victory will come."
On the tribute to former Hornets manager Graham Taylor, Mazzarri said: "It was beautiful, there were a lot of emotions, everyone was emotional.
"We wanted to give this victory to this great person who passed away and that is the only thing we missed."
Watford captain Troy Deeney said: "Today was more about Graham Taylor and not the result. It would have been nice to get a winner and dedicate it to him.
"You could see how emotional everyone was and it showed how much people care about him. Hopefully this game can be remembered for Graham and not the result. The main thing is we didn't lose.
"There are no words that I can use to sum up how great a man he was and we just wish his family all the best at this difficult time."
Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka said: "It was not the best game to watch, for us it was a good game and we showed once again we are a consistent team.
"I would like to have had more chances but they are a strong team and we had to defend.
"We will score goals, we have good players and we created chances but sometimes it is difficult if you are playing against a physical team.
"As a coach until the 31st (of January) you are always expecting for something to happen, the aim is to finish the transfer market with a better squad than we have got at the moment."
Watford are away at Bournemouth in the Premier League next Saturday (15:00 GMT), while Middlesbrough entertain West Ham at the same time.
