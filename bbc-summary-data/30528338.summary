A film version of Under Milk Wood, called Dan y Wenallt, starring Rhys Ifans and Charlotte Church, will be shown on S4C at the end of the centenary year of Thomas's birth.
The director, Kevin Allen, worked with Ifans on the 1997 film Twin Town.
"I've just tried to bring something fresh to the original material," he said.
Under Milk Wood was previously adapted for film in 1972 and starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.
"I haven't gone out of my way to be different," said Allen.
"I think you just have to get on and do your own thing and not look over your shoulder at other renditions."
The film will be released in English in cinemas across the UK in spring 2015.
