Joachim Low expects to have a strong squad to choose from for Germany's quarter-final against France on Friday, despite illness striking seven players.

Low said he was confident those affected will have recovered to play in the game, which kicks off at 17:00 BST.
"Some of them still have a bit of a cold, but it hasn't been the case that they have had any feeling of tiredness," he said on Thursday.
"I hope they all remain stable and that we don't see any deterioration."

The names of the seven players have not been released but defender Mats Hummels and midfielder Christoph Kramer were ill earlier in the week, with the former missing Monday's last-16 win over Algeria.
Three-time champions Germany are hoping to reach their fourth successive World Cup semi-final.
They finished top of Group G following two wins and a draw but were then given a tough test by Algeria in Porto Alegre, eventually winning 2-1 in extra time.
"We have not yet delivered our best possible performances, that is to come still," added Low, whose side opened their campaign with an impressive 4-0 win over Portugal.
"This isn't some easy-to-figure out computer game and your own team isn't always easy to programme, but you have to find the right combinations. You either win and stay or lose and go home."
France coach Didier Deschamps, a member of the World Cup-winning side of 1998, conceded Germany's exceptional record could help them.
"They are are very accustomed to this competition," he said. "Experience is more on their side, but we will play our game."
