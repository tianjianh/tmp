The 34-year-old scored 14 goals in 41 appearances last season but was out of contract with the League Two club this summer and was mulling over an offer to play in the USA.
Stead, who has played for 11 clubs during his career, has made 89 appearances and scored 28 goals for Notts since joining in July 2015.
The length of the former Sunderland striker's deal has not been revealed.
Stead told the club website: "It took me a while to make sure it was the right thing for me and the family, but it definitely is and I can't wait to get going.
"I want to be here. It's exciting times - there's a real buzz about the place. You don't want to be looking from the outside and wishing you'd been involved."
