[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stuart MacLeod jailed for 'horrific' hammer attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for six-and-a-half years over a claw hammer attack which left his victim brain-damaged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart MacLeod, 43, admitted attacking Michael Gibbons, 37, to the danger of his life in Bernadette Heron's flat in Glasgow on 17 November 2014.
Mr Gibbons accidentally hit Ms Heron with the hammer while trying to open her locked flat door. MacLeod attacked him after assuming this was deliberate.
The High Court in Glasgow heard the victim was left with horrific injuries.
Jailing MacLeod, judge Bill Dunlop QC told him: "I can understand how you misjudged the situation, but your reaction was grossly excessive.
"The consequences for your victim have been horrific."
The court heard Mr Gibbons, who suffers from epilepsy and learning difficulties, moved to a council flat in Springburn in May last year.
One of his neighbours was Ms Heron, who knew MacLeod and invited him and Mr Gibbons to her flat.
About 19:30, Mr Gibbons wanted to leave the flat and Ms Heron could not find the keys.
Mr Gibbons became anxious and was given permission to use a hammer to break the lock on the front door.
He struck the door several times and accidentally hit Ms Heron on the head.
MacLeod, who had been sleeping, awoke to find Mr Gibbons with a hammer in his hand and Ms Heron covered in blood.
He grabbed the hammer from Mr Gibbons and hit him on the head with the claw end then repeatedly kicked him as he lay on the floor.
The court heard that Mr Gibbons suffered severe brain injuries and requires 24-hour care and is unlikely to be able to live independently.
MacLeod, from Easterhouse, Glasgow, was originally charged with attempted murder, but the Crown accepted his plea to the reduced charge.
