Labour conference: Welsh delegate booed for Corbyn quip

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Welsh delegate at the Labour conference has been booed after questioning Jeremy Corbyn's appeal as leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew van Rooyen, from Bridgend, said: "We have got Jeremy Corbyn as leader, whether we like it or not."
He was speaking during a debate on plans to give Welsh Labour more autonomy from the UK party.
The proposals include a seat on Labour's ruling national executive committee.
Supporters of Mr Corbyn have opposed allowing Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones to nominate the Welsh representative and want that person elected by party members.
Some delegates tried to delay a vote on the proposals, prompting a debate on whether to have a debate.
Mr van Rooyen, speaking at his first party conference, said: "What a shame it is that some colleagues are trying to block it."
The conference chairman rebuked delegates for the response they gave him: "Colleagues some individuals booing there... be respectful to the speakers, you may not agree but be respectful."
Mike Payne from GMB Wales told the conference: "It is time we stopped the prevarication, comrades, and get on with it."
Delegates will vote on the changes later on Tuesday.
