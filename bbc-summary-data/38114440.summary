Stenhousemuir 0-1 East Fife: Fifers up to sixth after Kevin O'Hara winner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kevin O'Hara's 20-yard strike gives East Fife a victory over Stenhousemuir that lifts Barry Smith's side to sixth in Scottish League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His 11th minute effort secured a fourth straight win - and second since Smith succeeded Gary Naysmith as manager.
Stenhousemuir thought they had been awarded a penalty after 36 minutes, but referee Mike Roncone eventually awarded a drop ball amid some confusion.
Both sides had chances after the break, but the Fifers took the three points.
O'Hara's winner - the 18-year-old forward's second on loan from Falkirk - lifts them above Albion Rovers and seven points clear of their hosts, who remain two points adrift at the foot of the table.
