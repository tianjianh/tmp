Aker Solutions said employees had been told about 650 positions, mainly in the UK, Norway and India, may be affected.
A more specific breakdown for Aberdeen and London jobs has not been announced.
A spokesperson said: "The adjustments are being made because of the continued market slowdown and as part of a global reorganization that will strengthen the company's competitiveness."
Aker employs about 15,000 people, of which more than 2,000 are in the UK, the majority of them in Aberdeen and offshore.
