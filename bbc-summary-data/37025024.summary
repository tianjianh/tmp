The 28-year-old spent last season with Rotherham, making eight appearances.
Argentine Ledesma had two stints with the Saddlers while Bees boss Dean Smith was in charge at the Banks's Stadium.
"It will be a good thing for him to remain with us and then we will make a decision before the window closes," Smith told the club website.
Ledesma becomes Brentford's fifth signing of the summer transfer window.
Meanwhile Bees midfielder Andy Gogia, who featured 14 times for the west London club in 2015-16, has joined German Bundesliga 2 side Dynamo Dresden on a season-long loan deal.
