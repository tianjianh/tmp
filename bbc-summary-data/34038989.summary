Organisers of the Clacton Airshow say it will go ahead as planned following the Shoreham Airshow disaster.

The decision comes after Sussex Police said the number killed in the Shoreham crash on Saturday may rise.
Tendring District Council, which runs the Clacton show, said it had taken advice from its flight consultants.
The council said its view was that the Clacton show was significantly different to Shoreham because most of the flying takes place over the sea.
"At this point in time nothing has changed as far as Clacton is concerned," said council spokesman Nigel Brown.
He said the matter had been discussed on Sunday in the wake of the Shoreham crash.
"However, there will be no complacency and those people directly involved in the flying displays will be going through all the normal checks and procedures that take place before any event of this kind," Mr Brown explained.
"Safety is, and always will be, our primary concern at all times."
The Hawker Hunter jet that crashed at Shoreham was based at North Weald Airfield in Essex, but was not due to appear at the Clacton show, which takes place on Thursday and Friday.
