Inspired by sport? Tell us why it's important to you

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Is there a special reason why sport plays a special role in your life? Have you been inspired to try a new sport, or gone back to a sport you hadn't touched for years?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Many thousands of people all over the country picked up a stick, kicked a ball or laced up running shoes for the first time in the wake of the UK's successful home Olympic Games back in 2012. Every day a wealth of grassroots sport takes place in an increasingly health-conscious Britain.
If you are one of these people and have a story to tell, we'd like to hear from you - you could be featured on the BBC Sport website.
Which sport do you play? What made you decide to do it, and what drives you on? Where do you play your sport and who with? Why do you love it? Who is your hero?
Tell us via Twitter or, alternatively, you can email getinspired@bbc.co.uk with your story (up to 400 words) and include a few photos of you in action if you have them.
We will feature the best stories and photos on the BBC Sport website in the near future. (By sending us your contributions, you consent to us using them on this website and broadcasting them on any BBC outlet.)
If you don't have a story yet, then now is the time to start playing sport!
Explore the rest of the Get Inspired website and choose from more than 60 sports to find the one that's right for you. Don't forget to come back and tell us how it went!
We also appreciate your feedback - on the stories that we feature, and anything we may have missed. Contact us at getinspired@bbc.co.uk
