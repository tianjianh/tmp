[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Atletico Madrid climbed to third in La Liga with a routine victory at Malaga.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Diego Simeone's side were without seven players because of injury and suspension but strikes by Koke and Filipe Luis sealed a deserved win.
Koke capitalised on good play by Fernando Torres to put Atletico ahead after 26 minutes, while Torres was also involved for the second as Filipe Luis chipped home his first of the season.
Defeat leaves Malaga six points above the drop zone.
"We didn't make mistakes and when we got our chance in the second half, Filipe finished it fantastically," said Simeone.
"The 2-0 [scoreline] makes it look like something it wasn't. I always felt there were difficulties and danger."
Atletico move on to 58 points, above Sevilla who host Sporting Gijon on Sunday. Leaders Real Madrid, who have 65 points, entertain Alaves on Sunday, while champions Barcelona, two points behind, visit Granada.
Also on Saturday, Real Sociedad's hopes of a top-four finish were hit by a 1-1 draw at home to Leganes, who went ahead through Alexander Szymanowski. Juanmi levelled for Sociedad in the second half.
Eighth-placed Eibar maintained their hopes of qualifying for Europe for the first time with an impressive 3-2 win at Villarreal, while Athletic Bilbao were 2-1 winners at bottom side Osasuna.
