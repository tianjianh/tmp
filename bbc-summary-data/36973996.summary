CCTV footage - issued by Norfolk Police - shows the victim being thrown up to 15ft (4.5m) into the air, in a Norfolk car park, before the driver circled round and tried to hit him again.
It happened in the Vicarage Car Park in North Walsham at 00:55 BST on Saturday.
A man, 43, was later arrested and bailed in connection with the incident.
The victim, a 30-year-old man, was walking across the car park when he was struck by a dark coloured car, believed to be a blue Peugeot 307.
He was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, with a broken pelvis and serious leg injuries, including a shattered knee.
He was discharged from hospital yesterday, but police said he would not be able to walk unaided "for some time".

Det Ch Insp Stu Armes said: "The footage we have released today is shocking and I appreciate some people could find it distressing.
"However, it reflects the seriousness of the incident and how it could have had potentially fatal consequences for the victim.
"The victim has suffered serious injuries and has been left extremely distressed by his ordeal.
"Whilst the motivation for the incident remains unclear, we are treating it as attempted murder and at this time we believe it is an isolated incident."
After the incident, the car made off towards Bacton Road.
It is believed there were at least three other people, in addition to the driver, in the car at the time, one of them female.
Police have made an appeal for anyone with relevant information to come forward.
