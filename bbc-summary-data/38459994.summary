The 21-year-old joined the Lilywhites for an undisclosed fee from Manchester United at the start of 2016.
Pearson had impressed in two loan spells at Barnsley before he moved to Deepdale.
"He's been very good this season especially," boss Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"He's been one of our best players over the last few months since he got back into the team, but he knows he has to keep improving."
