A lecture was held at the British Medical Association in Tavistock Square.
Thirteen people died in the square after a number 30 bus was targeted by the bombers.
Dame Tessa Jowell, who gave the lecture, said many had swapped memories "as if they were [from] yesterday".
Esther Hyman, whose 32-year-old sister Miriam died in the bombing, said: "It used to be very difficult for me to pass through here but I've got used to it. I've developed coping strategies."
The Tavistock Square Memorial Trust is also campaigning for a permanent memorial to be placed in the square.
Dame Tessa, a former Labour minister who is seeking the party's election to become a London mayoral candidate, said: "Everybody was changed by this... hundreds of people whose lives were changed forever.
"There are lessons, obviously, to be learned and applied to the terrible situation now of those families in Tunisia."
Earlier it was announced that a minute's silence would be held 11:30 BST on 7 July during a service at St Paul's Cathedral.
It will also be observed across the capital's public transport network.
As well as those killed on the bus, 26 died in a bombing at Russell Square on the Piccadilly line; six died in an explosion at Edgware Road on the Circle Line; and seven died at Aldgate on the Circle Line.
