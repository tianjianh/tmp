Surrey captain Gareth Batty believes the club have a "good chance" of winning every competition this season.

Batty's side are top of Division One, with one win and two draws from their opening County Championship matches.
He is now hoping they can continue the momentum when they begin their One-Day Cup campaign at Somerset on Friday.
"We're traditionally a club that starts slowly, so I'm really proud of the management and the lads for flying out of the gates," the 40-year-old said.
"We've really started at a gallop. The challenge will be to see if we can sustain it until the end of the season."
Surrey opened their season with a crushing win over Warwickshire, before high-scoring draws against Lancashire and the Bears took them top with 45 points.
Having made a positive start in the County Championship, attention now shifts to the One-Day Cup, with a block of eight fixtures scheduled over the next three weeks.
Surrey have finished runners-up in the last two seasons in the 50-over format, losing out to Gloucestershire in 2015 and Warwickshire last season.
However, with new additions Scott Borthwick and Mark Stoneman having settled in alongside Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkara, Batty believes his squad are better equipped this campaign.
The off-spinner is even hopeful they can benefit from the new fixture schedule and improve on fifth in the County Championship and a T20 Blast group stage exit in 2016 to become the first side since Warwickshire in 1994 to win three competitions.
"I believe we're in a pretty good place across all facets of the game," he told BBC's Test Match Special podcast. "Can it ever be done again? I don't think so, but if anybody has a chance, I believe we do have a good chance.
"The Royal London One-Day Cup is done in July, so if you play well early in the season you could tick that one off.
"Then you have a bit more of the Twenty20 competition, which shouldn't be affecting your four-day stuff. So you can get that right, maybe tick it off, then you've got four games in four weeks to hopefully get you over the line in red ball cricket."
The county season moves into another phase with the next three-week period now dedicated to the One-Day Cup.
There will be extra interest with most England players involved ahead of the ODIs against Ireland and South Africa and the ICC Champions Trophy - for which the squad was announced on Tuesday.
The group stage ends on 17 May with a break before the quarter-finals on 13 June, the semi-finals on 16 and 17 June and the final scheduled for Lord's on Saturday, 1 July.
Ball-by-ball commentary of every game can be heard live via the BBC Sport website, with extensive coverage also on Radio 5 live sports extra.
