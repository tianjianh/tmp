[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Fylde 2-2 Dagenham & Redbridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham came from behind twice in stoppage time to salvage a draw at AFC Fylde.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts seized control early on and deservedly took the lead through Henry Jones after 14 minutes. The former Bangor City midfielder expertly controlled Andrew Bond's delivery on his chest and crashed home from six yards.
But Dagenham gradually grew into the contest and Morgan Ferrier, who had looked increasingly dangerous on the break, slid the ball home from 10 yards to equalise in first-half stoppage time.
Simon Grand finished from close range to nudge the hosts in front with five minutes remaining, but Sam Ling headed in a stoppage-time equaliser for Dagenham.
