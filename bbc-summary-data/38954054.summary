He left the Channel 4 winter sports show after getting a small leg fracture while taking part in snowcross training.
A spokesperson from Channel 4 told Newsround "Although [Sir Bradley was] keen to continue in the competition he will no longer take part following the fourth show in the series.
The last series of The Jump was troubled with injuries that saw seven celebrities quit the show. The injuries encouraged Channel 4 to review it's safety procedures.
Sir Bradley, who announced his retirement from cycling in December, tweeted: "Gutted to be leaving The Jump. I wanted to give you an injury update.
"Seen a specialist, I have a small leg fracture and need to rest for 3-6 weeks. Good news no surgery or cast required."
