[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Professional poker player David Michael Jenkins, 34, made more than £1m from his part in an underground business producing and supply steroids, Mold Crown Court was told.
He was jailed in July.
But he was back in court on Monday for a financial hearing under The Proceeds of Crime Act.
Judge Niclas Parry formally made an order which said that the criminal benefit from the enterprise was £1,012,767.
The recoverable amount available for confiscation was calculated at £101,862 which must be paid in three months or Jenkins will have to serve an additional two years in prison.
Jenkins, from Connah's Quay, Flintshire, told the court that as he was still in prison he may be unable to sell a house within the timescale.
The judge told him that if an application to extend the deadline was to be made in the future, he would have to show every effort had been made to sell the property.
The court heard that assets included an Audi A3, money held on account in casinos in Merseyside, casino chips, cash and a half share in a house in Connah's Quay.
Jenkins, a former roofer, had previously admitted being concerned in the supply of steroids, class C drugs, and money laundering between January 2009 and September 2012.
