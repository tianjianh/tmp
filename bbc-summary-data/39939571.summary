The 30-year-old Welshman clocked 51 minutes 26 seconds for Team Sky on Tuesday - 49 seconds behind Team Sunweb's Dumoulin.
Dumoulin - a noted timetrialler - has replaced Colombian Nairo Quintana as the overall race leader.
He leads the Movistar climber by two minutes and 23 seconds.
Thomas, who lost over five minutes following Sunday's crash, is now 11th overall, five minutes and 33 seconds behind the race leader.
Britain's Adam Yates - who was delayed by the same crash - is now 16th overall after the Orica rider finished two minutes 39 seconds behind leader Dumoulin on Tuesday.
Thomas said it "hurts mentally" to think his chances of competing for the overall race disappeared with Sunday's crash, despite Tuesday's second place.

"It shows I have the form and condition," Thomas told Eurosport. "It was a bit dented with the crash and I felt a bit handicapped with my arm, but I was happy with how today went.
"Hopefully I can try and recover and search for that stage win. It was a good boost to the confidence for sure.
"It still hurts mentally, to lose the chance of going for the podium through no fault of my own."
