'Agreement reached' over Tom Selleck water 'theft'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Selleck appears to have reached an agreement with the California water board that accused him of stealing water from a public hydrant.

A representative from the Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County said the proposed settlement would go before the board next week.
It is alleged a tanker truck filled up at a Ventura County hydrant more than a dozen times over the past two years.
The water was then taken to the Magnum PI star's nearby ranch, it is claimed.
The Calleguas district filed a complaint on Monday, accusing the actor of illegally exporting the district's water out of its service area.
Selleck, 70, has yet to make a comment about the accusations made against him and his wife Jillie, who was also named in the legal action.
California communities have been ordered to cut water usage drastically amid a four-year drought that has damaged the state's agriculture industry.
Selleck grows avocados on his 60-acre ranch in Westlake Village, which is located in a different area to the hydrant he is accused of tapping.
"Staff believes the tentative settlement is a positive step towards an ultimate resolution of this matter," said the water district's representative.
Resources manager Eric Bergh said the terms of the settlement would remain confidential until the deal was finalised.
In a 2012 interview, Selleck said it was "hard to make a living, let alone a profit" from avocados, the taste of which he admitted made him "gag".
