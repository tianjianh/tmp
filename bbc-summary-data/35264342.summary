Ulster v Oyonnax : Craig Gilroy return is one of eight changes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Craig Gilroy is fit to resume his place in the Ulster team for Sunday's rearranged European Champions Cup Pool One game against Oyonnax in France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gilroy's inclusion at full-back is one of eight changes from the side that lost to Munster in the Pro12 last week.
Ian Humphreys and Paul Marshall are selected as the half-back partnership.
Sam Arnold starts his first European game on the right wing while forwards Ricky Lutton, Lewis Stevenson and Roger Wilson are named in the starting XV.
Lutton replaces prop Wiehahn Herbst, who has failed to recover from a knock he sustained in the defeat at Kingspan Stadium last weekend, with Bronson Ross providing front-row cover among the replacements.
Stevenson comes in for the injured Alan O'Connor in the second row while Wilson replaces Nick Williams at number eight.
Regular first-choice half-back pairing Paddy Jackson and Ruan Pienaar occupy places on the replacements' bench, having been rested as part of the Ulster coaching staff's player management programme.

Louis Ludik also drops to the bench as Gilroy takes over the number 15 shirt after recovering from a fractured eye socket suffered in the triumph over Toulouse on 20 December.
Oyonnax lie 13th in the Top 14 and have lost their first three matches in Europe's premier club competition, which they are taking part in for the first time.
They will have to do without explosive winger Fetu'u Vainikolo for the rest of the season after the Tongan underwent knee surgery.
Vainikolo sustained a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the Top 14 game against Stade Francais on 30 December and had an operation on Friday.
The game was originally scheduled to be played in November but was postponed following the Paris attacks.
After a disappointing opening European defeat by Saracens, impressive back-to-back wins over Toulouse have put Ulster back in contention for a place in the last eight knockout stages.
After this weekend's rearranged game in France, Ulster travel to face Saracens at Allianz Park on 16 January, then host Oyonnax at Kingspan Stadium on 23 January.
Oyonnax: Q Etienne; D Codjo, A Taufa, E Sheridan, U Tawolo; N Robinson, J Blanc; L Delboulbes, J Maurouard, M Clerc; G Robson, F Metz; P Gunther, M Fa'asavalu, P Wannenburg.
Replacements: T Bordes, S Wright, H Pungea, L Power, V Maafu, A Aziza, R Clegg, D Ikpefan.
