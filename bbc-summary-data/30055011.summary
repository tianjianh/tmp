Up to 50 jobs are set to be lost as the titles become online-only, but the company said 12 new digital roles will be created.
The Reading Post, getreading and The Wokingham and Bracknell Times will close in Berkshire in December.
The Surrey Herald, Surrey Times and Wokingham Informer will also close as well as the Harrow Observer in west London.
Simon Edgley, managing director of Trinity Mirror Southern, said it was a "bold" move to focus on their websites and a digital-only operation.
"Decisions that impact our staff are never easy to make but they are absolutely necessary if we are to continue our transformation into a modern multiplatform publishing operation," he said.
In Berkshire, about 17 editorial, three administrative and six commercial roles will be lost and about 10 new digital editorial roles and two digital commercial roles will be created.
In Surrey and west London there will be a reduction of about 24 roles across its editorial and commercial departments.
Mr Edgley said: "This is a bold digital-only publishing transformation that will re-establish us as a growing media business that delivers the best quality journalism to our digital-savvy audience.
"We wholeheartedly believe that the future of our business here in Berkshire is online and this is an important and pioneering step that might, in time, be applicable to other existing markets or indeed new ones."
The Reading Post, Surrey Herald and Surrey Times will close on 17 December; The Wokingham and Bracknell Times, Harrow Observer and Woking Informer on 18 December; and getreading on 19 December.
