The police have issued a fresh appeal over the murder of a taxi driver in north Belfast a year ago.

Michael McGibbon, 33, was shot in an alleyway at Butler Place and died from his injuries in hospital on 16 April 2016.
The PSNI said the "brutal and callous attack" bore the "hallmarks of a paramilitary murder".
It said they wanted help tracing two men who called to Mr McGibbon's home the night before the attack.
"These men asked Mr McGibbon to step out the house. When he refused, they stated that they would be back," said Det Ch Insp Alan Dickson.
One of the men is described as being in his early 20s and slim while the other is described as being in his late teens.
"I am asking these men, or anyone who knows their identity, to get in touch with police," he said.
"If there is an innocent explanation for your presence at the house on that night allow us to eliminate you from this enquiry.
"I am also aware that other people in the area may also have been visited in a similar manner in the days surrounding Michael's murder, and I am asking for these people to make contact with police."
Det Ch Insp Dickson said Mr McGibbon was shot a number of times in the leg "in a densely populated residential area" and that his wife "desperately tried to save him by administering first aid".
"Easter is traditionally a time for families to spend time together and I would urge everyone to spare a thought for Michael's family who have been deprived of a cherished husband and father.
"One year on, and the McGibbons are still coming to terms with their grief, pain and loss. They deserve to see his killers brought to justice and pay for their ruthless actions."
He added that Mr McGibbon was a "man with no criminal record, no apparent criminal connections or associations".
"Those who carried it out have no legitimacy in this community and today I would like to mark the first anniversary of Michael's killing by appealing to local people to help us find them," he added.
