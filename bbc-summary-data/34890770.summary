Paul Heatley put the Crues ahead from a penalty on seven minutes after he himself had been fouled by Mark Hughes.
Jordan Forsythe doubled the lead on 23 as he side-footed home after good work by Michael Carvill.
Forsythe extended the Crusaders lead with a superb strike on 65 with Daniel Hughes pulling a goal back on 73.
Hughes's free-kick strike was another tremendous shot but the goal was little consolation for the struggling home side, with the game already out of reach.
The win keeps Crusaders five points ahead of their north Belfast rivals Cliftonville at the top of the table.
Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter:"We're just trying to commit ourselves to winning football matches and we let the points gather up as well.
"We've a lot to do. It's only early. We'll try and get into January and hope we're still in and around it."
Warrenpoint Town manager Barry Gray:"The scoreline didn't reflect how we felt we played today against a very good Crusaders team.
"We gave away the two early goals but it was a very, very positive display. I couldn't really ask for much more from the players."
