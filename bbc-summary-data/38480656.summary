The Reds beat Manchester City 1-0 at Anfield on Saturday to remain six points behind leaders Chelsea.
"We have to win our games and see where it leads us," said Klopp.
"When you are still there with five, six or seven matches to go you can think differently - but at the moment you only have to collect points."
Chelsea lead the way at the halfway stage of the season after a record-equalling 13-match winning streak.
"The league is unbelievably difficult," said former Borussia Dortmund boss Klopp. "We cannot look at Chelsea, they are unbelievably strong with 13 wins in a row. Not bad.
"But can you imagine how annoying it is when you win 13 games in a row and there is one team only six points behind?"
Liverpool's win over City came thanks to an early Georginio Wijnaldum header, one of only three efforts on target from either side.
"It was difficult," said Klopp. "We couldn't create too many chances and we defended really well.
"We probably had the bigger chances. I don't know of any real chances for them."

City are 10 points adrift of Chelsea in manager Pep Guardiola's first season in charge at Etihad Stadium.
"In these kind of games the little details make the difference," said the Spaniard, who has won six league titles in spells in charge of Barcelona and Bayern Munich.
"We have to focus on the next game against Burnley, not on the Premier League. Now we start the second road and see what can happen."
