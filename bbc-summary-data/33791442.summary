Metrolink: Travel card firm loses contract after delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greater Manchester's transport body has terminated its contract with the company responsible for rolling out a smart ticketing system after delays.

IT services firm Atos was contracted in 2012 to design, build and operate the 'Get me there' scheme.
Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) said it was "clear that Atos cannot deliver" the system and ended the deal.
Smart ticketing was introduced in October on Metrolink, but only to those with concessionary travel passes.
It was set to be rolled out to tram and bus passengers this year, with hopes to extend it further to rail travel.
In a joint statement, the transport body and Atos said the development and launch of the 'Get me there' system will continue, but with alternative suppliers.
A TfGM spokesman said: "Today's smart card already looks destined to be overtaken by contactless payments and mobile apps on smart phones.
"Given TfGM's commitment to deliver an integrated smart ticketing scheme, and with the opportunities afforded to us by the forthcoming Buses Bill, it is only right that TfGM re-thinks its approach to the 'Get me there' scheme to ensure that it is flexible and fit for the future."

Atos began developing the Oyster Card-style system in 2012, but there has been criticism of its slow roll-out.
It's currently only available for 500,000 concessionary card holders and TfGM have now said it's clear the company cannot complete the deal.
It's clearly a blow to Chancellor George Osborne's hope of an Oyster Card for the north as part of his northern powerhouse plans.
The travel body insists the existing service will be maintained as it looks for a new partner for the scheme.
