[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen McCafferty, 19, Teresa Robinson, 20, and Kaylem Ã“ Murachaidh, aged 18, died in a head-on collision in Drumkeen on Thursday.
A fourth man is in a serious condition in hospital.
Fr Eamonn Kelly said: "We blessed the bodies of the three deceased and we said a prayer for the man that was injured."
The deaths came 24 hours after two men were killed in a head-on crash on the N13 outside Letterkenny on Wednesday.
"We also said a prayer for the emergency services," Fr Kelly said.
"It was a very sad scene, when anybody loses their life obviously it is very sad, and there are great difficulties involved.
"You never get used to it because everyone is different. Even though you may have been called to accidents before you have never been called to this accident before."
Fr Kelly acknowledged that the victims' families would now be going through a "terrible" process of grief and mourning.
"The shock of losing someone so fast is hard to take on board, the sinking in feeling of the reality that they will no longer be with them.
"The weeks and months that lie ahead and the emptiness of it all, and as it all unfolds, it's such a harrowing thing for all the people involved.
"The impact on the local community is immense in the loss of any young person. There is such a vacuum left behind," he said.
