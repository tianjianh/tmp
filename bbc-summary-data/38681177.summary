Leon Johnson brutally attacked the man and stole his wallet in Acocks Green, Birmingham, in December 2016.
After police spotted a Cash Converters receipt bearing his name, Johnson initially claimed he was a good Samaritan who had tried to intervene.
But CCTV showed him carrying out the attack and he admitted robbery.

He was jailed for four years and eight weeks at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday.
Police said the victim suffered cuts to his head and a severely bruised eye socket after the attack.
Johnson, 35, of Bromyard Road, Hall Green, had been serving a suspended sentence for battery at the time of the attack.
Det Con Tom Lyons, from West Midlands Police, said clothes stained with the victim's blood had been found in Johnson's washing machine.
"This was a particularly traumatic experience for the elderly man who was assaulted for a relatively small amount of gain for Johnson," he said.
