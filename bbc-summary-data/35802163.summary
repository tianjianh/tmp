When she was in her early teens she started feeling ill, and went from dancing and having an active social life to being unable to stand.
With the medical profession unable to provide an explanation for the changes to her body, life became extremely frustrating.
Jessica was eventually diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, POTS (Postural Tachycardia Syndrome) and uses a wheelchair, but she hasn't let her condition hold her back.  Although she faces challenges every day she approaches life in a very positive way.
This is her story.
