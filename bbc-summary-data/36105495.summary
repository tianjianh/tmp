Mixu Paatelainen: Suspended ban for Dundee United manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United manager Mixu Paatelainen has been given a suspended two-match ban after "shouting and gesticulating" towards Dundee fans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident took place near the end of his side's 2-2 derby draw at Tannadice on 20 March.
The touchline ban will only take effect if Paatelainen commits a further breach of Scottish FA disciplinary rules before the end of 2016.
United, who are bottom of the Scottish Premiership, host Hamilton on Sunday.
The SFA charge said of Paatelainen: "In that on or around the 91st minute you committed misconduct by shouting and gesticulating at away supporters."
