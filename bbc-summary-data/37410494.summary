Thursday hearing date for St Johnstone's Graham Cummins and Chris Kane

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Johnstone will discover on Thursday if they have been successful in their appeal against the bookings for Graham Cummins and Chris Kane for simulation during Saturday's 1-0 win over Hearts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saints plan to make a full submission to the SFA on Tuesday.
Manager Tommy Wright told the club's website: "We fully support the game's authorities as they attempt to clamp down on this aspect of the game.
"In both these cases we feel that the players have been wrongly cautioned."
The cards had come after Wright suggested Hearts players were guilty of going down too easily.
Cummins was booked by referee John Beaton after 15 minutes at McDiarmid Park, but the Irishman went on to score the only goal of the game 12 minutes after half-time.
He was replaced by Kane late in the match and the substitute was shown his yellow card eight minutes after coming on.
