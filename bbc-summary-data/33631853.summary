[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Drennan, a mechanic and doorman from Newtownabbey in County Antrim, had left with friends for a holiday to the Spanish island on Saturday.
The 21-year-old is understood to have died less than 24 hours later. His body was found in his hotel room.
Spanish police told BBC News NI there were no signs of violence and the death appeared to be of natural causes.
However, they are waiting for an autopsy to be carried out and could not say when that would take place.
On Wednesday evening, friends and family of Mr Drennan released balloons and lanterns at Loughshore park in Jordanstown, County Antrim.
Mr Drennan's family have said a repatriation trust set up in the name of Kevin Bell, a Newry man who died in a suspected hit-and-run in New York in 2013, is covering the cost of bringing his body back to Northern Ireland.
