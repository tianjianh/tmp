England are a more close-knit unit since Eddie Jones took over as head coach before this year's Six Nations, says number eight Billy Vunipola.

England secured the Six Nations title with victory over Wales last weekend and will win the Grand Slam if they beat France in Paris on Saturday.
Jones replaced Stuart Lancaster after England's disastrous 2015 World Cup.
"James Haskell never used to talk to me! But now we've started talking about stuff other than rugby," said Vunipola.
"After a few games this year he was asking me questions and now we've made a good bond.
"It [the England camp] is quite an easy-going place off the pitch and it's nice to sit down, have a chat and see what's going on in team-mates' lives.
"We realised it was something we could improve on, you build stronger and better relationships that way.
"And you can see that new players are coming in and just doing their thing."
In an interview with BBC Radio 5 live, Vunipola added that he had benefited from Jones encouraging him to play his own game.
"He [Jones] has come in and had a good influence on the boys. Not just him, but also 'Guzzy' [defence coach Paul Gustard] and [forwards coach] Steve Borthwick.
"They know me quite well from Saracens so it's about paying that trust back."
On Australian Jones' fearsome reputation, Vunipola said: "We haven't seen Eddie lose his rag with us and I hope never to see that in my life."
