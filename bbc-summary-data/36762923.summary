It means Leigh have secured the title two games to go before the Super 8s.
Centurions head coach Paul Rowley quit 10 days before the start of the season, with Neil Jukes promoted from his position as assistant.
"From a personal point of view, I'm really delighted to lead this club this year and get that League Leaders' Shield," said Jukes.
He told BBC Radio Manchester: "It's been in our cabinet for two years and we wanted to keep hold of that. It's been an up and down season, without a doubt, and I've just said to the players and staff that they've been outstanding."
It has been another dominant campaign from Leigh, who have lost one and drawn one of their 19 games, and if they beat Dewsbury at home in their final league game of the season then it will be three years since they have lost in front of their own fans.
Despite their dominance of the second tier, Leigh finished bottom of The Qualifiers last year in the Super 8s.
"I think we are better prepared," added Jukes. "The problem this year is we've got Leeds, Huddersfield, Salford and Hull KR probably.
"It's going to be ridiculous when you look at it. I think as a club we are prepared, but the challenge is going to be harder."
