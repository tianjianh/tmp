The "other-worldly scenes" of artist Roger Dean, best known for his work with the rock band Yes, have been used for stamps on the Isle of Man.

The 71-year-old from Kent, who also created album covers for Asia and Uriah Heep, is the subject of an exhibition at the Manx Museum in Douglas.
Dean said he liked the juxtaposition between post being delivered and his "inaccessible" worlds.
Isle of Man Post said he had "inspired generations to become artists".
The Islands and Bridges collection includes a painting inspired by the Isle of Man, titled Meeting Place, which has been produced exclusively for the stamp issue.
The other images are taken from Uriah Heep, Blind Owl and Yes albums, including an image from 1973's Tales of Topographic Oceans.
The artist, who has sold more than 60 million copies of his images worldwide, said his paintings were "landscapes that are mostly inaccessible".
"Stamps are the means of paying for the passage of messages from place to place; I love the purposefulness of that," he said.
He added that in creating Meeting Place, he had been inspired by the "unique history and landscape" of the Isle of Man, which he said was "a gem".
"It is an island between two countries both with an ancient history, but the Isle of Man has retained its own identity, myths and history.
"It is a small island, but within its shores are varied landscapes of great beauty."
Former Yes keyboard player Rick Wakeman said Dean was a "very special artist", adding that there was "always something new to discover in his work".
