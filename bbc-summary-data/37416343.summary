Scarlets and the Welsh Rugby Union will work together to keep full-back Liam Williams in Wales, says Wayne Pivac.

The Scarlets head coach was responding to questions over reports linking Williams with a move to Ospreys.
"Liam is one of our favourite sons here at the Scarlets and we'd like to see him here for a number of years to come," said Pivac.
"I know the WRU would love to see him stay in Wales and together we'll be working to achieve that."
Pivac says Williams is "keen to stick around" and doubts he would join Scarlets' closest rivals.
"Look, anything's possible, isn't it. But no, I wouldn't think that would be the case," said the New Zealander.
Scarlets are one of three teams without a Pro12 point going into the fourth round at the weekend.
Title-holders Connacht are also without a win and are one place below the Welsh region in 11th, with Treviso last, before the Welsh and Irish teams meet in Llanelli on Saturday.
"Connacht is our focus now and we need to get that first win, which I think could break the shackles and things open up nicely for us," said Pivac.
"I'm sure in both camps it's a must-win game because nobody wants to be nought from four and sitting at the bottom of the table.
"It's a long way up from that position."
Wales prop Samson Lee is over his shoulder problem but a virus means he will miss the game against Connacht and is likely to return at Treviso on Saturday, 1 October.
"Lee's been cleared of that shoulder. He's as strong as he was pre the injury, if not stronger," added Pivac.
"He's done a lot of live scrummaging with us now and ticked all those boxes.
"He's just picked up a bit of a virus so we'll likely leave him until next week."
