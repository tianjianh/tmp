The family of an 86-year-old man who was tied to a chair in a care home have described his ordeal as "torture".

Seamus Gormley became a resident of Drumragh Care Home, Omagh, in 2014 following health complications.
In November, a care assistant who was employed at the care home, was found guilty of assault. The home has since closed.
The former owners of the care home said they co-operated fully with the investigation.
In July 2015, Mr Gormley, who has dementia, was tied to a chair with a belt by the care assistant. His family were informed three days after the incident. They found their father's arms covered in bruises.
Speaking to the BBC, his daughter Eilish McCullagh said her father, who had been a keen joiner and enjoyed 61 years of marriage, became nervous and withdrawn after the incident.
"The nurse told us that dad had been tied to a chair by two staff members and had been there for at least two hours on his own.
"There was nothing in his notes to say he had been restrained. It's a nightmare, even thinking about it.
"Nobody would do that to another human being. It was a form of abuse  - pure torture.
"He didn't deserve that, he wouldn't harm anyone."
Last month at Omagh Magistrates court, Catrina Tummons from Lisnaragh Road, Dunamanagh, was found guilty of assault and ill-treatment of a patient.
Mr Gormley's family have also hit out at the regulatory body, the RQIA, for not intervening quickly enough.
The RQIA said the incident was reported to the police, HSC (Health and Social Care) Trust and the patient's family by the home.
"While RQIA does not conduct a separate investigation, it is kept advised of any actions arising from this process," it said.
In a statement, Drumragh owner, the Four Seasons Care Group, said the former care home and wider company managers co-operated actively and fully with the investigation.
"We immediately suspended a care assistant and an agency nurse and the company itself triggered the investigation," it said.
"We also reported the care worker to the Northern Ireland Social Care Council and reported the nurse to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The authorities are satisfied that we took all appropriate measures."
But Mr Gormley's relatives said they felt let down by people they trusted and that the incident had traumatised the entire family.
"Mummy trusted these people to look after her husband and they let her down badly," said his daughter, Brenda Sweeney. "Never did she think that daddy would be abused.
"It has just been a total and utter nightmare."
Brenda Sweeney described the RQIA's response as "lacking".
"They should have stepped in much much earlier," she said. "They should have been with us every step of the way - we were at meetings, they weren't represented."
The Western Health and Social Care Trust said it did not comment on individual cases.
But a whistle-blower has criticised how the Drumragh home was run and said staff did not have the equipment to do their jobs.
"90% of the time you mightn't have the right sling for the right hoist," the whistle-blower told the BBC.
"You would just have to make do. Incontinence pads were rationed to an extent where you were running them under a tap so you didn't have to put them back on a resident because your manager was checking if they were wet enough to be thrown away.
"We had dirty sheets, threadbare towels, towels cut into face cloths, that is what you were expected to work with.
"At least five times, I contacted RQIA. I got through to the head office.
"I told them what my concerns were and they said they would follow it up.
"They never came, they never rang.
"They only ever came on their announced inspection day, they never came any other time."
The RQIA responded that during 2014-15 it was contacted on a number of occasions by anonymous whistle-blowers in relation to Drumragh Care Home.
"In each case RQIA fully assessed the information provided, and followed up the concerns through its regulatory activities including unannounced inspection," it said.
The Four Seasons Group said it had an active whistle-blowing policy.
"We have in place rigorous policies, processes and procedures across all our homes to support good care, but we are a people business and ultimately we are dependent on individual members of the front line staff in our homes," said a spokesperson.
