[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 2-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Gregory scored a penalty in each half as Millwall beat Fleetwood to earn their first home league win since August.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gregory had already poked an effort straight at Chris Neal before opening the scoring after 31 minutes.
The lively Fred Onyedinma burst into the box and was pulled down by Ashley Eastham, and Gregory stepped up to send Neal the wrong way.
Two minutes after the restart, Millwall were awarded another penalty after Nathan Pond tussled with Byron Webster at a corner.
Gregory made no mistake as he delicately rolled the ball into the bottom right-hand corner.
And the striker almost completed his hat-trick in the 50th minute, racing onto a clever through-ball from Steve Morison, but Neal stood firm in the Fleetwood goal to deny him.
Substitute Ashley Hunter got Fleetwood back into the game with a fine finish in the 65th minute, but Millwall held on.
