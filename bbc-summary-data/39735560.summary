Back row forward Clive Ross, lock Alan O'Connor and scrum-half Dave Shanahan have signed deals which will keep them at Ulster until the summer of 2019.
Hooker John Andrew has agreed terms to remain with the province until 2020.
"As we continue to build our playing roster it is critical that we have depth across these key positions," said Ulster Director of Rugby Les Kiss.
Andrew, 23, has captained the Ulster A side through their most successful campaign in recent years, having graduated from the Ulster Academy into the senior ranks.
The Ballymena man made his senior debut for Ulster in December 2015 against Connacht and has gone on to collect 26 caps for the province.
Ross, 27, has made 52 appearances for Ulster over the past three seasons and has featured in 23 of the side's 26 games to date this campaign.
The Cork native picked up his first try for the Irish province in the win over Connacht in December.
O'Connor made the switch to the Ulster Academy from Leinster in 2012, and has played 37 times to date for his adopted province.
Twenty-three-year-old Shanahan's 13 appearances so far include starts in January's Champions Cup pool games against Exeter and Bordeaux.
"All four of the guys have a great work ethic and a genuine eagerness to develop their game, so I have no doubt that they will continue to be key components of our squad for the years ahead," added Kiss.
