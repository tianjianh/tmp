[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kent v Derbyshire: Luis Reece and Will Davis take three wickets each

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derbyshire chipped away with regular wickets to prevent Kent from getting a foothold at Canterbury on day one.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Put into bat after an uncontested toss, Kent openers Daniel Bell-Drummond (38) and Sean Dickson (41) made a solid start, reaching 83 without loss.
But Luis Reece (3-38) and Will Davis (3-59) struck to reduce Kent to 114-5.
Sam Northeast (32) and Wayne Parnell (41) rallied before Adam Rouse and James Harris reached stumps at 238-8 with bad light seeing nine overs lost.
After overcoming cloudy bowler-friendly conditions, a number of Kent batsmen made starts, but none went on to make a half-century.
Reece was their main opposition, dismissing Bell-Drummond, Northeast and Parnell with some probing lines before Rouse (27 not out) and Harris (21 not out) put on a valuable stand of 35 in the fading light.
