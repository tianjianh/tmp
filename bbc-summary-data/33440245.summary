Fans descend on San Diego Comic-Con

Dust off your Wonder Woman suit. Leave your selfie stick at home. And if you must carry a sword, make sure it's tied securely to your costume as dangerous weapons will be checked at the door.

Yes it's time for Comic-Con, the annual pop culture convention where the entertainment industry markets directly to its most die-hard fans.
And the fans turn out in droves. Tens of thousands are expected to descend on the San Diego Convention Center this week, many dressed as their favourite superheroes.
All will be hoping to catch a glimpse of their favourite film, TV and video game stars, or sneak a peak at an upcoming film, show, comic book or video game.
"Tales of San Diego Comic-Con are told in awe on every set around the known fantasy/sci-fi production world," said Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi, who is attending the convention for the first time.
"It's become a fabled kingdom, one I am thrilled to find myself heading for. And to appear in the legendary Hall H is a further twist to the cosplay and comic madness I may never recover from."
"Cosplay" is short for "costume play", or the fancy dress many choose to wear to such conventions, while Hall H is the massive room inside the convention centre where the biggest "panels" are held.
No tents are allowed in the vast queue, but sleeping bags are allowed for the many who line up all night to guarantee themselves a place.
Batman v Superman, X-Men, Hunger Games and Star Wars events look set to dominate Hall H. Yet some of Hollywood's biggest studios are skipping the con of cons this year.
Marvel blamed "bad timing" for its absence, having already unveiled plans for the next phase of its superhero slate at a fan event last October.
"I really have a belief: If you can't go to Comic-Con and over-deliver, then don't go," boss Kevin Feige explained.
Without the Avengers to steal the show, the superheroes of Warner Bros and elsewhere have a chance to be the main attraction.
Unless Star Wars upstages them all, of course...
Fans are hoping to see Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill suited up as Batman and Superman. Jennifer Lawrence may be in town to promote the final instalment in the Hunger Games franchise. And there should be plenty of Wonder Women.
Women are increasingly represented at comic conventions, so much so that there is a movement to prevent sexual harassment of women in costumes.
Women often complain men grope and photograph them from behind at conventions, so a group called "Geeks for CONsent" has formed to remind crowds that cosplay does not equal consent to be manhandled or harassed.
The fabled Hall H may be the most desired ticket, but there is plenty of other space for fans inside the 2.6 million sq ft (2.4 million hectare) convention centre.
The San Diego Comic-Con is the largest and most star-studded of its kind, but there are dozens of similar events around the world that are becoming increasingly popular.
While some big Hollywood studios may be skipping Comic-Con this year, big corporations outside of traditional entertainment are waking up to how they can advertise their products to pop culture fans.
"Is Comic-Con becoming more corporate? Absolutely it is," said Jeetendr Sehdev, a marketing professor at the University of Southern California.
"That's the nature of how business is going. I think the corporate brands are becoming more entertainment centric."
Some fans may be annoyed at the presence of car company Lexus or insurers State Farm at comic conventions. But Sehdev said that is how pop culture is changing, and that younger fans are more receptive to the blurred lines between art and commerce.
So how do Comic-Con fans themselves feel about their culture going mainstream? "I think it's great! The nerds won," said Matt Moore, a pop culture writer who has attended many Comic-Cons.
"All the people who used to make fun of me in high school are there standing in line to watch Age of Ultron, or waiting for Batman v Superman. We won!"
The 2015 Comic-Con International runs in San Diego California from 9 to 12 July.
