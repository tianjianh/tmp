[SN]TITLE[SN]
AC Milan 0-1 Juventus (aet)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Juventus became the first Italian side in history to complete back-to-back doubles as substitute Alvaro Morata scored an extra-time winner against AC Milan in the Coppa Italia final.

The 23-year-old swept home a half-volley from Juan Cuadrado's cross to settle a game high on effort, but short on quality in the final third.
Juventus claimed the Italian title for the fifth successive season in April.
Milan miss out on Europe next season after finishing seventh in Serie A.
The final Europa League spot goes to minnows Sassuolo, who finished sixth in the league and had never qualified for Europe before.
The Italian Cup final is likely to mark the end of Mario Balotelli's second stint with the Rossoneri.
The 25-year-old striker - at the end of a season-long loan from Liverpool - has scored only three goals in 23 appearances since his return to Italy and was a late substitute in Rome.
Milan went close to dramatically sending the game to penalties, but substitute Jose Mauri's fierce low strike flew just wide after 17-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had come up for a set-piece.
The defeat marks the end of a miserable campaign for Milan and club president Silvio Berlusconi - who earlier this week had threatened to stop paying his players unless they improve  - was in attendance at Rome's Stadio Olimpico.
Milan last lifted a trophy in 2011 when they were led to a Super Cup win over city rivals Inter Milan by Massimiliano Allegri, who is now the Juventus boss.
Allegri was sacked at the San Siro in January 2014, six months before taking up his current post with Juve.
