Welsh couple fulfil Skye mountain wedding vow

A couple from Wales have fulfilled their ambition to stand atop one of Scotland's best known mountain features - in their wedding attire.

Mel Morrell and Steve Hill went on a climbing trip to Skye shortly after first going out six years ago.
The pair had hoped to tackle the Cioch, a block of rock on cliffs in the Cuillin, but could not complete the climb at that time.
They returned last Thursday and completed the ascent.
The Hills, who live in Swansea, were married two years ago, but only last week were able to return to Skye for the climb.
While on the Cioch they recreated a famous sword fight scene from 1986 film Highlander that featured Scots actor Sean Connery.
Mr Hill said: "We found the plastic swords in a crack once we were on the Cioch. It felt wrong not to use them."
The Hills, who are members of South Wales Mountaineering Club, made their trip to Skye with climbing friends.
Mrs Hill made her ascent in her climbing gear before putting on her dress.
Her husband put on his suit at a safe point just before finishing his climb via another route so as not to hold up others waiting to make the same climb.
