Up to 1,000 passengers were barred from boarding flights at Liverpool John Lennon Airport because of a security incident.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The departure lounge was evacuated at about 12:00 BST because of a technical problem with one of the scanning machines.
Passengers have since been told they can return to get their luggage rechecked, but to expect some delays.
An airport spokesman said there was no threat to passenger safety.
Officials said the problem was spotted "within a matter of minutes", but that a re-screening process was "necessary in order to ensure security compliance".
Six flights were delayed for up to two hours due to the removal and re-screening of passengers.
The cause of the airport scanner failure is being investigated.
