Words and pictures were painted onto the headstones at the graveyard on Nottingham Road in Chaddesden between 16:00 GMT on 9 November and  Remembrance Day.
Police said the damaged graves were located in the South Cemetery.
The attack is not believed to be linked to Remembrance Day, even though one of the damaged graves was a war grave, police said.
Sgt Nick Beeston said: "This is one of the most disrespectful acts of vandalism I have witnessed.
"To commit this type of crime in such a sensitive location shows a complete lack of thought or respect for the families and friends of those whose graves have been attacked."
Police are appealing for members of the community who may recognise the wording or the graffiti tag  #collectiv that was sprayed on some of the graves.
