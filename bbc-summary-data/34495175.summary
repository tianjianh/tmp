He first entered the UK singles charts in 1982 with the song I Won't Let You Down - recorded with his band Ph.D.
He went on to achieve international success with I Should Have Known Better and Hi-Ho Silver, the theme tune for ITV series Boon.
His family said they were "deeply shocked by his sudden death".
He passed away at his home in London.
A family spokesman added: "He was a devoted family man who loved his wife Chrissy and his children Sara and Lawrence, and the music that he continued to make.
"He dedicated a lot of time over recent years to the Cash for Kids charity appeal in Scotland with his friend Sir Tom Hunter and was still active and well respected on the music scene.
"He'll be much missed by all who knew him and everyone who loved his music and his unique voice and style."
Born in Glasgow's East End, Diamond was influenced by the voices of Ray Charles and Otis Redding and joined his first band at the age of 14.
After moving to London he formed the band Bandit and his haunting voice was brought to the attention of the father of British blues Alexis Korner, who invited him to work with him.
He later went to Los Angeles where he worked with Eddie Kramer, the legendary producer of Jimi Hendrix.
On his return to London he formed the band Ph.D with Tony Hymas and Simon Phillips. Their first single I Won't Let You Down went on to sell millions.
When Ph.D went their separate ways, Diamond signed to A&M Records.
His single I Should Have Known Better went straight to number one and was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. His next single Hi Ho Silver was another top 10 hit.
At the Edinburgh Festival in 1993, the Scotsman newspaper described Diamond as "Scotland's answer to Ray Charles".
In the late 90s, he teamed up with saxophonist Chris "Snake" Davis from soul outfit M People. They performed together and later worked on Diamond's album Souled and Healed which was released in 2005.
In 2011, he released an album of soul covers featuring Scottish musicians including Wet Wet Wet drummer Tommy Cunningham and Greg Kane of Hue & Cry.
