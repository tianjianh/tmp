Jordan Watson murder: Love rival vowed to 'kill anyone' for girl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Letters written by a teenager to the girlfriend of a 14-year-old boy he is accused of murdering, said he would "kill anyone for her", a court is told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Watson's body was found under a blood-stained tree in a Carlisle cemetery on 15 June. He had suffered a "brutal and sustained attack".
Carlisle Crown Court has heard George Thomson, 19, was so obsessed with the 14-year-old girl that he killed Jordan.
He and co-defendants Brahnn Finley, 19, and Daniel Johnston, 20, deny murder.
The girl, now 15 and who cannot be identified, said in police interviews shown to the jury, that Mr Thomson told her he wished Jordan was dead.
The court was told that during a police search of Mr Thomson's Carlisle home they recovered a blood-stained Gurkha knife and a collection of other weapons, including a machete and a cleaver.
Also found were a number of letters written by Thomson declaring his love for Jordan's girlfriend.
One said: "I am writing to you to tell you my feelings for you because I think you don't believe me. But I am telling you I really do love you and I would die 100 times for you and I would kill anyone for you."
She told police she and Jordan "loved each other" and denied any relationship with Mr Thomson.
She said: "He [Mr Thomson] asked me if I would cheat on Jordan with him and I went 'no'. He was always saying I was beautiful and if I went out with him he would treat me like a princess."
Asked if Mr Thompson mentioned any threats to Jordan, she said: "He said at one point he wanted to kill him. He said 'sometimes I wish he was dead'.
Jurors were told Mr Thomson's "obsessive desire" for the girl "festered and grew" and he wanted Jordan "out of the picture".
Simon Medland QC, prosecuting, said Mr Thomson lured Jordan to Upperby cemetery with an "almost certainly fictional" arrangement to sell weapons to another man.
The prosecution allege Mr Thomson's co-defendants were present during the murder to "lend support".
Mr Thomson, of Upperby Road, Carlisle; Mr Finley, of Furze Street, Carlisle, and Mr Johnston, of Petteril Bank Road, Carlisle, all deny murder.
The trial continues.
