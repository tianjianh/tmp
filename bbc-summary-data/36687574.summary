The 29-year-old, whose contract with the Latics had expired, has spent three loan spells at Meadow Lane, scoring 13 goals in 28 appearances.
He played under John Sheridan during the Notts manager's time as Oldham boss and his previous clubs also include Sheffield United and Scunthorpe.
Notts, who have now made seven signings this summer, have not announced the length of Forte's contract.
He was on loan at the East Midlands club in 2008, 2009 and 2012.
"I did well for them, so I thought it was the right time to come back," he said.
