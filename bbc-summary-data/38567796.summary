Rothley Post Office, which villagers said was due to close in four days, was targeted at about 03:40 GMT on Tuesday.
Leicestershire Police said a forklift-type vehicle - believed to have been stolen from a nearby building site - was used to smash the shop.
The suspects then made off with the machine in another vehicle.
This vehicle was later found burned in a field in Belton, Rutland.
