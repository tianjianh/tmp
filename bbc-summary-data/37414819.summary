Chesterfield 3-3 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jay Emmanuel-Thomas scored two second-half penalties as Gillingham came from behind to shatter Chesterfield with a stoppage-time equaliser in a 3-3 draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gillingham were caught cold in the second minute when Jon Nolan whipped in a free-kick from the right and Conor Wilkinson headed in from eight yards.
Chesterfield were causing problems down the flanks but Gillingham created little until the 32nd minute when Emmanuel-Thomas was denied from 10 yards by Tom Anderson's block.
The visitors went further behind in the 52nd minute after Mark Byrne tripped Nolan and Dennis fired the spot-kick past Stuart Nelson's right hand.
Emmanuel-Thomas pulled one back with a 65th-minute penalty after Deji Oshilaja was pulled back by Anderson but Wilkinson lifted the ball over Nelson in the 72nd minute to make it 3-1.
Emmanuel-Thomas netted a second penalty after Scott Wagstaff was tripped by Laurence Maguire to put Gillingham back in it.
Wagstaff then tapped in four minutes into added time to complete the comeback for the visitors.
