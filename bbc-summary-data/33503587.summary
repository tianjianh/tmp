Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has said he has "full confidence" in the chief constable of Police Scotland.

Sir Stephen House has been under growing pressure following the force's handling of a fatal crash on the M9.
Lamara Bell, 25, died in hospital at the weekend after lying critically ill for three days in a crashed car, next to her dead partner John Yuill, 28.
A review of police call handling in Scotland has been announced by the Scottish government.
Although the couple were not found until Wednesday, Police Scotland admitted the crash was reported to them three days earlier.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Matheson was asked about calls for the police chief to "consider his position".
Mr Matheson said: "I think the chief constable has a number of challenges which he has dealt with coming into post.
"He has also acknowledged there has been a number of mistakes made over the last couple of years, and clearly there's been a mistake made with this particular case, and he's sought to try and address them.
"It's important the focus now has to be on making sure this type of thing cannot occur again and we learn the lessons from that.
"We also have to make sure we have the right safeguards in there to ensure that if anyone makes a call to one of the Police Scotland contact centres then it is dealt with effectively."
The urgent review by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) will focus broadly on all call handling procedures and will be in addition to the ongoing independent inquiry specifically into the M9 incident by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc).
Sir Stephen has admitted that the initial information received about crash was not entered into police systems.
Ms Bell had been in a medically-induced coma at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow after suffering kidney damage from dehydration from lying in the wreckage for so long. She died at about 06:50 on Sunday.
A statement on behalf of the Bell family said: "Sadly, our daughter has passed away. We now request that the media respect our privacy to grieve for Lamara at this very difficult time."
The Yuill family said: "The family of John Yuill would like to say that their prayers and thoughts are with Lamara and her family. We are devastated by the sad news.
"The families have messaged each and our thoughts are with John and Lamara's children at this very sad time."
Sir Stephen has welcomed the review into call handling. He said Police Scotland needed to be able "to reassure the Scottish public that we have both the capacity and the capability to deal with their calls".
There had been pressure from opposition politicians for a wider inquiry into the operation of Scotland's single police force in light of the incident.
Speaking on Good Morning Scotland, Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman, Elaine Murray, said a review of how the police call handling system was working should have taken place sooner.
"It's easy to be wise with hindsight," she said.
"But I think there were warning signs there that the system was not working well and perhaps inquiries should have been made sooner.
"I think Sir Stephen House has a number of problems and if I was Sir Stephen House I would be considering my position this morning. However, it's important that we don't just make a scapegoat of the chief constable."
Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie welcomed the review but said it should go further.
"With reports of police officers backfilling civilian posts, huge workload pressures and morale at rock bottom there is a strong case for a wider independent review," he said.
Calum Steele, from the Scottish Police Federation, told BBC Scotland: "My members and police officers up and down the length and breadth of Scotland are working harder and are busier than ever before.
"I suppose all of this highlights that human beings do make mistakes. Of course we try to make sure that we design systems to prevent those mistakes being made, the unfortunate thing is that human beings are fallible."
