Dumfries foodbank opening 'broke rules' claims MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway SNP MP Richard Arkless has claimed David Mundell may have broken House of Commons rules by opening a foodbank in his constituency.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Secretary faced protests at the event in Dumfries last week.
Mr Arkless has complained to the Speaker and Cabinet Office about the actions of the Conservative MP for the neighbouring constituency.
However, a spokesman for Mr Mundell said he had complied with rules and notified him of the engagement.
Mr Arkless said he believed the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale may have broken the ministerial code in relation to accepted behaviour of MPs.
He said House of Commons speakers had repeatedly instructed that MPs intending to perform a public engagement in another member's constituency should inform them and "proper notice" should be given.
He said the only notification he had received was a "panicky" email one hour before the event.
He claimed it was a "clear breach" of House of Commons rules and potentially the ministerial code.
A spokesman for Mr Mundell said he had complied with the regulations.
"David made the visit as a constituency MP to a shared facility covering both constituencies," he said.
"He fully complied with the House of Commons rules by formally notifying neighbouring MP Richard Arkless of the engagement in his constituency.
"If Mr Arkless is claiming he still wasn't aware, he must have been the only person in Scotland who didn't know David was attending the event."
