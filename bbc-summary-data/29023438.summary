[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adam Lyth and Adil Rashid shared a new sixth-wicket record stand for Yorkshire as they piled up 610-6 before declaring on day three against Lancashire.

The pair put on 296 at Old Trafford before opening batsman Lyth was caught at mid-on for a career-best 251.
Stephen Parry took 3-109 but Lancashire continued to toil as Rashid made 159 not out before the declaration.
Trailing by 332, the Red Rose county soon lost Luis Reece, but were 144-2 at stumps, with Usman Khawaja 69 not out.
Resuming on 396-5 at the start of play, Yorkshire were in no mood to waste their opportunity to build a big first-innings lead and Lyth reached 200 by sweeping Simon Kerrigan for four.
Rashid's second century of the summer - and ninth of his career - followed off 169 balls and he also passed 5,000 first-class runs as they batted through the entire morning session, adding 130 to the total.
Left-hander Lyth finally departed following the interval, clipping a catch to Kerrigan off fellow spinner Parry, having batted for just 11 minutes short of 10 hours and hitting a six and 22 fours.
Skipper Andrew Gale allowed Rashid to complete his 150 before calling a halt and Yorkshire stuck immediately as former England seamer Ryan Sidebottom knocked back Reece's off stump in the seventh over.
Paul Horton and Usman Khawaja saw off the new ball and added 81 for the second wicket before Horton gave a return catch to leg-spinner Rashid when one short of a half century.
But that was Yorkshire's final success of the day as Khawaja passed fifty for the fourth time this summer as he and Ashwell Prince (18 not out) put on 81 before the close.
Lancashire vice-captain Paul Horton:
"We've given ourselves a fighting chance of saving the game. We're desperately trying to stay in the division, so we've got to fight for everything.
"We are disappointed with our first innings, it's put us behind in the game. It's going to take a few people to stand up, but it's a very good pitch to bat on.
"We batted poorly in the first innings, so hopefully we can address that, bat well in the second innings for three sessions and save the game."
Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth:
"The way I've played this season, if I got the call (from England) now, I think I'd be ready to step in.
"I've got to wait until I get that phone call, but what I've got to do is keep scoring runs. I won't get too carried away with where I am at the moment.
"There's two more big games in the season and a win tomorrow would be great for us.
"We're in a great position, there's not much for seam bowlers out there, but there's quite a bit for spin bowling."
