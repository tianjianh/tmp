The pensioner, who is in his 70s, was stabbed and beaten in his house at Clogharevan Park, Bessbrook, on Monday.
Police believe the gang may have used a hook to stab the victim. For days, he was critically ill but is now stable.
The arrested pair - a 25-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man - were released on  bail pending further inquiries.
They had been detained in Newry, County Down, on Friday.
The pensioner was beaten and stabbed as he lay in his bed during the early hours of Monday morning.
He was initially taken to Daisy Hill Hospital, Newry, and was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, in a critical condition.
On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Belfast Health Trust said the pensioner was now in a stable condition in hospital.
