Words from former Labour Party leader Michael Foot have appeared on a pavement next to a memorial to him that was daubed with swastikas.

The words were written in chalk after the graffiti on the memorial near where Mr Foot lived in Plymouth was removed.
Some of the words read: "We are here to provide for all those who are weaker and hungrier, more battered and crippled than ourselves..."
The graffiti is being investigated by Devon and Cornwall Police.

The memorial, near Mr Foot's family home in Freedom Fields, was found daubed with swastikas and references to the British National Party and English Defence League on Sunday.
Plymouth Labour councillor Chaz Singh welcomed the "positive" message of the mystery pavement artist.
"It touches you when you have a response like that," he said.
"Plymouth is a beautiful city to live in and the minds of a few should not stop us from being who we are."
The words were later cleaned from the pavement by the city council.
In response, Mr Singh said: "It was such a positive message, I can't understand how anyone in their right mind would have sanctioned removing it."
Councillor Dave Downie, cabinet member for safer and stronger communities, said the street services team were "aware of the sensitivity of the site" but they had to remove the writing "as it is technically still graffiti".
