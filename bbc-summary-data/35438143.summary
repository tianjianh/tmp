A man has been charged in connection with the death of Martin Hamilton, whose remains were found in a wood in West Lothian in December.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the 51-year-old man would appear at Livingston Sheriff Court on Monday.
Hamilton, from Glasgow, was previously one of Scotland's most wanted men.
He was released from prison in September 2014 but went missing in April last year. His body was found near West Calder on 17 December.
Det Supt Kenny Graham, from Police Scotland's major investigation team, said the investigation into Mr Hamilton's death was still ongoing in West Calder and nearby Blackburn.
He added: "Following this arrest we will be revisiting a number of people we have spoken to. We are also keen to hear from anyone else who may have information which may assist but who have not felt able to come forward before.
"We still have searches to conduct near the Five Sisters Business Park, as well as forensic work and other local inquiries in Blackburn, and this will be in conjunction with local officers who remain on high-visibility patrol in the area.
"I'm pleased with the support we have received from the local community in Blackburn - as well as information which has assisted my investigation, we have seen great engagement on a range of matters."
Hamilton was nicknamed the Blackhill Butcher, after the Glasgow housing estate from which he operated.
He had been on the police's most-wanted list before he was jailed in 2000 over a string of charges including drug dealing, torture, abduction and sodomy.
