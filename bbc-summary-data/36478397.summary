Bolton Wanderers: Nigel Adkins & Steve Cotterill shortlisted for manager's job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigel Adkins and Steve Cotterill are the final two managers in the frame to take charge at Bolton Wanderers, reports BBC Radio Manchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wanderers have been without a permanent boss since Neil Lennon left in March.
Academy boss Jimmy Phillips, 50, took charge for the remainder of the season but could not prevent Bolton's relegation from the Championship to League One.
Bolton are expected to make a decision within the next few weeks.
Former Scunthorpe, Southampton and Reading boss Adkins, 51, was sacked by Sheffield United in May after missing out on the League One play-offs. He has won promotion from the third tier three times.
Cotterill, 51, was dismissed as Bristol City boss in January after leading them to the League One title and the Johnstone's Paint Trophy the previous season.
He has also managed Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Notts County, Burnley, Stoke, Cheltenham and Sligo Rovers.
