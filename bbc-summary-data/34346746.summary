Gordon Stanforth jailed for abusing boys in Motherwell area in 1970s

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted sex offender has been jailed for seven years for sexually assaulting two boys in the 1970s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gordon Stanforth, from Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, groomed the boys when he was a football coach.
The 66-year-old abused one boy between 1971 and 1975 and the other between 1975 and 1977 at various locations in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire.
Stanforth, who pleaded guilty to the abuse, was previously convicted of similar offences in 1974 and 2003.
Jailing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Boyd told Stanforth: "You have been convicted of sexually assaulting two young boys more than 40 years ago.
"The nature of the offences show that there was a large degree of planning and grooming involved. You targeted two vulnerable boys. These are serious offences."
The court heard how Stanforth's victims were "paralysed with fear" when he assaulted them.
He was brought to justice after both of them spoke to police about the abuse years later.
The court also heard that Stanforth was fined Â£150 in November 1974 for lewd, indecent and libidinous offences.
He was also jailed for two years in December 2003 for lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour.
