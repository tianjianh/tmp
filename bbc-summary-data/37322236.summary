A man has been jailed for 21 months for 10 incidents of indecent exposure in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Harvey, 50, approached women, usually as they walked alone, in the Grange, Buckstone and Oxgangs.
He was wearing women's tights and had a balaclava on his head each time he struck between April 2014 and June 2015.
Harvey was found guilty of various sexual offences and breaches of the peace at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Det Ch Insp Alwyn Bell, of Police Scotland, said: "David Harvey committed these crimes during the early hours of the morning, in relatively secluded streets, which aided him in avoiding being caught, but also added to the fear and distress he instilled in his victims.
"He went to significant lengths to conceal his identity, but thanks to the evidence provided by the women he targeted, and the painstaking investigation by the Public Protection Unit, he was ultimately brought to justice.
"His arrest, conviction and subsequent sentence reflects our commitment to removing those responsible for sexual crimes from our communities and ensuring they cannot inflict further harm on the public."
