Australia's Bureau of Meteorology had forecast a tropical storm north of Darwin to intensify into a cyclone on Tuesday.
Authorities said although conditions had improved, heavy rainfall was still likely to cause a flood risk to some communities.
It comes after a cyclone hit Australia two weeks ago, bringing flooding that killed at least six people.
Northern Territory authorities have warned people to avoid flooded roads.
"The system looks unlikely to reach cyclone intensity until it moves further west into the Timor Sea," said forecaster Adam Morgan.
If the weather system does intensify, it will be named Cyclone Frances.
