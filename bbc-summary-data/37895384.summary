[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first woman to be US attorney general, Janet Reno, has died at home in Miami from complications linked to Parkinson's disease, US media say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Reno, 78, was at the centre of several political crises while serving under President Bill Clinton between 1993 and 2001.
She was criticised for a deadly raid on the Branch Davidian cult compound in Waco, Texas after just weeks in office.
Sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers were killed during the raid.
Questions were asked afterwards about the legality of the FBI raid and why it was that so many people were killed.
Ms Reno survived the aftermath of the raid to become the longest-serving attorney-general in the 20th Century from 1993-2001 - and one of President Clinton's most trusted cabinet members.
She also continued to work despite being diagnosed in 1995 with Parkinson's disease, which caused trembling in both her arms.
After Waco, Ms Reno played a role in some of the more high-profile controversies and scandals that rocked  the Clinton administration, including:
Towards the end of her career in the spring of 2000, Ms Reno angered her hometown's Cuban-American community by authorising the armed seizure of a 5-year-old boy who was taken from his relatives' home in Miami to be returned to his father in Cuba.
Ms Reno -  a  self-described "awkward old maid" who was nearly 6ft 2in (1.8m) tall - will be remembered for her cautious but blunt style, on one occasion famously telling reporters: "I don't do spin."
Civil rights activist Rev Jesse Jackson tweeted  that Ms Reno was a "personal friend, trailblazer {and] justice seeker".
Her biographer, Paul Anderson, earlier described her as "outspoken, outrageous, absolutely indifferent to others' opinions... truly one of a kind".
Ms Reno also won accolades outside Washington for her plain-spoken manner and folksiness, the Washington Post reports, which included her preference for kayaking on the Potomac River to "hobnobbing on the political cocktail circuit".
She will also be remembered for her frequently recited childhood stories from the Everglades swamps of Florida with a mother who wrestled alligators, the newspaper reports, to a home which included a family of peacocks, all named Horace.
