The 34-year-old former Wigan Warriors back was contracted until the end of next year, but has decided to retire at the end of the current campaign.
The Australian-born Ireland international started at Parramatta Eels before switching to West Tigers.
He joined Wigan in 2006 and during his eight-season stay he won the Super League and Grand Final twice, as well as the Man of Steel award in 2010.
"I'm disappointed to see a so great a player, with so much class on and off the field, hanging up his boots," said Dragons head coach Laurent Frayssinous.
"As a team, it's an extra motivation to finish the season as high as possible to offer him the end he deserves."
