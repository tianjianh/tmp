[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 0-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil and Mansfield shared the spoils in League Two as they played out a goalless draw at Huish Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mansfield could have been down to ten men after just five minutes when goalkeeper Scott Shearer handled the ball outside the area.
Shearer rushed from his goal to close down Kevin Dawson and clearly used his hand to stop the midfielder's shot, yet after much deliberation referee Chris Sarginson only produced a yellow card.
Matty Dolan forced a sharp save from the resulting free-kick, which along with Ben Whiteman and Chris Hamilton efforts at the other end was one of only three shots on target in the first half.
Whiteman had the best chance yet to open the scoring on 55 minutes, his first shot producing a low save from Artur Krysiak and the second brilliantly blocked by Bevis Mugabi with the goalkeeper stranded.
The visitors applied the most pressure late on as Krysiak made another good block, but it ended in a goalless draw.
