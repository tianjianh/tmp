Political leaders' Christmas cards opt for different styles

All three main Westminster party leaders' Christmas cards are personal photos, but with different styles.

David and Samantha Cameron's card is formal, showing the smartly dressed couple in Downing Street, flanked by Chelsea Pensioners.
Labour leader Ed Miliband's choice is more casual, depicting him at the table making cards with his family.
Nick Clegg's card shows him and wife Miriam in a series of offbeat "passport-style" shots.
Like last year, Ed Miliband's card depicts him with his wife and children. He is at the kitchen table of his home in north London with wife, Justine and their sons, five-year-old Daniel and Samuel, who's four.
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam's card is photo-booth style, with the deputy prime minister donning a Santa hat.
It is the second year that the Cleggs have opted for a tongue-in-cheek approach. Last year, the couple's sons added extra features to their card using a computer app.
Politicians often use personal photos for their Christmas cards, but they can elicit a negative reaction.
This year's card from former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie was criticised by some on Twitter, with author Matthew Sweet describing it as "weird" and the New York magazine calling it "decidedly forced and creepy after 50 photo takes".
