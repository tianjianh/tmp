Talks held in Waen over anaerobic digestion food waste plant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Public consultation is being held over plans to turn a former Denbighshire abattoir site into a food recycling plant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councils for Denbighshire, Flintshire and Conwy want to use the site in Waen, Rhuallt, near St Asaph, to recycle 22,000 tonnes of food waste a year to produce electricity.
Planning permision has yet to be secured.
Meetings are being held in Waen Parish Hall on Friday and Saturday.
The council consortium first announced the Â£7.5m project last year.
Since then, a new preferred bidder, BiogenGreenfinch, has been announced after an initial prospective partner withdrew.
In March the company obtained permission to build and manage an anaerobic digestion plant at Llwyn Isaf, near Caernarfon, for Gwynedd council to process local-authority collected food waste.
Anaerobic digestion is the process of recycling food waste and agricultural waste into renewable fuel to generate electricity, heat and fertiliser for farmland.
Representatives of BiogenGreenfinch and Denbighshire council will explain the project and answer any questions.
The proposed plant will generate electricity for the national grid proviiding enough to power homes in St Asaph for a year.
It will treat food waste from local households and businesses, all of which could be sent to landfill, said the company.
Meetings are being held in Waen Parish Hall on Friday, 16:00-20:00 BST, and Saturday, 10:00-14:00 BST.
