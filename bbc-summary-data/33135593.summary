Residents fear their homes are under threat of flooding due to building work on a Pembrokeshire village flood plain.

Homeowners in St Dogmaels claim a small housing development is being built on a higher level than planning permitted.
They said the River Teifi would now flood towards their homes in severe weather and have called for the council to take action.
A Pembrokeshire council spokesman said the developer had accepted remedial works need to be carried out.
Residents set up St Dogmaels Environmental Action Group to work "constructively" with relevant agencies after serious flooding last November but feel more needs to be done.
Chairwoman Lenka Janiurek, 56, said the situation had become "much worse" since work began on the development, with people's homes and gardens flooded with water and sewage.
Member Jake Elster-Jones, 43, said: "We are sitting here waiting for the rain, wondering what's going to happen.
"It's clearly a very serious issue and there is good evidence that when it rains, it will be worse flooding than there's been before."
He added: "We are angry and worried about this and feel something needs to be done about it."
A Pembrokeshire council spokesman confirmed ground levels on the flood plain have been raised above the levels shown in the site's original plans.
The spokesman said a representative for the developer had accepted "remedial works were necessary" and the council was "awaiting written conformation" of a course of action.
Bell Designs, the developer's agent, declined to comment.
