Braintree Town 2-2 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley extended their unbeaten run to four matches with a draw against relegation-battling Braintree at Cressing Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts surged into a lead when a long throw caused havoc in the box and Reece Hall-Johnson converted from close range.
However, in a pulsating affair, Neil Smith's mid-table visitors levelled through Tobi Sho-Silva.
Bromley then took the lead when they broke away early in the second half and Lee Minshull headed them in front.
Back came Braintree, though, and Michael Cheek levelled again with a well-timed header at the back post.
Braintree were without defender George Elokobi, who has been recalled from his loan by parent club Colchester.
