Molly-Mae Wotherspoon's grandmother denies dog death charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The grandmother of a baby girl who was mauled to death by a banned breed of dog in Northamptonshire, has denied keeping an out-of-control animal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six-month-old Molly-Mae Wotherspoon died after a pit bull-type dog attacked her in Daventry on 3 October last year.
Susan Aucott, 55, of Northampton, pleaded not guilty to being in charge of a dangerously out-of-control dog, resulting in death.
She spoke only to confirm her name and plead at Northampton Crown Court.
Judge Rupert Mayo granted her bail.
The baby's mother, Claire Riley, 22, of West Cotton Close, Northampton, is charged with the same offence, but did not attend court for medical reasons.
She will next appear on 18 January.
A trial date has been fixed for 7 June, which will take place at Stafford Crown Court.
