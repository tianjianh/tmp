John Edwards, 61, was buried on Friday in Halifax and resurfaced on Monday.
He said he had "brought words of light from the grave" in a bid to reduce the number of addicts' funerals he has to attend.
The Walking Free charity founder works with suicidal addicts and their families.
Mr Edwards streamed his incarceration live via a smartphone and also was in contact on social media.
He said he had talked to "people all over the world".
He thanked his supporters and said he felt a bit "woozy" after his time confined to the 8ft long, 3.5ft high and 4ft wide (2.4m x 1m x 1.3m) coffin.
Mr Edwards said he was "looking forward to using a toilet and having a shower".
During his stay he received food and water through a pipe and a second pipe was connected to a caravan toilet.
He said he had been buried to help give hope to  people suffering addiction.
"It's an extreme thing to do, but so is suicide and drug addiction," he said before been buried.
"But extreme times demand extreme measures."
