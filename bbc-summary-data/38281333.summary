The black cockapoo called Sophie, belonging to a woman from Buckinghamshire, went missing from a pub in Bournemouth.
Police issued an image of a woman they want to speak to over the theft at the Moon in the Square pub in Exeter Road on 27 November.
Following the appeal officers tracked down Sophie in Poole.
"It's great to know that Sophie will be spending Christmas at home with her family," said PC Steve Lea, of Bournemouth police.
The dog was found outside Hamworthy Library on Blandford Road on Friday. She was identified by her micro-chip.
A Dorset Police spokesman said there had been many leads from the public.
PC Lea said: "I would like to pass on my thanks, along with those of the owner, to everyone who has contacted us about this case.
"The public's response to my appeal has been overwhelming and all the help we have received is very much appreciated.
"Without the public's help it would not have been possible to reunite the dog with its owner."
