America's Cup 2017: Watch Ainslie's America's Cup Quest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Ainslie's Land Rover BAR team will continue their bid to win the 35th America's Cup when they race in the qualifying stages of this year's event from 26 May in Bermuda.

The six-man team, attempting to become the first British crew to win the America's Cup in its 166-year history, will face boats from France, Sweden, New Zealand, Japan and defending champions United States.
Ainslie, 40, steered his Portsmouth-based team to victory in the 2015-16 America's Cup World Series, a result which earned two points for the qualifying series.
Each team will race each other twice in the qualifiers, scoring one point per win, with the top four teams progressing to the challenger round.
The top four challengers are split into two best-of-five semi-finals from 4 June, with the winners competing in the final for the right to take on holders Oracle Team USA in the actual America's Cup matches.
The first to seven points wins the America's Cup, or the Auld Mug as the trophy is known, with a possible 13 races to be sailed on 17-18 and 24-27 June.
The America's Cup is the oldest competition in international sport and was first raced in 1851 around the Isle of Wight.
America's Cup Class boats are 15-metre long catamarans and feature hydrofoil technology which enables them to skim over the water at speeds of about 50mph.
The power is supplied by the crew "grinding" winches, or in the case of the New Zealand team by onboard cycles.
