X-Files TV return divides critics

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The return of cult TV sci-fi series The X-Files has been met with a mixed reaction from critics.

The first episode, which was broadcast on Fox in the US on Sunday, reunites Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully and David Duchovny as Fox Mulder after they were last seen on TV in 2002.
The pair are again embroiled in an investigation of alien abduction.
Critics were curious to see a return, but concluded it was "underwhelming" or "generous to its fanbase".
The new six-part series, which will run in the US before being shown in the UK on Channel 5 next month, has been written by the original show's creator, Chris Carter, who reunites the investigators of the paranormal in a familiar tale of UFOs and government conspiracy theories.
Dominic Patten of Deadline seemed largely to come away happy, saying what had been dubbed as an "event series" after an absence of 14 years, planted "a flag in America 2016 even as it wonderfully resurrects much of what made it such pivotal TV back during Bill Clinton's presidency".
He added: "Strikingly serious and silly at the same time, the six episodes are actually a lot like the original X-Files - you either go with it or you don't. And if you want to believe (to paraphrase the poster Duchovy's Fox Mulder had up in the duo's FBI HQ basement office in the original series), this X-Files is well worth opening up."
But Ken Tucker, TV critic from Yahoo, was lukewarm saying: "The new X-Files hour is fine for what it is, but it lacks the kick of minty-freshness, in favour of the musty tang of mythology. It's a mythology excavated and renovated to do 2016 work its mostly 20th Century original apparatus wasn't designed to sustain."
Tucker generally lamented the show's return, saying it was a casualty of a modern-day obsession with nostalgia.
"Why can't we leave well enough alone, re-watch the episodes we love and let the phenomenon rest? Because nostalgia is powerful; it summons up rich emotions and memories, but it's not often the fuel for vital creativity," he said.
"'We've moved on with our lives', Scully says early on in the hour. Perhaps the audience for the new episodes will end up feeling the same."
It is a view shared by Tim Goodman of the Hollywood Reporter, who was given a preview earlier this month: "Why the need to revisit this show now? Nostalgia?
"What we're left with is a very underwhelming hour that will force even die hard fans (and yes, I was one of them) to consider whether pushing onward is really worth the time."
Jonathan Bernstein in The Daily Telegraph agreed that racking up old TV ground was a debatable choice by Fox, and maybe not the wisest.
"Reminding audiences of decades-old disappointment probably wasn't the sort of nostalgia that was intended when the notion of reviving The X-Files as a 'six hour-event' was conceived, but, sadly, that's the impression left by this first episode."
However, what most seemed able to agree on was the onscreen partnership of Anderson and Duchovny holding the same charisma that contributed much to the original show's success.
"On a positive note, the years have not lessened the chemistry between David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson," Bernstein said.
The second show of the series is set to go out on Fox on Monday night, but after the first episode the overall split conclusion was summed up by Jeff Jenson of Entertainment Weekly.
"Revivals, reboots, and retreads of pop phenoms rarely pulse with the magic of their original incarnation at their original moment," he said.
"I want to believe The X-Files can be the rare example of pop recycling that succeeds by being something other than blast-from-the-past nostalgia, producing punch-drunk love giddiness.
"A return to transcendence? Too much to ask. Above-average artfulness? That's a reasonable expectation... It's possible that four weeks from now, we might be saying that this mini-series succeeded more than it failed."
