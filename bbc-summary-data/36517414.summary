The show, which won 11 Tony Awards on Sunday, will open at the Victoria Palace Theatre in October 2017.
With a score that blends hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap and R&B, Hamilton tells the story of America's birth and founding father Alexander Hamilton.
"The support Hamilton has received from our British fans has been incredible," Lin-Manuel Miranda said.
"I have been reminded of their love, which is just as our King George would want it to be! I'm thrilled the show will be shared with UK audiences starting in the fall of 2017 at the beautiful Victoria Palace Theatre."
The theatre, owned by stage impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh, is currently undergoing an extensive multi-million pound refurbishment.
Sir Cameron said: "Just occasionally in life the stars align as they have now, and I have the perfect theatre available for one of the most brilliant, original and entertaining musicals I have ever seen.
"The moment I saw Lin-Manuel's remarkable Hamilton I knew that this was a musical with a phenomenal story and score which will be performed somewhere in the world as long as people want to go to the theatre."
Hamilton's 11 Tonys included three acting prizes and awards for best musical, actor, director, choreography, score and book.
It also won the Pulitzer Prize for drama earlier this year.
The show, currently in New York at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, has been hailed as "a landmark American musical", garnering celebrity fans including Star Wars director JJ Abrams, Jay Z and President Obama.
It is based on Ron Chernow's biography of Hamilton, an immigrant from the West Indies who became George Washington's right-hand man during the American War of Independence and was the new nation's first treasury secretary.
Tickets for the London run will go on sale in November, with registration for priority booking open now.
