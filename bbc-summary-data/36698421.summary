Aiden Webb, 22, from Norwich, set off to climb Fansipan mountain on 3 June.
He died after slipping down a waterfall and his body was found six days after he set off.
His father Trever Webb said he and mother Simone could only "proceed" by returning to thank those who helped find him.
Aiden Webb, an experienced climber, planned to conquer the 3,100m (10,300ft) high mountain alone in a day.
But he died just over 24 hours later as he tried to find his way back to safety after being forced off the main trail by a landslide.
On a Facebook memorial page set up in his son's name, Mr Webb wrote: "We are able to proceed at this moment only by the thought of returning to Sapa, to offer support in any way to the people who helped to find you, son, for us.
"We would want you to be as proud of us as we are of you, Aiden."
Mr Webb had gone to Vietnam with his girlfriend Bluebell Baughan, 24, of White Notley, Essex.
She was in contact with him by phone from the nearby town of Sapa when Mr Webb told her he had fallen into a ravine and had cut his arm open on a rock, hurt his knee and lost his way.
His phone stopped working shortly after 06:15 when he agreed Miss Baughan should raise the alarm.
Vietnamese TV said about 150 people were involved in the search for Mr Webb and a specialist team was brought in.
Investigations showed Mr Webb died on impact after falling 18m (60ft) into a shallow pool at about 07:00 on 4 June.
His parents plan to return to Vietnam at Christmas.
