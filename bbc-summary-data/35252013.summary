[SN]TITLE[SN]
July start for Edinburgh's 20mph speed limit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first stage of a plan to introduce 20mph (32km/h) speed limits across roads in Edinburgh will begin in July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phase one of the Â£2.2m project covers much of the city centre, from Queen Street to the Meadows.
The limit, which will eventually cover 80% of the capital's roads, was approved by councillors last year.
The roll out will be complete by 2018. The scheme is designed to improve safety and encourage more people to walk or cycle.
Despite the change, speed limits on key arterial routes into the city will remain at 30 or 40mph.
About 50% of the city's roads are already 20mph.
Phase two of the project, in the north of the city, is due to begin in October.
Phase three is to start in February 2017, then phase four in June 2017, phase five in October 2017 and phase six in February 2018.
A report about the objections to the project are going to the transport and environment committee on Tuesday. It shows there were only 54 objections lodged.
The report recommends councillors to "set aside" the objections and approve the project.
Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh city council's transport convener, said: "Introducing 20mph in residential streets, shopping areas and the city centre will undoubtedly improve safety and that a relatively low number of people objected during the formal consultation demonstrates the public's acceptance of and, indeed, support for 20mph limits.
"What's more, we want to strike a balance between all road users and for this reason a number of key, arterial routes will be maintained at 30 and 40mph.
"We are now ready to take a bold step towards becoming a 20mph city, a change that is set to improve safety and enhance the environment in streets all over Edinburgh.
"Understandably, lowering speed limits will involve a culture change for the whole city, but we're encouraged by the high level of support received throughout the consultation process."
