The officer left his own car on double yellows while issuing a ticket to a vehicle left in a disabled bay in Arthur Street in Stockport, the Manchester Evening News reports.
Stockport Council said he should not have parked there earlier this week.
It has identified the warden and "will ensure the appropriate action is taken to avoid a repetition".
A Stockport Council spokesperson said the incident involved the Civil Enforcement Officer (CEO) "issuing a penalty charge notice to a vehicle parked in a disabled bay without displaying a blue badges.
"However, CEOs should not park on double yellow lines to issue penalty charge notices.
"We have identified the CEO involved in the incident and will ensure the appropriate action is taken to avoid a repetition."
