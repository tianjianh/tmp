A housing association is facing a planning hurdle after building 55 new homes in the wrong place.

Homes on Yorkshire Housing's Hob Stone site were built out of position by as little as 11cm, reports The York Press.
The association must now apply for a Variation to a Condition order as the Acomb development does not match the plans approved by City of York Council.
Yorkshire Housing said it was still working to ensure new residents could move in as soon as possible.
Properties on the site have been built between 11cm and 75cm out of place and the location of an access road also varies from the agreed plans.
Of the 55 homes, 14 have been sold and 41 rented.
A spokeswoman for Yorkshire Housing said the discrepancies were spotted during a review of the site by contractors.
She said a Variation to a Condition application was submitted last month but advised that it could take up to 13 weeks for the council to process.
"This is the first time an issue like this has come to light on one of our schemes, we are investigating how this has happened," she said.
"Yorkshire Housing employ a building contractor to execute the scheme in accordance with planning permissions.
"We are keeping customers who are renting or buying the affected homes up-to-date with progress and will do as much as possible to make sure that people can move into the homes they are renting or buying as soon as possible."
A City of York Council spokesman said: "Once all necessary detail has been provided and we have the full context of the plans we can proceed."
