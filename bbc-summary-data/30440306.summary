Red Cross worker Khuram Shaikh, 32, from Rochdale, was shot and stabbed at a hotel while on holiday on Christmas Day in 2011.
He was killed when he tried to break up a fight.
The suite in the Brian Blatchford building is dedicated to the former prosthetics and orthotics student.
Professor Sue Braid, head of Health Sciences at University of Salford, said: "Khuram dedicated his life to helping people in the most deprived parts of the world, using the skills he learned here in Salford to fit prosthetic limbs to people affected by conflict.
"This work gave so many people a new lease of life.
"This new clinic, named in Khuram's memory, will give future students the skills to continue his legacy and is a fitting tribute to a much missed university alumnus."
Sri Lankan politician Sampath Vidanapathirana was jailed for 20 years for killing Mr Shaikh in July.
Lahiru Kelum, U. Sama Deshapriya and Praneeth Chathuranga were also convicted of Mr Shaikh's killing.
