More then 500 scouts, cubs and beavers took part in the event on Weston-super-Mare beach in Somerset.
The record attempt was organised by the Axe District Cubs to mark 100 years of Cub Scouts.
The current world record of 352 was set by Keep Wales Tidy (UK) in Pembrokeshire last summer.
Michelle Syms, assistant cub leader at 1st Kewstoke Cubs in Weston-super-Mare, said to qualify every single sand angel had "to be perfect".
"Essentially you lie down and make the sand angel and then we had to walk around and help each of them up to their feet so they didn't walk on them or stand on anyone else's," she said.
"If you put your hand in it when you get up or walk through it, then your angel is disqualified."
Following a practice run on Thursday, more than 500 young people headed to Weston beach on Friday evening to leave their mark.
"It was absolutely fantastic and the kids loved it," Ms Syms said.
"A lot of the six-year-olds walked through their angels but I'm sure we'll do it - we've got 200 to play with and all we need is 353."
They are waiting to hear from Guinness World Records to find out if their attempt was successful.
