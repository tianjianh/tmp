Passengers threw water over the male rail worker and female commuter after the attack on an overground service near South Tottenham station on Wednesday.
British Transport Police (BTP) said officers were hunting for suspects.
The type of substance used in the attack has yet to be identified. Police said it caused eye irritation.
A BTP spokesman said: "This did not result in any serious injuries although both the male staff member and the female passenger were taken to a local hospital as a precautionary measure and have since been released."
