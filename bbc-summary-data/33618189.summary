Police are hunting for Ryan Byrne, 34, who was released in error from Wandsworth Prison.
The Prison Service informed the Met Police Byrne had been released on Friday, and said an investigation had been launched.
A spokesperson said: "Releases in error are very rare but regrettable occurrences.
"The number of incidents have fallen significantly in recent years with figures down by a quarter compared to 2009/10, but every incident is taken extremely seriously and we are not complacent.
"The recapture of this prisoner is now a matter for the police."
Byrne was sentenced in 2008 to a total of nine years' imprisonment for burglary, robbery and theft.
Officers in Hammersmith and Fulham, west London, have appealed for anyone with information about Byrne's whereabouts to get in touch.
Byrne is described as white and of medium build, with blue eyes and a goatee beard.
