Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga has ruled himself out of the remainder of the World Twenty20 after failing to recover from a knee injury.

Malinga, 32, missed Thursday's win over Afghanistan and will return home.
"He has informed the manager that he can't continue playing," Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Mohan de Silva told BBC Sinhala.
"We received reports he still feels pain while bowling in the nets so he is not in a position to continue playing."
Malinga has been replaced by 26-year-old leg-spinner Jefferey Vandasay, who was the original squad but dropped the day before they left for India.
Malinga, fourth on the all-time list of T20 international wicket-takers, was named captain midway through Sri Lanka's victorious World T20 campaign in 2014, but stood down just before this year's tournament in India and was replaced by Angelo Mathews.
Sri Lanka's next match is against West Indies on Sunday.
