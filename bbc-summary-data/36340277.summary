Wallaby in a Kangoo Matilda stuns breakdown driver

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The boss of a zoological park was left in need of a jump-start when his car broke down while transporting a baby red-necked wallaby.

Zachary Hollinshead and five-month-old marsupial Matilda were "stranded in the middle of nowhere" when his aptly-named Renault Kangoo came to a halt.
AA patrolman Andy Jones said he thought Mr Hollinshead was joking when he told him about the unusual passenger.
The pair were soon out back on the road after Mr Jones fixed the ignition.
Mr Hollinshead said he had been carrying a mini menagerie when he broke down, which included a young owl and a Binturong - or "bearcat" - which were collected by fellow zookeepers before the AA arrived.

He said Matilda went with him or zookeepers "everywhere at the moment" as she was being hand-reared after her mother became ill.
Recovery worker Mr Jones said he was "a bit nervous" when he first arrived on the scene in Pattingham, Staffordshire.
But he said Matilda was "very tame" and obediently stayed put.
"I was concerned about it jumping off the seat, but the AA member assured me it wouldn't as it stays close to him. I held it and stroked it," he said.
The AA said it made a temporary repair to the ignition system, so Mr Hollinshead could carry on to work at the Wild Encounters zoological park in Bobbington, near Wolverhampton.
Mr Hollinshead, from Shifnal, added: "She's still in her pouch at the moment, it replicates what mum hasâ€¦ so she probably wouldn't know where she was.
"She's used to the movement of us picking up the pouch as she would mum jumping around in the wild.
"She's certainly not fazed and she comes home with us every night and back every morning, so she's quite used to flying around the Staffordshire countryside."
