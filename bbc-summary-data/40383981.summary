The national event in Liverpool, attended by Prime Minister Theresa May and Prince Edward, saw a Red Arrows flypast and a parade to the waterfront.
Mrs May said that armed forces are more relevant than ever, "playing a vital role" after the Manchester attack.
The day was billed as a chance for people to show their support for those connected with the armed forces.
As well as those currently serving, the event honours veterans, reservists, cadets, families and charities.
Parades, military displays, gun salutes and Typhoon and Red Arrows flypasts have been some of the highlights.
The Royal Navy's type-23 frigate HMS Iron Duke was docked in Liverpool for the celebrations. A series of displays along Pier head also took place featuring planes, helicopters, tanks and marching bands.
Mrs May praised the "tremendous job that the armed forces do for us here at home and across the world, helping to keep us safe".
She said that armed forces "provided visible reassurance to our communities" when they were deployed on the streets after the UK terror threat level was raised to critical.
Troops were deployed after 22 people were killed by suicide bomber Salman Abedi at the Manchester Arena on 22 May.
The parade in Liverpool comprised about 100 personnel from each of the services, plus bands, veterans and about 300 cadets.
Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said there are some 10,000 service men and women who are working around the globe on operations or in British bases.
"They've been helping to deal with terrorism, they've been helping to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean, they've been on Nato deployments, they've been peacekeeping in South Sudan.
"All of that keeps us safer here at home. They're out of our sight but they should never be out of mind," he said.
