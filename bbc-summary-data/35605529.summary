Bombardier suspends apprentice scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The aerospace company, Bombardier, is suspending recruitment of new apprentices as part of cost cutting plans.

It comes a day after it announced more than 1,000 job losses.
The company usually takes on about 40 apprentices every year for a four year training programme.
The scheme was assessed by the Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) last year as "very good" with some "outstanding" elements.
The firm said it will "support existing apprentices to complete their training and gain relevant qualifications".
At the time of the ETI inspection the firm had 140 apprentices, 20 of whom were on the pilot higher level programme.
Over the four year scheme apprentices work towards NVQs in aircraft fitting or engineering.
First Minister Arlene Foster has said she will do what she can to soften the blow of the job losses.
Meanwhile, a company which is one of Bombardier's biggest local parts suppliers says its saddened by the cuts.
However, Raymond Semple of Moyola Precision Engineeering, said he was confident about its own future, despite Bombardier's troubles.
"It's a major thing losing 1,000 jobs. Those people trying to get employment, it's not going to be all that easy for them," he said.
"For us as a company, we're quite confident we'll still be going forward. It's a global business here."
