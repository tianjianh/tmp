The British star famous for playing Nelson Mandela and starring in The Wire, is reportedly being considered for the next 007.
The Daily Beast is reporting there was leaked email from Amy Pascal, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment motion pictures group.
It is reported the contents said: "Idris should be the next Bond.
Pascal was thought to be emailing Elizabeth Cantillon, the former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures - which distributes the Bond franchise.
There is no confirmation from Idris Elba or from Sony Pictures that the actor will take over to be the next 007.
The 42-year-old has previously said he would play Bond.
During a Reddit AMA in September he responded to a fan's question of whether he'd be willing to take the role, writing: "Yes, if it was offered to me, absolutely."
Daniel Craig, who is currently filming his fourth appearance as Bond in new release Spectre, is signed on to do one more film.
"I've been trying to get out of this from the very moment I got into it. But they won't let me go, and I've agreed to do a couple more," he told Rolling Stone two years ago.
Spectre is due for release in November next year.
