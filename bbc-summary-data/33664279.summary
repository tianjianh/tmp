The Friesians, aged 16 months, were found dead in Dolwen, near Old Colwyn, on Friday after eating clippings from yew and leylandii trees.
Sgt Rob Taylor, of the rural crime team, said a post-mortem examination showed plant toxins were to blame.
He said the force was investigating the "atrocious" act of fly-tipping.
"I'm appalled that the selfish action of someone dumping their waste has killed three animals. We are investigating and will analyse CCTV," he added.
He urged anyone with information to call 101.
