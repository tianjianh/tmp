Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre slammed by inspectors

Staff looking after young offenders at a detention centre in Northamptonshire were under the influence of drugs, an Ofsted report has said.

The findings follow an inspection at the G4S-run Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre near Rugby.
Inspectors rated the unit "inadequate"- the lowest grading - and said young people suffered degrading treatment.
G4S said what had happened there was "completely unacceptable" but claimed it took swift action at the time.
The training centre, which opened in 1999, houses up to 87 boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18.
The unannounced joint Ofsted, HM Inspectorate of Prisons and Care Quality Commission inspection of the unit was carried out in February.
Inspectors said: "Poor staff behaviour has led to some young people being subject to degrading treatment, racist comments, and being cared for by staff who were under the influence of illegal drugs."
The report also found delays in children receiving essential medical diagnosis and treatment, and said on one occasion, a young person did not receive treatment for a fracture for about 15 hours.
Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: "This is the worst report on a prison I have ever seen because it is a catalogue of abusive practices that have been inflicted on young children who have no escape.
"These child jails run for profit are secretive and should never have been set up in the first place. Rainsbrook should be closed immediately. No child is safe in this jail."
A G4S spokesman accepted the report was "extremely disappointing".
However, he said it was the first time in 16 years the centre had been found by any inspecting body to be less than "good" or "outstanding".
