Belfast planning: Views sought on Linen Quarter regeneration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackstaff Square in the centre of Belfast could be revitalised in new plans for the historic Linen Quarter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The area bridges the planned transport hub on Great Victoria Street and nearby hotel developments.
The council has said it could become a pleasant, family friendly area and is asking people what they think of the plan in a public consultation exercise.
The design includes a central or green space that could be used as a public meeting area or to hold outdoor events.
The Linen Quarter lies to the south of Belfast City Hall and includes a number of the city's key business and public sector headquarters, as well as existing and planned hotel developments.
It includes Bedford Street, Linenhall Street, Adelaide Street, Alfred Street and Ormeau Avenue.
An exhibition showing how the Linen Quarter could look in the future is currently on display at the Ulster Hall.
The consultation runs until next month.
