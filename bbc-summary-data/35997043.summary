A paedophile has been branded the "living embodiment of every parent's worst nightmare" after grabbing a girl of 11 off the street and raping her.

Paul Ripley, 53, abducted the girl as she walked home in Ellesmere Port, Chester Crown Court heard.
He bundled her into his car and drove her hundreds of miles north to a field where he raped her twice.
Jailing him for ten years, Judge Nicholas Woodward told him he had acted "for your own sexual gratification".
The girl, who was left alone near Darlington, flagged down a taxi driver, saying: "I don't know where I am. I've been raped."
Police were quickly able to trace Ripley's car as he drove back south to Cheshire, arresting him on the M6 in Lancashire after he crashed into a police car within hours of the attack.
He told officers: "It doesn't matter, I've done it all."
Ripley had pleaded guilty to rape, kidnap and dangerous driving and will be under supervision for 24 years in total.
Judge Woodward said: "You are the living embodiment of every parent's worst nightmare."
In a statement to the court, the girl's mother said: "I can only imagine what my daughter went through that night, the pain, confusion, panic and fear.
"What that man did to her that night has changed her and me forever.
"I can't and never will understand what drives a human being to do what he did."
