The fare increase only applies to cash journeys.  The price for people using a pre-paid Avanchi card depends on the journey length.
People using an Avanchi card for longer journeys will see a cut from £1.80 to £1.60 but for shorter journeys it will rise from £1.20 to £1.30.
The cash fare will be £2 for longer journeys and £1.50 for shorter routes.
Kevin Hart, general manager of LibertyBus, said they planned to introduce a single island-wide fare for pre-pay users.
"The results of the independent LibertyBus customer satisfaction survey in 2014 and lots of customer feedback indicated that there is a demand for one flat fare Island-wide," he said.
"As the first step towards this goal, we have changed the fare structure on the Avanchi Card Pay-as-you-go".
