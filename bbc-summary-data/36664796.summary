Notts County have signed midfielder Michael O'Connor on a two-year deal, making him the third player to move to Meadow Lane from Port Vale this summer.

O'Connor, 28, links up with ex-Vale team-mates Carl Dickinson and Richard Duffy at Notts, all of whom were to be out of contract this week.
The Northern Ireland international had been at Vale Park since July 2014, scoring 12 goals in 76 games.
"It's going to be exciting," O'Connor told the club website.
"I've signed a two year deal and in that time I don't just want to get the club into League One, I want to get them into the Championship."
The former Crewe, Lincoln, Scunthorpe and Rotherham player lives in Lincolnshire and had previously said he would consider a move closer to home.
The Magpies finished 17th in League Two last season, having gone through four different caretaker or permanent managers, but appointed Oldham boss John Sheridan this summer.
Sheridan had already signed five players before completing the O'Connor signing, following the lifting of the transfer embargo last month.
