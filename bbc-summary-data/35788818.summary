Aldershot Gurkha regiment celebrates borough freedom

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 150 Gurkha soldiers have marched through Aldershot in Hampshire to celebrate receiving the Freedom of the Borough of Rushmoor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Troops of 10 The Queen's Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment began their parade at Princes Hall.
Road closures were in place as members marched along Grosvenor Road, Victoria Road, Station Road, High Street and Princes Way.
The parade was led by the Brigade of Gurkhas Band.
It also included the regimental pipes and drums.
Mayor of Rushmoor Councillor Martin Tennant, who presented the Freedom Scroll to the regiment, said: "Rushmoor is extremely proud of the long historic link with the Gurkhas as they have made their home in Aldershot.
"They continue to serve the British Army and the local community with tremendous distinction."
The decision to award the Freedom of the Borough to the Gurkhas was approved by Rushmoor Borough Council at an extraordinary general meeting in July last year, when councillors unanimously backed a motion conferring the honour on the regiment for their "bravery and courage" and for its contribution to the life of the community.
It is the highest accolade a council can give and marks the 200th anniversary of the Brigade of Gurkhas.
During its time in Aldershot, the regiment has completed two operational tours of Iraq and two of Afghanistan.
