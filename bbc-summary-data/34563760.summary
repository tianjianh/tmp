The nine-day festival, which celebrates Gaelic culture, officially ended on Saturday with a massed choir procession through the town.
Organisers said an estimated 8,000 people from across the UK and abroad attended the festival.
It featured 200 competitions, including traditional singing, Highland dancing, literature and piping.
John Morrison, chief executive of organisers An Comunn Gaidhealach, said: "The feedback from those who attended and competed has been excellent.
"I'm very proud as to how much people have enjoyed this year's Mod. We've seen a lot of new faces competing this year, and we hope they'll be joining us in the Western Isles next year."
The 2016 Mod will be mainly based in Stornoway next October.
The gathering was first held Oban in 1892.
