Man charged with assaulting Willie Frazer falls down courthouse stairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ambulance was called to Armagh courthouse after a man accused of assaulting victims campaigner Willie Frazer fell down a flight of stairs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frank McGirr, 60, from Shanliss Road, Stewartstown, is accused of assaulting Mr Frazer and making a threat to kill him.
The charges arose from an incident at Mr Frazer's home last month.
Frank McGirr arrived at the city's magistrates court on Tuesday leaning heavily on a walking stick.
He appeared only briefly in the dock, confirming his name and date of birth before having the two charges put to him.
Afterwards, he was required to sign for alterations to his bail conditions.
This involved him going down a flight of stairs from the dock to the cells area.
The district judge told a defence solicitor that his client could take another route if he wished.
Mr McGirr, however, began to descend the staircase.
He was just out of sight of the main court room when he apparently slipped and fell to the bottom of the stairs with a loud crash.
There was an audible gasp in the courtroom and several prison officers ran to his assistance.
An ambulance was called as Mr McGirr lay motionless at the bottom of the stairs.
It is understood he suffered cuts and bruises, but was not seriously injured.
The court's business was then transferred to another courtroom while paramedics treated Mr McGirr.
