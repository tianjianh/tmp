Wigan Warriors kept up their winning start to the season as Josh Charnley's late try gave them victory over a dogged Huddersfield Giants side.

Jermaine McGillvary's try gave the hosts a first-half lead, but after the break Wigan's Liam Farrell went over.
The Warriors went ahead for the first time when Dom Manfredi crossed, but were pegged back by Jamie Foster's try.
Jamie Ellis kicked a goal and a drop goal but Charnley's converted try turned the game on its head at the end.
Wigan had begun their Super League campaign with a 12-6 win over Catalans Dragons last week.
Despite missing several key personnel from last week's defeat by St Helens, including captain Danny Brough and prop Eorl Crabtree, the Giants turned in a positive display in their second defeat of the campaign.
McGillvary scored on his 150th Giants appearance, assisted by the impressive Ellis who led his side in the absence of Brough, while Foster's debut was also marked by a score.
However Wigan's ability to grind out a result, with their own injury concerns, was shown by a second-half response even when the game looked lost following Ellis' late drop-goal.
Charnley's defensive work was backed up by the crucial try to send the Warriors into next week's World Club Series against Brisbane Broncos in good spirits.
Huddersfield head coach Paul Anderson:
"It's a feeling of disappointment. Our commitment and effort was outstanding.
"What you saw is the future of the club. They stood up real well and we know now that we have blokes out there no matter how old they are that can do a job for us.
"We should have won that game. When we went 12-6 down, we could easily have thrown the towel in but that's not us."
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane:
"I'm just glad to get the two points, that's what we came to get. I'm happy to be sat here with four points and we've not played well.
"It's a decent start for us but we understand we need to improve for next week. We played ugly and won.
"Some of our skill was poor. They controlled the ball and they were allowed to do that, which is disappointing. We had a spell when our completions were about 50% which is not us."
