Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for Derek McInnes' side.
Didn't do too much wrong, couldn't do anything about the goals. Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst.
In second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game.
In team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor.
Probably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club
Wasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of.
Not the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them.
An opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind.
Largely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of.
Celtic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better.
Whenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat.
Not the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that.
Won a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor.
Expect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything.
Barely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down.
Had that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit.
Fairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively.
Was probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout.
Strong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure.
Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target.
Man of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example.
Solid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position.
Always capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal.
Scored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did.
Probably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be.
Probably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well.
Did what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield.
Another who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic.
Didn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong.
Pat Bonner and Willie Miller were talking to BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson.
