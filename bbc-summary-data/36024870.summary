Coetzee, 52, coached Stormers and Western Province in the Super 14, before a brief stint with Japanese side Kobe Steel Kobelco Steelers.
He succeeds Heyneke Meyer, who resigned in December after leading the Springboks to third place at last year's World Cup.
"I am very excited and grateful for this opportunity," Coetzee said.
"This job comes with a huge amount of responsibility because our passionate fans rightfully demand the best from the Springboks at all times."
Coetzee was part of the Springbok coaching team in 2000 and, most notably, between 2004 and 2007, including during their World Cup triumph in France.
"Allister's appointment marks the changing of the guard at the top of Springbok rugby," South Africa Rugby president Oregan Hoskins said.
"He was the outstanding candidate in terms of his rugby credentials, his understanding of our unique South African transformation imperatives and also in the image he will present as Springbok coach."
