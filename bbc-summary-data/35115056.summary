Sandra Brown spent the money on spa treatments, a £700 television and paying parking tickets, a court heard.
Brown, 64, of Shorton Road, Paignton, took control of clients' finances at the Manor Cottage care home.
She admitted four counts of fraud and one of money laundering between 2007 and 2012 and was jailed for 28 months at Plymouth Crown Court.
The court heard Brown took £25,661 from four elderly residents - two of whom have since died.
The frauds were only uncovered when she was replaced as manager.
Sentencing Brown on Tuesday, Judge Ian Lawrie QC said Brown had taken advantage of victims who were not only elderly but had mental health issues.
He told her: "The vulnerable are entitled to the highest levels of care and probity from the people who are looking after them.
"A message needs to be sent out to the broader world that the courts will not tolerate this behaviour."
