Paul Warne: Rotherham United interim manager does not want full-time job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham United interim manager Paul Warne says he still has no interest in taking the job on a permanent basis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warne took over on Monday following Kenny Jackett's resignation after only five games in charge of the club.
The Millers' 2-1 Championship defeat by Burton, their 15th game without a win, left them 13 points adrift of safety at the bottom of the Championship.
"After a defeat, I haven't flipped my mind and thought, 'You know what, this is easier than I thought'," Warne said.
"It's still ridiculously hard, it's ridiculously stressful, I gave everything I could. It sounds pathetic I suppose, but I 'teared up' in front of the lads.
"It's difficult. I gave everything I could for the team to win and it wasn't enough - and that's hard to take."
