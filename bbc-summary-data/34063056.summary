[SN]TITLE[SN]
Republic of Ireland 1-0 Georgia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Republic of Ireland kept their Euro 2016 qualification hopes alive as a second-half goal from Jon Walters earned a vital win over Georgia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a nervous first-half display, the Republic raised the tempo after the break and Jeff Hendrick's fine run set up Walters's 69th-minute winner.
The Republic stay third in Group D but they have a four-point cushion over Scotland after Germany won in Glasgow.
Poland remain second after routing Gibraltar 8-1 in Warsaw.
The Republic are still four points behind group leaders Germany but, with two matches remaining, they are now in position to clinch at least a play-off spot.
However, those are two tough games as they first host Germany in Dublin on 8 October before concluding their campaign in Poland.
That said, one win would guarantee Martin O'Neill's side one of the eight play-off places.
And a win in Warsaw would clinch an automatic qualifying spot for the Irish if Scotland beat Poland in Glasgow three days earlier.
The one downside from the Republic's win was the bookings picked up by Glenn Whelan and James McClean, which will rule them out of the Germany contest.
Hendrick's stunning run and cross as he jinked past three attempted challenges before setting up Walters to stab home dramatically changed the contest at the Aviva Stadium.

The Republic had looked jittery in the first period as Georgia striker Levan Mchedlidze twice went close after being set up by impressive playmaker Tornike Okriashvili.
But boosted by the half-time introduction of Shane Long for the ineffective Robbie Keane, the Republic lifted the pace in the second half as the busy Glenn Whelan and Hendrick tested keeper Nukri Revishvili.
Yet, the Georgians still looked largely comfortable until Hendrick's bit of magic set up Walters's winner.
For that delightful piece of skill alone, the Derby midfielder has to be the man of the match.
Despite lifting the pace after half-time, the Republic were still showing little sign of breaking down the Georgia defence until Hendrick's moment of inspiration.
Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill: "That was very tense. We didn't play well in the first half. We were very tentative. You might even say nervous.
"But in the second half there was a great turnaround, with great effort and application and we found a way to win. Jeff Hendrick was absolutely magnificent for the goal. He has the ability to do that. He just needs a wee bit more encouragement.
"And it was great to see Jon Walters, who has had a fantastic tournament for us, get the goal. He's got a great, great heart."
Republic of Ireland goalscorer Jon Walters: "It was all about the result tonight. It was tough but we knew it was going to be that.
"We managed a 1-0 (win) and we couldn't have asked for any more. Fair play to Jeff Hendrick. He made the goal for me. He's got that ability. He's a top quality player.
"We are still a million miles away from qualifying. We've got two big games coming up next months but we'll take that in our stride hopefully."
