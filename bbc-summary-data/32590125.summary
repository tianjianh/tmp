Although parts of the US rapper's song were muted by ITV, Ofcom still received 151 complaints about offensive language and race discrimination or offence.
Ofcom has assessed the complaints but said it will take no further action.
ITV tried to cut out offensive language by airing February's ceremony with a short delay, the regulator decided.
An Ofcom spokesman said: "We received a number of complaints that Kanye West's language, shortly after the watershed, was offensive.
"But we will not be taking the matter forward for investigation.
"Having carefully assessed these complaints, we noted that before the programme ITV took steps to ensure that offensive language was not used, and during the programme to mute the majority of it."
