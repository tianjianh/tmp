Mickey Harte: Manager expects to remain in charge of Tyrone 'for some time'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mickey Harte says he expects to remain in charge of the Tyrone footballers "for some time" despite the county's decision in September not to grant him an immediate contract extension.

Speaking on the Allstars tour in Dubai, Harte expressed confidence about his continuing role with the Red Hands.
"I think there is a great group of players at the minute," he said.
"They have good confidence in each other and I think we will work together for some time."
Harte rejected suggestions that his ongoing refusal to speak with Irish national broadcaster RTE had played a part in the Tyrone county board's decision not to grant him the two-year extension that he had requested.
The Tyrone manager's current deal will conclude at the end of the 2017 championship.
There have been suggestions that Tyrone's sponsors have been unhappy at Harte's stance over the RTE issue which followed a sketch on a radio programme in August 2011 which mocked him for going to see the Dalai Lama, months after the murder of his daughter Michaela in Mauritius.
Tyrone players have also refused to speak to RTE since the controversial radio programme.
"The sponsors have never spoken directly about this being an issue at all," said Harte in Dubai.
"That's just stuff that gets into the grapevine, people repeat it and it becomes the truth. In fact, it's not the truth at all."
Tyrone earned their first Ulster title since 2010 this year but then suffered a disappointing All-Ireland quarter-final defeat against Mayo.
