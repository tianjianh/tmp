The Mayor of London accused the government of having no clear strategy just two months ahead of a deadline to formally trigger the UK's exit from the European Union (EU).
Mr Khan said a "muddled Brexit" would be as damaging as a "hard Brexit".
The Department for Exiting the European Union has yet to respond to the mayor's speech.
In his speech to business and political leaders on Thursday, night the Mr Khan said: "It's deeply concerning that we still appear to have muddled thinking at the heart of government.
"The only thing that would be as damaging as a hard Brexit would be a muddled Brexit.
"And - unfortunately - it looks like that is where we are heading unless there's a change in tact and direction from our government."
The Mayor said a negative Brexit impact for London would hit the whole country.
"If the proper agreements aren't negotiated and we don't get the necessary transitional agreements in place, there'll be serious knock-on impacts on our future - with jobs and billions of revenue lost," he said.
"Revenues used to deliver public services and much, much more.
"This would hit the entire country, not just London."
Downing Street has previously said the prime minister will give a speech next week "setting out more" on the government's Brexit plans.
Theresa May's official spokeswoman said: "She will be making a speech on Tuesday, setting out more on our approach to Brexit, as part of preparing for the negotiations and in line with our approach for global Britain and continuing to be an outward-looking nation."
