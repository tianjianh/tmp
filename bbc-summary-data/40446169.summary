The two-day event got underway on Saturday, and includes a Red Arrows display , a Typhoon Eurofighter and the Tigers Parachute Display Team.
Organisers are reminding people it takes place in restricted airspace and that drones are "strictly prohibited".
An estimated 100,000 people were expected to see the show on Saturday, organisers tweeted.
Anyone found using drones within six miles (9.6km) of the bay will have them confiscated, they said in a statement.
The use of drones, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), is restricted in the UK under Civil Aviation Authority rules and regulations.
Infringing restricted airspace carries a potential court fine of Â£2,500 and a prison sentence of up to five years.
Thousands of visitors are expected to flock to the airshow, after last summer's event attracted about 200,000 visitors.
