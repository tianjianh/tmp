Edward Hardy, who has dementia and lives in a care home in Wookey, Somerset, played for decades but had not touched the keyboard for nearly 25 years.
But, staff at the home said when he started playing again he could play "amazing tracks to a ridiculous standard".
His old bandmates David Payne, 67, Arthur Rice, 66, and Ron Foster, 88, got in touch for a reunion. Clinton Rogers reports.
