Gritting lorries and snowploughs have been out and about on Lincolnshire's roads - in preparation for the start of the snow risk season.

"The gritters are now travelling to various workshops for maintenance, just like getting a car serviced," said a highways official.
The "low-risk" season begins in October with "high-risk" starting in November.
The county council said they had to think about the upcoming winter even when it was "boiling hot".
The fleet of more than 40 vehicles covers about 1,865 miles (3,000km) of roads including all major traffic routes and selected A and B roads.
Officials said the service was stood down in April but had to start again surprisingly soon.
Richard Fenwick, from county council highways, said: "The end of summer is a busy time, even when it is boiling hot we have to think about it.
"We have drivers go out during the day to make sure they know the routes, iron out any wrinkles."
The authority said it had about 35,000 tonnes of salt in stock and would expect to use about 25,000 tonnes in an average year.
