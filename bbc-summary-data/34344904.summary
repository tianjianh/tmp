A convicted drugs trafficker who has been on the run for five years has handed himself into Dutch police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Tarrant, 66, from Essex, walked into a police station in Breda in the Netherlands on Saturday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.
He fled the UK after being arrested in 2009 when drugs, a gun and cash were found at a house in Waltham Abbey.
He was jailed for 15 years in his absence. Extradition proceedings have begun to bring him back to the UK.
The Metropolitan Police first detained Tarrant after finding cannabis blocks, two kilos of cocaine, a handgun, ammunition, body armour and approximately Â£5,000 at a property in Essex.
But he disappeared while on conditional bail.
Tarrant was one of eight "most-wanted" British criminals thought to be hiding in the Netherlands, and was featured on BBC programme Crimestoppers in December.
Dave Allen, head of the NCA's international crime bureau, said: "These fugitives really do have nowhere to hide and I would urge any of the remaining individuals to save yourself the trouble and hand yourself in."
Tarrant was arrested as part of Operation Return, a joint NCA, Crimestoppers, Bel M (Dutch Crimestoppers) and Netherlands law enforcement scheme to locate UK fugitives believed to be hiding out in and around Amsterdam.
