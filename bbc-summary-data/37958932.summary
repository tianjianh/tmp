[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rochdale 4-0 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tim Sherwood tasted League One defeat for the first time since taking over as Swindon's director of football as Rochdale cruised to a 4-0 victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following their midweek exit from the FA Cup at the hands of non-league Eastleigh, Sherwood took a place in the directors box as the Robins slipped up at the Crown Oil Arena.
John Goddard and Anton Rodgers both saw efforts kept out by Dale goalkeeper Conrad Logan before the visitors fell behind in the 29th minute to Joe Bunney's precise header.
And the contest was effectively decided during an eleven-minute spell after the break during which Swindon shipped three goals.
Matt Lund doubled Dale's lead in the 55th minute when he fired into the roof of the net from close range and then substitute Steve Davies slotted home the third two minutes later.
Davies was brought down by Lloyd Jones to earn a penalty in the 66th minute and the former Blackpool frontman slotted home his second from the spot.
Robins goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux averted further embarrassment when he saved twice from Ian Henderson in the closing stages.
