The German top seed, who needed three sets in both of her opening two matches, won 6-0 6-4 in Melbourne.
Kerber faces Coco Vandeweghe in round four after the American beat Canada's Eugenie Bouchard 6-4 3-6 7-5.
Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka are in action later on Friday.
Russian eighth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova was another winner early on day five, needing three hours and 36 minutes to beat Serbia's Jelena Jankovic 6-4 5-7 9-7.
"Jelena was in total control in the third set but I was trying to hang in, it was amazing that I could turn it around," said Kuznetsova, who trailed 3-0 in the final set.
"I just waited and tried to recover some breaks. I was not playing my best."
