[SN]TITLE[SN]

Paris St-Germain were crowned French champions with eight games left as Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored four in a 9-0 demolition of bottom side Troyes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PSG clinched the title with two months of the season to spare.
Edinson Cavani, Javier Pastore and Adrien Rabiot put them 3-0 up inside 19 minutes before Ibrahimovic struck three within 10 minutes in the second half.
Matthieu Saunier scored an own goal and Cavani made it 8-0 before Ibrahimovic added his fourth.
Laurent Blanc's men clinched their fourth successive Ligue 1 title in style with the biggest away win in the history of the competition.
They did it with just one defeat in 30 games after they were beaten 2-1 by Lyon in February, and the latest win took their goal difference to +62 with just 15 league goals conceded.
They have won 24 of their 30 games with Ibrahimovic scoring 31 goals in 25 appearances to add to Cavani's 16 in 27.
Defeat left Troyes, who had Lossemy Karaboue sent off in the 64th minute, eight points adrift of second-from-bottom Toulouse with a goal difference of -47.
