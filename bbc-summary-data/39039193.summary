Two more people have been arrested after a man was shot and critically injured in Hampshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old suffered a serious head injury in the shooting on Athena Avenue, Crookhorn, on 13 February.
Two Surrey men, aged 30 and 21, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, but have since been released without charge.
Police said they would face no further action "at this stage".
Police said the shooting "may be related to the drugs trade" and finding the weapon "remains a priority for the investigation".
Three people previously held over the shooting have been bailed.
A man and woman, aged 37 and 38, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, while a 31-year-old woman was questioned on suspicion of conspiring to murder.
The victim remains in hospital.
