Apprentice star Stuart Baggs' death caused by asthma attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The sudden death of former Apprentice star Stuart Baggs was caused by an asthma attack, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old's body was found after officers were called to his Isle of Man home on 30 July.
Insp Iain MacMillan said: "Mr Baggs had suffered from asthma for many years and died as a result of his condition."
Police have informed the coroner that the Plymouth-born entrepreneur died from "natural causes".
Insp McKillop said: "From the reaction we have encountered during our enquiries, it is clear that this is a tragic and premature loss of such a hardworking and visionary young man.
"We extend our thoughts to the family at this sad time and on their behalf I would request that they are now left in peace to grieve."
Baggs lived in the Isle of Man for most of his life and ran a telecommunications company.
When he was aged 21 in 2010, he became the youngest ever candidate to appear on the BBC One show The Apprentice.
Baggs, who was fired in the semi-final, became famous for his one-liners which included "Everything I touch turns to sold" and "I'm Stuart Baggs the brand".
He was found dead by police after they were called to his home on Central Promenade in Douglas, at 09:00 BST last Thursday.
