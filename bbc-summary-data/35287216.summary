The 22-year-old spent the first half of this season on loan at Portsmouth, scoring twice in 12 appearances.
His last game for Pompey was December's FA Cup tie against Accrington, meaning he will be ineligible for the Grecians' third-round replay at Liverpool.
"I've come up against Exeter City already this season and they were really impressive," he said.
"It's a team that I wanted to be a part of, and one that I wanted to see do very well. They beat us at Fratton Park, and the lads were really impressed with how they played."
