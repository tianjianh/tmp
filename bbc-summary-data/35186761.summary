[SN]TITLE[SN]
Israel missile defence chief Yair Ramati sacked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head of Israel's missile defence programmes has been sacked for a "grave breach of information security", the defence ministry has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ministry gave no further details of Yair Ramati's offence.
However, Israeli media said he had stored classified information on his personal computer.
Yair Ramati had been in the post for four years, overseeing projects such as the Iron Dome and Arrow anti-missile interceptor systems.
The defence ministry praised Mr Ramati for his achievements in the trial of missile systems.
But it said the nature of the offence meant that Mr Ramati's tenure had to be curtailed.
"Relevant authorities" were investigating, it said.
