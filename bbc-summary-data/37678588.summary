Corrie Mckeague, 23, a gunner based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, vanished after a night out in Bury St Edmunds early in the morning of 24 September.
His father Martin Mckeague said he is "really at a loss" to know what has happened to him.
Suffolk Police is continuing to search for the missing airman.
He was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating takeaway food in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 BST.

It is thought he stopped for a nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to his base.
A trace on his mobile phone showed it was in Bury St Edmunds early on 24 September but then moved to the Barton Mills area.
Police have found neither Mr Mckeague nor his phone.
His father, Martin Mckeague, 47, who lives in Scotland, said: "Three weeks' down the line and [we are] nowhere.
"We need someone to come forward with something. Someone must have information, someone must have seen something. I'm really at a loss.
"It's desperate, frustrating. If someone had picked Corrie up that night and dropped him off wherever, we need that type of information.
"If someone had picked up his phone, and then thrown it away, they're not in trouble, it's just putting the pieces together if that's what happened," Mr Mckeague added.
On Saturday, TV chef Delia Smith added her support to the search by posing with a missing poster which was handed out at Norwich City Football Club, of which she is a director.
