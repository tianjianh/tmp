The British world number two broke Berdych in the third game and saved two break points in the next before racing through the first set in 38 minutes.
Murray made it nine successive games to get to 3-0 in the second set before securing a semi-final against Novak Djokovic at 13:00 BST on Saturday.
"I felt I dictated the whole match," the 28-year-old Scot told Sky Sports.
"Against someone serving as big as him, it's not always easy to do. I didn't have too much defending to do. I served well and got a good read on his serve."
Murray was relieved the contest only lasted 78 minutes, saying: "I'm very happy with the performance and I get to conserve some energy. It's pretty late here and it takes an hour-and-a-half to get back to the hotel."
World number one Djokovic moved into the last four with a 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 win over Australian Bernard Tomic.
The Serb was pushed all the way in a thrilling opening set, edging the tie-break, before Tomic capitulated in the second.
Djokovic won his last match against Murray in Shanghai, in the 2012 final.
"It'll be an extremely tough match," the Briton said of Saturday's encounter.
"We played great tennis in the 2012 final, but I feel like we are quite different players since then. I feel both of us have progressed and play different tennis. We are now quite aggressive."
Earlier, Rafael Nadal's renaissance took a big step forward as he thrashed a flagging Stan Wawrinka for the loss of just three games.
The Spaniard beat the world number four 6-2 6-1 for his first win over a top-five player in more than a year, building on his run to last week's China Open final.
Nadal will meet Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga - a 7-6 (8-6) 5-7 6-4 winner over South Africa Kevin Anderson - in the last four.
