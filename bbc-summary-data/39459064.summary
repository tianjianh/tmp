Tracey Wilkinson and her son Pierce were killed in the attack in Stourbridge, West Midlands. The boy's father, Peter, was seriously injured.
Aaron Barley, 23, of no fixed address, has also been charged with the attempted murder of Mr Wilkinson, police said.
He is due to appear before Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Saturday.
The family were discovered by emergency crews at the house in Greyhound Lane, Norton, on Thursday morning.
Mrs Wilkinson was pronounced dead at the scene while her son died in hospital.
Mr Wilkinson, believed to be a company director for local firm Hill & Smith Ltd, was found in the garden of the house.
He remains in hospital with stab wounds to his chest and back.
West Midlands Police said a post-mortem examination and formal identification will take place on Monday.
A neighbour of the victims described seeing two people being carried from the house on stretchers into ambulances.
Asked to describe the family, she said: "We just knew them as neighbours and asked how the kids were when we saw them in the street.
"They were just really, really friendly. They had lived there about seven or eight years and what has happened is just desperately sad."
The executive headteacher of Pierce's school paid tribute to the teenager.
Stephen Dunster, of Redhill School in Stourbridge, said: "Pierce was a loyal, caring and conscientious pupil who will be sadly missed by all members of our school community.
"He always met everyone with a smile and was a kind and thoughtful young man.
"He was passionate about his football team, West Bromwich Albion, and was devoted to his pet greyhound.
"He was a loving son and brother. Our thoughts and prayers remain with his family."
Pupils and staff at the school are being offered professional help and counselling following the deaths.
Stourbridge MP Margot James said she knew of the family through the local Conservative Association and said the community will do all it can to offer its support.
She added: "My reaction is probably the same as everyone else in Stourbridge - absolute shock and horror that anything like this could happen in someone's normal day in my constituency.
"It is a truly tragic and awful event."
