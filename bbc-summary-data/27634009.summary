Manchester United are set to resume talks with Southampton on Friday over the transfer of left-back Luke Shaw, reports BBC Radio Solent.

Saints have already turned down a Â£27m offer for the 18-year-old.
Left-back had been one of the priority areas for David Moyes before he was sacked by United last month.
Current first-choice Patrice Evra recently signed a new contract but United are still searching for a long-term replacement for the Frenchman.
The move comes a day after news emerged that Liverpool are attempting to sign Southampton and England striker Rickie Lambert.
Lambert, 32, and Saints team-mate Adam Lallana, 26, will hope to be involved in England's World Cup warm-up match with Peru at Wembley on Friday, but Shaw will miss the game through illness.
Lallana has also been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with Liverpool interested in Southampton's captain.
Southampton themselves are searching for a new manager following the departure of boss Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham.
Shaw is preparing for the World Cup with England and is battling alongside Leighton Baines for a starting position in Roy Hodgson's side.
