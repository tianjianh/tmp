A GP cleared over the death of a 12-year-old boy from Blaenau Gwent has now been formally acquitted of attempting to pervert the course of justice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joanne Rudling, 46, and her colleague, Lindsey Thomas, 41, went on trial in May charged with the manslaughter of Ryan Morse by gross negligence.
Dr Thomas's case was thrown out and a judge ruled no case to answer on the manslaughter charge against Dr Rudling.
Dr Rudling was acquitted of the outstanding charge at the Old Bailey.
The youngster died at his home in Brynithel in December 2012 after suffering from a mystery illness.
A post-mortem examination later showed he had Addison's disease - a treatable but also very rare condition.
Dr Rudling was due to face a retrial at Cardiff Crown Court over a charge of perverting the course of justice later this month.
But during a hearing in London on Friday, High Court judge Nicola Davies indicated that evidence the Crown sought to rely on would be excluded from the trial.
So the prosecution offered no evidence and Dr Rudling, who was present in court, was formally acquitted.
