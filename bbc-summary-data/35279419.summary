Houston has been named Scottish Championship manager of the month, while Rogers has the player prize.
Falkirk won three of their league games, including beating leaders Rangers, and drawing with Hibernian.
Houston's side have leapfrogged Hibs into second place, although the Edinburgh side have a game in hand.
Both sides are three points behind leaders Rangers, who have also played one less game than the Bairns.
Their wins during December included a 2-1 home success against the Glasgow side and they also defeated Livingston and Dumbarton.
Rogers, who is on loan from Aberdeen, only conceded two goals in those four games.
News of the 21-year-old's award comes a day after Liverpool's decision to recall current Dons number one Danny Ward from his loan at Pittodrie.
Rogers, who was born in the United States but has played three times for Republic of Ireland Under-21s, has made 24 appearances for Falkirk this season.
He has had previous loans with Airdrieonians and Dumbarton.
Rogers had another clean sheet in Falkirk's first game of 2016 - a 1-0 victory over Alloa Athletic.
