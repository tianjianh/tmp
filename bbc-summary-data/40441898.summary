Police Scotland confirmed earlier today that the man who died was Keith Johnston from Dounby.
The death is being investigated by Police Scotland, the Health and Safety Executive, and an internal inquiry.
The council's chief executive paid tribute to Mr Johnston.
Alistair Buchan said: "On behalf of everyone at the Council, I offer our condolences to all those affected by Keith's death.
"Our thoughts are with his family, friends and workmates at this sad and very difficult time.
"Keith was a much-valued member of staff and a highly-skilled and experienced member of our roads team. He will be deeply missed by his colleagues."
The accident happened on the A986 Dounby to Twatt road near Birsay. It is understood the vehicle involved was a council-owned lorry involved in the road maintenance operation.
