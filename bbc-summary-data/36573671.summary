Fire crews worked through the night after a thatch roof fire in Oxfordshire.

Smoke was spotted coming from the property in Great Haseley just before 17:30 BST on Sunday, with flames engulfing almost half of the roof.
Up to 50 firefighters attended the blaze, with a specialist team using chainsaws to cut fire breaks to protect the rest of the home.
Crews in breathing apparatus tackled the flames from inside the property.
The cause of the fire is not yet known.
Marcus Reay, from Oxfordshire fire service, said "[We] used ladders to allow specialist teams to climb the roof and cut fire breaks using chainsaws.
"This is a new technique that we have developed for thatch fires which allows us to limit fire spread, giving us more time to salvage personal possessions from within properties."
