A neighbour raised the alarm at about 07:00 GMT and the man was rescued from the property in Mawgan, Cornwall by fire crews and treated by paramedics for minor cuts and bruises.
Neighbour Julian Rand said the trapped man was "understandably very shocked".
The man was calling for help when fire crews arrived.

Mr Rand said: "The large tree which was standing in the Old Rectory came down and smashed into the garage and house.
"The man wasn't injured by the falling tree, but was trapped."
Tolvaddon Station Manager, Mark Salter, said the man was in his 50s or 60s and was "literally just pinned beneath the branches and the tree trunk so he was unable to move".
Mr Salter said firefighters freed the man using small handsaws.
He said the man, who was taken to a bed and breakfast, had minor injuries to his torso and legs.
About a third of the roof was damaged and the garage destroyed by the tree, Mr Salter said.
"Looking at the damage, I'd say it may be sometime before he can get back home," he added.
Power lines were also brought down by the tree and fire crews from Helston, Mullion and Tolvaddon attended.
