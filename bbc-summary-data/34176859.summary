New abuse claim against former Newport head Jon Styler

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New allegations of historical abuse against a former head teacher from Newport who killed himself in 2007 have emerged, BBC Wales has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven people had already alleged Jon Styler abused them at Malpas Church in Wales School in the 1970s.
Now a former pupil at a Worcestershire private school where Mr Styler was the head has claimed the teacher sexually assaulted him in his flat.
A third case involved another Newport school, BBC Wales understands.
It has been reported Mr Styler strongly denied any allegations against him before he died.
Two men are calling for an inquiry into what the authorities may have known about the alleged incidents at Malpas Church in Wales School.
Mr Styler was the head teacher at Bowbrook private school in Hartlebury, Worcestershire, in the mid-to-late 1980s when a former pupil in his early 40s, who lives in north Wales, says he was sexually assaulted by Mr Styler in his flat.
The man said the assault happened just after leaving the school, when he was 17.
Bowbrook private school no longer exists. BBC Wales was unable to contact anyone involved with the administration of the school at the time, despite several attempts.
A different institution, with no link to Bowbrook private school or Jon Styler, now occupies the site.
Another institution in Worcestershire, Bowbrook House School, also has no link to Bowbrook private school or Mr Styler.
BBC Wales also understands another man has contacted solicitors alleging he was abused by Mr Styler when he worked at Brynglas Primary School between 1968 and 1971.
Brynglas Primary School does not exist anymore and BBC Wales was unable to contact anyone involved with the administration of the school at the time.
Newport council said it cannot comment further as the matter is subject to a compensation claim.
The Independent Schools Association, a charity that represents hundreds of independent schools, said: "We urge anyone with information surrounding the well-being of children to share this immediately with their local authorities, police and organisations that support children."
Gwent Police has said there is no current investigation into Jon Styler.
