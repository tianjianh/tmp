The lifeboat service was called in to help pull the woman and the man from the sea off St Osyth.
When they arrived shortly before 06:00 BST on Friday, paramedics were already treating the pair at the water's edge.
The man, in his 40s, died later in hospital. Police have not confirmed the relationship between him and the arrested woman, aged 40.
It is understood the man is from the Clacton area.
An RNLI spokesman said the man and the woman "had been in the water for a fair amount of time".
"Our thoughts go out to the casualties, their friends and family," the spokesman said.
Essex Police appealed for anybody who saw anything suspicious in the Spring Road area between 01:00 BST and 06:00 to contact them.
