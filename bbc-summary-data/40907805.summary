[SN]TITLE[SN]
Preston North End 1-0 Reading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jordan Hugill's well-taken goal was enough for Preston to beat Reading at Deepdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decisive moment came midway through the first half, as Sean Maguire nodded into the path of Hugill, who chested down before firing in.
Reading goalkeeper Vito Mannone made saves from Maguire, Tom Barkhuizen and Stephy Mavididi to keep his side in it.
The Royals went closest when Joseph Mendes' header from a free-kick was saved by Chris Maxwell.
Having already gone a goal down, Reading were also forced into two substitutions before half-time with midfielders John Swift and Liam Kelly limping off and replaced by George Evans and Joseph Mendes.
And the latter almost made an instant impact, getting his head to Pelle Clement's free-kick only for Preston keeper Maxwell to hold it.
The home side, though, were again looking more likely to score after the break, but Mannone's saves and some determined defending from Liam Moore gave Reading hope.
However, their attacking threat was summed up by efforts from debutant Leandro Bacuna and Evans, who both cleared the bar.
Preston manager Alex Neil:
"I'm extremely satisfied. I thought we were the better side and created numerous opportunities. The only disappointment is that it finished 1-0.
"It was an incredible effort from the lads. I thought they were top, top drawer.
"We worked extremely hard, our shape was excellent and we had a lot of individual great performances."
Reading boss Jaap Stam:
"If you play against a side like Preston you have to bring everything to the game including physique, pace, aggressiveness.
"Hopefully you can play your own game. We didn't get what we expected from it.
"I am not happy in how we played and what we did. We gave a lot of balls away and that brings them into the game to create opportunities."
