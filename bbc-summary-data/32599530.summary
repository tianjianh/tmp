The Steelmen clinched the Southern Premier League title with a 3-2 victory at Poole on 25 April.
It has yet to be confirmed whether they will play in the Conference North or South division next season.
The parade began at the club's Steel Park ground at 18:30 BST and headed for the Corby Cube.
Stevie Noble, chairman of Corby Town since April 2014, said: "We've come back from the brink, tried to get the community involved with us and they have offered fantastic support.
"The open top bus is a thank you to the town."
Mr Noble said preparations for the Conference were already under way.
"Realistically, you're always trying to progress to the next division, so a realistic target next season is play-offs," he said.
