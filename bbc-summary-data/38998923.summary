The mine was used as a location for the BBC TV drama Poldark.
The National Trust said the fees would fund conservation and maintain the site, which has seen a 50% rise in visitors since the programme first broadcast.
But opponents claim the charges are "insensitive" to the memory of the 1919 Levant Mine disaster that occurred there.
