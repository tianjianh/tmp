[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 2-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Taylor took his goal tally for the season to 18 with a second-half brace as Bristol Rovers kept in close touch with the League One play-off places with a home win over AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last season's leading scorer in the Football League headed his side in front from Lee Brown's deep cross to the far post after 61 minutes, having been denied by Wimbledon goalkeeper James Shea seconds earlier.
Taylor wrapped up the points nine minutes later, cleverly making space inside the box to beat Shea with a low left-footed shot from a Chris Lines pass.
And the striker narrowly missed out on a hat-trick, heading inches wide from a Lines cross in the closing moments.
Neither side were able to create much in a disappointing first half, with the best chance falling to Wimbledon's Andy Barcham, whose shot was blocked by Rovers goalkeeper Will Puddy after a neat through ball from Tyrone Barnett.
Rovers were restricted to long-range efforts, the best a low drive from Billy Bodin on the half hour, which brought a comfortable diving save from Shea.
