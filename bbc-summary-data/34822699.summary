An additional 259 Western Power Distribution customers were without electricity in the Pontyberem area of Carmarthenshire
Flood warnings were also issued.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said flooding would affect the Conwy, Dyfi and Lower Dee valleys.
The Met Office yellow "be ready" warning for north Wales, Ceredigion and Powys, was in place until 04:00 GMT Monday.
The Met Office said: "Be aware that, given already saturated conditions, flooding is possible either from standing water or from rivers which have remained high after the large rainfall totals over the last few days."
NRW said its staff would be out working all weekend on flood defences and putting measures in place to reduce the impact on people and their property.
