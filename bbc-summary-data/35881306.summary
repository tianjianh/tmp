The 28-year-old 6ft 5ins lock is in his second season at Sixways since arriving in the summer of 2014 from then Premiership champions Northampton.
His importance to the team is summed up by Worcester's impressive results since his return from injury in January.
Tight-head prop James Johnston has also signed a new one-year deal for the 2016-17 season.
"Signing a new deal was a no-brainer as everything is in place for this club to become one of the best in Europe," said van Velze, whose new contract is of an undisclosed length.
"The facilities and support we receive is world-class."
Director of rugby Dean Ryan added: "GJ joined the club at a time of transition and has been one of the catalysts in our transformation over the last couple of seasons. He leads by example on the field and his work rate is second to none."
Worcester go into Saturday's home game with bottom club London Irish looking for a fourth consecutive Premiership win for the first time since originally being promoted to English rugby's top flight in 2004
