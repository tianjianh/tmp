Justin Bieber has topped the UK singles chart with Sorry, ending Adele's three-week run and breaking a chart record for the most tracks inside the top 40.

The chart features eight songs from Bieber's new album Purpose, the first time a living artist has had so many simultaneous entries.
However the Canadian singer failed to keep One Direction from the top of the UK album chart with Made in the AM.
Their first record as a four piece is the fastest-selling album of the year.
Made in the AM sold 93,189 copies in its first week, beating the record previously held by Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds album Chasing Yesterday, and outselling Bieber by just over 3,000 copies.
However Adele is expected to outstrip them all over the next week, after her third album 25 was released today.
Adele's track Hello had kept Bieber from the top of the singles chart for three weeks, but he finally claimed the top spot with combined weekly sales of 104,000 - including 5.35 million streams.
He dominated the top five, with three tracks including Love Yourself at three and former number one What Do You Mean? at five.
His eight top 40 entries see him break a record set by Elvis Presley in 1957, when he had seven songs in the top 40 singles chart.
Fleur East's Sax was at number four, while former X Factor winner Ben Haenow's debut album debuted in the top 10 in the album chart.
One Direction's first album since the departure of Zayn Malik earlier this year is their fourth out of five albums to top the chart, following 2012's Take Me Home, 2013's Midnight Memories and 2014's Four.
The boyband recently performed their final tour date before they take an extended break.
Former UK number one album If I Can Dream by Elvis Presley was in third place this week, while Alone in the Universe by Jeff Lynne's ELO entered the chart at four.
Little Mix's third album Get Weird rounded out the top five while Kylie Minogue's festive release Kylie Christmas debuted at 12.
Despite a Facebook campaign to get US band Eagles of Death Metal into the singles chart, their cover of Duran Duran's Save A Prayer failed to make the top 40.
The band were performing at Le Bataclan concert hall in Paris last Friday when gunmen opened fire, killing 89 of the 130 people left dead during attacks across the city.
