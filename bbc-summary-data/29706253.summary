Feel the Force Day was set up so that as many people as possible could access and experience Star Wars.
Co-founder JJ Lucia-Wright was inspired to help organise the event after spending the past 10 years teaching a friend who is deaf and blind about the films.
People attending were encouraged to stroke a Wookiee, sniff the scent of the Millennium Falcon and hug Princess Leia.
