Aberystwyth public toilet's 20p charge to maintain loos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People will have to pay to spend a penny as part of trial to raise funds to maintain public toilets in mid Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Those wanting to relieve themselves at Aberystwyth's Park Avenue loos will have to pay 20p during the six to 12-month trial from 10 November.
If successful, charges could be introduced at all public toilets in Ceredigion.
But the council said disabled people could still use them for free.
Alun Williams, Ceredigion's cabinet member for environmental services, said the council agreed the charge because residents often suggested charging for public toilets when asked for suggestions about which council services they would be willing to pay for.
The move comes after the Welsh Government said councils must come up with strategies for the management of public toilets as part of its Public Health Bill.
If also follows the closure of many across Wales due to budget cuts.
Seven closed in Cardiff in March, Merthyr Tydfil has no council-run toilets left and Gwynedd and Anglesey councils asked community and town councils to help fund theirs.
