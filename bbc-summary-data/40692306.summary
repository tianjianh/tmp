The 20-year-old was part of the Shrimps' development side last term and has earned a professional deal after featuring in three pre-season matches.
He started in Crystal Palace's youth setup and spent some of the 2016-17 campaign at Welsh side Airbus UK.
"I'm looking forward to the season and trying establish myself as an important member of the squad," Deakin said.
