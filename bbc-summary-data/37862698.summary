Marcus Bignot: Grimsby Town appoint Solihull Moors boss as manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Grimsby Town have appointed Solihull Moors boss Marcus Bignot as their new manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 42-year-old replaces Paul Hurst, who left to take over League One club Shrewsbury Town last month.
Bignot guided the Moors to promotion to the National League in 2015-16 and led them for the final time in Saturday's FA Cup first-round draw at Yeovil.
His first game as Mariners boss will be at home to Sheffield United in the EFL Trophy on Wednesday.
Micky Moore, who joined Solihull as assistant manager prior to the start of the current season, will take on the same role with the Mariners.
Bignot, who is married to Arsenal Ladies and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Emma Byrne, started his coaching career in 1998 as manager of Birmingham City Ladies, while still playing for Crewe.
He made more than 400 career league appearances in spells with six clubs before retiring in 2010, combining his playing career with his coaching duties until leaving Birmingham in 2005.
Grimsby are eighth in League Two, having won six of their first 15 games since being promoted from the National League last season.
