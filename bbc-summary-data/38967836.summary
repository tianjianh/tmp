Police Scotland said the incident happened at Vane Farm between 08:00 on Friday and 14:00 on Saturday.
Two Beltex rams and two sheep died as a result of the attack.
The Scottish Partnership Against Rural Crime launched a campaign on Monday to raise awareness amongst dog owners about the impact of livestock worrying.
Insp Jane Donaldson, Police Scotland's rural crime co-ordinator, said:  "The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.
"This campaign is being launched to coincide with the spring lambing period because this is when sheep are at greatest risk."
