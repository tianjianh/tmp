The Ports are also only three points ahead of 10th-placed Carrick and four clear of Ballinamallard and given their current freefall, Pat McGibbon's side now appear to be right in the relegation mix.
The portents looked promising for Portadown as Ken Oman went close before Ross Redman set up Soares to put them ahead on 14 minutes.
However, as the Ports lost their way, the game turned dramatically in Warrenpoint's favour just before half-time as McDonald's deflected effort beat David Miskelly before Murray netted again a minute later.
Warrenpoint bossed the second half as the impressive Johnny McMurray and McDonald went close before Murray's 81st-minute goal sealed their victory.
At Carrick, in-form Allen put Glentoran ahead in the 10th minute as he ran on to a long ball from keeper Elliot Morris.
James Wright levelled four minutes later with a free-kick which deceived Morris but Allen restored Glentoran's lead two minutes later as he headed in his 20th goal of the season.
David Scullion and Fra McCaffrey both went close to extending Glentoran's lead before the break and the visitors bossed the second half as Carrick keeper Brian Neeson made a series of fine save.
