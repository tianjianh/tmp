The Newtownards cyclist, defending the title he won last year, gained a lap with only seven remaining.
He held on to finish behind Russian Ivan Kovalev.
It was a third World Championship medal for Irivine, who was 12th in the individual pursuit qualifying earlier on Thursday.
He won silver in the pursuit last year but was well back after clocking 4:26.525, while Ireland team-mate Ryan Mullen was fourth in 4:22.419.
Irvine will take part in the points race on Friday.
After his double medal success at last year's World Championships in Belarus, Irvine won gold in the points race at the World Cup in Manchester in November.
