One-Day Cup: Notts' Michael Lumb and Riki Wessels rewrite records against Northants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire set a new record for most runs scored in a 50-over fixture in England in a One-Day Cup thriller at Trent Bridge.

After Notts had racked up a seemingly impregnable 445-8 - the second-highest List A score ever recorded - Northants came within 21 runs of a famous win.
Notts openers Riki Wessels and Michael Lumb put on 342 - the highest-ever stand in one-day cricket in England.
But Northants made a bold bid to get the runs, falling just short on 425.
The total run aggregate in the match of 870 was enough to beat the 867 in the Surrey-Glamorgan C&G Trophy tie at The Oval in 2002 - the game in which Ali Brown hit the world record one-day score of 268, yet Glamorgan got within 10 runs of winning, losing off the penultimate ball.
Sharing that record was some consolation for a Northants side who made an incredibly game effort, Adam Rossington's rapid 97 off 69 balls ultimately being upstaged by Rory Kleinveldt, who hit nine sixes and 10 fours in his 128 off 63 balls - his maiden List A century.
Even then, when the ninth Northants wicket fell at 417, there was drama as top-order batsman Richard Levi finally appeared at number 11, nursing an earlier wrist injury.
He initially came out with a runner, Rob Keogh, who was promptly sent back by the umpires. But, after Levi had put his first ball back over the bowler's head for six, he was then bowled off the second ball of the 48th over by Harry Gurney.
For all Northants' efforts, they were all still shadowed by the stunning 342-run stand earlier between Lumb (184) and Wessels (146).
The world one-day record is still held by Surrey, who made 496-4 against Gloucestershire in the FP Trophy at The Oval in 2007.
Former Northants batsman Wessels and England international Lumb, who both hit one-day career-bests, smashed Notts' previous partnership record of 217 - also held by Lumb, with Alex Hales, against Middlesex at Lord's in 2014.
They also beat the previous best one-day stand in England, 324 by India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid against Sri Lanka at Taunton in the 1999 World Cup.
But when Wessels went for 148, they fell just 30 runs short of matching the all-time best one-day partnership of 372 between Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, for the West Indies' second wicket against Zimbabwe at Canberra in the last World Cup in February 2015.
They also fell short of the highest-ever one-day first-wicket stand, an unbroken 367 set in a South African one-day game by Morne van Wyk and Cameron Delport for Dolphins against Knights in Bloemfontein in October 2014.
Lumb's 184 is now Notts' highest one-day cricket score, beating Paul Johnson's 167 not out against Kent in 1993, and it surpassed Ian Botham's 175 not out for Somerset as the highest score in a List A game against Northants.
Their stand was the biggest in a one-day game between two first-class counties since Tim Curtis and Tom Moody put on an unbroken 309 for Worcestershire's third wicket against Surrey at The Oval in the 1994 Natwest Trophy semi-final.
