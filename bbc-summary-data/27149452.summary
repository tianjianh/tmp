[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daria Pikus, 22, died in March 2013 after the accident in Turnells Mill Lane, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire.
An inquest into her death heard how she was hit by a Vauxhall Corsa at about 22:00 BST and died at the scene.
Coroner Anne Pember, who heard the street was dark at the time, recorded a verdict of accidental death.
Cory Tompkins, the driver who collided with Miss Pikus said he was travelling at about 40 or 50 mph, below the road's speed limit of 60 mph.
The victim - who was originally from Poland - was waiting to cross the road, having been dropped off on her way home from work.
Mr Tompkins said he saw the headlights of a car coming towards him but could not see past them.
"I honestly don't think there was any way I could have avoided her," he said.
His passenger, Cain Coor, said the stretch of road had been very dark and said the street lights had been turned off.
Nathan Gallon, the crash investigation officer, told the inquest the road had been dark adding: "Visibility is limited by the range of lights on vehicles."
He went on to talk about how the lights were turned off in 2011 as an energy conserving measure.
Northamptonshire County Council turned off half of all of its street lamps in a bid to save about Â£2m.
The county council would not comment about the street lamps but released a statement which said: "We extend our sympathies to the family of Daria Pikus at this very difficult time. We are awaiting the coroner's report."
