Mulhern, 21, made four appearances for the Rhinos and joins up with former team-mate Jamie Peacock who is now football manager at the Robins.
Coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Humberside: "He's come through a really good system at Leeds and is very highly-rated by Jamie.
"He fits the bill for the recruitment that we are trying to do here and I'm looking forward to working with him."

Chester added: "I expect him to be pushing to be in the squad and it's up to him to impress in training and in the friendlies."
Meanwhile, Hull KR have also signed winger Will Oakes, 16, from Wakefield's academy.
The teenager will initially join up with the newly formed Hull Academy side.
