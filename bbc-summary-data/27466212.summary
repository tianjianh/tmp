Prime Minister David Cameron has invited two Bristol students to present a film about female genital mutilation (FGM) to an international summit.

Muna Hassan, 20, and Ifrah Hassan, 19, produced the film with the charity Integrate Bristol as a teaching aid.
It presents the dilemma of a schoolgirl whose friend's sister is going to be cut and the issues faced by the teacher the schoolgirl confides in.
It will be shown at the Department for International Development Youth Summit.
National curriculum
More than 20,000 girls under 15 in the UK are thought to be at risk of FGM.
Before taking the film and associated lesson plans to the summit in July, Muna and Ifrah will show a primary school resource the charity has developed to an audience at City Hall in Bristol.
Ifrah said: "At the summit we'll be showing the film to lots of young people who will take it home and have the conversation in their schools."
As well as showing other young people the film at the summit the pair have been asked to present it to MPs and hope to persuade Education Secretary Michael Gove to put FGM on to the national curriculum.
Last month, Mr Gove issued schools with new guidance on dealing with FGM after meeting fellow Integrate Bristol campaigner Fahma Mohamed.
But the young activists feel that did not go far enough.
"You have to make it mandatory for teachers to be trained," said Ifrah.
"That's why we've made this film and we are saying to Mr Gove 'Take it and use it please'."
"Until we get what we want - for FGM to be talked about in all schools - we won't go away," added Muna.
