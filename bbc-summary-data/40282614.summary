The Saracens centre scored the first of three Scottish tries as Gregor Townsend's men triumphed in Sydney for the first time.
The 24-19 win was just the visitors' third from 12 Tests on Australian soil.
"I think we're still developing, which is a good thing. There's still a load more potential for this squad," Taylor told BBC Scotland.
"I think everyone believes that and everyone believes that we're trying to create that belief that we can beat any team in the world and that's slowly building.
"The boys are working exceptionally hard to play that brand of rugby that Gregor's after and I think it's coming together quite well."

Since succeeding Vern Cotter, head coach Townsend has guided Scotland to back-to-back victories on tour, with the Sydney success following a five-try win over Italy the previous weekend.
"It was a very special victory," Taylor, 27, added. "We deserved that win in the end. There was never a lost cause, which is pretty special. When you know you've got guys either side of you that are going to keep fighting for absolutely everything, it means a lot.
"We have a great belief in ourselves and in our team and how we're trying to play rugby."
Flanker Hamish Watson finished a fine attacking move to score the decisive try at Allianz Stadium, and says the result surpasses any he has achieved.
"I think it's the biggest victory of my career," the Edinburgh open-side, 25, said. "This, as a one-off victory, it's a big, big victory against a team that was ranked above us.
"With the sort of backs we've got nowadays with Scotland, we've got so many good backs, you can try and run those sort of gamble lines and you know that it will pay off sometimes because our backs can beat a lot defenders.
"It was a huge effort by the boys and defensively amazing in that last 15 minutes. Definitely the biggest victory of my career, I'd say.
Watson impressed during the 2016 autumn internationals, was a stand-out performer as Cotter piloted Scotland to their most successful Six Nations Championship in 11 years last term.
"It's great to carry on the momentum that Vern took forward with this squad and now Gregor's sort of carried it on," Watson added. "He's done really well to start with two wins.
"It's a great team to be involved with at the minute and great for all the fans, great for Scottish rugby.
"We are a very close group of players. That squad's been together since the start of Vern's career with Scotland so we're a very tight group and we've got that squad that looks like it could be going forward for the next few years. It's a young squad and obviously a lot of very good players in it."
