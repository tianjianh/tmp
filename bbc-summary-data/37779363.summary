The Spanish Football Federation warned Valencia that it may close its Mestalla Stadium if similar incidents happen.
The plastic bottle was thrown into a huddle of celebrating Barca players after Lionel Messi's 94th-minute winning penalty secured a 3-2 victory.
Luis Suarez and Neymar both fell to the floor after the bottle landed.
Messi's reaction was particularly animated - he turned to gesticulate and shout towards the area of the crowd that the bottle had come from.
Spain's football federation criticised the Barca players for their "exaggerated reaction" and for celebrating in front of home fans, but added "nothing justified" the reaction of the Valencia supporters.
It also praised Valencia for quickly identifying the fan who threw the bottle.
