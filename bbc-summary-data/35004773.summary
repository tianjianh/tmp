Medway Arriva bus drivers' strike disrupts services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 Medway bus drivers have gone on strike over "unachievable" timetables, disrupting services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unite union members walked out at 05:00 GMT in the first of two 24-hour strikes.
Services in the Medway towns and routes to and from Maidstone, Bluewater and Gravesend have been affected by the industrial action.
Arriva urged passengers to make alternative arrangements and check its website for the latest information.
The union claims timetable changes have led to unrealistic running times, making a safe, reliable service impossible to deliver.
Arriva said improvements were being introduced in January and it wanted to meet union leaders to try to resolve the issue.
Bus drivers are due to go on strike again on Monday.
