Mr Wright has been the interim chief executive since Richard Carey announced in October he was standing down from the health authority.
It has been embroiled in a recent staffing controversy.
NHS Grampian chairman Prof Stephen Logan said: "He has demonstrated strong charismatic leadership, a clear focus for the organisation and a genuine desire to be visible."
Mr Wright's appointment comes after BBC Scotland revealed last month that the board had failed to appoint a new chief executive after a recruitment campaign for the post, on a salary of up to Â£151,000 a year.
Prof Logan added: "His tremendous capacity for hard work and his personal drive, energy and enthusiasm have been instrumental in embedding our values of caring, listening and improving and in moving forward day to day business at the same time as planning for the future.
"We should never be complacent. We face real challenges every day and we will continue to do so. But we will continue to deliver safe, effective, person centred care with good clinical outcomes and positive patient experience and Malcolm will maintain that focus and build and develop the organisation going forwards."
Recommendations were made in reviews last year looking at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, the care of older people and concerns over general surgery.
