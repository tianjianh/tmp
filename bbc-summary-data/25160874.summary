The vigil outside Transport for London's headquarters in Southwark follows the deaths of six cyclists killed in a two-week period.
Organisers are calling for 10% of each London borough's transport budget to be spent on cycling infrastructure.
TfL said it was spending Â£1bn on road improvements.
Organiser Donnachadh McCarthy said: "We want a real budget, at the moment we're getting crumbs.
"We want an integrated cycling network in London within five years and we want a say at the top table."
So called "die-ins" were staged during the 1970s in the Netherlands prompting a cycling revolution
Leader of Southwark Council Peter John said: "If we are going to follow a Dutch-style approach it will mean re-defining and re-planning how traffic moves around our capital, in a way that we haven't really had before.
"That needs strategic overview, that needs the mayor to bring councils together...and he needs to do it soon."
On Monday the Metropolitan Police launched Operation Safeway and deployed officers to 166 key junctions during the city's rush hours to improve road safety.
In the first three days it issued more than 2,000 fixed penalty notices to motorists and cyclists for a variety of highway offences.
London Mayor Boris Johnson said: "This targeted operation has been hugely effective at raising awareness of road safety among motorists and cyclists.
"This is a balanced operation reminding everyone of their duty to take care of each other while out on the roads, and I hope the figures put to rest concerns by some groups that they are being singled out."
