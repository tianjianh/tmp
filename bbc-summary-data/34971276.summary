Martin Matthews, 48, and Bobby Smith, 33, used a ladder to gain access to the Queen's Gallery on Sunday afternoon.
They were arrested on suspicion of trespassing on a protected site after police officers were called to a report of a protest.
The Queen and Prince Philip are not thought to have been at the palace at the time.
A spokesman for the two men said they had scaled the roof at 15:15 GMT on Sunday.
Scotland Yard said its officers were called to the scene at 16:28 and that the men came down from the building of their own accord at about 23:00.
The men sat on a roof about 18ft (5m) high at the entrance of the public art gallery, which is located on a road to the side of the main gate to Buckingham Palace.
One of the men held a banner reading: "I'm Harry's dad. Stop the war on dads."
The protesters' spokesman said the demonstration was part of a campaign by the groups New Fathers 4 Justice and Stop The War On Dads.
They were campaigning over rights for fathers in divorce and separation proceedings and the reform of the family courts.
