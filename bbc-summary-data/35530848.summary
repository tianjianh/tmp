The 26-year-old is the fourth celebrity to drop out of the competition because of an injury.
Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle, actress Tina Hobley and Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington have also pulled out of the programme.
Vandelli was taken to hospital on Sunday after a fall while taking part in the show's Snow Cross challenge.
A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: "[Vandelli] received immediate medical attention but sadly will not be able to continue in the competition due to an ankle fracture, which has now been treated."
The Jump sees celebrities take part in various winter sports competitions, including ski-jumping, bobsleigh, and speed skating.
Tweddle had to have neck surgery after suffering a serious spinal injury on Saturday when she crashed into a safety barrier. She remains in hospital.
Holby City actress Hobley broke her arm in two places while Adlington dislocated her shoulder. All three have since left the series.
Athlete Linford Christie has also been forced to take time out due to a hamstring injury but remains in the competition.
Earlier in the week, Channel 4 confirmed it had asked producers to "review safety procedures again to further reduce the prospect of accident".
On Tuesday, Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards said producers were not solely to blame for the celebrities injuries, saying it was the contestants' own responsibility to train properly.
Tweddle described the days following her accident as "very scary" after the operation which saw surgeons take a bone from her hip and use it along with pins to fuse together two fractured vertebrae in her neck.
Rebecca Adlington told host Davina McCall the fall that caused her shoulder injury was "literally the worst thing that has ever happened to me, it was worse than childbirth".
