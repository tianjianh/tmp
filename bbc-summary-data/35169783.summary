[SN]TITLE[SN]
Child rapist jailed for 10 years over 'heinous crimes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A child rapist was jailed for 10 years on Wednesday after a judge condemned his "heinous crimes".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul White abused three girls during swimming excursions and subjected two of his child victims to rape.
One of the children was raped in a changing cubicle at a leisure centre in Perth.
A judge told White, 54, at the High Court in Edinburgh: "All three were in your company in the context of swimming or related leisure activity."
Kenneth Maciver QC told the rapist that he had been in a position which "you cruelly abused when you committed these heinous crimes".
The judge said it was recognised that the emotional and psychological effects of such crimes were "both significant and enduring".
"A lengthy custodial sentence is both necessary and appropriate for such serious sexual sexual offending," he said.
The judge said that in the circumstances of the case he could not impose an extended sentence - involving a prison sentence and further supervision.
He said this was because of "a legal lacuna" which he said should be dealt with to allow the imposition of such sentences for historic sexual offending.
He told White: "You have been convicted of the rape of two children - one of seven or under and the other of 10 or under."
White, formerly of Rintoul Avenue, Crieff, Perthshire, had earlier denied indecency offences and rape charges during his trial.
He was found guilty of indecency towards a girl aged between four and six between 1987 and 1990 at Perth Leisure Centre and Crieff Hydro Hotel Complex. He molested her in the swimming pool and tried to get into a cubicle while she was dressing.
He was also convicted of indecency towards another girl, aged six or seven, between 1990 and 1992 at Perth Leisure Centre and during a car trip. White also took the girl to a wooded area at Kinoull Hill, Perth, and raped her.
White was further convicted of raping a girl aged between nine and 10 at a changing cubicle at Perth Leisure Centre between 1997 and 1999.
White had denied the offences and when defence solicitor advocate Iain Paterson asked him if there was any truth in the allegations he replied: "No, none whatsoever."
During the trial jurors were sent home early at one stage after White failed to turn up and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was found to have attempted suicide.
The judge told the jury that he had been arrested in circumstances which gave him concern about his state of mind and he was assessed by a medical professional.
Mr Paterson told the court today that there was no suggestion of a mental health disposal in White's case.
He said White had "a history of self-harm" and added the court was dealing with a middle-aged man with no previous convictions.
White was earlier placed on the sex offenders' register.
