[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael van Gerwen moved two points clear at the top of the Premier League table with a thrilling victory over James Wade in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The world number one hit a 138 checkout in the last leg of the match to triumph 7-5.
Meanwhile, second-placed Peter Wright drew 6-6 with Dave Chisnall.
Adrian Lewis and Phil Taylor won to boost their play-off hopes, while Raymond van Barneveld thrashed Wade in the last match of week 10.
Van Barneveld had lost 7-3 to Taylor earlier on Thursday, but the Dutchman moved back above the 16-times world champion into third position in the table with a comfortable victory against Wade.
Lewis is only two points below the play-off spots following his win against former world champion Anderson, who slipped out of the top four and is in danger of missing out on a semi-final spot for the first time since 2013.
