County Championship: Rain thwarts Derbyshire against Nottinghamshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derbyshire were denied a chance of a first Championship win for two years as bad light and rain saw their match with Nottinghamshire end in a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rain delayed play until 13:45 BST and Notts, who resumed on 313-6, added only 36 runs to be dismissed for 349 as Tom Taylor (4-67) took three quick wickets.
Chasing 216 to win, Wayne Madsen scored 61 and put on 67 with Shiv Thakor (25).
Derbyshire were 190-5, needing 26 off 7.5 overs, when rain forced the players off for the final time.
It was harsh on Derbyshire who had seemed poised for their first Championship win over Notts since 2002.
After the visitors slipped to 36-2, Madsen and Thakor scored at more than five an over to swing the game in their favour.
With the victory target in sight, the players first went off for bad light which meant Derbyshire had nine overs to score the 36 required for victory.
The restart lasted seven balls and in that time Alex Hughes (24) was trapped lbw by Luke Fletcher (2-46), but heavy rain forced the players off the field again with Derbyshire agonisingly close to a famous win.
Notts move 13 points clear of second-placed Kent who did not play this week, while Derbyshire are eighth with 36 points from five matches.
Notts head coach Peter Moores:
"I think we have to give credit to them. Derbyshire were in a great position to win the game. It was unfortunate for them that the weather came at the wrong time, but credit to how they played.
"Now with all the weather apps around we get that many reports, but at the start of the day we knew we'd have a chance of some cricket.
"We prepared as if we were going to play but we wanted to get a lead of 250-270. They bowled well at us and it was a good run chase from them. They put us under pressure."
Derbyshire captain Billy Godleman:
"Obviously we are disappointed that we weren't able to play the game through and seal the victory.
"We've spoken internally about putting together quality first-class cricket across four days, not just a session or a day, so I'm really pleased the group were able to play good solid cricket across all four days.
"I think everyone has played their part. It has been a real team effort and everyone has contributed. We are just disappointed that the weather and light intervened and stopped us from a certain victory."
