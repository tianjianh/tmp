The 24-year-old becomes QPR's seventh signing of the summer transfer window.
Wszolek spent last season on loan with the Gialloblu from Sampdoria, and made the switch permanent this summer after Verona were relegated from Serie A.
"He is versatile and a very hardworking player," R's boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told the club website.
Meanwhile, midfielder Daniel Tozser has left Loftus Road after having his contract terminated.
The 31-year-old made 12 appearances for Rangers after joining from Watford on a two-year deal last summer.
