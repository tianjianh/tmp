The US Supreme Court is to hear a case regarding abortion law in Texas. It is to decide on whether a 2013 ruling stating that abortion clinics meet certain requirements is constitutional.
Dozens of clinics have closed as a result of the ruling, and researchers say self-induced abortions may increase if clinics continue to close.
Women typically use a pill called misoprostol to induce their own abortions. Here, one young woman explains why she crossed the border into Mexico, where the drug is cheaper and easier to obtain without a prescription.
