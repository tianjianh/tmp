A Swansea woman was killed in a freak accident in the driveway of her home when her car toppled on top of her, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jill Hutchinson-Grigg, 54, accidentally hit a low garden wall as she tried to reverse out onto the road in February.
Her Daewoo car was left balancing on the edge of the wall at her home in Morriston, until she climbed out and the vehicle fell on her.
A verdict of accidental death was recorded by the Swansea coroner.
The inquest was told that Swansea University worker was "pinned to the floor" by her Daewoo Kalos car.
She was found by neighbours who heard her cries for help, but died almost a week later in hospital.
Swansea coroner Colin Phillips said: "This is a very tragic and unfortunate accident.
"The vehicle was balancing between the upper and lower gardens, and when she attempted to alight, it must have shifted and trapped her."
