Non Stanford column: I am so happy to be part of Wales' magic weekend

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is a crazy weekend for Welsh sport, in the best way, with both the national football and rugby teams facing huge games and it is amazing to be able to play a small part in proceedings.

On Sunday I hope to fly the flag for my country, in my adopted home city of Leeds, in the latest World Triathlon Series event.
But first, it will be time to watch the football and rugby.
I love my rugby, so hopefully I can definitely get up and watch a bit of that.
Obviously it is fantastic to have a Welsh team at the Euros this summer, I would love to see Wales do well and I am really looking forward to them playing England.
There will be plenty of chat with the English guys I train with when it comes down to that game, we are doing a Euro 2016 sweepstake and ahead of the game, there will be so much excitement.
Let's hope Wales can finally undo England, otherwise, I might never hear the end of it. Even my flatmate Vicky Holland is English.
There are lots of Welsh girls already qualified for Rio, Welsh sport at the moment is really strong and Welsh women are at the forefront of that.
There are loads of names in the last few years that have come to the public's attention and it is nice to be involved in it all.
I draw inspiration from those girls, absolutely, it is hard to describe, but Welsh people will understand, I love looking out for my compatriots and seeing them doing well.
For example, I love my cycling and get excited every time I see Geraint Thomas doing so well, because he's Welsh. He's come through the same system as us and it inspires you.
And seeing Jade Jones win gold at the Olympics four years ago left a huge impression with me. How could you not be inspired by what she was doing?
It is pretty exciting to have a World Series race practically in my back garden.
The race goes nearly past my house, it is ten minutes from it at the most and it will literally be a case of running in front of a hometown crowd as well.
It will be fantastic, all the athletes from around the world have started descending on Leeds and it is great to be able to showcase the city to them and showcase why we love Leeds so much.
It has been so good to perform in London in the past and when Yorkshire had the Tour De France last year, they support the people showed for it was phenomenal.
So hopefully they will show similar enthusiasm for this event and it will give us a real boost.

My fitness is where I would I want it to be, touch wood the last few months have gone as they should and we are on track at the minute for peaking in Rio.
I have had some really good sessions in the past couple of weeks and I am feeling good about it, but everything at this point is a stepping stone towards the games.
In terms of my result in Leeds, I would love to do well, you start every race wanting to do as well as you can and that means a podium finish, it would be great to do that in front of a home crowd.
So that is my target, it is a hard course, but this is what we are used to, it is pretty undulating and will be tough, but not something to worry about.
But ultimately, much as it would be nice to get on that podium, it does not matter too much how I do this weekend. Like I say, it is all about building blocks for Rio.
