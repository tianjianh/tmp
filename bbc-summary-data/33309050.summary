Peacock worked as Derby's academy director for four years from 1998, but has spent 21 years at the Football Association either side of that spell.
"The chance to work once again at this fantastic club was an opportunity I couldn't decline," Peacock said.
The Rams have also named ex-Switzerland international Pascal Zuberbuhler, 44, as their goalkeeping coach.
Peacock and Zuberbuhler have joined manager Paul Clement's new-look coaching set-up and he said their experience would be crucial for his first season in charge.
Clement said: "John is an excellent coach and has a wealth of experience, having worked at the Football Association for a considerable amount of time.
"He is a key signing for me and I am really pleased that we have been able to attract such a highly-skilled coach to my backroom team."
Peacock worked in various roles at the FA and led the England U-17s side to two European Championship wins, in 2010 and 2014.
Zuberbuhler gained 51 international caps and won six league titles in his homeland, a well as playing for West Brom and Fulham in England.
Clement said: "He is an individual who has played at the pinnacle at not only club level, but for his country as well and has been part of sides that have gone on to be very successful.
"That sort of experience will be really important for us and it is something we can call upon to benefit the goalkeepers that we have at the club."
