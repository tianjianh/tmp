[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ariana Grande to get honorary citizenship of Manchester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ariana Grande is to get honorary citizenship of Manchester under plans put forward by the city council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council is proposing a new system to recognise outstanding contributions to the city.
The US singer is in line to be the first recipient for organising the One Love Manchester concert in aid of victims of the bomb attack at her gig, in which 22 people died.
An event to mark "selfless acts" after the blast is to be held, too.
Under the proposals for the new scheme, honorary citizenship of Manchester could be granted to those from outside Greater Manchester.
Council leader Sir Richard Leese, said many people would already consider Grande to be "an honorary Mancunian".
He said: "This seems a fitting moment to update the way we recognise those who make noteworthy contributions to the life and success of our city.
"We've all had cause to be incredibly proud of Manchester and the resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May - with love and courage rather than hatred and fear."
He said Ariana Grande had "exemplified this response".
Some 50,000 people went to the One Love Manchester concert at Old Trafford on 4 June, which raised almost Â£3m for victims of the Manchester Arena attack.
Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer at the end of Ariana Grande's concert.
Manchester City Council has also announced it would hold an event later this year to recognise the "great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit in the aftermath of the atrocity".
The authority said there was a need for a new system of honours in addition to the rarely-awarded freedom of the city, which will remain the highest honour the city can give.
The freedom of the city has only been awarded four times this century.
The plans will go before the council on 12 July.
