A career criminal abducted a six-year-old boy and attacked his grandmother after running naked through a busy Dundee toy store, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Przemyslaw Kaluzny is now facing a lengthy jail term after pleading guilty to the charges.
CCTV footage of the 41-year-old running naked through Toys R Us in April 2015 was shown in court.
It also emerged Kaluzny had been in a Polish criminal gang and has previous convictions for violent offences.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told he had previously served a series of jail terms in Poland for violent offences, including a four-and-a-half year sentence for robbery and 10 months for hostage taking.
He had also been a member of a gang that stole cars to order before he moved to Scotland in April 2014.
The court heard that Kaluzny had taken ecstasy that he found in a Kinder Egg on the street before running amok in the store on Easter Sunday.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told the court that two hours before the incident, Kaluzny had gone to a neighbours home where he "did not appear himself" and took the Class A drug before leaving in a car for the shop.
The CCTV footage played in court shows Kaluzny completely naked, calmly walking past shoppers in the store.
The six-year-old boy, who was with his father and grandmother, was in an aisle looking at toys when Kaluzny grabbed him.
Ms Robertson told the court: "Without saying a word and appearing calm, the accused approached them, and whilst still running he forcefully grabbed the boy with one arm, lifting him from the ground and proceeding to run off with him in his arm towards the front entrance door.
"He [the boy] immediately started crying hysterically and appeared petrified. The accused then went to leave the locus."
One store worker repeatedly rammed Kaluzny with a trolley before the boy's grandmother - who cannot be named to protect the boy's identity - hit him with her handbag.
Staff and shoppers then dived on top of Kaluzny as he struggled to get free.
Kaluzny, who is presently detained at Murray Royal Hospital in Perth, pleaded guilty on indictment to possessing an offensive weapon, behaving in a threatening and abusive manner, public indecency, abduction, assault, assault to injury and vandalism.
Defence solicitor Nicola Brown said Kaluzny had been part of a ring of "heavy duty" criminals before coming to Scotland to support a friend.
She told the court he had become "disillusioned" and had taken the green tablets he had found in the Kinder Egg as a "suicide bid".
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC deferred sentence for background reports and remanded Kaluzny in custody in the meantime.
