The 30-year-old, who joined Bayern in a Â£24m move from Real Madrid in 2009, was out of contract in 2015 but is now tied to the club until he is 33.
"There can be no better indication of how happy my family and I feel to be here," said the former Chelsea winger.
The Netherlands international has 10 league goals for Bayern this season.
He looks set to win a third title with Bayern, with Pep Guardiola's side currently 23 points clear, and has already won the league in England, Spain and his homeland.
"I'm delighted we've now signed the new contract and I'll continue pursuing trophies with FC Bayern," added Robben, whose scored the winner in last season's Champions League final at Wembley.
Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said: "Arjen has proved his worth to FC Bayern. He is a fundamentally important member of the team and will now remain so for the years to come."
