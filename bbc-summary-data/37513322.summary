[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenichi Phillips, 18, was targeted as he sat in a parked car driven in Birmingham on 17 March.
His brother Kwamae Phillips, who was driving, and passenger Khaleel Johnson, narrowly missed being injured by a second shot, the jury heard.
Disharn Downie, 18, and Dean Silvera, 37, are on trial charged with murder.
Birmingham Crown Court heard there had been a conversation between those in the car and the accused about "who was staring at whom".
A shot was fired and Mr Phillips staggered out of the car and collapsed in an alleyway where he was "left to die alone in a pool of blood", prosecutor Karim Khalil QC said.
A mobile hairdresser found the teenager by following a trail of his blood, having spotted the shattered window of the car.
A "significant quantity" of drugs were found both on the victim and in the vehicle.
Mr Khalil said both men who survived the shooting will deny the group were at the scene in St Marks Crescent, Ladywood, to deal drugs.
They fled on foot after the victim's brother crashed the car in a panicked attempted to get away.
Mr Downie, of Gravel Bank, Birmingham, and Mr Silvera, of Stamford Grove, Perry Barr, deny murder, attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.
Mr Silvera is also said to have assisted Mr Downie and a third man, Isaiah Mr Wright-Young, by driving them away from the scene.
The court was told the latter is "on the run".
The trial continues.
