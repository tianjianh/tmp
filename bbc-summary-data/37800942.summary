[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nice 4-1 Nantes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mario Balotelli continued his career revival in France with another goal as Nice beat Nantes to move six points clear at the top of Ligue 1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Italian, who has scored seven goals in his first seven Nice games, latched on to Jean Michael Seri's pass over the top to slot home their second goal.
The ex-Liverpool striker had a hand in the opener, Wylan Cyprien scoring after Balotelli was tackled.
Emiliano Sala pulled one back but Alassane Plea and Cyprien sealed it.
Balotelli has scored six goals in his first five games in the French league, having managed only two league goals in the previous two seasons for Liverpool, who let the 26-year-old leave for free on transfer deadline day, and AC Milan.
Nice, who have not won the league since 1959, are unbeaten in their opening 11 Ligue 1 games since the summer appointment of Lucien Favre. They are six points above rivals Monaco and third-placed Paris St-Germain.
