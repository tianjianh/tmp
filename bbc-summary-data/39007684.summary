Det Insp Gary McIntyre said: "At this early stage, the remains have been removed and will be examined in Greece to determine whether they belong to a female or a male."
Mr Cook's mother Pat told The Sun newspaper: "We have been told that a skeleton has been found - we don't know what to make of it. It was a shock to receive the call after all this time, it's upset all the family.
"But it's not the first time this sort of thing has happened. We are waiting to hear more from the Greek authorities."
