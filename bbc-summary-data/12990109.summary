Karen Edwards was joined by about 20 friends and family at the site where Becky Godden-Edwards was discovered.
They laid flowers and a white teddy bear in tribute to Miss Godden-Edwards, who would have been 29 on Monday. She had been missing for eight years.
Her remains were found in a field in Eastleach by police investigating the murder of 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan.
Taxi driver Christopher Halliwell, 47, of Ashbury Avenue, Swindon, has been charged with the murder of Miss O'Callaghan and is due to appear before Bristol Crown Court on Friday.
Officers said at a news conference on Tuesday detectives would be questioning Mr Halliwell as part of their inquiries into Miss Godden-Edwards' disappearance.
Mrs Edwards wrote on a card: "When you were born and put into my arms, I cried with joy.
"I love you so much. But today I am crying for you, my beautiful girl. I loved you the day you were born and I love you even more today.
"I was always there for you, my baby girl, words can't be said about how I feel. Sleep tight my darling. Love Mum and Charlie."
As the family paid their respects, they stood together with their arms around one another and hugged each other.
They stayed at the field at Baxter's Farm for 15 minutes before driving away.
Miss Godden-Edwards' family did not initially report her missing to the police as they thought she was living in the Bristol area.
It was not until 2007 they contacted the National Missing Persons Helpline.
