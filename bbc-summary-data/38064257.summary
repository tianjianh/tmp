The club is understood to owe other clubs fees for loan players and must pay a bill of Â£300,000 to HM Revenue & Customs in the next seven days.
"It's been widely reported and quite right that we are behind with some payments to other clubs," chairman Simon Corney said.
"I'm asking the fans not to get too concerned about it."
Corney added: "It's quite common in football and there are probably quite a lot of clubs in the same situation as us.
"The debts will be paid. There's no two ways about it. They always do get paid, we have to pay them."
Interim chief executive Mark Moisley said Oldham hope to have the embargo lifted for when the January transfer window opens.
Oldham are 22nd in League One with 16 points from 18 games this season after starting the campaign with just seven contracted players.
