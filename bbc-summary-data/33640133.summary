Bergdich has joined from Spanish side Real Valladolid for an undisclosed fee and has signed a four-year deal with the Championship club.
The left-back, 26, spent the second half of last season on loan at Genoa.
Ceballos, 22, was a free agent after his release by Tottenham earlier this summer and has agreed a three-year deal at The Valley.
The Spaniard did not feature for Spurs after joining from Barcelona in the summer of 2011 but spent the 2013-14 season on loan with Portuguese Primeira Liga side Arouca.
Bergdich, who spent three years with Lens before moving to Valladolid in 2013, has won 17 caps for Morocco.
"Cristian is a very technical player, who has a lot of quality and skill," Addicks boss Guy Luzon told the club website.
"We identified Zakarya as a player who possesses a lot of pace on the left side of the pitch."
The duo become Charlton's fifth and sixth signings of the summer, following the arrivals of Patrick Bauer, El Hadji Ba, Simon Makienok and Ahmed Kashi.
