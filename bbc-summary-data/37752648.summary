Aston Villa goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini says new boss Steve Bruce has instilled more confidence in the Championship club's squad.

After replacing Roberto di Matteo, former Birmingham City boss Bruce, 55, has steered Villa to back-to-back league wins for the first time in nearly 18 months.
"It's very pleasing," Gollini, 21, told BBC WM 95.6.
"The guys are pushing themselves very hard - they're doing a fantastic job."
Bruce, who left Hull City in the summer after guiding them to promotion back to the Premier League, is unbeaten after three games in charge of Villa.
A 1-1 draw with Wolves was followed by a 2-1 win at Reading and Saturday's 1-0 home victory against Fulham.
That run has taken Villa to within six points of the play-off places, with Bruce adamant promotion is a realistic target this season.
"Everyone knows he's a man with a lot of experience," Gollini said. "He's giving us the confidence we were missing and it's been really good so far - we just have to keep it going."
Villa face Bruce's former club Birmingham at St Andrew's on Sunday.
