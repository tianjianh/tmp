The event sees the eight best qualified men's singles players compete on hard court at London's O2 Arena.
This season's tournament begins 13 November and new world number one Andy Murray meets Marin Cilic a day later.
Barbara Slater, BBC director of sport, said the deal "shows our longstanding commitment to ensuring top class tennis reaches the widest possible audience".
She added: "The ATP World Tour Finals remains one of the standout moments in the sporting calendar bringing together the best players in the world to create a truly unique atmosphere."
Murray will face Stan Wawrinka and Kei Nishikori as well as Cilic in his group, with world number two Novak Djokovic - winner of this event for four straight seasons - drawn in the other group.
As part of the agreement with the ATP, eight singles matches will be available on BBC television, including one of the semi-finals and the final, while full radio commentary of the tournament is also available.
Jamie Murray and Brazil's Bruno Soares will play Treat Huey and Max Mirnyi in the doubles event, not before 18:00 GMT on Sunday.
BBC Sport will also offer radio and online commentary on ATP World Tour Masters 1000 matches.
London's O2 Arena has hosted the World Tour Finals since 2009 and will continue to do so until at least 2018.
