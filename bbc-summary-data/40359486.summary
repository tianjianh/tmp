The 20-year-old will be reunited with former team-mates Gary Taylor-Fletcher and fellow summer recruits Steven Hewitt and Luke Wall.
Midfielder Shaw spent part of last season on loan at Bangor.
"We are delighted with the signing of Brayden. He has experience of the WPL following his spell with the club last season," boss Kevin Nicholson said.
"We are excited about working with him in the upcoming season and expect him to positively impact our team."
Shaw extended his contract with Stanley earlier this summer and joins the Citizens for an undisclosed fee.
