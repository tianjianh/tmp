PM challenged over pilot's death in mid-air collision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron has been challenged over an Anglesey pilot's death in a mid-air collision between two RAF Tornados.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ynys Mon Labour MP Albert Owen questioned the prime minister as he set out the case for air strikes in Syria.
Mr Owen said Mike Poole, whose son Flt Lt Hywel Poole was killed in 2012, wanted to know whether RAF planes flying over Syria would have collision warning systems attached.
Mr Cameron said UK aircraft would have the most advanced equipment possible.
A service inquiry report into the accident found the lack of a collision warning system was one of 17 contributory factors to the accident over the Moray Firth in Scotland.
Mr Cameron paid tribute to Hywel Poole, who was 28 and from Llandegfan, and said the aircraft would have the best equipment available "to make sure they are kept safe".
