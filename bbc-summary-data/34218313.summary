Petra Laszlo said in a letter to the Magyar Nemzet newspaper (in Hungarian) that "something snapped" in her as migrants broke through a police cordon.
She said that she reacted out of panic and felt she had to "defend herself".
Prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the incident.
Ms Laszlo said: "I do not deserve the political witch-hunts against me, nor the smears or the death threats.
"I'm just a woman, and now an unemployed mother of small children, who made a bad decision in a situation of panic. I am truly sorry," she said.
The footage of Ms Laszlo kicking people and tripping them up, including a man carrying a small child, sparked outrage when it surfaced earlier this week.

She was sacked by Hungary's N1TV station, which is affiliated to the far-right Jobbik party.
The station said in a statement that she had shown "unacceptable behaviour".
Hungary has become a key transit point for migrants on the journey towards Western Europe, with more than 150,000 people arriving this year.
Hungary's leaders have been criticised for what has been perceived as a harsher stance than other European states towards migrants.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned of Hungary being "overrun" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's "Christian roots".
