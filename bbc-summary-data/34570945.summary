The 33-year-old, who led England to the semi-finals of the World Cup, is joined on a 10-person shortlist by Colin Bell (Frankfurt), Laura Harvey (Seattle Reign) and John Herdman (Canada).
Portsmouth-born USA coach Jill Ellis is also a contender.
USA trio Hope Solo, Carli Lloyd and Megan Rapinoe are among those shortlisted for player of the year.
Goalkeeper Solo, midfielder Lloyd and forward Rapinoe helped their team win the World Cup in July.
Lloyd's six goals meant she finished as joint top-scorer along with Germany's Celia Sasic, who is also shortlisted along with team-mate Nadine Angerer.
Japan captain Aya Miyama is also a contender, along with Ramona Bachmann (Switzerland), Kadeisha Buchanan (Canada) and France pair Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer.
The managerial shortlist is completed by Calle Barrling (Sweden Under-19s), Farid Benstiti (Paris St Germain), Gerard Precheur (Lyon), Norio Sasaki (Japan) and Thomas Worle (Bayern Munich).
"England fans may question why no Lionesses were nominated for this year's Ballon d'Or award after Sampson's team claimed bronze at this summer's World Cup.
"Manchester City defender Lucy Bronze in particular is a notable absentee. The right-back was rewarded for her two goals in Canada by being shortlisted for the Golden Ball - the award given to the best player at the tournament.
"Bronze, fellow defender and captain Steph Houghton, and goalkeeper Karen Bardsley were also named all in the World Cup All-Stars squad.
"Another name missing from the list is Scotland international Kim Little. The midfielder finished another prolific season with Seattle Reign in the USA as joint-second top scorer, as she continues to shine in the NWSL."
