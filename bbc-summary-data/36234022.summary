Ekeng fell to the floor in the 70th minute of a televised Romanian league match between Dinamo and Viitorul.
He was pronounced dead in hospital two hours later.
The Romanian Football Federation announced on Saturday the Romanian Cup final between Dinamo and Cluj would be put back a week to 17 May.
It said all games scheduled for this weekend would be postponed.
The Cameroonian FA confirmed Ekeng's death on Twitter on Friday, while his former club Cordoba tweeted: "We have no words to express our sadness at the loss."
Ekeng had also previously played for Le Mans and Lausanne.
In 2003, Cameroon international midfielder Marc-Vivien Foe died after collapsing during a Confederations Cup match against Colombia in France.
Fifa president Gianni Infantino said: "At moments like this, words seem insufficient. Messages I've read online from teammates, his club in Romania, and former teams, show just how highly Patrick was regarded."
