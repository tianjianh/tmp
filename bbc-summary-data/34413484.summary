Emergency services were searching for the women after they disappeared from the town of Lloret de Mar, in Spain.
Teams were alerted at 04:15 local time after the women - reported to be 33 and 36 - failed to return from a swim in the sea, a Spanish news website said.
The women are understood to be from Birmingham, a police spokesman said.
The UK Foreign Office said it was providing support to their families.
"We can confirm the death of two British nationals who had been reported missing in Lloret de Mar on 1 October," a spokesman said.
"We are providing support to the families and those who were travelling with the individuals at this difficult time."
Salvamento Maritimo, the Spanish search and rescue service, tweeted that the bodies had been found by a search helicopter two miles from Lloret de Mar, shortly after 12:00 local time.
They had been taken to the neighbouring town of Blanes, the service added.
Rock Badfrozien, from the local police force in Spain, told the Press Association news agency the pair were among a group of five women from Birmingham who were on holiday in the area.
"We don't know what has happened, but the sea was in very bad condition, with a red flag on the beach," he said.
"There was very drastic conditions, and it was dangerous to go in to the sea in those conditions."
