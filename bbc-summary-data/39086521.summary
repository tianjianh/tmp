[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 0-1 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth's automatic promotion hopes suffered a blow as Paul Cook's side slumped to defeat against lowly Crewe at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Ray's header 13 minutes from time capped a miserable week for Pompey after being held to a disappointing 1-1 draw by Morecambe on Tuesday.
Callum Cooke sent in a ball from the left and defender Ray rose highest at the back post to nod past goalkeeper David Forde.
Crewe would have been in front seconds before half-time but for Enda Stevens clearing a Ben Nugent header off the line after Forde flapped at a corner.
The visitors produced a stubborn defensive display, reducing Pompey to few clear-cut scoring opportunities.
Striker Eoin Doyle should have done better with a ninth-minute header which he sent over the crossbar from Stevens' centre.
Gary Roberts also curled a long-range free-kick narrowly over the frame of the goal while Kal Naismith could not keep his effort down after Kyle Bennett had crossed.
