Mr Adams was speaking at a 1916 Easter Rising commemoration in Rosslea, County Fermanagh, on Sunday.
He said Ireland needed "a peaceful rising to take control of the ideals of the proclamation and to put them into practice".
Mr Adams said the challenge for republicans was "to unite orange and green in equality and mutual respect".
"I believe next year's centenary events should be a catalyst for a national conversation on these issues," he added.
"Sinn Féin is committed to securing, in the time ahead, a referendum on Irish unity so that each and every one of us, working together, can build a new, dynamic country.
"Such a referendum should not be seen as threatening to any section of our community.
"All political objectives can now be pursued peacefully and democratically and in mutual respect.
"That is the great success of the peace process."
Several hundred people attended the event in Rosslea, which was one of a number of commemorations held on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Republic of Ireland, a ceremony took place on O'Connell Street in Dublin, which was attended by Irish President Michael D Higgins and the Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny.
