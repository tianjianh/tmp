Food giant Nestle has signed a deal to meet half of its UK and Ireland energy needs from a Scottish wind farm.

It has entered into an initial 15-year partnership with Community Windpower at its nine-turbine Sanquhar site.
The company said it was a "proud moment" and "another key milestone" in its efforts to become a sustainable business.
The development in Dumfries and Galloway is scheduled to open early next year.
Nestle said it already took all of its grid supplied electricity in the UK and Ireland from renewable sources.
However, chief executive Dame Fiona Kendrick said the new deal took things "a huge step further".
"This is a newly commissioned wind farm, generating new energy, creating capacity that didn't previously exist and capable of providing half of our electricity needs," she said.
Community Windpower said it was "delighted" to be working with Nestle while climate group RE100 said it showed that business demand for renewables was rising.
