Dorrie Kempsell and Ivy Peck celebrated the occasion at the care home in Exmouth, Devon where they both live.
The sisters, originally from Liverpool and supporters of rival football clubs, both married men named Ronnie.
The twins said getting lots of fresh air and being "interested in everything" were key to a long life.
Mrs Peck said: "We've always been active - cycling when we were much younger and we played games that kept us going."
The only time in their lives the twins have lived apart was when Mrs Kempsell lived with her husband.
When he died after seven years of marriage Mrs Kempsell moved in with her twin and her husband in Suffolk before moving to Devon.
Mrs Kempsell is a supporter of Everton Football Club while her twin has always supported Liverpool.
The sisters welcomed their matching cards from the Queen which Mrs Kempsell described as "lovely".
