Theo Walcott's second-half goal ensured Arsene Wenger's side added to last week's Barclays Asia Trophy triumph.
Walcott stabbed home with the outside of his boot after a delightful pass by 17-year-old Jeff Reine-Adelaide.
Wolfsburg's Josuha Guilavogui had a 25-yard drive pushed away by Cech, a Â£10m signing from Chelsea.
Cech has now helped Arsenal win two pre-season trophies in two games, and Arsene Wenger's side can make it a hat-trick of success ahead of the Premier League campaign if they defeat Chelsea next weekend.
Wenger made 10 changes to the side that started the 6-0 victory over Lyon, Mesut Ozil the only survivor from Saturday's match.
Cech, 33, was making his home debut and looked comfortable throughout against the German Cup winners.
Yet it was 17-year-old winger Reine-Adelaide who caught the eye, just as he did against Lyon.
Wenger had said the teenager is "something special" after he had made his senior debut the previous day.
Reine-Adelaide produced a quality slide-rule pass for Walcott to finish coolly to put Arsenal ahead in the 50th minute.
Wolfsburg, who finished second in the Bundesliga last season, had several former Premier League players on show, including ex-Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner.
Former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, after his side had fallen behind, fired high and wide when he should have done better, with Ricardo Rodriguez stinging the palms of Cech on the hour mark.
De Bruyne has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester City this summer but failed to impress.
Wenger introduced a number of substitutes including Aaron Ramsey and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but it was 19-year-old forward Chuba Akpom who forced a save as Arsenal looked to kill the game off.
