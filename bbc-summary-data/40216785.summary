General election 2017: Welsh politicians' antics

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Following the recent revelation the naughtiest thing Theresa May did as a child was to upset farmers by running through wheat fields, here is a snapshot of some of the antics Wales' politicians were involved in during the snap election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A row erupted between senior Welsh Tories after it emerged neither Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies nor Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns were taking part in a BBC Wales leaders' debate.
While Mrs May was criticised for not taking part in the UK debates, three different leaders took part in the ones in Wales, with a party source describing the situation as a shambles.
Don't mention Jeremy
First Minister Carwyn Jones was accused of seeking to airbrush Jeremy Corbyn out of Labour's campaign in Wales after failing to refer to him once when he launched the party's Welsh campaign.
Mr Jones said it was a Welsh event and he was fronting the campaign in Wales.
Pressed in the assembly on Tuesday, he said Mr Corbyn would make "an excellent prime minister".
Who's Natalie?
Paul Nuttall called Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood Natalie twice during an ITV debate, much to her annoyance.
Songs and drugs and rock'n'roll
Ms Wood admitted smoking cannabis in her youth and sang to Catatonia in the Victoria Derbyshire programme's "van share" series.
Devo acrobatics
Many parties were accused of playing fast and loose with what Westminster was and was not responsible for, and confusing voters in the process.
But, to give the party a mention, we will use Lib Dem leader Tim Farron as an example.
He attacked Conservative social care policy while visiting Wales, even though it only applies in England, insisting Tory plans had implications for cross-border farms.
