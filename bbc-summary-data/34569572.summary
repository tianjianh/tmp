[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The youngster needed medical treatment following an attack near Knighton Lane East, last week.
At Leicester Magistrates' Court earlier Ajay Jetha, who is charged with nine offences including two serious sex offences, was remanded in custody.
Magistrates ordered Mr Jetha's address should not be released for fear of a vigilante attack.
The boy, who was left "deeply distressed" by what happened, was attacked between 15:30 and 16:00 BST on Tuesday.
Mr Jetha, who was arrested on Friday, spoke only to confirm his name and age and was remanded to appear at Leicester Crown Court in November.
As well as the two sex assault charges he was also charged with false imprisonment, taking indecent images of a boy aged under 13, assault, possession of cannabis, and three charges of being in possession of indecent images.
