The Irishman led Edinburgh to the semi-final of last season's Heineken Cup but this term his team have won only four out of 14 RaboDirect Pro 12 games and lost all six of their European ties.
"I am very disappointed by the run of results this season," said Bradley, 50.
Edinburgh's defence coach Billy McGinty has resigned from his post.
His duties will be shared by Bradley, who will continue to coach until May, and forwards coach Neil Back, who joined the club in July last year.
I will put everything into the remainder of the season to help the club build for a brighter future
When Andy Robinson vacated the post in 2009 to become Scotland head coach, he was replaced by Rob Moffat.
Nick Scrivener was appointed as interim head coach when Moffat was sacked in January 2011 and when Scrivener returned to his native Australia, Bradley was handed the reins in May of that year.
"It's been an honour to be Edinburgh Rugby head coach and I'd like to thank my fellow coaches, management team, players, staff, fans and sponsors for their support these past two years," said Bradley.
"Building a strong club with a clear identity, which has shared ownership from the players, management, fans, sponsors and the community at large is the key driver of all successful teams and, for me, it is critical that this work continues and enables both the club and the team to reach its full potential.
"The undoubted highlight of my two years was the joy on the faces of all connected with Edinburgh Rugby when the final whistle went when we overcame Toulouse in last year's quarter-final of the Heineken Cup at Murrayfield.
"I will put everything into the remainder of the season to help the club build for a brighter future."
Scottish Rugby has now started to look for a replacement for Bradley for next season.
Its chief executive Mark Dodson issued a statement on the departures.
He said: "Michael and Billy have played a pivotal role in a number of memorable games at Murrayfield.
"In particular, last year's journey to the Heineken Cup semi-final in Dublin was a highlight.
"This season's results, however, have been below the standards expected by the club and its fans and we believe the time is right to begin the search for a fresh coaching team."
