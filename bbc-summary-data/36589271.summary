[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Appointed successor to Charlotte Edwards, Knight took 5-26 to dismiss the tourists for 165 in 45.4 overs.
Opener Tammy Beaumont hit 70, adding 96 with Knight as England cruised home with 18.1 overs to spare at Grace Road.
Knight is the first player to take five wickets and make a fifty in an ODI.
New Road hosts the second game of the three-match series on Wednesday.
The final ODI will be held at Taunton on Monday, before the sides play three Twenty20s.
Katherine Brunt needed only 19 balls to claim her 100th ODI wicket as Pakistan's innings began poorly after England won the toss.
But it was off-spinner Knight who starred, sparking Pakistan's slide from 93-3 by having Iram Javed caught by Lauren Winfield at first slip with only her second delivery.
Sidra Ameen was caught and bowled by the skipper for 52 off 79 balls, with captain Sana Mir following in the same fashion two balls later.
Number nine Asmavia Iqbal made 22 off 34 balls but Knight wrapped up the innings by having her caught at long-on two deliveries after removing Sania Khan.
Lauren Winfield perished to the first ball of England's reply and Georgia Elwiss was bowled for 12 to leave the hosts 33-2.
But Beaumont looked completely at ease and seized her opportunity at the top of the order, hitting four fours off five balls as she showed her early intent.
Iqbal removed Beaumont for 70 - her first ODI half-century - but by that time England required only 37 to win.
Sciver made an aggressive run-a-ball 27, completing a comfortable victory moments after Knight brought up her 70-ball fifty.
England captain Heather Knight: "I had some nerves this morning - it was a big day for me - but they settled quite quickly.
"I was dreaming of a hundred on debut. Getting a five-for never crossed my mind but it was great to start well.
"When I took the job I said I wasn't going to try and be another Charlotte Edwards and I'd do it my own way.
"Laura Marsh was outstanding in the middle and a few of my wickets were down to her."
