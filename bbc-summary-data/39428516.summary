Jo Pavey: Briton set to receive bronze from 2007 World Championships

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Jo Pavey is set to receive a 2007 World Championships 10,000m bronze medal after Turkey's Elvan Abeylegesse had her result chalked off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Athletics' governing body the IAAF said the silver medallist had been found guilty of an in-competition doping offence during the event in Japan.
Pavey, 43, was beaten to bronze by American Kara Goucher, who will now be upgraded to silver.
It is Pavey's first global medal having won Commonwealth and European medals.
The five-time Olympian is set to compete in this year's London Marathon with the aim of qualifying for the 2017 World Championships in London.
Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba, who won gold in the 10,000m at the 2007 Worlds, will also line up against Pavey during April's marathon.
The saga surrounding Abeylegesse dates back to 2015 when the IAAF announced 28 athletes who competed at the 2005 and 2007 World Championships had returned "adverse findings" from retested samples.
The Turkish Athletics Federation subsequently revealed that Abeylegesse was one of those under investigation. The Ethiopian-born runner was withdrawn from the 2015 Worlds as a consequence.
Her results from 25 August 2007 to 25 August 2009 have been removed, and the 34-year-old is retrospectively banned from 29 September 2015 to 28 September 2017.
