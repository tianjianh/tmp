A Swedish top-flight match was abandoned on Monday after Ostersunds goalkeeper Aly Keita was attacked by a pitch invader.

Ostersunds were drawing 1-1 at Jonkoping Sodra in the closing stages of their Allsvenskan match when the intruder ran on to the field and grabbed Keita, who fell to the ground.
Players and security tackled the man, who was escorted away.
Keita was given medical attention before being led off the pitch.
The 29-year-old later told reporters he had been struck in the temple, saying: "I am shocked and angry. It is awful that something like this could happen."
Match delegate Nicklas Bengtsson said Keita was "not fit" to play on.
Ostersunds coach Graham Potter, a former West Brom player, added: "Keita is shocked. He's not doing so well."
Police said a 17-year-old male had been arrested.
"He is under arrest, we have informed the prosecutor of the arrest and interviews will be conducted with him about the suspected breaches of the law," Jonkoping police commander Peter Nordengard added.
This was the second time a game in the Swedish top flight had been abandoned this year.
In April, Gothenburg's match against Malmo was halted when a firework exploded at the feet of a substitute who was warming up.
