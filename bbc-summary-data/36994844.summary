[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 1-1 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton are still looking for their first win of the new League One season after they drew 1-1 with Northampton at the Valley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Addicks skipper Johnnie Jackson's 57th-minute strike cancelled out Alex Revell's first-half header.
The Northampton hitman, who played for Charlton boss Russell Slade at Leyton Orient and Cardiff, scored after 16 minutes with a headed goal which saw the home side booed off at the break.
Alfie Potter picked out Revell with a looping cross and the forward steered his header across goal and found the back of the net.
Rob Page's men could have doubled their lead after half an hour but Harry Beautyman's header drifted just wide of the post.
Charlton came out firing in the second-half with Andrew Crofts and Nicky Ajose both unlucky not to equalise.
The Addicks' relentless pressure paid off when Ajose played in Jackson who coolly slotted home.
The result leaves Slade without a win as Charlton manager, while Northampton extended their unbeaten league run to 26 games.
