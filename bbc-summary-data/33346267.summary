The outlook for the UK's financial stability "has worsened" in the light of events in Greece, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned.

Risks in relation to Greece include a reduction in the risk appetite of businesses and a knock-on effect on households, Mr Carney said.
But the UK's direct financial exposure to Greece is "minimal", he said.
On Tuesday night, Greece became the first developed nation to fail to make a payment to the IMF.
The International Monetary Fund confirmed that Greece had failed to make a repayment equivalent to about â‚¬1.5bn (Â£1.1bn).
This week, Greece closed its banks and restricted cash withdrawals. On Sunday, the country is due to hold a snap referendum on the crisis.
