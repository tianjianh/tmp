Wes Burns: Fleetwood Town sign Bristol City striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Fleetwood Town have re-signed striker Wes Burns from Bristol City for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old was recalled by City on Monday from his loan spell at Scottish Premiership side Aberdeen.
The Wales Under-21 international spent three months on loan with the Cod Army last season where he scored five goals.
"It's been a long process on getting the deal done and over the line," he told the club website.
"It's good to be able to concentrate on this and hopefully reach the form I showed last season."
