Three of Scotland's five snowsports centres have reported having good snow conditions, but few skiers and snowboarders.

Glencoe Mountain said it has upper, mid and lower slopes open.
CairnGorm Mountain also has slopes open and expects fresh snowfalls over the weekend, while Nevis Range has good conditions for competent skiers.
Freezing temperatures and snow has been forecast for upland parts of Scotland this weekend.
Snow is not unusual in April and last year wintry conditions continued into May.
Heather Negus, of Ski-Scotland, said skiing and snowboarding in Scotland in springtime was often possible, but added that there was a "distinct lack of customers".
She said: "It is always the same at this time of year.
"We can offer great sliding, particularly on the upper mountains, but down in the valleys and in the cities, people see daffodils and cherry blossom and believe the ski season is over, but believe me it's not."
Meanwhile, the Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) said walkers and climbers should expect winter conditions on the highest mountains, including in Lochaber, Glen Coe, Cairngorms and on and around Creag Meagaidh.
It has warned that collapsing overhanging ledges of snow, known as cornices, could pose a risk in some places.
Collapsing cornices can cause avalanches.
