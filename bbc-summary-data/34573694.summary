Langley Mill flat fire: Father and sons deny murdering three

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father and his two sons have denied murdering three people - including a baby - in a flat fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amy Smith, 17, was killed with her six-month-old daughter Ruby-Grace Gaunt and friend Edward Green, 17, in the blaze at home in Langley Mill, Derbyshire.
Peter Eyre, 43, Anthony Eyre, 21, both of Central Avenue, Sandiacre, and Simon Eyre, 24, from Long Eaton, all denied three counts of murder.
Their trial is due to start on 12 January at Nottingham Crown Court.
The family spoke only to confirm their names and enter not guilty pleas before they were remanded back into custody.
Police said Ms Smith, Ruby-Grace and Mr Green all died from smoke inhalation in the fire in June.
