[SN]TITLE[SN]
A radical bid for parents' votes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is a bold promise to parents - 30 hours of free childcare for all two, three and four-year-olds in England by 2021.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the moment the poorest two-year-olds get 15 free hours of childcare a week in term time.
All three and four-year-olds can already get 15 free hours and, under existing conservative plans that is due to increase to 30 hours for working parents from September.
So Labour's proposals go much further, with all parents - in work or not - entitled to 30 hours by the end of the next parliament.
Overall it means better-off parents would benefit as much as those on lower incomes from a greater entitlement to free hours of childcare.
Some may see that as a subsidy to middle-class voters who will simply switch from paying for childcare to having free hours.
But research suggests it would be the poorest children who have most to gain from another promise - to increase the proportion of qualified graduates working in early years.
Quite how much is hard to tell, as there has been a move to improve the levels of qualifications.
A change which came into effect in April says staff with an A-level equivalent early years qualification should also have GCSE maths and English.
Labour says by the end of the parliament the additional  cost would be just over Â£5bn a year.
This doesn't include some of the other longer term promises included in the manifesto, such as extending free hours of childcare to one year olds.
That, it seems, is intended as a long term aspiration.
Nor does it include the extra money Labour says it wants to provide for Sure Start.
As well as offering more parents more free hours Labour also wants to make a radical change.
Instead of government money being given to parents through tax and benefit subsidies, under these plans it would go directly to childcare providers to help reduce the costs.
This would mean getting rid of all existing childcare subsidies for children under five - including universal credit, childcare vouchers and the new tax free childcare system.
No decision has been made about what would happen in the long term to existing subsidies for childcare for the over fives, which are just as essential for many parents.
So why the generous offer to parents?
The UK has some of the most expensive childcare in the world.
Although providing more free hours has had a relatively modest effect in encouraging more mothers to go out to work.
