Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) figures show medics spent 32,000 hours waiting at A&E departments in 2015-16 compared with 16,000 in 2014-15.
YAS said waiting time "was one of the most significant issues" it faced.
A shortage of available hospital beds has been given as one of the problems causing knock-on delays at A&E.
Dr David Macklin, Executive Director of Operations at YAS, said handover waiting times were "a system problem" for the NHS, not just in Yorkshire, and said blame could not be attached to individual hospitals.
"We have numerous occasions where we have multiple vehicles queued at hospitals," he said.
"Emergency departments across Yorkshire are working incredibly hard to manage their demand and that means sometimes ambulances are queuing.
"Patients who are not seriously injured may need to wait."
Professor Keith Willett from NHS England said the increase in waiting times was "concerning" and added there were "a multitude of reasons" for the rise.
"One of the biggest problems is the pressure on the beds in the hospital," he said.
"That's because the hospitals are finding it increasingly difficult to move patients and their care back into the community."
The figures were supplied after a Freedom of Information request by the BBC.
Just five hospitals - one each in East, South and West Yorkshire and two in North Yorkshire - accounted for about 70% of the total waiting time.
The handover time is counted only after 15 minutes have elapsed at A&E.
The number of hours spent by the YAS to handover patients was about 12,000 In 2013-14 and about 16,000 in 2014-15.
Hull Royal Infirmary (East Yorkshire)                   6,436
Northern General (Sheffield, South Yorkshire)     4,329
Pinderfields (Wakefield, West Yorkshire)              3,954
Scarborough  District General                              3,831
York  District Hospital                                           3,384
