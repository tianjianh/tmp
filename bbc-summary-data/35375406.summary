Edinburgh 'just need to focus on beating Grenoble' - Alan Solomons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh coach Alan Solomons has told his players to forget about qualifying scenarios and simply win their European Challenge Cup match in Grenoble.

Victory over the pool leaders will see the Scottish side go through as group winners, while a losing bonus point would see them qualify as runners-up.
But defeat by seven points or more, plus a bonus-point win for London Irish against Agen, would see Irish qualify.
"Our approach is we need to win; that is it," Solomons told BBC Scotland.
""We have got no thoughts of that [going through with a losing bonus point]. In order to get the result, we have to perform. Other permutations are of no consequence to us because they are factors that are outside our control."
Having reached the final of the Challenge Cup last season, reaching the knock-out stages for a second year would maintain the momentum at the capital club, with Edinburgh currently third in the Pro 12 and challenging for a play-off place.
"We have put in a lot of hard work," said Solomons. "I certainly had the vision for the club, and I had to get my feet under the table for the first few months and formulate that.
"The club had to be re-built, there was consensus about that. What is exciting now is to see the strong green shoots of what we are trying to achieve starting to come through."
Having seen a youthful line-up secure a bonus-point win against Agen last Friday, Solomons intends to field a "strong side" - including returning Scotland prop Alasdair Dickinson, after a six-game absence with a calf injury - to try to secure qualification at the Stade des Alpes on Saturday.
"Our goal in the Pro12 is to make the top six while our goal for the Challenge Cup is to make the play-offs and then to go on from there," the coach added.  "You have to respect both competitions. I think that is important. We are capable of multi-tasking.
"It will be a tough game, there is no question about that. They are a good side and are at home. We have a long trip ahead of us but everyone is looking forward to it. They know the importance of the game."
