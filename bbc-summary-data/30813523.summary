Limestone fix for Llandudno sea defences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coastal repair work is needed along the sea front at Llandudno in Conwy, councillors have been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sea defences along the west shore need to be bolstered to prevent flooding during future storms.
The plan is to bring in 3,000 tonnes of limestone to the seafront near West Parade.
A report to planners say the method has proved "very effective" and is aimed at stopping waves overlapping the sea wall and flooding gardens of nearby homes.
It says coastal erosion has been "accelerated" by winter storms.
But Natural Resources Wales has advised that any shingle used as part of the work should be brought in from elsewhere and not moved from other parts of the beach, to protect habitats.
If it gets the go ahead, the work would take place outside the main tourist season.
