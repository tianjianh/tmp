The company says its Dtek50 smartphone offers improved security over rival Android devices, and will cost less than its previous handset Priv.
It is the firm's second Android handset after switching focus away from its struggling BB10 platform.
One analyst said the phone was the "right move" but that the company still faced an "uphill battle" with devices.
