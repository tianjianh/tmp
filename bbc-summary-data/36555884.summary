The 21-year-old has struggled for game time but has scored twice in four outings in Australia.
Burgess came through the Wigan academy and finished as their top try scorer in his final year in Super League.
"I'm proud to say that I had a go at the NRL," Burgess, who will join on 1 December, told the Wigan website.
"It didn't go perfectly to plan and I'd definitely consider giving it another go but, for now, I'm looking forward to coming home.
"I really want to win some silverware with my hometown club and that is definitely the aim when I return. I'm also looking forward to enjoying some of my mum's cooking."
He won three England caps on the back of his impressive form for the Warriors and will help cover the loss of Josh Charnley who is moving to rugby union side Sale Sharks.
Burgess, who scored in Wigan's losses in the 2014 and 2015 Grand Finals, had vowed to return to the club before the end of his career.
