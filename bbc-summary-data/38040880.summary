Ian Holloway: QPR boss avoids 'blubbering weasel' look after composing himself

Ian Holloway says the reception he got from QPR supporters on his return as boss at Loftus Road almost made him look like a "blubbering weasel".

The 53-year-old won the first game of his second spell in charge of the R's as his side beat 10-man Norwich 2-1.
"I had to compose myself before I went out," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I had to look the part. Hopefully I looked like a swan, as it was a privilege and an honour to be stood in the dugout again."
Rangers were 2-0 up inside 30 minutes through Conor Washington and Sebastian Polter, after the Canaries had Martin Olsson sent off in the second minute.
"The fans singing 'we got our Rangers back' really meant something to me," added Holloway, who was previously in charge of the west London club from 2001 until 2006.
"That's the thing that made me more proud about today. I will have a tear about it later on."
Holloway said he was "dizzy" following a "rollercoaster" return to management, having been working as a television pundit since his sacking by Millwall in March 2015.
"To be out for 18 months and watch other people's creations and dissect them, no matter what you do, you can't get the same kind of buzz," he said.
"I was elated, disappointed, then re-elated and I have to try to be solid for the lads."
