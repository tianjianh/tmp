Pathologists found multiple fractures in Ms Mann's neck, a pattern "commonly found in people strangled," jurors were told during the trial.
The court heard Ms Mann's brother became worried when he could not contact her and went to his sister's first-floor flat on Chapel Street and found her body.
Mark Haywood QC, prosecuting, told the court Sterling attempted to murder Mr Tyndale on 11 July 2015 after learning of his ex-partner's relationship.
The men went drinking at Sterling's flat where Mr Tyndale, 52, was attacked, with Sterling "forcing a knife into his neck, trying to choke him", the court was told.
Mr Tyndale managed to escape and later went to hospital where he had an emergency operation.
He did not inform police about who attacked him - instead claiming a stranger assaulted him in the street - fearing his affair would become known to his wife, the court heard.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Sterling then persuaded Ms Mann to move in with him, where she remained for a month before returning to her home on 24 August.
Sterling discovered that Ms Mann had seen Mr Tyndale and he went over to her flat and killed her.
He tried to cover his tracks by cleaning her flat but left his footprints on the freshly mopped floor. His DNA was also found on a plastic beaker he had used in the property.
David Parsons, from West Midlands CPS, said "jealously and rage took hold of him".
