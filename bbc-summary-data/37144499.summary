The 2013 world champion finished fourth, three seconds behind housemate and training partner Holland who overtook Stanford in a sprint finish.
Reigning world champion Gwen Jorgensen of the USA took gold with Switzerland's Nicola Spirig collecting silver.
"I'm absolutely delighted that Vicky got the medal," said Stanford.
"We came here as a team to get a medal and we've walked away with one.
"I gave it everything and I don't think I could ask much more of myself.
"Maybe I didn't play it tactically right. Fourth is probably the worst place to come but it's still fourth at the Olympics.
"We have one medal in the house now, so we can put it on display."
Two-time world champion Helen Jenkins finished in 19th place as she competed in her third Olympics.
"I just felt a little bit off the last couple of days and I just didn't have it today," she said.
"But it's the Olympics and I just gave it everything and that was the best I could do today."
The Welsh athlete was reigning world champion when finishing fifth at London 2012.
Four years earlier Jenkins was 21st on her Olympic debut in Beijing.
Welsh athletes have claimed a record four gold medals at Rio 2016 and 10 medals overall.
