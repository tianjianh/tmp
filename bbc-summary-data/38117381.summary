The blaze broke out at a property on Mill Croft, Wolverhampton, just after 10:30 GMT on Thursday.
The occupant, 37-year-old Lisa Skidmore, was found in a first-floor bedroom. A post-mortem test has since revealed she died from strangulation.
Police said they believed a man assaulted her before setting fire to the room and making his escape.
Ms Skidmore's 80-year-old mother was also found injured at the property.
She was treated for severe facial injuries and officers said they believed she disturbed the intruder, who then assaulted her.
West Midlands Police said they were looking for a black man in his 20s, about 5ft 6in tall, with a medium build. He was described as wearing a dark-coloured, long-sleeved jacket, dark trousers and leather gloves.
