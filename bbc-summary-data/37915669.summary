Commuters using Thameslink and East Midlands Services were worst hit, with warnings of delays of up to 90 minutes.
A spokesman at Network Rail said a piece of cable came into contact with overhead electric lines at Luton station, causing them to suspend connections.
Links to Gatwick Airport were also affected. The company apologised.
Stranded passengers took to social media, with one commuter in St Albans claiming crowds were "milling around clueless".
Network Rail said travellers could use their Thameslink tickets to get home on connected rail and underground services.
Earlier, a Network Rail spokesman said: "Due to a piece of cable coming into contact with the overhead electric lines at Luton station we are currently unable to run trains through the area.
"We are working to repair the problem and get trains running again as soon as possible with Network Rail teams currently on site.
"We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and advise that passengers travelling through Luton this evening check with their train operator before they travel."
The disruption was expected to continue until the end of service on Tuesday.
