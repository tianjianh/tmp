[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 0-0 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton missed the chance to move four points clear of third-placed Fleetwood as they were held to a drab draw by relegation-threatened rivals Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts edged a tame first half before Bury forced Mark Howard to tip James Vaughan's header over the bar.
Wanderers finally showed urgency in the last 15 minutes, with Joe Murphy saving David Wheater's long-range volley.
Adam le Fondre struck the underside of the bar and Filipe Morais' free-kick went close but the Shakers survived.
The point ends a three-game losing run for Lee Clark's side, moving them two points clear of the drop-zone, while second-placed Bolton are winless in three as they look to seal automatic promotion to the Championship.
To make matters worse for the Trotters, midfielder Darren Pratley was forced off in the closing stages with a head injury.
Meanwhile, Bury winger Jack Mackreth was an unused substitute after being recalled from his loan at Macclesfield earlier on Tuesday.
