The Ashes hero is a Nottingham Forest fan who saw his team beaten 8-1 by Manchester United on his first trip to the City Ground in 1999.
"I remember the guy who was sat in front of us arrived late and left early to avoid the traffic, and he missed about five goals," Broad told BBC Sport.
"So it was a bit of a learning experience - now I always make sure I get to a game early and stay until the end."

Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, including one perfect score.
His score of 80 points saw him beat ex-F1 driver Mark Webber, who picked five correct results with no perfect scores, for a total of 50.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
