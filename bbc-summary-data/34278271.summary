Hillsborough inquests: Fan 'made mistake' telling parents he cradled victim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Liverpool fan who told grieving parents he had "cradled" their dying son at Hillsborough said he now believes it was another young victim.

The new inquests heard John Owen visited the parents of Henry Rogers, 17, at their home in Cheshire five days after the tragedy on 15 April 1989.
But Mr Owen now says he was mistaken and he had been with an unknown victim.
Henry Rogers was one of 96 football fans fatally injured in a terrace crush at the FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield.
The jury heard how Mr Owen and David Roland - who had also been at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest - tracked down Veronica and Stephen Rogers after they had seen Henry's picture in a newspaper.
He said he wanted to offer "comfort" to his parents.
Patrick Roche, representing Mr and Mrs Rogers, asked Mr Owen if he had made the visit "to tell them that Henry had not died alone".
Mr Owen agreed.
Mr Roche then asked: "Do you still think that what you told them was correct?"
He replied: "No."
He also said Mr Roland accompanied him for "support" because "it's something I didn't want to do alone".
Asked why he believed his original account was wrong he said: "The accounts I gave first were probably quite rushed and quite hazy. The only thing that I could remember with any great certainty is that I had seen Henry Rogers on that pitch on that day."
Mr Owen said he now believes he dealt with two casualties - one an unnamed young man who died in his arms, and the other was Henry, whom he helped carry across the pitch.
Part of a statement Mr Owen gave in 1989 was read to the court, in which he described coming across Henry on the pitch.
In the statement, he said: "I took his hand and asked him if he was all right. I lifted his head up.
"I think he was still alive then but he didn't say anything. I saw his eyes roll backwards and he died in my arms."
Mr Owen, who was 30 at the time, said that was "not his current recollection".
Mr Roland said he continued to believe both he and Mr Owen were with Henry when he died and he disputed he only went to see Mr and Mrs Rogers to "support" Mr Owen.
The court heard how Henry went to the match with his older brother, Adam, and two friends.
Adam also died six months after the disaster. His parents believe the trauma of the day and losing Henry contributed to his death.
None of the group of friends had tickets for the match and, in part of Adam's 1989 statement, he described how, as they tried to buy tickets from touts outside the ground, they were swept into the crowd at the turnstiles.
They went into the ground through an opened exit gate, down a tunnel into pen three, and within seconds were caught in a crowd surge that separated them.
Adam went on to describe how he escaped on to the pitch, searched for his brother at the stadium and then caught a train back home.
Karl Knights, who was a sergeant with South Yorkshire Police in 1989, said he climbed into the enclosure, gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Henry and then carried him on to the pitch.
The officer helped carry him into the gym where a doctor confirmed his death.
The inquests, sitting in Warrington, Cheshire, are due to resume on Tuesday.
