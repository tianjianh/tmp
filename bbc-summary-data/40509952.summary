Fines considered for leaving cars running outside schools

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents could be fined for leaving cars running outside schools in Sheffield to try to cut down on toxic fumes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City councillors have started gathering views on the idea following guidance issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
NICE and Public Health England said "no idling" zones should be set up outside schools to help improve air quality.
The consultation also asks if other locations should be considered, including care homes and hospitals.
A similar ban outside schools has already been introduced in London where Westminster Council hands out Â£80 fines to "car idlers".

Jack Scott, Sheffield City Council's cabinet member for transport, said polluted air was a "major public health hazard".
He added: "There's no reason for drivers to leave engines idling at any time, but especially near schools, care homes and hospitals."
To introduce fines the council would have to establish no idling zones using a local by-law.
Becky Webb, head teacher at Tinsley Meadows school in Sheffield, welcomed the consultation.
She said: "Air quality remains a major issue for many schools in the country and idling cars are a big part of the problem.
"I hope lots of parents and schools across the city let their views be known."
The consultation in Sheffield closes on 31 August.
