Moray Council allows whisky tasting measures to shrink

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Smaller measures of whisky can be drunk at tastings and distillery tours, after new guidance was issued in Moray.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council area includes Speyside, where dozens of distilleries attract thousands of visitors every year.
The annual Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival, which runs from 28 April to 2 May, has welcomed the move, which will allow drinks to be served in 10ml measures rather than 25ml.
The new guidance follows consultation with Police Scotland.
Rhona Gunn, Moray Council's director of economic development, infrastructure and planning, said: "In Moray Speyside we have half the total number of distilleries that exist in Scotland, so it's appropriate that we should be taking the lead on this.
"The guidance says that where whisky is supplied in the context of a genuine whisky tasting event, and the marketing and other information provided to customers makes it clear that sample measures will be provided, then it is unlikely that the council's trading standards service would take the view that full measures were required.
"Police Scotland will assess the need for a licence on a case-by-case basis with a pragmatic view being adopted where appropriate.
"This applies to any tours, tutored tastings and events where alcohol is dispensed as part of the overall package".
James Campbell, of the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival, said: "This guidance from Moray Council will greatly enhance the experience of visitors attending our events.
"The Festival is a staunch advocate of responsible drinking, and we have campaigned for some time for our event providers to be allowed to serve smaller 10ml measures where it is deemed appropriate.
"We hope that the pioneering view taken by Moray Council will be mirrored by local authorities across Scotland."
