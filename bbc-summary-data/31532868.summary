Five teenagers have been charged with vandalising hundreds of Jewish graves in France in an anti-Semitic attack.

The suspects, aged 15 to 17, are accused of the "desecration of burial places due to the religion of the deceased".
Tombstones were pushed over and vaults opened at the cemetery in the north-eastern town Sarre-Union last Thursday.
Local prosecutor Philippe Vannier said the vandalism appeared to be part of a game that went wrong.
Images on social media also showed graves daubed with swastikas and Nazi slogans. Some 250 were damaged.
Mr Vannier said on Wednesday there was a clear "anti-Semitic motive" behind the act.
Four of the boys have been assigned to juvenile centres, while a fifth has been placed in the care of "a trusted individual", he added.
