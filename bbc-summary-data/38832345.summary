The Giants fought back from two goals down and will have home advantage when the Elite League's top two sides meet again on 8 February.
The sides were locked at 4-4 going into the final minute of the match.
Jim Vandermeer got the late goal, putting Belfast into the lead for the first time.
There was a controversial start to the match as Belfast's player-coach Derrick Walser was given a 10-minute penalty for 'skating before the end of the anthem'.
Layne Ulmer's powerplay opener and a second goal by Gleason Fournier had Cardiff in command at Ice Arena Wales but Colin Shields netted on the powerplay, from Walser's pass, to make it 2-1.
Guillaume Douicet restored Cardiff's two-goal cushion before Chris Higgins got a second for the Giants.
Joey Martin, though, made it 4-2 right at the end of the second period with the Giants claiming time was actually up before the goal was scored.
The Giants, one point behind the Devils at the top of the league, scored three without reply in the third period, the goals coming from Shields, Brandon Benedict and Vandermeer.
