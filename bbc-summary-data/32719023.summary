[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of missing Ben Needham is to make a new appeal on Greek television over the disappearance of her son 24 years ago.

Ben, from Sheffield, vanished when he was 21 months old during a family holiday on the island of Kos.
Kerry Needham has travelled to Athens with South Yorkshire Police to appear on a missing persons programme.
Mrs Needham will also meet the British ambassador to Greece, John Kittmer, to discuss her son's case.
Earlier this year, South Yorkshire Police was granted Home Office funding to support the Greek authorities in continuing inquiries to find Ben.
The television programme, the English translation of which is Light at the End of the Tunnel, broadcasts to about 50% of the Greek TV audience.
Ben's grandmother Christine and his sister Leighanna will also participate in the programme, to be shown on Friday.
In a statement tweeted from @FindBenNeedham, the account of the family's campaign, Kerry Needham said: "As part of Operation Ben I have arrived in Athens this morning with my family and detectives from South Yorkshire Police.
"During our five days here we will be meeting the British ambassador for the first time in 23 years to discuss Ben's case."
The statement continued: "We sincerely hope this will lead to more people coming forward with new information and will help the British and Greek police investigate the whereabouts of Ben."
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: "We have the deepest sympathies with Ben Needham's family and continue to offer them consular support. We are following this case closely and will fully assist South Yorkshire Police wherever possible."
Ben vanished on 24 July, 1991, after travelling to Kos with his mother and grandparents, who were renovating a farmhouse in the village of Iraklise.
In 2013, a DNA test carried out on a man in Cyprus proved he was not Ben.
Mrs Needham has always maintained her son is alive and was probably abducted.
