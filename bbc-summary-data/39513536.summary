The proposals have been welcomed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has been meeting representatives of the company in New York.
The new hotels will include five Marriott brands - W Hotels, Moxy, Aloft, Courtyard and Residence Inn.
They will boost the group's room count in Scotland by almost 75%.
The expanded portfolio will include a W hotel in Edinburgh and three Moxy hotels at unspecified locations.
Marriott said it remained "optimistic for the future growth of our company and hospitality overall in Scotland".
Ms Sturgeon, who has been on a five-day visit to America to promote trade and investment, said: "Despite the uncertainty brought about by Brexit, Scotland's economy and tourism sectors remain strong and I am delighted that big businesses like Marriott International are choosing to show their confidence by investing here.
"Scotland's performance in hotel markets is exceptionally strong, with latest figures showing that we are outperforming 11 of the main 12 European hotel markets, including Paris, Madrid and Berlin - only London was higher."
