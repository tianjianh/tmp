Sadulaev, 20, won 5-0 against his 26-year-old opponent to add to Russia's two Greco-Roman golds, won by Roman Vlasov and Davit Chakvetadze.
The result was a repeat of Sadulaev's 2015 World Championship win over Yasar in Las Vegas.
Azerbaijan's Sharif Sharifov and USA's J'den Cox won bronze.
Sharifov beat Venezuelan Pedro Fuentes, while Cox saw off Cuban Reineris Salas, who pulled out with six seconds remaining of the fight, seemingly in protest at the American being awarded two points from a challenge.
