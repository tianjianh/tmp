It follows the recent attacks in Paris and also in Mali, where 22 people were killed in a raid on a luxury hotel last week, couturier Alphadi said.
About 1,000 designers, models and celebrities were due to attend.
Niger is battling the Nigerian-based jihadist group Boko Haram in the south-east of the country.
Since February, hundreds of people have been killed by the Islamist militants in Diffa region, which borders Nigeria.
The last Fima show in 2013 was held under tight security amid fears of an attack by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb  (AQIM).
Alphadi, whose real name is Seidnaly Sidhamed, said the four-day festival would take place "very soon", without giving a date.
Apart from musicians and designers, footballers Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon and Ivorian Yaya Toure were expected for this year's launch which was due to take place at Niger's biggest stadium, the AFP news agency reports.
