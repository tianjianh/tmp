Southend United: Daniel Bentley offers 'derisory' - Phil Brown

Southend United manager Phil Brown says offers made for goalkeeper Daniel Bentley have been "derisory".

The 22-year-old broke a club record with 12 consecutive home clean sheets last season.
"The offers have been derisory to say the least, the enquiries have not, but we haven't had concrete bids from those conversations," Brown told BBC Essex.
"We have from QPR but it was insignificant. It was knocked back in no uncertain terms."
Bentley helped Southend win promotion to League One via the play-offs last term, with the keeper's save from Wycombe's Sam Wood in a penalty shootout at Wembley sending Brown's side up.
He also won both the supporters' and players' player of the year awards for 2014-15.
"I don't think the bids are going to go away and his career is well and truly off and running," said Brown.
"All you can do is give advice. Do you recommend he goes to sit on his backside in the Premier League and wait for a top-class goalkeeper? Before you know it he's 26 and played no more games.
"At this moment in time, he's on the right path."
Brown added he was keen to sign another striker, and says they are looking at options including Crawley's Izale McLeod and Charlton's Joe Pigott - who scored at Wembley while on loan with the Shrimpers last season.
"Conversations have been ongoing with players, agents and clubs," said Brown. "There are two or three clubs interested in Izale McLeod and one of them has put in a substantial bid on the table for him.
"If you look at his record, he's played at a higher level and scored goals, so it would be a significant signing if we can get our hands on him.
"And obviously the Joe Pigott situation has been ongoing over the last four weeks, to which we had a little bit of a guided message with Charlton on Wednesday that could make it important we get him in before Saturday."
