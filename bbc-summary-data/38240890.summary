Celtic charged over crowd disturbances at Man City in Champions League game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uefa have charged Celtic in connection with crowd trouble during the 1-1 draw at Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visiting supporters are alleged to have set off fireworks and caused other crowd disturbances.
It is the 10th time in the past five years the club have been charged by European football's governing body regarding their fans' behaviour.
Uefa's disciplinary body will examine the case on 23 February.
It is Celtic's second Uefa charge this season. They were fined 10,000 euros (Â£8,535) after the Glasgow side's supporters displayed Palestinian flags during their Champions League qualifier against Israeli side Hapoel Be'er Sheva in August.
The draw in Manchester saw the hosts progress to the last 16 in second place, while Celtic finished bottom of the group.
