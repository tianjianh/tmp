Life sciences £100m fund in Wales open for business

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £100m fund to help boost hi-tech medical and pharmaceutical companies in Wales is open for business.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Half the money for the Life Sciences Investment Fund is being provided by the Welsh government.
The rest will be raised by a company set up to run the fund and led by Welsh biotech entrepreneur Sir Chris Evans.
Ministers hope it will boost growth, create jobs and raise Wales' global profile as a base for life sciences - the study of living organisms.
It is one of the key sectors targeted by the Welsh government as having the potential to grow.
The Welsh government says life sciences - which includes pharmaceutical and medical technology firms - employs 15,000 people in Wales and is worth £1.3bn to the economy.
Ministers have previously spoken about their desire to make Wales an attractive place for scientific research and development.
Economy Minister Edwina Hart said: "Wales has significant opportunities in life sciences and we are determined to make the most of them.
"Life sciences businesses can grow very quickly in a global and growing market and we know the rewards for success are huge.
"A small number of successful businesses - compared to other sectors - can generate a great deal of economic value for Wales."
Based in Cardiff, the fund will be run by Arthurian Life Sciences, chaired by Port Talbot-born Sir Chris Evans.
He has stepped down as chairman of the Welsh government's life science sector panel which advises ministers on the industry.
Arthurian won a tender to run the fund and has committed to raising £50m for the project.
Sir Chris said: "I am delighted that through Arthurian, Wales now has its first genuine Life Sciences Fund up and running.
"It is fully active, FSA-regulated, cash in the bank, experienced fund management professionals running it and an excellent board of immensely successful individuals to govern and guide the fund over its lifetime."
