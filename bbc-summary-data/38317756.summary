James Davies: Three week suspension rules flanker out of holiday derbies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets flanker James Davies has been suspended for three weeks by a disciplinary panel after admitting swearing and making an obscene gesture in the 31-20 loss at Toulon.

The 25-year-old will miss next Sunday's European Challenge Cup match with Toulon and the Welsh derby games against Ospreys and Cardiff Blues.
The panel felt the offence was at the "low end of World Rugby's sanctions".
The player will now face a further disciplinary process at the Scarlets.
However, the region say the player's contract will not be terminated.
A statement by Scarlets general manager Jon Daniels said: "Whilst our internal disciplinary process may find further sanctions are appropriate, removing James from his rugby community through contract termination is not in anyone's interests."
Head coach Wayne Pivac had warned on Tuesday that "all sorts of things right up to dismissal" were possible punishments.
Davies, who won an Olympic silver medal as part of Team GB's sevens team in Rio, apologised for his actions before facing the independent disciplinary panel.
He was warned for swearing by referee Greg Garner during the first half of the match at Stade Felix Mayol and appeared to make a gesture.
The offence carries a range of bans from four weeks to a year depending on seriousness.
The summary of the adjudication issued by European Professional Club Rugby said the panel had taken into account "Davies' guilty plea and timely expression of remorse".
Scarlets issued a statement on Monday in which Davies said: "During the heat of battle I lost my composure and said and did things I deeply regret.
"I apologised to referee Mr Garner both during and after the game but would like to reiterate my sincerest apologies publically."
The region said Davies had volunteered to be an ambassador for a Welsh Regions initiative to support disaffected young people and had visited a children's ward at West Wales General Hospital with team-mates after attending the tribunal on Wednesday.
