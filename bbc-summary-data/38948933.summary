It's not that different to us but the nail clippers are a bit bigger!
It's just an udder day for Charlie Davey - he's the man who travels across Cornwall doing this job.
He uses a special machine to pick the animals up and turn them around so he can get at their feet.
Looking after their feet is important for cows' health - it allows them to walk comfortably and helps to stop infections.
