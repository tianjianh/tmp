Bloody Sunday: March date for police to question ex soldiers on 1972 shootings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The PSNI has confirmed it will begin questioning former soldiers about the killings of 13 people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972 next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eight former members of the Parachute Regiment will be questioned.
The interviews will take place in Britain after the former soldiers won a court action preventing them being arrested and taken to Northern Ireland.
Thirteen people were killed when British paratroopers opened fire on a civil rights march in Derry in 1972.
A fourteenth person died later.
Bloody Sunday was one of the most controversial days in Northern Ireland's history.
In 2010, Prime Minister David Cameron apologised to the Bloody Sunday victims on behalf of the state, after a long-running public inquiry unequivocally blamed the Army for the civilian deaths.
The inquiry, led by Lord Saville, took 12 years to complete and exonerated those who died.
It concluded that soldiers fired the first shot and gave no warning before opening fire on the civilian marchers.
The Saville Report also found that some of those killed or injured were clearly fleeing or going to help the injured and dying.
Accepting the findings of the 2010 inquiry, Mr Cameron described the killings as "unjustified and unjustifiable" and said he was "deeply sorry".
