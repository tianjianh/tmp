[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of people rescued by the RNLI across Wales has reached an eight-year high, new figures show.

Lifeboat crews helped 1,244 people in 2014 - an 8% increase on the previous year - and the highest figure since 2006.
Whitmore Bay in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, was the busiest for beach incidents, while Porthcawl in Bridgend county was the busiest station.
The most common reason for callouts was people getting cut off by the tide.
RNLI lifeguards in Wales had a busy summer 2014, responding to 1,261 incidents and assisting 1,376 people.
Volunteers at Mumbles lifeboat station in Swansea rescued the most people, with 82 brought to safety, closely followed by Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, with 81 people rescued.
Crews in Port Talbot, Port Eynon, Burry Port and Tenby all recorded rescue increases, while volunteers in Aberystwyth, Rhyl and Conwy saw a rise in call outs.
The type of rescues ranged from a child trapped in rocks to a 21-year-old man who became stranded while taking photographs of waves on a jetty in Aberystwyth.
But Nicola Davies, RNLI's community incident reduction manager, said people seemed to be following the charity's advice and warnings about safety.
"Whilst previously people may have chosen to take part in activities alone, instead they are now thinking twice and considering how going to the coast as a group is far safer. Consequently, more people were rescued than ever before," she said.
"Instead of attempting to bring themselves to safety, people are recognising the need to dial 999 much quicker and as a result our volunteer crews have been exceptionally busy."
