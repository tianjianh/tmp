A University Challenge contestant told a woman to "pretend this never happened" after he raped her at a hall of residence, a court has heard.

Bartholomeo Joly de Lotbiniere, 21, is accused of raping the fellow student at York University in June 2014.
In a video interview played to the city's crown court, the woman said she tried to push him off as he lay on top of her.
Mr Joly de Lotbiniere denies rape and assault by penetration.
The court heard the woman describe how she and the defendant, of Kensal Rise, London, had been out drinking as part of a group on the night of the alleged assault.
She said Mr Joly de Lotbiniere, referred to in court as Barto, tried to kiss her and suggested they have sex.
Thinking he was joking, she said he left the room and went to the toilet before going to her room, but he followed her in.
After the attack, the court was told he said "pretend this never happened" and then "tell no one about this".
Prosecutor Gerald Hendron described how the woman later texted Mr Joly de Lotbiniere and said: "I thought I'd let you know I wasn't overly comfortable with what happened on Thursday night".
The prosecutor said that Mr Joly de Lotbiniere replied: "Neither am I".
He said that he added: "I was a disgrace, I did a very stupid thing and I am very sorry for what I did.
"I just hope you can forgive me at some point. I'll try not to act like a bloody 14-year-old again and start acting my age. Sorry."
In October 2014, it is claimed the defendant texted the woman again, saying: "I wanted to apologise to you in person tonight.
"I wanted you to know I'm very sorry for what I did and that there's no enmity between us. And that we can move on as mutual friends."
The prosecutor said that, in a police interview, Mr Joly de Lotbiniere told officers his apologies related to him being unable to get a proper erection during the sexual encounter.
The woman explained how she began dating someone and told him what had happened to her, saying this was a moment of realisation.
She told the interviewing officer: "Then, basically, he was on University Challenge and it was all over social media and certain tweets.
"I just wanted to do something about it."
The case continues.
