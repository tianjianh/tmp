Muamba, 24, suffered a cardiac arrest during Bolton's FA Cup tie at Spurs on 17 March and he was released from hospital on 16 April.
"I'm happy I'm here," he said. "It's a special place - anyone who has played for this club will knows that.
"I'm glad I came today, I really wanted to come and support the boys."

Muamba was returning to Bolton's ground - and conducting his first TV interview - since being discharged.
"I'm happy to be back, I'm happy to see the fans outside and for the support I got," said the midfielder.
"I'm happy to be able to speak to people again and walk freely. The support has been overwhelming, I'm very grateful for it.
"The support helps me every single day - I've still got six or seven boxes of well-wishes to go through. The support stays in my mind every single day, keeps me going every single day."
Muamba paid special tribute to the fans who have sent messages of support regardless of which club they follow.
"Thank you from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your support," he added. "Not just the Bolton fans, the whole country.
"I'm grateful I can walk again and do things normally again. My message is thank you."
Muamba was technically dead for 78 minutes after collapsing on the pitch during his team's quarter-final at White Hart Lane.
The former England Under-21 international started talking again two days after the incident and was walking just over two weeks later.
Since he left the London Chest Hospital, Muamba has continued his rehabilitation at home but it is not yet known if he will play professional football again.
Bolton, who have a game in hand on the teams around them, have the chance to move out of the relegation zone with victory over Spurs.
