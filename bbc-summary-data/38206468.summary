The 40-year-old defendant, named as Michael P, admitted making a signalling error and dialling the wrong emergency number. Two commuter trains collided near Bad Aibling in February.
The controller also admitted having played a computer game on his mobile phone just before the crash.
He expressed "huge guilt" in the case.
"I would like you to know that my thoughts are with you," he told survivors, in a statement read by lawyers. The trial took place in Traunstein.
Those who died in the crash at Bad Aibling on 9 February were all men aged between 24 and 59.
Prosecutors said Michael P had been playing the fantasy game "Dungeon Hunter 5" on his phone when he allowed the two trains on to a single-track line.
