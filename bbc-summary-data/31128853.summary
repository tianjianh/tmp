Justice Lowell Goddard: Profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard, who has resigned as the head of the independent inquiry into historical child sex abuse in England and Wales, was not the first person to be appointed as its head.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She was the third chairwoman of the inquiry since it was set up last July, before resigning on 4 August in a letter to Home Secretary Amber Rudd.
She is a serving judge of the High Court of New Zealand and UN committee member who has experience of working with victims of sexual assault.
In 2007, she was appointed chairwoman of New Zealand's Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) - the first woman to hold the position - and was in post when the authority released a report on the outcome of its inquiry into police handling of child abuse cases.
Born in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1948, Justice Goddard studied law at the University of Auckland, and started practicing as a barrister in 1977.
In her earlier years as a barrister she worked as a member of the steering committee which helped establish the HELP Clinic, a facility for victims of sexual abuse.
In that role, she assisted police to establish a better approach to the examination and interviewing of sex abuse victims.
Justice Lowell Goddard was made Queen's Counsel in 1988 - one of the first two women to be appointed to the role - and deputy solicitor-general for New Zealand in 1992.
She became the first woman of Maori descent to be appointed as a High Court judge in 1995, and has also sat as a member of the criminal division of the country's Court of Appeal.
