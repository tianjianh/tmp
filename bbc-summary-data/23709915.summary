Olympics fan Chen Guan Ming, 58, from Xuzhou, is cycling his rickshaw to Rio, in time for the 2016 games.
He was not breaking the law by taking it on the A-road but was advised by police to find another route.
A spokesman said: "We offered him a map, but he didn't seem to want it."
This is the second time Mr Chen has decided to "promote the Olympic spirit" - as the banner on his rickshaw states.
He travelled from China to London by rickshaw in time for the 2012 Olympics, before returning to his home country.
However, he then decided to do it all again, and this time hopes to make it to Rio de Janeiro.
Mr Chen was able to begin his latest Olympics quest from London, thanks to a courtesy flight from a British airline company.
He is funding the rest of the trip himself, doing odd jobs and offering rides in the rickshaw, in which he sleeps at night.
Mr Chen left Cambridge on Wednesday, choosing to pedal along the A14 70mph (110km/h) dual carriageway.
A Cambridgeshire Police spokesman said: "We were called at 13:29 BST to reports of a man riding a rickshaw along the A14, causing traffic problems.
"He was stopped and given words of advice not to travel on the A14, but he was committing no offences and went on his way."
The spokesman said he was not sure where Mr Chen was planning to go next, but added: "I understand he's eventually heading to Liverpool."
He was not able to say whether Mr Chen understood the police advice about road safety.
Mr Chen is thought to know only four words of English.
