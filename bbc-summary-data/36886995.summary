New Aberdeen FC stadium consultation under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A series of public consultations on Aberdeen FC's proposals for a new stadium on the outskirts of the city are getting under way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stadium and training facilities would be built at Kingsford, close to the Aberdeen bypass, near Westhill.
The Yes to Kingsford Stadium group believes it would be a vital step forward for the club.
The Say No To Kingsford Stadium group argues it is green belt land and would have a negative local impact.
The group previously told BBC Scotland it had been inundated with abuse from some fans. Aberdeen FC condemned any abuse.
Club chairman Stewart Milne has described Kingsford as "an ideal location for supporters".
The Dons had previously been considering a relocation to Loirston, to the south of Aberdeen, a proposal that had been marred by planning difficulties.
