Darren Broadbent death: Teenagers' murder charges dropped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two teenagers charged with the murder of a man who was fatally stabbed have had the cases against them dropped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Darren Broadbent was discovered at Thorntree Court, in Grangewood, Chesterfield, on 1 August.
A 15-year-old boy, from Sheffield, who cannot be named, and Jaiden Browne-Evans, 18, also of Sheffield, have been released from custody.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said convictions were not realistic so the case was stopped.
A CPS spokesman said it was an "extremely sensitive" case and further police investigations had not resulted in any more evidence that could prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendants had not acted in self-defence.
He added that senior lawyers and the prosecution were "satisfied" that the initial decision to prosecute was "correct" according to the evidence available, but the only course available to the prosecution was to discontinue.
