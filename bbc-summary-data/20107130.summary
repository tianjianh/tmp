In Scotland motorists have been advised to watch out for hazardous conditions although the Met Office has not reported any weather warnings.
Meanwhile, councils in England and Wales said hundreds of gritters were on standby ahead of icy conditions.
Temperatures have only managed hit 10C (50F), with outbreaks of rain predicted for Sunday.
Significant snowfall hit parts of Scotland, including the Highlands, north east, Central, Tayside and the Borders on Friday evening, with drivers advised to prepare for their journeys as the cold snap continues.
BBC forecaster Holly Green said the snow showers were brought by a short blast of very cold Arctic air.
"Although there'll be a brief spell of snow on the tops of the Grampians in Scotland during Saturday evening that will have turned to rain during the night," she said.
"Sunday will be a greyer day across the country with outbreaks of rain but no snow. It's rather unusual, although not unheard of, to get a covering of snow at this time of year."
