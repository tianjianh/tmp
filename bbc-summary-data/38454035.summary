An article on the club website states that Veron's first match will be on 8 January against Bayer Leverkusen in the Florida Cup. It also says he will compete in both the league and the Copa Libertadores.
Veron won the Uefa Cup with Parma and the Serie A title with Lazio before moving to United in 2001 for a then British record transfer fee of £28.1m.
He joined Chelsea for £15m in 2003, but spent three of the following four years on loan at Inter Milan - who he helped win the Italian league title - and then his boyhood club Estudiantes.
