[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joshua Reid, 21, admitted two charges of assault to injury and one of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner in Ladybank, Fife, in November.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard how Reid attacked his mother after being offered only leftover takeaway for dinner.
He then threw a carving fork at his mother's partner, which pierced his clothes and stuck in his shoulder.
The court heard how the assaults on 41-year-old Gillian Farquharson and her partner Grant Swan, 44, happened hours after the funeral of Ms Farquharson's father.
At one point Reid dragged his mother along the ground when she tried to escape.
Ms Farquharson later told police she feared her son was going to kill her.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told the court that after being offered leftover takeaway, Reid swore at her and threw food over the walls, saying "you have two seconds to clean up that rice or you will get it'.
He then threw crockery around.
Ms Robertson said: "His mother tried to leave but as she walked out he followed her, seized her by the arm and pulled her into the house. He grabbed her by the neck and threw her on to the sofa."
Mr Swan tried to intervene but Reid threw a carving fork at him, embedding in his shoulder through his coat and hoody.
"The accused shouted he was going to do his mother, calling her a slag and a dog," Ms Robertson added. "The complainers later spoke to police and his mother said she had been absolutely terrified and believed he would kill or stab her."
Defence solicitor David Bell said: "He had taken alcohol for the first time in a long time and the effects of that combined with the event and the argument caused this.
"The death of his grandfather was a significant event for him. He reacted extremely badly to what happened."
The court heard that Reid had been committing crimes since he was 14 and he had convictions for theft, carrying a knife, assault and robbery.
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael jailed Reid for eight months and ordered him to be monitored in the community for four months after his release.
He said: "There isn't any alternative to a custodial sentence.
"This was a serious matter involving the throwing of a carving fork that embedded in this man's body.
"Fortunately the injuries were not as serious as they could have been."
