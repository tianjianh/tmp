Dzagoev, 25, broke a metatarsal during CSKA's 1-0 win over Rubin Kazan on Saturday, a result that clinched the Russian title for CSKA.
Russia are in Group B at the Euros with England, Wales and Slovakia and kick-off against England on 11 June.
"The medical examination confirmed the fracture of the second instep bone," the Russian Football Union said.
Dzagoev, the joint-top scorer at Euro 2012, will be replaced by FC Krasnodar's Dmitri Torbinski, 32.
