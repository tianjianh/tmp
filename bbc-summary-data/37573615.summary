[SN]TITLE[SN]
S4C's number of repeats far too high, says chief executive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
S4C broadcasts far too many repeats, the Welsh language television channel's chief executive has admitted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Jones told an assembly committee that 57% of its programmes had been shown before, compared to a target of 20% when S4C was launched in 1982.
He said he did not know how the situation would be managed if there were further budget cuts.
In September, it was announced funding for S4C from the BBC licence fee will remain at £74.5m a year until 2022.
That makes up the bulk of the channel's budget.
S4C also receives £7m from the UK government, as well as some commercial income.
Giving evidence to the culture and Welsh language committee, Mr Jones said: "In 1982 when S4C launched we had a target of 20% repeats on screen.
"We're now at 57%, which in my view is far too high.
"I don't know how we'll manage that going forward if there are other cuts from the DCMS [the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport] let's say, or in terms of the real term cuts.
"But that's a factor we'll have to look at again."
