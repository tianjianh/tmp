[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rock-bottom Lions held on until the break, although they needed some good fortunate to do so.
Goalkeeper Jonathan Maxted saved superbly from Tom Shaw, then Ryan Lloyd hit the post, and Kane Richards fired straight at the keeper during a goalmouth scramble as Guiseley rode their luck.
Jon McCarthy's hosts did find the breakthrough not long into the second period as Richards converted James Akintunde's cut-back with a smart chip.
Chester sealed matters from the penalty spot with Shaw slotting home after Johnny Hunt was fouled.
Will Hatfield completed Guiseley's miserable night as he was sent off after a foul on Craig Mahon with six minutes to go.
