At least three people have died in the Houston area after major flooding and tornadoes swept across the southern US over the weekend.

At least 16 people in Oklahoma and Texas were killed and dozens of people were missing after the record rainfall.
Heavy rains continued to fall on the area on Tuesday afternoon.
Houston - the US's fourth most populous city - was under water in many parts on Tuesday, with thousands of cars abandoned on city streets and highways.
Thousands of residents have been displaced and over 1,000 homes were destroyed.
On Tuesday morning, Houston's highways were still flooded, making driving impossible for residents.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency in 24 counties in Texas.
The effects of the massive storms were also felt near the Texas border in Mexico.
On Monday, at least 14 people - including an infant - were killed by a tornado that hit the northern Mexico border city of Acuna.
Mexican authorities said that more than 1,000 homes were damaged by the storm.
Houston's public transport services were suspended and many residents of Houston were told to stay home from work and school.
More than 11 inches of rain fell overnight on Monday and into Tuesday morning.
Fire fighters have carried out more than 500 water rescues of mostly stranded motorists.
Houston Mayor Annise Parker said at the news conference that many parts of Houston were not as badly affected by the storm, but she urged people to stay inside and not seek out the floodwaters for photos.
"We urge folks not to go out looking for floodwaters...we urge people to people to continue to be safe. The worst thing that's happened is a loss of life," she said.
One victim of the floods was Alyssa Ramirez, an 18-year-old from Devine, Texas, who was driving home from her school prom, where she had just been named prom queen.
Barricades were not being used on the road Ms Ramirez was driving home on after prom, News 4 San Antonio reported.
Ms Ramirez called 911 and tried to escape,  but the floodwaters came too fast and too heavy. Crews found Ms Ramirez and her car Monday morning.
A home was swept away in Wimberley, Texas, where teams are searching for 12 members of two families.
The families are missing after a rain-swollen river in central Texas swept their vacation home off its foundation and slammed it into a bridge downstream.
"We are floating in a house that is now floating down the river", one missing family member Laura McComb told her sister Julie Shields on Saturday night, according to local TV station KXAN. "Call mom and dad. I love you, and pray".
Laura's husband Jonathan McComb escaped the floodwaters, his father Joe McComb told the Washington Post. Laura McComb and her two children are still missing.
Problems continued elsewhere in Texas as Dallas-Fort Worth airport was forced to close a runway when a sinkhole was reported.
The airport confirmed the closure on Twitter, and said the sinkhole was not on the runway but in a "safety area".
Texas often experiences long periods of drought, despite heavy rainfall at times.
As of the week of 19 May, areas in central Texas were experiencing abnormal to severe levels of drought, with 795,851 residents affected, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
