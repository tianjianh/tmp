McAleny, 24, has played twice for Everton and has most recently been on loan at Wigan Athletic last season, when he netted four times in 13 games.
Oxford boss Michael Appleton told the club website: "He works hard, knows where the goal is and we think will give us another goal threat."
Oxford are 14th in League One and into round five of the FA Cup.
