[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness has said he believes the British government is reluctant to move to break the deadlock on legacy issues until after May's assembly election.

Mr McGuinness was talking to BBC NI's The View.
He said he believed the government was "not keen" to resolve the matter until after the vote.
The Fresh Start Agreement failed to resolve legacy issues arising from Northern Ireland's Troubles.
Mr McGuinness said he was making his assessment following discussions with Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers.
"From the meeting I was involved in with Theresa Villiers, it was clear to me that the British government were not keen to resolve this situation prior to the Assembly elections, so I think probably Arlene Foster (Northern Ireland First Minister) is taking her lead from where she believes the British government to be at," he said.
"I don't think that is it, I made the point when I had the conversation with Theresa Villiers that if it was a matter of waiting until after the Assembly elections that preparatory work needs to be done between now and the elections, so that we are not after the election facing the public with this prospect that there will be more talks.
"This needs to be resolved immediately after the Assembly elections."
