The 500 bronze coins, known as the Yorkley Hoard, were bought by the Dean Heritage Centre for Â£1,600 after a public fundraising campaign and grants.
The coins, scattered across a field in Yorkley, were found in 2012 by metal detector enthusiast Gavin Warren.
Mr Warren said: "I found three coins at the top of the field and then my detector went absolutely crazy."
Most of the coins, 373, are dated AD 330-335.
The hoard also include two coins which date from AD 294 to 340 and a third coin which dates from AD 271 to 274.
Discovered scattered over a wide area, many of the coins had traces of a textile suggesting they had been in a sack or bag
"They were spread out in a 'V' shape across the field," said Mr Warren.
"My detector went absolutely crazy and when we dug holes into the ground, they were just falling off the spade from the soil.
"We collected about half and went back the next weekend and found the rest."
Half of the money to pay for the coins came from the V&A Purchase Grant Fund and the Headley Trust, with the other half from a public fundraising campaign.
Under the Treasure Act 1996, museums are given the opportunity to buy items declared as treasure at a coroner's court.
