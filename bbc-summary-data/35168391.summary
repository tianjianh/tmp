Scoot Ferries, based in Cowes, cancelled all sailings over the weekend after buyout talks failed. Thirty-two workers lost their jobs.
David Meany, of Ashtons Recovery LLP, said discussions with "two or three" parties were progressing.
The company's three chartered vessels are being taken back by their owners.
Mr Meany said the termination of charter contracts "may be a benefit" as some of the parties had been considering bringing in their own vessels.
"There certainly is a glimmer of hope there - hopefully that will turn into something positive.

1 Sept Regular Lymington-Yarmouth passenger service begins
5 Nov Portsmouth-Cowes route starts earlier than planned

19 Dec Sailings cancelled and company stops trading
21 Dec 32 staff made redundant
"[Scoot] had a number of issues with the operations of the ferries - one vessel had a blown engine, another ended up impounded and another one had some damage.
"Their plans to take it forward were skewed by those issues cropping up at the same time," he said.
Scoot Ferries began operating a passenger service between Yarmouth and Lymington in September, with a Portsmouth-Cowes route was added in November.
On Saturday customers took to social media to complain about being stranded after it announced it was suspending operations.
On Monday, chief executive ZoÃ« Ombler said: "Running a ferry company is an expensive business and it's fair to say we were under capitalised from day one and desperately looking for additional investment.
"I'm devastated for the sake of all of my team and our loyal customers who were let down tremendously badly."
