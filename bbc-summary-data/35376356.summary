[SN]TITLE[SN]
On manoeuvres at First Minister's Questions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Just an average day. A familiar session of questions to the First Minister. Relatively sharp exchanges over public spending. Pleas from the chair for brevity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
That plus an armed invasion.
OK, maybe not armed. And not really an invasion. More like an opportunity to witness democracy in action.
But all 25 newcomers were decidedly dressed as soldiers - and they arrived in Holyrood's public gallery after questions to the FM had got under way.
It caused, it should be said, something of a stir. Was it a coup? If so, had it been cleared in advance with the Presiding Officer? Had the business bureau been alerted through the usual channels?
One by one, the soldiers took their seats. Some of them seemed a little unsure as to what to do with their headgear. Was it "caps aff" at Holyrood? Or "bunnets on"? The conclusion, eventually, was off.
However, the uncertainty offered a degree of comfort to the tribunes in the chamber below. Would the leaders of a military coup be so obviously concerned with parliamentary protocol?
Later inquiries disclosed that, far from invaders, they were decidedly welcome guests from 2 Highlander Cadets, 2nd Battalion. From the Aberdeenshire area.
They were last seen chatting with Alex Salmond, an MSP/MP from their patch who could be heard saying: "Now, about this guy Trumpâ€¦â€¦." (For the avoidance of doubt, that is what passes for a joke. In Strichen. Mr Salmond was, of course, his customary charming self.)
Perhaps the young soldiers were hoping to pick up a few tips on coping with conflict. If so, it was a relatively rewarding day.
Labour's Kezia Dugdale opened an offensive on the subject of public spending; in particular, the budget for child care. She questioned both the funding and the practical implementation.
How did the ambitions for improved provision square with cuts in council cash? Further, was not experience on the ground that provision did not match ambition? Parents could not get childcare when and where they needed it.
Building to a conclusion, Ms Dugdale suggested that the Scottish government offer to double childcare in the coming parliament amounted to "one great big con".
To the contrary, said Nicola Sturgeon. Funding was available. Talks were under way to improve flexibility. And the resources would be found to implement the offer of doubling care.
By contrast, she said, Labour had said "zero" about their own plans. Like an experienced officer reprimanding a raw recruit, Ms Sturgeon advised her counterpart that she needed "to do more than whine".
For the Tories, Ruth Davidson complained that the number of school inspections had fallen sharply, reducing the info available to parents. Ms Sturgeon said there were a range of checks available.
The FM added that formal inspections had been deliberately reduced during the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence.
Scared of what they might find, eh? Not a bit of it. Rather, effort had been redirected to supporting teachers - as they struggled to cope/adapted with verve. (Take your pick, according to taste.)
To the skirmish then between Ms Sturgeon and Willie Rennie of the Liberal Democrats. Had any of the brave boys in uniform been in Dundee on Monday - and who am I to say they were not - then they would have witnessed the pre-conflict preparation.
Think I've told you already that I was chairing a debate between the leaders, hosted by Dundee University Students Association. In the middle of this, Mr Rennie spoke somewhat disparagingly of Amazon. (The global despatch outfit with a base in Fife. Not the female warriors. He's not that brave.)
On that occasion, Ms Sturgeon had taken her cue from the ancient combatants to deliver a withering blow in the direction of Mr Rennie. She would, she said, leave her Lib Dem counterpart to talk down Fife jobs.
Plainly, it stung. At any rate, Mr Rennie returned to the topic. Amazon, he said, paid well below the living wage. It was, he said, regarded by workers as "an exceptionally horrible place". Why, he said, was the SG doling out cash support to such an employer?
Ms Sturgeon headed out swiftly on manoeuvres. Unfortunately, her compass was awry. She declared robustly that all companies should pay their fair share in tax. Which is understandable. Just not what Mr Rennie had asked.
Did he milk it? What do you think? Nobody, he said, was arguing that Amazon should quit Fife. (It had been suggested Mr Rennie had said just that.) And, in a conscious echo of the Dundee exchanges, he said he would leave Ms Sturgeon to defend low wages.
Spotting a trench, Ms Sturgeon changed tack. She apologised if she had misheard. Her government did more than others to promote the living wage. It was vital to engage on that topic with Amazon and others.
And that was it. Caps on. By the leftâ€¦.
