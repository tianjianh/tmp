DJ Fearne Cotton has broadcast her final show on Radio 1, after almost 10 years at the station, and six at the helm of the mid-morning show.

"This is honestly the weirdest day ever," she said as the programme began.
"There's a hashtag on Twitter, #FarewellFearne, which is a bit like I've died," she added.
The 33-year-old said she was stepping down for "family and new adventures" in February, after revealing she was pregnant with her second baby.
Dave Grohl - frontman of her favourite band, Foo Fighters - led the tributes with a specially-recorded phone message for her last show.
He said: "It's one thing to be a wonderful voice on the radio, someone that has that kind of timing and sophistication and humour and knowledge - but then also to be the most beautiful woman in the world?
"Usually when you step into a radio studio, you're faced with some people that look like they should be working on the radio. In her case, she deserves to be out of the studio a little bit more."
Ricky Gervais, in character as David Brent, also left a message, saying: "Ten years on the old wireless. Lasted longer than some. Congratulations Fern Britton."
Coldplay's Chris Martin wrote a new song - Gone But Not F. Cotton - to mark her departure.
"I was very, very sad to hear my favourite show would disappear," he sang.
"Have to tell her thanks for the records she played / Thanks for introducing us to Lana Del Rey."
"Thanks for all the mornings in the lounge, we'd arrive / And sweetly you'd tell us, 'no swearing, we're live.'"
Rock band Kodaline played a specially-adapted version of their song The One, with the lyrics: "The BBC will never be the same, we're going to miss you when you're gone. / We hope the goldfish that we gave you is still alive and swimming on."
James Bay also recorded an acoustic version of Jackie Wilson's (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher.
The song, which was played at Cotton's wedding, reduced the DJ to tears.
As the broadcast began at 10:00 BST, Cotton said she was "terrified-slash-excited," having been kept in the dark about the surprises in store.
"I've been looking forward to it and dreading it in equal measures. I've barely slept."
Looking back on her time at Radio 1, she said: "I started here in my early 20s with my dear friend Reggie Yates and that feels like a lifetime ago. I find myself here on my last day, at 33, as a mum."
"I will walk out here with so many amazing memories."
The DJ hand-picked the playlist for her final show, playing favourites including Adele's Hometown Glory, Fleet Foxes' Helplessness Blues and The Avalanches' Since I Left You.
Her final track was Lana Del Rey's Video Games.
During the show, many of the artists Cotton championed over the years sent their best wishes on social media.
Sam Smith said he would "miss your sweet voice in my ears every day"; while Ellie Goulding added: "Thank you for always supporting me and supporting new music."
Cotton's show, which features the Live Lounge segment, won a Sony award for best music programme in 2012.
DJ Clara Amfo will take over the programme on Monday, playing highlights from Radio 1's Big Weekend festival, which takes place in Norwich this weekend.
Cotton will wrap up her time at the station by presenting some of the coverage over the two days of the event.
