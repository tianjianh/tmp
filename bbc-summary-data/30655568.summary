A man who died after the car he was driving ended up in a Bedfordshire stream may have remained undiscovered for about 10 hours, police said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A white VW Polo was spotted in a small tributary leading to the River Great Ouse near Barford Road in Tempsford just after 13:15 GMT on New Year's Day.
The male driver, who was the only occupant of the vehicle, was pronounced dead at the scene.
Officers believe the car had entered the water at about 03:00.
A post-mortem examination is yet to take place to establish the cause of death.
Friends leaving tributes at the scene told the BBC the dead man was 19 years old and lived locally.
Bedfordshire Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
