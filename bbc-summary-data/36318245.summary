[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ospreys open-side Sam Underhill will not tour Australia with England this summer, says head coach Eddie Jones.

Underhill, 19, has impressed for Ospreys since his debut in September, making 16 appearances this season.
Despite pledging his allegiance to England, Underhill wants to stay with Ospreys and Rugby Football Union rules state Jones cannot select players based outside England.
"Hopefully by November he's going to be eligible for selection," said Jones.
"I had a good chat with him last week and we decided the best thing for him is to have a good pre-season.
"He's a young guy, he's had a fair few injuries this season."
Underhill's unavailability also means he will miss England Saxons' tour of South Africa in June.
The former England Under-18 player was at Gloucester before moving to Wales to study economics at Cardiff University.
Born in the United States, Underhill could qualify for Wales in the future under the three-year residency rule.
