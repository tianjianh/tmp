[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-Wales captain Jonathan Davies has said England lock Joe Launchbury should have been called up into the British and Irish Lions squad in New Zealand.

Lions coach Warren Gatland has added six players who were on tour with Wales or Scotland in Australasia.
Eddie Jones, coaching England on tour in Argentina, said Gatland should add players based on "merit rather than geographical proximity."
"Joe Launchbury has been absolutely amazing," Davies said.
"For him to be in Argentina and not on that Lions party, for me is a disgrace.
"He's quality and could step into the Test [side], so could Finn Russell and maybe Gareth Davies but not the other players I'm afraid."
Welsh quartet Kristian Dacey, Tomas Francis, Cory Hill and Gareth Davies were called up after featuring in Wales' 24-6 victory over Tonga in Auckland on Friday.
Scotland prop Allan Dell and fly-half Russell were then added to the Lions squad following Scotland's 24-19 defeat of Australia in Sydney on Saturday.

"You can understand why he's doing it," Davies told BBC Radio 5 live.
"Geographically it's easier and they're players just to fill in that are not going to take any part in the games - they're bench players.
"Finn Russell and Gareth Davies were unlucky to miss out. The other players go there knowing they're just making the numbers up.
"But what happens if the Test players get injured?"
The Lions secured a confidence-boosting 32-20 win over the Maori All Blacks in the latest game of their New Zealand tour.
Gatland's side face Chiefs in Hamilton on Tuesday ahead of the first Test against New Zealand in Auckland on Saturday, 24 June.
New Zealand warmed up with a 78-0 win over Samoa but Davies said the Lions had a "very, very good chance" of winning the first Test.
"All the pressure is on the All Blacks because no one expects the Lions to go there and win," Davies added.
"You can see Steve Hansen and the way he's piping up in press conferences.
"They are going to be on edge because all the pressure is on the All Blacks."
