It was the first non-rugby sporting event at Twickenham in its 107-year history, and the first London-based NFL game away from Wembley Stadium.
Landon Collins scored the pick of the touchdowns with a superb interception return for the Giants, after the Rams' Tavon Austin had crossed for the opening score.
Rashad Jennings edged the Giants ahead for the decisive score.
New York safety Collins told BBC Sport: "It was a fantastic win for us.
"When I caught the ball I looked down field and saw a lot of dark blue but all my white was to the left, so I went back and ran down there. It was a surprise for me."
Treated to a pre-match show of fireworks and flames, plus music from Craig David, fans at Twickenham did not have to wait long for the first on-field action as the Rams forced an early turnover.
They took full advantage as Case Keenum found wide receiver Austin in the end zone, and soon after added a field goal from Greg Zuerlein to head in 10-0 up at the end of the first quarter.
The Giants got on the board thanks to a Robbie Gould field goal in the second, before Collins snaffled a tipped pass and superbly returned it to the end zone.
The 22-year-old broke through nine tackles as he returned at speed and dived into the end zone with help from his team-mates.
Quarterback Eli Manning handed on for Jennings to bundle over in the final quarter after a smart Odell Beckham Jr catch, and Gould's kick made it 17 points without reply for New York.
The game at Twickenham was the second of a three-match series in London this month, with the other two hosted by Wembley.
The Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Indianapolis Colts 30-27 in the first, and the Washington Redskins face the Cincinnati Bengals in the third on Sunday, 30 October.
