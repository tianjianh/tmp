The 32-year old former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper previously played for boss Neil Warnock at the Millers.
"I'm really pleased to have signed for Cardiff City. The manager has always been fantastic with me and I'm delighted to work with him again," the Northern Ireland international said.
"I'm looking forward to playing in front of the Cardiff City supporters."
"Lee is what I call a 'Steady Eddie'," Warnock said. "Lee has always done well for me.
"We've now got a really good trio of goalkeepers. Neil Etheridge - a big lad with plenty to prove, Brian Murphy - who did well for me last season, and Lee, who offers experience, reliability and good decision making.
"It is down to the goalkeepers now to see who can cement their place in the team, and keep that number one jersey."
