Harrogate couple's anger at defibrillator red tape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple who raised more than £4,000 for two potentially life-saving defibrillators have been told they must seek planning permission and pay £195 to install each machine.

Lizzie and Alistair Hughes started fundraising after Alistair suffered a cardiac arrest in 2013, aged 37.
The couple, from Harrogate, say they are "frustrated" with the response.
Harrogate Council say it believes planning permission is necessary but is investigating the matter.
Mrs Hughes told BBC Radio York they wanted to install one public-access defibrillator on the Worlds End pub in Knaresborough and a second machine in Harrogate.
She said: "This is not an attack on the council.  We just want to let them know how frustrated we feel about this ruling and how many people also believe we should be able to put these things up without planning permission.
"If it has the potential to save lives, then we just want to get them out there."
Barbara Dinsdale, from Heart Research UK, said: "I'm astounded because the longer term implication is far worse than one going up without planning permission."
Councillor Rebecca Burnett, Harrogate Borough Council's cabinet member for planning said: "So far as we are aware, planning permission is required for the installation of a defibrillator.
"We will look into this matter and speak to other authorities [and] if planning permission is not required we will certainly ensure that the applicants know and that no fee is charged."
