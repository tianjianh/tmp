More than £30,000 has been raised for the family of aid worker Alan Henning, who was murdered by Islamic State (IS) militants.

The money was raised via two online appeals set up by Muslim colleagues and friends following his death.
A video purporting to show the beheading of the taxi driver from Salford was released last week.
A memorial service will also be held for the 47-year-old in Manchester on Sunday.
The father-of-two was captured by the extremist group in December while delivering food and supplies to Syrian refugees on an aid convoy.
One of the online funds was set up by Dr Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, who had previously accompanied Mr Henning on an aid convoy.
She said: "After seeking permission from Alan's widow Barbara, we have decided to set up a fund in memory of Alan for his children.
"We want them to know that their father's death was not in vain and that the work Alan was so committed to, will also continue."
Sunday's memorial service for Mr Henning will be held at the British Muslim Heritage Centre in Manchester at 18:30 BST.
It will be attended by Mr Henning's wife and their two children.
One of the organisers Sohail Kaushal said: "There will be leaders from all faiths and politicians attending the memorial.
"We want to remember Alan and continue his legacy of humanitarian aid work.
"We'll also be announcing the total amount of money raised for his family."
Last month MPs voted to authorise RAF air strikes against IS in Iraq, at the invitation of the Iraqi government.
The UK is among more than 40 nations that have joined forces to challenge the extremist group.
