"Asian and continental European nations dominate, although Team GB can compete with anyone from outside those areas. Joanna Parker and Paul Drinkhall are the singles entrants for Britain. Joanna is a solid defensive player, Paul has a strong forehand and is an ex-European junior champion. China's Zhang Jike is the reigning men's World Cup winner and world champion, and is looking to add the Olympic title. China sweep the medals, but in tournaments their athletes can crack under pressure."
The sport's appeal is obvious: it's fast, fun and cheap.
At elite level, it's really fast. The ball travels at speeds of 100mph and is struck more than 180 times in a minute - about three shots a second.
The Chinese dominate the global game (they have won all five titles at each of the last four World Championships), and the proliferation of China-born players representing other countries has raised the standard.
There are four table tennis events held at the Olympics: the men's and women's singles, and men's and women's team events, which replaced the doubles at the last Olympics.
As table tennis is an incredibly fast sport, an hour's play can burn approximately 272 calories. Due to its intensity, table tennis improves cardiovascular fitness, endurance levels and the health of an athlete's heart.

One of the main benefits of playing table tennis is that it is non-contact. This means you can get all the positives of a high-energy sport such as football without the risk of collision injuries to the arms, shoulders and legs.
It is also one of the few competitive sports that requires players to move at speed without straining the muscles or joints through stretching or using heavy equipment.
For people returning from injury or the elderly, table tennis tennis can be the perfect sport to sustain fitness levels.
The action of having to hit a fast-moving ball with a bat several times a second means table tennis also improves reflexes, eye-to-hand co-ordination, mental alertness and speed of movement.

In England, Ping! is an innovative three year street ping pong project which provides people with opportunities to play social and competitive table tennis, free of charge.

A point is scored in a variety of ways, including when a player allows the ball to bounce twice on their side of the table, hits the ball into the net and outside the boundaries of the table without bouncing.
Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner dropped just one game in seven matches when winning the 1992 men's singles gold - living up to his nickname of the 'Mozart of Table Tennis'
The first player or pair scoring 11 points (by a margin of two clear points) wins the game.
If the scores are tied at 10-10 then it is the player or the pair that gains a lead of two points first who wins the game.
The expedite system can be introduced if a set has not finished after 10 minutes. Under the expedite system, each player makes a service and if the receiving player or pair makes 13 good returns, the receiver shall score a point.
The service is changed after every two points. Once the score gets to 10-10, the serve changes after every point.
In doubles matches, the serve alternates between players as well as teams. Players also take turns to hit the ball, with one hit allowed per player before it alternates.

London major Boris Johnson proudly declared after Beijing that "whiff-whaff is coming home". However, the medals will not be following.
Paul Drinkhall plays in the men's singles, Joanna Parker in the women's, and both will find the going tough. The teams are also unlikely to go far.
Gold should be all about the Chinese. Wang Hao and world champion Zhang Jike should contest the men's final, while Ding Ning and Li Xiaoxia are the two top women.
China also look unbeatable in the team competitions. Germany are the best European outfit and will be looking for medals from the men's team and Timo Boll.
In the late 19th century table tennis was a sedate after-dinner pastime among the high society in England and British army officers abroad, with cigar-box lids used as rackets and a carved champagne cork for a ball.
