Haggis artwork sought for UK's only mountain gondola

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Artwork on the theme of Scotland's national dish, the haggis, has been sought for one of the cabins on the UK's only mountain gondola.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Groups of children have been invited to come up with a design that would be wrapped around the four sides of the cabin on the Nevis Range Gondola.
The competition is being run as part of the Highland Haggis Festival at Spean Bridge, near Fort William.
The festival is to be held on 1 and 2 April.
The gondolas system transports visitors to the Nevis Range snowsports centre from 300ft up to 2,150ft on the north face of Aonach Mor, the eighth-highest mountain in Britain.
