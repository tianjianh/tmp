County Championship: Steven Patterson gives Yorkshire edge against Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steven Patterson claimed career-best figures of 6-56 as a depleted Yorkshire attack bowled Durham out for 172 on day one at the Riverside.

Jack Burnham (49) and Mark Stoneman (45) made the only scores of note as Durham were dismissed in 61.1 overs.
Seamer Patterson bettered his 5-11 against Worcestershire in April 2015 when Burnham was caught at cover.
Alex Lees made 71 for champions Yorkshire, who reached 129-4 at stumps as Chris Rushworth claimed 4-42.
Only one point separated the two sides before the start of play, with Yorkshire and Durham second and third in the Division One table respectively.
With Ryan Sidebottom, Jack Brooks, Liam Plunkett and David Willey unavailable, Yorkshire included young pace bowlers Josh Shaw and Ben Coad, the latter making his first-class debut, in their side.
Scott Borthwick failed to enhance his England prospects when he was run out by Andrew Gale for two and Durham slumped from 74-2 to 148-8 in the afternoon session.
Their position would have been even worse if Lees had not dropped Burnham on four at first slip. He batted for more than three hours before he was last out.
Rushworth earned Durham a bowling point by taking all four Yorkshire wickets to fall, including Lees and nightwatchman Patterson in the same over.
