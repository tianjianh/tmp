Sale had hoped to extend Taylor's stay at the AJ Bell Stadium, with director of rugby Steve Diamond saying his exit would be a "disaster" for the club.
The 24-year-old has scored five tries in 93 games for Sharks, having made his debut in 2011.
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said:  "He is a young front row forward who has a bright future."
Talking to the club website, 48-year-old Young continued: "He is a really exciting English prospect who has impressed in the Aviva Premiership and in Europe this season with his dynamic physicality."
Sale have already acted to replace Taylor, with the club completing a deal to sign Bath and England hooker Rob Webber on a two-year deal from next season.
