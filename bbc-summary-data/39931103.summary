[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a statement, the 15-member Council demanded that Pyongyang conduct no further such tests.
North Korea earlier said the missile it had tested on Sunday was a new type of rocket capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead.
The missile travelled some 700km (435 miles), reaching an altitude of 2,000km and landing in the sea west of Japan.
North Korea said it was a test of the abilities of a "newly developed ballistic rocket".
South Korea's military said it could not yet verify the North's claims.
But it said Pyongyang's missiles did appear to be able to leave and re-enter the atmosphere, which is crucial to developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports.
