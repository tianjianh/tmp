Trained in the United States by Bob Baffert, American Pharoah's achievements were honoured at the Longines Awards in London.
American Pharoah was the first winner of the Triple Crown - Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes - since Affirmed in 1978.
France's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, won by Golden Horn, took the award for world's best horse race.
American Pharoah was given a top rating of 134 by a team of international flat racing experts after a season which culminated with victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic.
"He did it all," said Baffert. "I've had a lot of talented horses, but he just kept bringing it."
Jockey Victor Espinoza described his mount as "a once-in-a-lifetime horse to ride", while owner Ahmed Zayat said the horse was "cuddly, lovable and brilliant".
American Pharoah became a household name in the US and finished top of a 'Sportsperson of the Year' poll carried out by Sports Illustrated magazine.
The horse has been retired for a breeding career at Ashford Stud in Kentucky, where he commands a fee of $200,000 (Â£140,000) a time.
Golden Horn, whose Arc triumph followed a series of victories under jockey Frankie Dettori, including the Derby at Epsom, was second in the awards on a 130 rating.
Shared Belief and Treve were ranked joint third on 126.
