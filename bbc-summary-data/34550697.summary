[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The centre will employ 15 people, including software engineers and business analysts.
It will be led by Gary Kennedy, the company co-founder, who began his career at Newry-based First Derivatives.
The project is supported with an Invest NI grant of Â£75,000.
Mr Kennedy said the company had considered other locations but "the strength of the talent pool, the proximity to Queen's University and the support from Invest NI" made Belfast the best option.
Clarus operates in international capital markets and provides data, analytics and research services to its customers, who include investment bankers, hedge fund managers and regulators from the the UK, the US and Europe.
