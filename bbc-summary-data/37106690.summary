An unbeaten 130 from Kumar Sangakkara saw Surrey squeeze into the semi-finals of the One-Day Cup with a last-ball win against Northamptonshire.

Sangakkara struck Mohammed Azharullah for four to seal a one-wicket win after Surrey had collapsed in pursuit of 277.
The visitors needed 12 runs to win off the final over after slumping from 234-5 to 250-9 in the closing stages.
Earlier, Rory Kleinveldt's unbeaten 76 meant Northants posted 276 after a last-wicket partnership added 49 runs.
Surrey will face Yorkshire away in the semi-finals on 28 August after the White Rose beat Kent by 11 runs in their quarter-final at Canterbury.
Northants must pick themselves up ahead of a T20 Blast semi-final against Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston on Saturday.
Alex Wakely's side looked set to pull off a surprise victory as lower-order wickets fell around Sangakkara and Surrey needed 27 off the last 14 balls.
Sangakkara brought that equation down to 12 off the last over and scooped the third delivery from an Azharullah full toss to fine leg for six.
Last man Jade Dernbach scrambled through for a bye to leave two to win off the final ball, which former Sri Lanka wicketkeeper Sangakkara struck to the boundary.
All this came after he had been dropped on just seven before going on to register his 37th career List A century.
Northants had earlier looked set to finish well below par after slumping to 227-9. But seven fours and three sixes in all-rounder Kleinveldt's 62-ball knock rescued them with a last-wicket stand alongside Azharullah.
Opener Josh Cobb (66) also caught the eye with an innings including seven fours and three sixes, but Dernbach proved the pick of Surrey's bowlers with 4-39.
Surrey coach Michael di Venuto told BBC Radio London:
"It was a hell of a game for the spectators, I'm not sure about us watching. Yet again, I'm having a heart attack watching us play one-day cricket.
"Kumar was magnificent at the end and throughout the whole innings. He showed his class and showed why he's still one of the best players in the world.
"I was pretty disappointed with the way we batted in the last 10 overs and the way we went about it, we just lost all intent.
"We had to leave it all up to Kumar to do the job. Luckily, Jade Dernbach stayed with him and kept his head and we're lucky enough to be in the last four."
