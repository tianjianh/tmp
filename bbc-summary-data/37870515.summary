She will sample the culinary histories of stately homes and create new recipes inspired by her visits in Mary Berry's Secrets From Britain's Great Houses.
In September, she announced she would not remain as a judge on Bake Off when it moves from BBC One to Channel 4.
In a statement, she said she was "so excited" to be doing the new six-part series with the BBC.
"I have always had an enquiring mind so I know I will be inspired by the great houses we visit," she said.
BBC director of content Charlotte Moore said: "This series will be a real treat for BBC One viewers to go behind the scenes with Mary Berry and explore Britain's great houses through her love of cooking."
Berry will reveal the workings of the houses and visit the kitchens, gardens and private rooms - as well as meeting the current custodians - in each 30-minute episode.
The 81-year-old made her name as a cookery writer and has judged The Great British Bake Off with Paul Hollywood since its launch in 2010.
The most recent series, which finished last week, was the last series to be seen on BBC One.
However Berry, Hollywood and hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc will be seen in two Bake Off Christmas specials, which have already been filmed.
Tanya Shaw, managing director at Shine TV, which is producing Berry's new series, said: "I can't think of anyone more perfect to tell the stories of these great households and to bring us such a unique insight into Britain's rich culinary past."
