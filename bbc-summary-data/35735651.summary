Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall have marked their marriage with a service of celebration at the "journalists' church" in London.

Friends and family of the media mogul and the former supermodel gathered at St Bride's near Fleet Street a day after their civil ceremony.
The church has a long association with newspapers and writers.
Around 100 guests attended, including the couple's 10 children from previous relationships.
It is Mr Murdoch's fourth marriage and the first for Miss Hall, 59, after her 1992 Bali wedding to Sir Mick Jagger was later deemed legally void.
Australian-born Mr Murdoch 84, whose News UK company publishes The Times and The Sun newspapers, tweeted he was "the luckiest and happiest man in world".
St Bride's says it offers "a spiritual home to all who work in the media" lying in the heart of an area which was once the home of most UK national newspapers.
But Mr Murdoch's decision to dispense with his Fleet Street newsroom in the late 1980s marked a key stage in the abandonment of the area by the media industry.

A cold drizzle fell on St Brides and on the noisy scrum of photographers and camera crews penned into the narrow entrances to the churchyard trying to get a glimpse of the celebrity guest list.
Every now and then a shout went up as a famous face appeared at the church gates. "Bob! Bob! This way" shouted the snappers as Sir Bob Geldof paused silently in front of the church for a few seconds.
Sir Michael Caine was immune to their shouts and went straight in. One less well-known face outstayed the snappers' welcome as she preened for the cameras. "You can go in now" said one of the paparazzi, to general laughter.
There was irritation when we learned that Jerry Hall had gone in by another entrance. There is little that this couple need to learn about how to manage the press.
Playwright Tom Stoppard, musician Bob Geldof and former Rolling Stone Bill Wyman were at the service along with newspaper editors and media executives.
Justice secretary Michael Gove was also in attendance along with actor Michael Caine, artist Tracey Emin and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.
