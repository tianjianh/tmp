Ryan Craig Preston, 23, was also accused of drink driving, failing to stop for a uniformed constable and failing to report an accident.
He was arrested after a 22-year-old man was struck by a car as he left the EQHQ nightclub in Livingston on Saturday.
The victim was treated in hospital but his injuries were not thought to be life-threatening.
Mr Preston was also charged with failing to give police his name and address and other details.
A Crown Office spokesman said Mr Preston, from Kirknewton, West Lothian, made no plea or declaration during his appearance on petition at Livingston Sheriff Court.
He was committed for further examination and released on bail. The date of his next court appearance has not yet been set.
