The Rhinos were beaten at home by Wakefield on Monday, having lost at Castleford three days earlier.
"We haven't been good enough and we haven't played well and we have to take it on the chin and deal with it," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
"The mood is good in training despite the poor form and we have to look to ourselves to get out of this."
Brian McDermott's side, who have only won two of their opening eight fixtures, lost just nine of 30 Super League games last season as they won the treble.
Burrow added: "We can't keep saying that we need to get it right next week.
"It's been a tough season and it's just getting worse and worse. We've got no excuses. We just need to get wins."
The Rhinos host 11th-placed Hull KR on Friday.
