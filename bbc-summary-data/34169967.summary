Marcel was found fatally injured by police called to reports of an assault at about 23:15 BST on Friday, in the St John's Estate, Hoxton.
He was pronounced dead at the scene. A witness said she saw the teenager being chased through the estate.
Marcel's family said they were devastated by his death.  No arrests have been made, the Met confirmed.
In a statement, his family said: "We cannot comprehend how anyone could carry out such a wicked attack.
"We want those people who know something about this attack to come forward and provide information to the police.
"These people must come forward to prevent another family going through the pain we are all now suffering."
A 40-year-old woman, who did not want to be named, said she saw the victim from the window of her flat and described seeing "a big chase".
A post-mortem examination will be held at Poplar Mortuary on Monday, the Met said.
Det Ch Insp Andy Partridge said: "My officers have been at the scene since the attack took place and have come across a community left shocked by what has taken place.
"Whilst we have had a good initial response I believe there are still a number of people who were at the scene who have not come forward, people who hold significant information."
Flowers have been placed near to the estate in tribute to the victim.
