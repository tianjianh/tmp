Janulis' photographs show the countryside covered in snow as winter takes hold.
"On the first day the snow fell, I went flying and taking pictures, not to miss the chance of capturing the moments while the trees are still holding the fresh snow," says Janulis.
"No matter how cold it was, I enjoyed the winter season.
"The very end of December and early January brought stronger cold to Lithuania, reaching -15C. No matter of this, I kept on flying."
Janulis's images capture the countryside and the capital, Vilnius.
"I have always loved looking at perspectives from above; it allows us to see so many things that would otherwise be unnoticed," says Janulis.
"Taking photographs from above grants us the possibility to see the same view of the daily world as others."
Janulis uses a DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus quadcopter to capture the pictures.
Here, the snow covers the damaged roof of a large building in Vilnius.
