A cat had to have its left leg amputated after being shot six times at close range, the RSPCA says.

Jasper limped home even though his entire lower leg was shattered, RSPCA inspector Nina Small said.
The shorthaired pet from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire also had airgun pellets lodged in its left eye.
Officials have just released details of the attack on 10 April and anyone with information is urged to contact the animal charity anonymously.
The pellets entered Jasper's left eye, the roof of his mouth, abdomen and neck. Two more pellets were discovered lodged behind his left knee.
"When the owners opened the door the cat walked in and fell in his cat basket. He would've been in a lot of pain," Ms Small said.
The RSPCA believe the pet may have been in the nearby allotments or the school playing field when he was attacked.
It is illegal to shoot at and cause unnecessary suffering to a domestic animal with an air weapon.
