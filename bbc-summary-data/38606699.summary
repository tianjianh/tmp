Prof John Beetlestone founded the science discovery centre in Cardiff in 1985.
It announced on Friday he had died aged 84 following a "short illness".
Techniquest chief executive Lesley Kirkpatrick said his contribution to scientific education would "benefit children across Wales for generations to come".
"Professor Beetlestone dedicated his life to making science and technology more accessible and enjoyable for children and adults alike across Wales and beyond," she said.
"He leaves behind an impressive legacy which will continue to educate and capture the imagination of the future generations of aspiring scientists."
Prof Beetlestone and his colleagues first set up the educational charity in a gas showroom opposite Cardiff Castle - where Burger King now stands.
It later moved to Cardiff Bay, where it focused on providing educational programmes for schools.
Today, it also has a centre at Glyndwr University's campus in Wrexham.
