The prime-time show will be filmed in a "contemporary, documentary-style" and will explore their personal lives, relationships and even disappointments.
The Big Bang Theory's producer Bill Prady is behind the series.
The recent pilot got a standing ovation at an ABC screening last month, according to Entertainment Weekly.
The Muppets, created by puppeteer Jim Henson, first appeared on television in the 1950s, getting their own show in the 1970s.
They recently made a return to the big screen in 2011's The Muppets and 2014's Muppets Most Wanted, featuring Ricky Gervais.
Their TV comeback series is one of several new comedies picked up by ABC after the US pilot season.
Dr Ken will star Community's Ken Jeong, while The Real O'Neals is a contemporary take on a seemingly perfect Catholic family.
ABC has also ordered six new dramas and given hit shows including Grey's Anatomy, Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder and Marvel's Agents of Shield a new series.
Several other shows including Nigella Lawson's The Taste have been cancelled.
