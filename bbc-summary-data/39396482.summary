Alexis Sanchez is fit, but a thigh injury has sidelined Lucas Perez, while Santi Cazorla's Achilles injury has ruled him out until next season.
Kevin de Bruyne and Raheem Sterling are both in contention for Manchester City despite picking up injuries while on international duty.
Gabriel Jesus and Ilkay Gundogan remain long-term absentees.

Steve Wilson: "Two meetings in three weeks between Arsenal and Manchester City look pivotal to both clubs' seasons.
"If Arsene Wenger finds himself at a crossroads, so do some members of City's staff. It's hard to see anything other than a major Etihad clearout in the summer, with Pep Guardiola having judged a squad with an ageing core and found it wanting.
"Guardiola will firmly believe that a golden time lies ahead - conjuring images of Leroy Sane, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus thrilling fans and haunting opponents.
"Think of Wenger's wonder years at Arsenal and the images are of Tony Adams, Marc Overmars, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira framed by that familiar Highbury backdrop.
"These are certainly great memories of some of the finest football played on English fields - but they are memories of a different time and a different place."

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "Our season will be decided by the next two months and the ability we show to fight.
"Our future will be decided by our mental qualities. We have had enough press conferences about (my future) and at this moment it is not the most important thing at the club.
"It's a strange season because we played 20 games unbeaten but I cannot sit here and say we have no flaws in our team because we have."
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: "Arsene and the Arsenal players are so professional. They want to win every game.
"When you lose a lot it is the most dangerous moment to face them. I would prefer to face Arsenal after a lot of wins."
Manchester City have dropped a few points recently, with two successive draws. I think they will make it three in a row at Emirates Stadium.
