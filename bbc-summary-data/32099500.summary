The world number 13 from Cambridgeshire had to come from 3-0 down to triumph 4-3 and claim the Â£100,000 cheque.
"I've been playing snooker since I was 12 and all I've ever wanted is to win a major tournament," said Perry, 40.
"I've been really composed all week. I have been very calm at the table and haven't got nervous," he added.
Welshman Williams appeared on course for his 19th ranking title - and first since 2011 - after winning the first three frames with breaks of 64, 57 and 103.
But Perry won a scrappy fourth, then levelled the scores with breaks of 50 and 56, before runs of 54 and 24 sealed the decider.
He had seen off compatriot Stuart Bingham 4-1 in the earlier semi-final while Williams completed a 4-2 win over Judd Trump.
