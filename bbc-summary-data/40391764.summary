Safe standing: West Brom open to pilot scheme at The Hawthorns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Bromwich Albion say they are willing to use The Hawthorns as part of a pilot scheme for safe standing.

The Premier League wrote to all 20 top-flight clubs about a trial to re-introduce standing areas, which were banned in 1994.
Albion's director of operations Mark Miles said: "We would be very keen to be involved.
"It is the same message I have delivered verbally at previous meetings," he added.
But Miles said that before any scheme can be considered, the case has to be made for legislative change on the grounds of safety.
All-seater stadiums have been compulsory in the top two divisions in England since an inquiry into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans.
Any change to introduce standing at stadiums in England would need government legislation.
In Scotland, Celtic opened a 2,900-capacity safe standing section last year after the Scottish champions were granted a safe-standing licence by Glasgow City Council.
Miles has visited the rail seating system that has been installed in the north-east corner of Celtic Park.
"There is little doubt that it was clearly welcomed by the supporters as well as creating a unique atmosphere," he added.
