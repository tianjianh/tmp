[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 13-year-old was charged under the Air Navigation Act after pilots complained of green lasers being shone at them during landing and take-off.
The police said it was "an incredibly dangerous activity".
Edinburgh Airport officials welcomed the arrest and said shining lasers at planes could have "fatal consequences".
Iain Geddes, of Fife Constabulary, said: "In 2012 we received a number of complaints reporting laser pens being aimed at their aircraft, and where they appeared to be coming from the Dalgety Bay and Rosyth areas.
"Following prolonged enquiry by my officers, we have now identified a 13-year old youth as being responsible and he will be reported for this.
"I must emphasise that this is an incredibly dangerous activity and puts at considerable risk the staff and passengers of aircraft, and subsequently the wider community should an aircraft get into difficulty.
"I would ask that those involved in this practise seriously consider their actions and for those buying and/or selling laser pens to be mindful of the uses to which they can be put."
An Edinburgh Airport spokesman, said: "We welcome the police's determination in this matter which underlines the seriousness of the offence.
"These types of offences are extremely foolhardy and could have fatal consequences.
"We hope that this action will send a message that dangerous behaviour cannot be tolerated."
