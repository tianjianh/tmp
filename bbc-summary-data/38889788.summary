Notts County 2-2 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County grabbed a priceless point in their bid for League Two survival in a frantic 2-2 draw at home to Exeter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
County's bold second-half assault looked in vain when Ryan Harley put 10-man Exeter 2-0 up in the 89th minute.
Yet defender Richard Duffy nodded a goal back in stoppage time and a shot by Jorge Grant deflected in off skipper Jordan Moore-Taylor barely a minute later.
Earlier, midfield goal machine David Wheeler edged the visitors into a 33rd-minute lead.
Notts boss Kevin Nolan rolled back the years by pushing 36-year-old Alan Smith back up front to partner Jon Stead, but the former England international's main contribution was to pick up a booking before being replaced by Shola Ameobi.
Former Newcastle hitman Ameobi immediately tested goalkeeper Christy Pym with a close-range header before squandering a golden chance by missing his header in the 81st minute.
City's Jake Taylor was sent off in the 85th minute and Duffy rattled the bar before the incredible finish.
