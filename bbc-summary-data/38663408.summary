Matthew Salmon, 29, of St Ann's, Nottingham, was found guilty of multiple child sex offences at Nottingham Crown Court in December.
The girl, then aged 10, came forward after the NSPCC visited her Derbyshire school as part of its Speak out Stay safe service.
Salmon was sentenced to 15 years with a further year on licence.
The court heard how Salmon carried out multiple sexual assaults on the girl, ranging from kissing to rape over a two-year period.
He was found guilty of nine charges, including three counts of rape and two of sexual assault.
Judge Gregory Dickinson QC said the girl had suffered the "full spectrum of sexual abuse" and, given her age, "she clearly had no idea how serious it was".
Det Con Sue Hough, of Derbyshire Police, said: "Hopefully this will go some way to providing closure for the family and allow them to move on.
"It has been the most horrific catalogue of sexual abuse I've ever had to investigate on a child."
The NSPCC's Speak out Stay safe campaign involves volunteers visiting schools to speak to children aged four to 11 about how to protect themselves from abuse and how to report it.
Since the service started in 2011, it has reached more than one million children at 15,000 schools across the UK.
