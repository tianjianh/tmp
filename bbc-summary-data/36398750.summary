As well as reaching Saturday's team event, all five British men qualified for apparatus finals on Sunday.
Louis Smith topped the standings on his way to the pommel final with 15.833.
Kristian Thomas and Nile Wilson were first and second into the high bar final - with Thomas also making vault and floor finals.
Dan Purvis also made the floor final and Courtney Tulloch is through in the rings.
Britain are competing without world champion Max Whitlock, who withdrew as he recovers from a virus.
"I'm very happy with my routine and most importantly posting that score on pommel for the team," said Smith, who won silver and bronze at the London Olympics.
"With Max not being here it was extra important that I gave the team a big score on pommel so I made sure I nailed it."
Smith, 27, believes the British squad are on the right path towards their ultimate goal of the  Olympics in Brazil this summer.
"Everything we are doing out here is part of a bigger journey towards Rio," he added. "Today was a step closer and the aim is to keep improving."
The women's European Championships follow the men's event, and will also be covered live on BBC TV, Red Button and online over the weekend of 4 and 5 June.
