Five-month-old piebald cob Gizmo was found in an "emaciated state" near a caravan park in Yeldham Road, Halstead, Essex, on 17 February.
More than 1,000 people responded to an RSPCA appeal to help the pony, which was being cared for by Catley Cross Vets in Wickham St Paul.
The surgery is holding an open day on Sunday for people to meet Gizmo.
The pony underwent five months of specialist care and physiotherapy but is now "looking extremely well", an RSPCA spokeswoman said.
Gizmo was "in a very poorly state" when he first arrived, Catley Cross vet Carolyn Wyse said.
He had been "left to die" and his condition was described as "touch and go". Gizmo was "hypothermic, dehydrated and collapsed - and essentially dying".
Horse lovers from around the world rallied to the RSPCA's appeal to help pay for his care at the surgery.
Many others followed his progress on Facebook.
The surgery, which plans to keep Gizmo until he is about two years old and suitable for rehoming, has been able to help seven other horses with the extra funds from Gizmo's appeal.
The open day runs from 10:00 to 16:00 BST.
