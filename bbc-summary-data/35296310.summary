Dundee councillor Lesley Brennan has been sworn in as a Labour MSP after Richard Baker resigned from Holyrood.

Ms Brennan will see out the remaining 10 weeks of the parliament as the next candidate on Labour's North East list.
The city councillor was Labour's candidate in Dundee East in the 2015 general election, when she turned down a donation from Tony Blair.
After being sworn in, Ms Brennan said she was "privileged" to represent the people of the North East of Scotland.
She explained: "I had not expected to become an MSP in this parliamentary session but even although it is only for a short time it is a privilege to represent the people of the North East in the Scottish parliament.
"I'll be doing all I can to support Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, and her team during my time at Holyrood and am looking forward to getting stuck in to my new job."
Ms Brennan backed Katy Clark for the deputy leadership of the party in 2014 against Ms Dugdale.
The economist is one of the candidates on the party's North East list for May's Holyrood elections, with party members currently voting to choose the rankings.
Mr Baker was due to step down at the election, but decided to leave his post early to take up a job with Age Scotland.
