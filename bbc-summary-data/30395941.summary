[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor has admitted raping and sexually assaulting two children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill, 61, from Tasburgh in Norfolk, who practised at Horsford, admitted two rapes and three counts of gross indecency with two girls under 16.
Norwich Crown Court heard the offences occurred from the early 1990s to 2002 and did not relate to his professional role.
He was remanded in custody to return to the court for sentencing on 30 January.
O'Neill has been suspended from his duties by local NHS managers.
Margaret Berry, director of nursing and quality for NHS England in East Anglia said: "We are aware that Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill, who was a GP in Horsford, has pleaded guilty to a number of historical sexual offences.
"As this matter is part of an ongoing legal process, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.
"Whilst these offences do not relate to his professional role, we can confirm that Dr O'Neill is retired and no longer able to work as a GP following suspension by the General Medical Council and removal from NHS England's practitioner list.
"We recognise this information may generate public concern and anyone with information or a concern in relation to this case is urged to contact police directly."
