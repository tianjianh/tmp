It happened near Saint Peter's Cathedral, a popular tourist area on the Falls Road, at 13:00 BST on Thursday.
An eye witness said a number of people had intervened to help the tourists, a man and a woman.
Police are appealing for information about the incident which happened on Albert Street.
Speaking to the Irish News, Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Fra McCann praised the tourist and those who intervened for their bravery.
"There are tens of thousands of tourists who come for the international wall [on the Falls Road] on a yearly basis and this sends out all the wrong messages," he said.
Mr McCann told the paper that statutory agencies must take action to stop anti-social behaviour in the area.
"It's not acceptable that people are terrorised by the same group of people."
