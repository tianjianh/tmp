Rafael Benitez: Newcastle United boss charged by FA over referee comments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United boss Rafael Benitez has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for commenting on the appointment of referee Andy Madley for 24 April's league win over Preston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The FA allege that the 57-year-old's words were "improper and/or brought the game into disrepute" after he expressed "surprise" at Madley's appointment.
The Spaniard has until 18:00 BST on Tuesday to respond to the charge.
The former Liverpool boss could face a Â£2,000 fine if found guilty by the FA.
Benitez's comments came in a pre-match press conference where he questioned Huddersfield-born Madley taking charge of the game, when Huddersfield Town still had a chance of beating the Magpies to second spot in the Championship.
Newcastle went on to win the game against North End 4-1 and clinch promotion to the Premier League.
"I was really surprised with the assignation, but we have to trust the referees," Benitez had said. "I know it's a difficult job. Hopefully everything will be fine and nobody will be talking about the referee at the end of the game."
