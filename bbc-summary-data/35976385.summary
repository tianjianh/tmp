[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish landscape paintings created from boat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish artist captured many of the landscapes for his latest collection of works from the sea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glasgow-based Gregor Smith was taken up and down Scotland's west coast in a friend's boat to create paintings and etchings of Lismore and Mull.
He also made several long drives north to Caithness, Sutherland and Wester Ross for paintings of Achiltibuie and sea stacks at Duncansby Head.
The collection, Far Shore, is being exhibited at Glasgow's Compass Gallery.
Smith said: "There are advantages to working from a boat, as it opens up so many more vistas and viewpoints.
"You have to work quickly though."
He added: "I travelled with my sketchbook, chalks, pencils and other materials and captured as much as I could, but if you're accustomed to using your eyes, you'll see and record a lot of it in your mind."
