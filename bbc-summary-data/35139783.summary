Hamilton Academical 0-1 Kilmarnock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock recorded their first victory in over two months to edge out Hamilton Academical.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tope Obadeyi scored with a looping shot which evaded the Hamilton goalkeeper Michael McGovern.
Dougie Imrie had earlier seen a close-range shot cleared off the line by Conrad Balatoni, while Josh Magennis had gone close for Kilmarnock.
The result will ease some of the pressure which has been building on the Kilmarnock manager Gary Locke.
Hamilton's poor run of form continues - they have only managed one win from their last 10 matches.
Right from the kick-off Hamilton opted to test the Kilmarnock defence, Ali Crawford with the attempt from the centre-circle. It was on target but Jamie MacDonald saved comfortably.
Obadeyi then loped forward for Kilmarnock, but his shot from the edge of the box was well off target.
The much-maligned Killie defence then held up fairly well to some sustained Hamilton pressure.
There was a soft claim from Lucas Tagliapietra for a penalty after a corner. The giant defender appeared to be manhandled in the box, but nothing was given.
There were signs of life from Kilmarnock in the attacking third as Magennis fired over the bar, and McHattie shot wide of the post.
Magennis then jinked into the box but his near-post shot was batted away by McGovern in the Accies goal. Obadeyi did similar shortly after.
At the other end Darian Mackinnon cut a dangerous ball across the penalty area, but unfortunately for Hamilton there were no takers.
Conrad Balatoni then made the clearance of the season off the goal-line. Dougie Imrie fired in a fierce shot from eight yards which had MacDonald beaten, but there was Balatoni on the line to repel the ball with a superb clearing header.
Five minutes into the second-half it looked like Magennis would give Kilmarnock the lead as his volley from McHattie's cross seemed destined to nestle in the top corner. Somehow McGovern managed to get a glove to it and tip the shot over the bar.
There then followed a lengthy delay as Tagliapietra was stretchered from the field after picking up an injury at a corner. He was replaced by Jamie Sendles-White.
There was a real sense that either side could win the match, and the game became increasingly stretched in the second-half.
And it was Kilmarnock who made the breakthrough. The ball found Obadeyi in the box and his shot into the turn looped up and over McGovern and into the net.
The freaky effort was scored right in front of the Kilmarnock fans and they celebrated with gusto.
Hamilton tried to respond with a free-kick into the box which found the head of Ziggy Gordon, but his effort was turned around the post by MacDonald.
Kilmarnock almost took a two goal advantage after neat play involving talented youngster Greg Kiltie on the edge of the box. Kiltie angled a shot towards the corner of the net but it was well saved by McGovern.
