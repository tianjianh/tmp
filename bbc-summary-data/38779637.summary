[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jordan Obita's 25-yard strike rescued a point for Reading, who twice came from behind to draw at Ipswich.

Leicester City loanee Tom Lawrence opened the scoring with a trademark goal, running from deep and smashing home via the underside of the bar.
Jordon Mutch equalised on his Reading debut, finding space in the box to roll home his first goal since March 2014.
Lawrence then slotted past Ali Al-Habsi for his eighth goal in eight games, before Obita's powerful leveller.
After a 3-0 home drubbing by Derby on Tuesday, Mick McCarthy made five changes to his starting line-up, including debuts for Emyr Huws and Steven Taylor.
As a first half edged by Ipswich drew to a close, Lawrence lit up the game with a stunning strike by finishing off a clinical counter-attack.
Liam Kelly almost replied for the promotion-chasing visitors seconds later, but his half-volley rose over the bar, before Taylor headed just wide for Ipswich in a frantic end to the first half.
Mutch, one of three players signed on loan by Jaap Stam on transfer deadline day, restored parity when he slid the ball beyond Bartosz Bialkowski after being given too much space in the Ipswich box.
Ipswich again took the lead through Lawrence's 10th of the season after he was sent free by David McGoldrick, but Obita's low strike ensured a share of the spoils.
Reading stay third, four points from the automatic promotion places, while Ipswich move up two places to 15th.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "It was certainly a positive reaction from Tuesday night when we were comprehensively beaten. That performance was unacceptable and unpalatable but today was completely different.
"I made a few changes and the new faces have helped liven up the place and gave us all a spark.
"I thought the performance was great and I think we probably deserved to win it."
Reading boss Jaap Stam: "I don't think we were ever in the race for the top two. We are just beginning to build something this season after finishing 17th last year.
"If we have a chance to achieve something we should go for it, but I was never under any illusion that we are in the race for the top two against Newcastle, who have spent 60 to 70 million pounds, and Brighton, who have worked towards this for three years.
"It makes it very hard when you have to equalise twice. I don't think we deserved any more but it was an important point for us."
