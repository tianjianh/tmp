Mary Logie's body was found in her first-floor flat in Green Gates, Leven, at 20:00 on Tuesday 5 January. She had last been seen alive at 08:00 that day.
Police now believe Mrs Logie was killed "sometime in the morning" of that day.
BBC Scotland understands she was beaten with a rolling pin. The police said it was a "brutal and horrendous attack".
Officers said they had received a number of calls and were following various lines of inquiry.
Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of the Major Investigation Team, said: "As a result of this thorough inquiry, I now strongly believe that the murder was committed some time on the morning of Tuesday 5 January.
"She was last seen alive at 08:00 and so we are now focusing on the remainder of the morning.
"A great deal of activity has been taking place in and around Green Gates, and the ongoing assistance from the local community has been tremendous and vital in helping us develop our inquiries.
"Officers have spoken with various people in connection with this ongoing effort and we're not at a stage where we can release much detail about the actions being carried out.
"We must always protect the integrity of the investigation and there is information, which has to be kept within the inquiry team.
"I want to give my personal assurance to the community that our investigation is thorough and officers are doing a tremendous amount of work to ensure Mary's killer is brought to justice."
Mrs Logie, who had failed to visit a friend in hospital as planned, was described as a beloved mother, grandmother and friend by her family, who said she would be "sadly missed".
Police are continuing to carry out extra patrols in the area to reassure the public.
