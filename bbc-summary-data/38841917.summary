A helicopter service linking the Isles of Scilly with the mainland could be reinstated by spring 2018.

Cornwall Council took just 30 minutes to unanimously approve proposals for a new heliport in Penzance.
Tourism bosses says trade on the Scilly Isles has suffered since the old helicopter service ended in 2012.
Since then the link has been covered by a seasonal ferry and fixed wing planes.

The new site will be built on land alongside the former heliport in Penzance.
The council said it received more messages of support for the heliport proposals, than it had received on any other planning application.
One of the main investors in the project, and the owner of Tresco, one of the Scilly Isles, Robert Dorrien-Smith said: "Today's decision marks the start of the of the project that we believe will bring about a revival for the islands and dramatic improvements for their residents, businesses and visitors".
In 2012 British International Helicopters ended the helicopter service, which had provided a link between Penzance and Scilly, the UK's most westerly islands, for more than 48 years, citing rising costs and falling passenger numbers.
