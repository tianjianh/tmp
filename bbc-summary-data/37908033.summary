[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fire control calls move to Dundee after Aberdeen closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen's fire control room closes on Tuesday, with all emergency calls being now handled from Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five of the 24 staff are directly transferring to the Tayside operation, and the rest are being redeployed or have left the service.
Temporary accommodation is being used, with the new North Control in Dundee due to open by March.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the public would see no difference in how calls are handled.
Concerns have been expressed about the loss of local knowledge.
The plans - which are also seeing Inverness, Dumfries, Fife and Falkirk being closed - were approved in 2014, with Johnstone in Renfrewshire, Edinburgh and Dundee remaining as bases.
