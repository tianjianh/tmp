[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday 5-1 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday consolidated their place in the play-offs with a thumping win over Norwich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Wallace gave the Owls an early lead with a finish into an empty net from 40 yards after John Ruddy failed to get distance on a clearance.
Jordan Rhodes made it 2-0 with a header from Fernando Forestieri's cross before Cameron Jerome pulled one back only for Morgan Fox to make it 3-1 at the break.
Rhodes headed his second before Forestieri scored a fine free-kick.
The defeat stretched Norwich's winless run to four matches and left them nine points adrift of the play-off places.
The Owls went into the game on the back of two defeats, but took an early lead in unusual circumstances.
Midfielder Sam Hutchinson closed down Ruddy, who had left his area to clear the ball, and the keeper could only find Wallace, who controlled well before showing great technique to find the back of the net from long range.
Norwich gave themselves a lifeline when Jerome pounced after Steve Naismith's initial effort was saved, but Fox's header from Forestieri's near-post corner restored Wednesday's two-goal lead just three minutes later.
Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal had backed striker Rhodes to improve after a slow start to his Hillsborough career and the Scotland international proved the Portuguese right with two well executed headers as the hosts cruised to their biggest win of the season.
Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal:
"My players did fantastic and they did exactly what they must do. It was probably the best performance of the season.
"When we are like this, playing good football, we can achieve more goals and a better performance.
"I had a very good expectation about the game. We played some very good football and put our opponents under pressure for long periods during the game."
Norwich City manger  Alex Neil:
"I'm obviously disappointed and frustrated. I think we understood the gravity of the game but ultimately we didn't handle it.
"We gifted two goals to Sheffield Wednesday and then started to play a little bit. If you're going to gift two goals to a team like Sheffield Wednesday, you're going to struggle.
"The lads were disappointed with their performance and they know they should have done better. They know it was unacceptable."
