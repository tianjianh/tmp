The 22-year-old, who lives and trains in Cardiff, broke the world record with a throw of 41.68m but broke it again in her final throw to win gold.
Davies beat South Korea's Young Dae Joo 14-12, 4-11, 11-9, 11-5 in his final.
Arnold beat New Zealander Holly Robinson and Poland's Katarzyna Piekart who won silver and bronze respectively.
Arnold finished 11th and fifth in the event at Beijing 2008 and London 2012.
"This has been my absolute dream - I cannot believe I am Paralympic champion and double world champion. It is so surreal," Arnold told Channel 4.
"I've been injured for two months but coming here has been as clean slate and I just went out there with nothing to lose.
"I actually thought I had one more throw! When my coach told me I had won gold I just burst into tears. I didn't expect to break the world record by that much."
Welsh world number one Davies is a former Brecon rugby player who suffered a broken neck in September 2005 following a collapsed scrum against Ynysybwl.
"I'm not really sure how I'm feeling right now! I can't believe I kept it together. I have played Young Dae Joo twice in competition before and lost both times," Davies told Channel 4.
"I must thank everybody for their support. We've been working hard behind the scenes and it has paid off. I'm chuffed I managed to keep it together.
"I haven't beaten any of the Koreans for a while so to do it on the biggest stage is brilliant. Come on!"
