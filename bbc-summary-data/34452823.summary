[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County have signed former Netherlands Under-21 striker Alex Schalk until the end of the season, subject to international clearance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old arrived on trial with the Dingwall club last month following his release from Go Ahead Eagles in the second tier of Dutch football.
Having started his career at NAC Breda, he will provide competition for Liam Boyce, Brian Graham and Craig Curran.
Curran has not featured since suffering a head injury in late August.
Boyce is the Staggies' leading scorer with 11 goals, while Graham has netted once during the current campaign.
