Cornwall coach Graham Dawe hopes the County Championship final is not moved from Twickenham as part of a potential revamp of the competition.

His side beat Cheshire on Sunday to retain the title they won last year.
However, with crowds at the final falling, there is speculation that the Rugby Football Union could take the game to a smaller ground in future.
"Hopefully they don't take it away from the stadium, because young players want to play at this stadium," said Dawe.
"It all depends on the RFU, doesn't it? How they keep this competition going, how they keep it alive."
Cornwall have now reached the showpiece game in each of the last four years.
The final of the competition, also known as the Bill Beaumont Cup, has been played at Twickenham since 1984.
"It is a problem, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination," Dawe added to BBC Sport.
"All you can do is the best with what you're dealt and don't look at it too gloomily, but who knows what the future holds."
