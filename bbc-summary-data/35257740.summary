The 23-year-old, who played 18 games for the Reds during a loan spell last season, is available to face QPR in the FA Cup on Saturday.
Manager Dougie Freedman said: "His quality on the ball will help the squad. He brings a desire to do well.
"I want players who want to come here. Gary expressed a real strong interest."
Freedman added: "He said no to a few other clubs. I think Leeds were interested but he knocked them back to come to a club where he is loved and wanted."
Meanwhile, former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson is training with Forest.
Robinson, 36, is a free agent having been released by Blackburn Rovers at the end of last season.
