[SN]TITLE[SN]
DJ Neil Fox to face November trial over sex charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DJ Neil Fox will stand trial on sex charges on 5 November, a London court has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He denies nine offences against six complainants spanning more than two decades.
Mr Fox - known as Dr Fox - appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court before Senior District Judge Howard Riddle.
The judge said there should be further preliminary hearings on 23 July and 2 October, and he renewed Mr Fox's unconditional bail.
The trial is expected to last two weeks.
The allegations span the period from 1991 to 2014 and the youngest alleged victim was 13 at the time.
Two allegations relate to a motor show in 1991, one at Chessington World of Adventures in 1996, and the others at the offices of Capital Radio and Magic FM.
