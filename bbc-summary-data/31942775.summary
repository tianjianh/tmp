Felicity Bassouls, 67, of the Scottish Highlands, is said to have harassed the ex-Northampton Saints player after he separated from her daughter, last year.
She appeared at Northampton Magistrates' Court on two counts of harassment without violence.
The case was adjourned for trial at Corby Magistrates' Court on 12 August.
The harassment is alleged to have taken place in Northampton and elsewhere between 1 September and 29 October last year, against Cohen and Ms Bassouls' own son, Austen Blaney.
Cohen, 36, had denied rumours that his marriage ended after his appearances on the BBC One celebrity show.
He starred in the 2013 series with dancing partner Kristina Rihanoff but denied they had a relationship.
In a statement issued at the time of their break-up, the couple said: "Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children.
"There is no third party involved and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time."
