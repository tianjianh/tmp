[SN]TITLE[SN]
Flintshire bin man crash driver 'not distracted', court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A school coach driver whose vehicle was in a fatal collision with a binman has denied being distracted and taking his eye "off the ball".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathon Brown, 37, of Holywell, Flintshire, denies causing the death of Andrew Green, 39, by driving carelessly.
The incident happened at Ffynnongroyw, about five miles east of Prestatyn, Denbighshire, in June 2015.
Mr Brown told Caernarfon Crown Court he was still haunted by the collision.
The court has heard that the bin wagon was stationary and had lights flashing when the coach passed taking children to school, going in the same direction.
The prosecution said on Monday Mr Green crossed the road ahead of the lorry and the bus driver was unable to stop before hitting him.
The court heard how Mr Brown was driving at 33mph in a 30mph zone.
However, on Tuesday, he denied being distracted.
He told the jury: "I don't understand why he ran, that's the bit that haunts me."
The trial continues.
