At the moment the NHS is judged against two cancer targets.
Following requests from doctors, it is expected a "single cancer pathway" will be trialled and it will be measured against the current system.
The Welsh government will announce details of the pilot project during a briefing later.
The Health Minister Mark Drakeford has already announced an overhaul of A&E and ambulance service targets.
The Welsh government has said the new measures will give a better picture of whether cancer patients receive timely treatment regardless how the disease is diagnosed.

The health minister argues that while many of the targets used by the NHS are useful at measuring speed, or how quickly a patient gets treated, they don't adequately reflect the quality of care. For example, whether or not treatment was ultimately successful.
So after an overhaul of A&E and ambulance targets was announced in March, proposals for new cancer care measures will be unveiled.
But opposition parties have argued that in looking at new targets the Welsh government is admitting defeat on the current measures.
At the moment, if a patient is referred to a specialist who suspects they have the disease and they require urgent treatment, then 95% of confirmed cases should start treatment within 62 days.
In February, 90.5% of patients in Wales received treatment within that time period.
The second current target involves patients who are not considered urgent cases but are subsequently diagnosed with the disease. It means 98% of those patients should start treatment within 31 days of that point.
This target was met in February, with 98.2% of patients being treated within the time frame.
The proposals will be tested in coming months by Wales' seven health boards.
