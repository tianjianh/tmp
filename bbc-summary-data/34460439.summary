He tweeted on Tuesday, "Lauren! I found your student ID in the park. If you still need it my office will get it to you. Hanx."
The ID card shows that she is enrolled at Fordham University in New York City.
There is no word yet on whether Lauren got her ID back from Mr Hanks, though one Twitter user has claimed it belongs to her friend.
Mr Hanks is familiar with having strangers return lost items -he tweeted in March that someone had found his credit card on the street and returned it.
