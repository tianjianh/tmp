Arriva Trains Wales admitted some trains had been too full as rugby fans headed to the Millennium Stadium on Saturday.
The Blues took on the Ospreys and the Dragons played the Scarlets during the clashes.
Fans had been tweeting Arriva to complain about trains being full.
Arriva tweeted back to say its trains were very busy and apologised for "any discomfort".
A spokesman said he understood there had been a backlog of passengers waiting at some stations, that was cleared.
