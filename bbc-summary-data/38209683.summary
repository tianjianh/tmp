It took an estimated $28.4m (£22.3m) over the weekend, while Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them kept second spot with $18.5m (£14.5m).
Moana, which only opened last weekend, has already taken $119.m (£93.5m) worldwide.
Fantastic Beasts, a Harry Potter spin-off starring Eddie Redmayne, has earned $183.5m (£144.1m) in just three weeks.
The weekend's only new film, the budget horror film Incarnate, was expected to take about $4m (£3.1m) but only managed $2.6m (£2m).
"We are disappointed that we fell short of our goal and repeating the success of our previous releases," said John Hegeman, executive at production company BH Tilt.
"The low-cost nature of the BH Tilt films and release model enables us to experiment and take risks, and we look forward to seeing what we can learn from this weekend for our future releases in 2017."
Previous BH Tilt films include The Darkness and The Green Inferno.
Award contender Jackie, starring Natalie Portman, had a limited opening over the weekend.
The Jacqueline Kennedy biopic took $275,000 (£216,031) from five theatres, while dark US drama Manchester by the Sea, starring Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams and Kyle Chandler, expanded to 156 cinemas, bringing in $2.4m (£1.8m).
