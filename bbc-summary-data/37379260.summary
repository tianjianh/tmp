An 80-year-old man who became an internet star when his son posted videos of him singing in the car, has landed a record deal.

Former Butlin's Redcoat Ted McDermott, who was diagnosed with dementia in 2013, spent decades entertaining people.
Decca Records signed him up after videos of his carpool karaoke were watched 40 million times on YouTube.
His son Simon McDermott, 40, said it was "a dream come true".
His father has recorded "You Make Me Feel So Young", with "Quando Quando Quando" on the B-side, and proceeds of its sale will go to the Alzheimer's Society and the McDermott family.
Mr McDermott has difficulty recognising his son, but the two tracks are among several songs he remembers the words for.
His son found that singing the songs, while driving around Blackburn, helped his father cope with his Alzheimer's disease.
Simon posted the videos online to increase awareness for the Alzheimer's Society and raised Â£114,000 for the charity, but they did not expect the deal.
"This is a dream come true not only for dad, but for the entire family," he said.
"There have been some really tough days in the last few years - especially for mum.
"We threw an 80th birthday party last month and thought that would be his last time singing solo for people, so it's amazing to think he now has a single coming out!"
The single, to be released next Friday, was recorded in London with the Guy Barker Big Band and mixed at the Abbey Road Studios.
Decca executive producer Alexander Van Ingen said: "Teddy's voice is truly remarkable for any singer, let alone one 80 years of age."
He said it is "full of character and experience" and is "perfect for the classic 1946 Sinatra hit".
