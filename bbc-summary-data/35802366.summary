New manager Rafael Benitez says Newcastle must focus on "one game at a time" in their bid to avoid relegation.

United have 10 games remaining, starting with an away trip to Premier League leaders Leicester on Monday.
"We have 10 games to play, this is just the first one," Benitez told BBC Newcastle.
"We have to concentrate on one game at a time. I am sure that with the quality and the commitment I have seen from the players in training, we will be fine."
Newcastle currently sit 19th in the Premier League, one point adrift of 17th-placed Sunderland and safety, with a game in hand.
A victory would take Newcastle out of the relegation zone but the Magpies have lost their last six away games, whilst Leicester have been beaten only twice at home this season.
"We know that it will be difficult - [Leicester] are on fire now and everything is for them because they are playing at home," the ex-Liverpool manager continued.
"But we have our players, our quality and we need to have the confidence that sometimes has been missing."
Having been brought in on Friday following Steve McClaren's long-expected departure, Benitez admits he has had little chance to make changes to the side.
The 55-year-old Spaniard added: "We didn't have too much time to prepare. This game will be more about the passion, commitment and some adjustments tactically.
"We have to adjust little things but, for me, the main thing is to see the commitment of the players.
"Obviously what I demand from them, what I expect from them and what I have seen from these two training sessions is their commitment.
"They had a day off and I was bringing them to the training ground - and everybody was there and everybody was putting 100% in."
