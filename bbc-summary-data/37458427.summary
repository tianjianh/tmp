[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brentford 0-0 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Athletic picked up their first away point of the season after holding Brentford to a goalless draw in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts dominated but Wigan's Shaun MacDonald cleared John Egan's header off the line and up on to the bar.
Nick Powell's late free-kick almost stole all three points for the Latics but it was saved by Daniel Bentley.
Wigan stay outside the bottom three but have won just once in nine games, while Brentford remain unbeaten at home.
The visitors' keeper Adam Bogdan saved from Lasse Vibe's early low drive before defender Dan Burn's superb tackle denied Scott Hogan a clear run at goal.
Vibe then fired wide as Brentford saw far more of the play and created the better chances.
Wigan's Stephen Warnock bravely cleared an Egan effort as the hosts became increasingly frustrated by a resolute defence.
The draw saw Brentford denied victory at home for only the second time this season, having netted nine times in the previous two home games.
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"Wigan are a good side, they won League One comfortably and have some good players so you have to be at your best.
"Maybe after our last two games people expected us to go and beat Wigan with ease, but our set-pieces weren't as good as they have been and you have to give them credit because they defended well.
"The fact that we are disappointed with a 0-0 and didn't create as many clear-cut chances as we did on Tuesday (against Reading) is a good thing. It's also another clean sheet and we were the better side."
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell:
"We have a bit of momentum now and could have done with another game rather than the international break. We always look upwards and we want to progress as a club.
"Results-wise the start wasn't good enough but we have come out of that and have emerged stronger as a group, and you could see that today.
"I've never doubted myself or my players and they took the hits on the chin and have come through it. It's been a case of getting used to the Championship and having a bit of luck. We are now a stronger group to go and attack this league."
