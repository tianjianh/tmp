Mr Ali was being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over allegations made about him, the BBC understands.
He was not on duty at the time of the crash in Staniforth Road, Darnall.
A force spokeswoman said she could not confirm PC Ali's involvement in the IPCC investigation.

"The force referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission."
A report published in August said about 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men, mainly of Pakistani origin, from 1997 to 2013 in Rotherham.
In September, the IPCC said it was investigating 10 South Yorkshire Police officers referred to the watchdog by the force over the handling of child sexual exploitation in the town.
Mr Ali was a neighbourhood officer based in Rotherham who had 18 years' service with the force.
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton said Mr Ali was a "well-liked officer" and colleagues had been left "devastated" by his death.
"All of our thoughts are with Hassan's family and on behalf of the force I would like to offer my sincere condolences at this incredibly difficult time," he said.
A force spokeswoman said Mr Ali was on foot when he was struck by a blue Vauxhall Corsa travelling towards Greenland Road, Darnall. The driver was not injured.
