The 27-year-old beat eighth seed Parsons 21-9 21-8 in 28 minutes.
Defending champion Sarah Walker also retained her title, with an 18-21 21-9 21-17 win over Jersey's Elizabeth Cann.
Chris Adcock and wife Gabby both took two titles, their mixed doubles triumph courtesy of a 21-18 21-16 victory over Chris Langridge and Heather Olver.
Gabby joined Lauren Smith to win the women's doubles, while Chris teamed up with Andy Ellis to win the men's doubles.
Londoner Ouseph looked in imperious form as he triumphed against England Under-19 champion Parsons to move closer to Darren Hall's record of 10 titles.
Ouseph said: "I would like to carry on to the Rio Olympics, which would mean I could get to nine, but I'll just take it a year at a time."
