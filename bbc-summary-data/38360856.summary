[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 2-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defender David Wheater scored twice in a nervy win over Shrewsbury as Bolton made it nine home victories on the spin in all competitions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The centre-half - whose last Bolton brace was scored in the Premier League - struck twice in four first-half minutes to seemingly put Phil Parkinson's side in full control.
Just as Bolton thought the game was won, Junior Brown set up a frantic finish by heading past Ben Alnwick in the 84th minute.
With 60 seconds of normal time left, referee David Webb denied Shrewsbury a chance to equalise by over-ruling his linesman, who had given a penalty against Andy Taylor for handling Louis Dodds' cross.
Bolton's superiority at set-pieces was evident early on as Tom Thorpe had a header clawed off the line by Jayson Leutwiler.
Wheater then opened the scoring, heading Jay Spearing's corner off the post before mopping up the rebound from close range.
Four minutes later he grabbed his second, finding himself in the right place once again after Gary Madine's shot was blocked.
Shrewsbury showed some attacking intent after half-time and Jack Grimmer drove one shot inches wide of the post.
Zach Clough was denied by a fine save from Leutwiler but as Wanderers went into cruise control, Brown's header meant they were riding their luck in the later stages to cling on to three points.
