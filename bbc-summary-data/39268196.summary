A woman has been found guilty of stealing £2,590 from a pensioner who considered her to be his friend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rona Macdonald, from Dundee, stole the money from David Bowman who had trusted her to help him with his banking.
The 59-year-old originally faced 19 charges alleging that she stole £11,430.20 from Mr Bowman.
However, 18 were found not proven after Mr Bowman, 77, told a trial he could not remember if they were authorised transactions or not.
The pensioner told Dundee Sheriff Court he had known Macdonald for "years" after meeting her in a pub and considered her to be a friend.
He said he trusted her to withdraw money for him because he was "too lazy" to go to the bank and did not know how to work a cash machine.
Macdonald was found guilty of stealing £2,590 between 26 December 2013 and 15 June 2015 at Hayat Supersave Shop in Happyhillock Road, Dundee.
Mr Bowman told the trial: "I only ever take out cash by writing a cheque to myself and cashing it at the bank.
"In June 2015 I went to the bank and they said there was a concern and I'd noticed my bank card was missing.
"I got her to help me because I was too lazy to go to the bank myself.
"She would come along to the house for a coffee and go and get me money and always return the card. It would normally only be for £20 to £50."
He said there were transactions he did not recognise.
"There were far too many for it all to be ones I'd said were OK," he said.
After being shown CCTV footage of Macdonald taking money out at the shop Mr Bowman said: "I don't know where that is. I wouldn't have authorised that."
Sheriff George Way deferred sentence until 10 April for social work reports.
