Irish adoption law: Omagh woman's search for the truth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Karen Droogan has spent almost all of her life not knowing who she really is or where she came from.

The 40-year-old has spent years trying to discover her true identity and find the woman who gave birth to her.
Karen is one of thousands of people who were adopted under the Republic of Ireland's secretive adoption system, which has been in force since 1952.
This week, the government announced plans to end that secrecy, but not all the measures have been welcomed.
Karen was born in 1974 and was raised on a farm in County Cavan by a couple she believed were her parents.
But when she reached the age of about 10, she found out she was not who she thought she was, when she discovered her adoption certificate.
"Growing up, I always knew there was something different," she said.
"I always knew I didn't look like either of my parents or even my brother, I don't look like him, and I always knew I didn't fit in. There was something I felt was missing".
She had been issued with a false baptism certificate in the name Catherine Maguire, but her adopted family always referred to her as "Karen".  Neither name was real.
Despite the revelation, she said she maintained a good relationship with her adoptive mother, who died when Karen was 18.  Her adoptive father died last year.
The fake certificate was signed by a priest in Drogheda, County Louth, and around the time of her adoptive mother's death, Karen, then 18, wrote to him, asking for information.
The priest replied, saying he had passed her letter on to the Health Service Executive (HSE), the body that runs all public health services in the Republic of Ireland.
Karen decided not to pursue the matter with the HSE at that stage. She later got married, took her husband's surname and is now raising a family in Omagh, County Tyrone.
But having children of her own made the search for information about her birth family more important than ever. She started asking questions again in 1996, when she gave birth to a second son who was very ill.
"I pushed it then, to try to find some medical information but all they would tell me was that there was no history of any diseases in the family or any conditions that I should be concerned about."
She was also told, at that stage, her mother had got married and had other children.
At present, adopted people in the Republic of Ireland do not have an automatic right to information that would help them apply for their birth certificate, although the new law will go some way to redressing the balance in their favour.
Adoption authorities are, however, able to release basic facts known as "non-identifying" information about birth parents.
When I ask Karen what she knew for certain about the woman who gave birth to her, she replied: "She was in her early 20s, she was a catering assistant, and I just have (information on) height and colour of eyes, and things like that."
She had another breakthrough recently though, when the Catholic Church published Irish parish records online, including baptismal records.
By cross-referencing her date of birth with babies born to single mothers, a friend of Karen's tracked down what they now believe is her real baptism certificate.
She was named Jennifer and was born to a single woman in a Drogheda hospital in October 1974.  She was adopted weeks later from a baby home outside the town.
She has since tried to make contact with her birth mother, through social workers in Drogheda.
Unfortunately, her mother's sister - Karen's biological aunt - replied on the family's behalf saying her mother did not want any contact.
The news was "devastating" for Karen, but she said she will not give up her search.
"I hope that at some stage I would be given the opportunity to send her a letter personally, and just to know that she is happy.  If she doesn't want contact, I'm not going to turn up on somebody's doorstep and destroy somebody's family," said Karen.
"I assume, from what they had told me, that her husband and her family don't know. I would just like to know the truth of what happened to me and what happened to her."
Karen says she holds no bitterness towards the woman who gave her up for adoption but is angry with the system that denied her the right to know the truth.
"I feel bitter that I had such a struggle, that I had to go begging, nearly, to find information," she said.
"I don't feel bitter towards her because I can understand, back then in 1974 she was on her own, I assume, and she had no support from family probably.
"I can understand being a single parent because I've done it myself and it's not an easy job and back in those days it would have been a lot harder."
The new legislation should make it easier for someone like Karen to find the basic personal details that she had to spend years tracking down.
However, she said she was "insulted" by plans to make adoptees sign a statutory declaration, promising to respect the wishes of parents who do not want contact.
"To me personally, it's making us out like we're just going to turn up on somebody's doorstep, which is not what any adoptee I've ever spoken to wants to do.
"All we really want is to have the basic right, that everybody else has, to know who were are and where we come from and to know the stories around our birth.
"I think to be made to sign [declarations] sounds like it's going back years, to where the mothers were forced to sign their children away - we're going to be forced to sign our rights away."
Asked what she would say to her mother if she ever agreed to a meeting, Karen said: "I would just like to know how she is and whether she had a good life and what the story of my birth was, did she marry my father?
"I just want to know that she didn't suffer."
