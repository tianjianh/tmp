A jury in Australia has heard an audio recording of a woman pleading with her Tinder date to be allowed to leave his apartment, before she fell 14 floors from the balcony and died.

Warriena Wright met Gable Tostee for the first time on the night she died.
He pleads not guilty to her murder. There is no allegation that he pushed her - rather it is believed she was trying to climb down.
The court also saw photographs the couple took together.
They had been chatting on the dating app Tinder and met in person at a seaside resort called Surfers Paradise, on Queensland's Gold Coast.
The prosecutor said Mr Tostee intimidated Ms Wright so much that she felt the only way to escape his apartment was by climbing down his balcony.
According to the prosecutor's account of events, Mr Tostee became angry after Ms Wright threw ornamental rocks at him and hit him with a telescope.
He allegedly choked and restrained her before locking her out of his apartment on his balcony.
The defence lawyer said the case "doesn't fit" murder and manslaughter definitions, and that Ms Wright had become aggressive towards Mr Tostee after a night of drinking alcohol and being intimate.
On the recording made on Mr Tostee's phone, Ms Wright threatened to "destroy (Mr Tostee's) jaw".
Later in the recording, he called her "a goddamn psycho".
She was later heard to scream: "Let me go home."
"I would, but you've been a bad girl," he replied.
"You're lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony. I should have never given you so much to drink.
"I'm gonna walk you out of this apartment just the way you are, you're not going to collect any belongings.
"If you try to pull anything I'll knock you out."
Ms Wright then screamed "No" and repeated "Just let me go home" before falling and screaming.
The court also heard from a neighbour, Nick Casey. He said he heard noises before going outside, where he saw Ms Wright climbing over the edge of the balcony. He had told her "You can't get down this way, go back," he said.
Another neighbour, Gabriele Collyer-Wiedner, said she was woken at 02:00 by the sound of furniture banging and when she looked outside she saw a pair of feet dangling from Mr Tostee's balcony.
She said: "I froze there, then the body fell on my balcony railing. I screamed and somebody else screamed, I assumed it was her voice."
After Ms Wright's fatal fall, Mr Tostee called his father and said: "I didn't cause this, I didn't push her or anything."
Ms Wright, who was from New Zealand, was on a short holiday in Australia when the pair met in August 2014.
If Mr Tostee is convicted of her murder he could face a life sentence.
