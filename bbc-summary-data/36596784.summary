The jury in the trial of a man accused of murdering a toddler has retired to consider its verdict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Buckley, 28, from Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taff, denied murdering 17-month-old Finley Thomas and a charge of child cruelty.
His partner Chloe Thomas, Finley's mother, has admitted child cruelty after originally denying it.
The jury was sent home for the evening on Wednesday afternoon and will resume deliberations on Thursday.
The pair told Cardiff Crown Court that Finley had fallen from the top of the stairs when Ms Thomas was out.
He was taken to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, on 23 September 2014 but died the next day.
