The 23-year-old victim's body was discovered at an address in Ladykirk Road, Benwell, on Thursday night after reports of a disturbance, police said.
Parvel Cina was arrested on suspicion of murder and has now been charged, Northumbria Police confirmed.
The 25-year-old, of no fixed address, is due before Newcastle magistrates later.
The victim has not been identified. A police spokesman said the force had referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), because of recent police contact with the woman and man.
