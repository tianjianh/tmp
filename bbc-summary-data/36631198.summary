Euro 2016: England boss Roy Hodgson will not 'beg' FA for new contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England boss Roy Hodgson says he will not "beg" the Football Association for a new contract after Euro 2016.

Hodgson's deal expires at the end of the tournament and FA chairman Greg Dyke has said the 68-year-old will only stay on if England "do well" in France.
"I'm prepared to carry on," Hodgson said before Monday's last-16 tie with Iceland in Nice (20:00 BST).
"It is different to wanting it. I'm prepared to carry on if the FA want me to."
England started the tournament with a 1-1 draw against Russia before beating Wales 2-1 and drawing 0-0 with Slovakia in their final Group B game - results that left them in second place and in a tougher half of the draw.
Hodgson's decision to make six changes for the Slovakia game has also come under scrutiny, with reports suggesting it upset some in the FA hierarchy.
But FA chief executive Martin Glenn said neither he nor Dyke had any problems with the changes for the Slovakia match and Hodgson had their "full support".
"I actually don't know where these stories are coming from," Glenn told the Independent.
Hodgson said: "If they don't want me to [continue], then my contract will have run out and that is how that will be, so I'm not begging for the job, " said Hodgson.
"I believe in what I've done, in particular over the last couple of years.
"I believe in the team I am working with and believe the team is showing such potential that it will go on to do good things and if the FA want me to continue with me looking after them, I will be happy to do so."

Dyke told the BBC last week that a run to the semi-finals would be regarded as a successful campaign, as would an "unlucky" defeat in the quarter-finals.
England's opponents in the last eight will be either hosts France or the Republic of Ireland, but they must first safely negotiate a buoyant Iceland side who have far surpassed expectations at their first major tournament.
"To be honest, I am not even contemplating going out to Iceland," Hodgson said. "I haven't contemplated losing a game yet.
"I've had to accept two draws which I would have liked to have seen be wins, so I am not contemplating anything there.
"I will prepare the team for Iceland, we will do the best we can to win the game. Then after the game, we will either be heavily criticised as we haven't won it or, with any luck, if we played well and won the game people, will maybe say we did well."
