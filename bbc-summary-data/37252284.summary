[SN]TITLE[SN]
The Qualifiers: Hull KR 18-25 Leigh Centurions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leigh Centurions came from behind to beat Hull Kingston Rovers and put themselves on the verge of promotion to the Super League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts went ahead early on when Ken Sio and Josh Mantellato went over, but Sam Hopkins put Leigh back in it.
Andrew Dixon helped level the scores just after the break, before Matty Dawson crossed to give Leigh the lead.
Leigh scored their third try in seven minutes through Josh Drinkwater, though Matty Marsh set up a tense finale.
The result means Leigh are now four points off the Million Pound Game and one match away from returning to the Super League for the first time since 2005.
Rovers were without half-back Albert Kelly, who was suspended by the club after returning from a trip to Australia later than agreed.
