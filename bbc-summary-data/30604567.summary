Premier League predictions: Lawro v Unbroken star Jack O'Connell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for the Premier League fixtures on 28 and 29 December is actor Jack O'Connell.
The Derby County fan, who has appeared in TV dramas such as 'This is England' and 'Skins', is the star of the new Coen Brothers film 'Unbroken', which tells the life story of star athlete and World War II hero Louis Zamperini.
O'Connell, 24, is enjoying the Rams' revival under Steve McClaren, but also has happy memories of watching them when Jim Smith was manager in the late 1990s.
"Stefanio Eranio was the first name I had printed on the back of my shirt," O'Connell told BBC Sport.
"But quite a few players from that golden era stand out. People like Paulo Wanchope, Dean Sturridge, Aljosa Asanovic and Igor Stimac - the big Croat who ran our backline and was a fearless leader.
"Since then, we have had to put up with a good decade of being dismal but now things have gone full circle."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.
From the Boxing Day fixtures, Lawro got six correct results from 10 games, with one perfect score.
His score of eight points beat Match of the Day commentator Guy Mowbray, who picked four correct results, with no perfect scores, to give him a total of four points.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
