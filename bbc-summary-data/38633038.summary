Services to the whole of Withernsea, East Yorkshire, failed at about 18:00 GMT on Saturday.
Northern Gas Networks confirmed the supply was restored to around 3,000 homes and businesses at around 20:45 on Sunday.
It was thought water may have damaged equipment during Friday's storms.
Ian Waddle, Northern Gas Networks regional manager, said: "We would like to thank residents in Withernsea for their patience and cooperation, along with the other agencies and volunteers who have helped provide support since this incident occurred."
Withernsea is about 17 miles from Hull and has a population of more than 6,000. It has a hospital and retirement homes.
Northern Gas Networks said it had "flooded the area" with employees from across the north of England in order to fix the problem as quickly as possible.
Vulnerable customers were looked after "as a priority", the company added.
It has now released an online guide to advise residents how to safely turn their gas supply back on.
Homeowners or businesses who require assistance should call 0800 040 7766. followed by option 5.
Anyone who smells gas should call the National Gas Emergency Service on 0800 111 999.
