Humza Yousaf met them to hear their goals for the road which runs from Edinburgh to Carlisle.
The group believes a range of small and larger-scale projects could bring economic and environmental benefits to the area.
It argues that could benefit the whole region and make it more attractive to visitors as well.
Secretary Marjorie McCreadie said she was delighted a long-sought ministerial visit had been secured.
"We have long waited this meeting with the minister but we have at last succeeded," she said.
Ms McCreadie said talks would be based on a new action plan with a Selkirk bypass the main concern.
However, she said there were other issues along the route which she hoped would be addressed.
The action group said improved transport infrastructure could give a significant economic boost to the area.
"We need tourists to come, we need people to come and stay and shop," said Ms McCreadie.
"To have these people come we need good roads, good transportation to encourage them to stop and shop and stay.
"Money is always a problem but we will stick at it like we did with Auchenrivock - it took us 10 years to get Auchenrivock but we succeeded in the end."
