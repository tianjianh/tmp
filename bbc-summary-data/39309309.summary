[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Daniel Hughes was stabbed six times with a knife during a struggle while helping colleagues arrest Callum Ashes in Huyton, Merseyside in 2016.
Ashes, 19, of Huyton Lane, Huyton was convicted of wounding with intent but was found not guilty of attempted murder and common assault.
He was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to nine years' detention at a young offenders' institution.
An officer spotted Ashes, who was wanted for another offence, in Westmorland Road, Huyton and radioed colleagues for help to arrest him last September.
There was a struggle in which PC Hughes was injured and three other officers separated them before Ashes tried to escape but was arrested, police said.
Deputy Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said: "He didn't think twice when he pulled out a knife and stabbed Constable Hughes, who had gone to the aid of a colleague who was trying to arrest him.
"This incident highlights the dangers officers face every single day."
There was no separate penalty for having an article with a blade or forfeiture and destruction of it, the court said.
