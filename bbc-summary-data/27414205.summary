Seven of the group at Pembroke Comprehensive School fell unwell at about 14:00 BST. Police believe they experienced a poor reaction to the substance they had taken.
Some were treated at the scene while others were taken to Withybush hospital in Haverfordwest as a precaution.
None are believed to be in a life-threatening condition.
A Pembrokeshire council spokesman said parents have been informed.
A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesperson said: "At approximately 14:07 this afternoon, the ambulance service informed Dyfed-Powys Police of an incident they were dealing with at Pembroke Comprehensive School, where a group of pupils had become unwell.
"Officers attended the scene and established that a number of pupils were affected - some were treated at the scene and released, but others were conveyed to A&E in Withybush as a precaution."
The spokesperson said air ambulance also attended the school as a precaution and none of the pupils are believed to be in a life-threatening condition.
"Enquiries have commenced into the circumstances, but early indications are that the group may have reacted to a type of legal high."
Ambulance staff confirmed that they had sent four emergency ambulances to the school and an ambulance officer.
"Though the cause is yet to be confirmed, it is believed the pupils may have reacted to an unknown substance," added a spokesperson for the Welsh Ambulance Service.
