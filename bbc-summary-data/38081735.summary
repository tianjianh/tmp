[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Thomas Mair is sentenced to life with a whole life term for the murder of Jo Cox, the Labour MP's friends and colleagues pay tribute to the 41-year-old mother of two and give their reaction to the trial's verdict.

Jeremy Corbyn said the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by Thomas Mair was "an attack on democracy, and has robbed the world of an ambassador of kindness and compassion".
"Jo Cox believed passionately that all people can achieve their full potential given the opportunity," he said.
"Jo's values were lived out in her last moments, when she bravely put the safety of her staff before her own. Jo is someone the Labour Party will forever be extremely proud of.
"The single biggest tribute we can pay to Jo and her life will be to confront those who wish to promote the hatred and division that led to her murder."
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Jo Cox was a "committed and passionate politician".
"The shocking and senseless murder of Jo was an attack on all of us and the values we share of democracy and tolerance," she said.
"As home secretary I am determined that we challenge extremism in all its forms including the evil of far right extremism and the terrible damage it can cause to individuals, families and communities.
"Jo knew that tackling hatred and division is not something that can be done by government alone but only by working in partnership with local people and groups, getting involved and speaking up for the values that make us the country we are proud to be.
"Jo's life was brutally taken away. It falls on all of us to redouble our efforts to make sure the principles that she stood for live on."
Labour MP Stephen Kinnock was a close friend of Mrs Cox and said he welcomed the sentence.
"I think that it is the right and due and fit punishment for this heinous, twisted crime, and I hope that as you say the family will feel some sense of justice," he said.
"The trial has been an awful process of hearing in detail, which of course Thomas Mair forced us to do by refusing to plead guilty. He forced the family to go through this."
Mrs Cox worked for the Labour peer, Lady Glenys Kinnock, before she became an MP.
Lady Kinnock told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: "I'm afraid that there's a growing willingness and encouragement in some ways of terrible violence and undermining of the rights, the fundamental rights of people to a quiet, peaceful life or a life that involves political advocacy such as was Jo's life."
Hilary Benn, the MP for Leeds Central, said: "This was a political assassination of a public servant who was going about her work.
"Jo was turning up for one of her constituency surgeries where she would sit and people would come and see her and she would do her best to help them."
He added: "I think it is the right sentence, reflecting the horror and brutality and as we've just heard the cowardice of this crime.
"But I don't really want to dwell on the man who did this. I think today above all is a day to remember Jo and the person that she was."
Speaking to the House of Commons after the verdict and sentencing, Mr McDonnell said: "Jo Cox's murder robbed this House of a fierce advocate for social justice and a passionate campaigner.
"Her killing was an attack on democracy itself.
"Our thoughts are with her family."

Nick Grono said Jo Cox helped him set up the Freedom Fund organisation to help fight modern slavery.
"Jo was deeply committed to humanitarian causes and to human rights causes and deeply, passionately believed in our mission about fighting slavery," he said.
"Jo's legacy is one of this outpouring of love and tolerance against an act of utter hatred and intolerance.
"It has been just remarkable, for us that are close to Jo and her family , to see how people across the country and across the world have responded to this act of hatred - and Jo would have been so desperately proud of that response."
