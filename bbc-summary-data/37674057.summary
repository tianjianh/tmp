Two men saved off Portobello after dinghy capsizes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lifeboat crew believe they saved the lives of two men whose dinghy capsized off Portobello.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men's boat appeared to lose its mast at about 13:05 on Sunday and the men ended up in the water.
Although they did not have a radio or mobile phone, the incident was witnessed by people on a nearby shoreline who called for help.
The Kinghorn RNLI lifeboat helped both men from the Firth of Forth and took them ashore.
Lifeboat helm Mark Brown said: "On arrival, we pulled both male casualties into the lifeboat and took them ashore where Fisherrow Coastguard Rescue team personnel assisted.
"One casualty had swallowed a lot of water and was very cold, but the second sailor was able to assist in the recovery of the dinghy.
"Weather conditions were good, but there was a heavy 1-2m swell running due to the easterly wind we are experiencing just now. This made it difficult whilst taking the casualties ashore.
"The casualties were well equipped for inshore sailing but they didn't have a radio or mobile phone onboard. They were fortunate in this instance that members of the public called 999 to launch a rescue mission."
