Matt Derbyshire: Rotherham United striker's red card at Leeds rescinded after appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham United striker Matt Derbyshire has succeeded with his appeal against his sending-off against Leeds United on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old was dismissed in the second half of his side's 2-1 win for elbowing Gaetano Berardi.
The former Blackburn man would have faced a three-match ban had the red card not been rescinded.
Derbyshire, who has scored six goals this season, is now eligible to play against Bristol City on Tuesday.
