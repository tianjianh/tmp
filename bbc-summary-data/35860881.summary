Pippin, a cross between a Yorkshire terrier and a poodle, was taken from his home in Wigston, Leicestershire, last Tuesday.
The 54-year-old actor met Pippin and owner Jane Wilson on the set of the TV show Doc Martin while they were on holiday in Cornwall.
The total has doubled to £4,000 as the family had already offered a reward.
Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire
Mrs Wilson's son, Gareth, said he contacted Mr Clunes's agent to help find Pippin after the actor showed "genuine interest" in him when he met him a few years ago on set in Port Isaac.
"We are so incredibly grateful for Martin Clunes's help and wish to thank him from the bottom of our hearts... [his] intervention has been a ray of light in the clouds," he said.
"The focal point of our lives was ripped away last week and I am incredibly worried for my mother.
"She does not eat, nor sleep and is so distraught... it makes the situation unbearable."
In a statement, Mr Clunes's agent said: "Martin can't think what he can do to help except add another £2,000 to their existing reward offer."
Mrs Wilson discovered the 15-year-old Yoodle was missing when she arrived home to find "glass shattered everywhere".
She said he was "really ill" and would not "last long" as he is dependent on prescribed pills and medicated food to survive.
Pippin, who is partially deaf and blind, is black with silvery hair on his face and beard. The tip of his tail is bald and he has a noticeable lump where the tail joins the body.
The family has urged anyone with information to contact Leicestershire Police or Crimestoppers.
