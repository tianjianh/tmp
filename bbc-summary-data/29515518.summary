Twin Peaks: Why is everyone excited about its return?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nowadays we're almost spoiled by good television dramas.

Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Scandal, House of Cards - the list of shows worth staying in for goes on and on.
In fact, it's pretty hard to keep up with them all and it's really annoying when people are talking about that must-see programme you just haven't got around to watching.
So, with all that good TV, why should you be bothered about a show that first aired in 1990?
And just why has social media gone nuts about Twin Peaks returning for a third series?
According to Topsy there have been almost 75,000 tweets about the drama, with it trending in cities across the UK.
Well, for those of you who haven't got around to watching it over the last two-and-a-half decades - or who just weren't born back then - here's your Newsbeat guide to why it's such a big deal.
The basic premise of the story is a murder investigation.
Kyle MacLachlan starred as FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, who was looking into the death of homecoming queen Laura Palmer, played by Sheryl Lee.
Set in a small town in the US, each episode represented a day in the story, and focused on the double lives of the characters.
Even if you haven't seen Twin Peaks, you'll probably have come across at least one of David Lynch's films.
His movies include Mulholland Drive, The Elephant Man and Eraserhead.
He's also known for his acting work, providing the voice of Gus in The Cleveland Show, among other roles.
As the co-creator and director of Twin Peaks, he's credited with much of its success.
Bizarre dream sequences, people talking to logs and David Duchovny as a transgender government official - the world of Twin Peaks is unlike any other.
Maybe 25 years on, shows have become more violent, sexually explicit and full of swearing, but some of these scenes and characters are still as creepy as they ever were.
And with the third series airing on Showtime in the US, Lynch may have even more freedom to make Twin Peaks really, really weird.
According to the announcement, Lynch and co-creator Mark Frost will write and produce all nine episodes of the limited series and it will be set in the present day.
"Twin Peaks will continue the lore of the original series, providing long-awaited answers and a satisfying conclusion for the series' passionate fan base," it added.
The show isn't due to air until 2016, so you've got plenty of time to watch the first two instalments.
All the episodes are available to stream on Amazon Prime in the UK, while the download, DVDs and Blu-Rays are also available to buy.
