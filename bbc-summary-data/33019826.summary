It is the second motorbike crash at the Devil's Elbow hairpin on the Peel to Kirk Michael coast road in as many days, said police.
Both riders were rescued by Coast Guard and Fire Service rescue teams and escaped with "minor injuries".
The Isle of Man Constabulary said it will be reviewing safety at the site.
No other vehicles were involved in either incident.
The road, which is on the west coast of the island, is not part of the Isle of Man TT course.
Two visiting motorcyclists have already died in separate accidents on open roads on the island this week.
Sgt Andy Pailor said: "Whether you live on the island or are visiting for the TT it is imperative you ride or drive to your limits and take proper notice of the road signs."
