[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bishop of St Edmundsbury takes Lambeth Palace role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich is to take up a new senior post at Lambeth Palace, the headquarters of the Anglican Church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Right Reverend Nigel Stock will become Bishop at Lambeth in October.
He will work with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby on renewing religious life, reconciliation within Anglicanism and boosting membership.
"As Bishop of Lambeth, I will be the main point of contact for bishops of the Church of England," he said.
"I will also be engaged with ecumenical and interfaith work.
"The archbishop is aiming to work with a smaller staff at Lambeth, but is looking to make it a responsive, courteous and hospitable place from which to conduct his ministry.
"He is working on three priorities for his ministry: a renewal of prayer and the religious life within the country; reconciliation within the Church and the nation; and evangelism."
