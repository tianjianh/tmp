Turnover at the club grew from £11.8m to £14.6m in the latest accounts.
That coincided with Bath reaching last season's Premiership final and the high-profile signing of Sam Burgess.
"Off the pitch, we are close to achieving our ambition of operating as a self-sustaining club," managing director Tarquin McDonald said.
"This means that we can continue to invest in the club's future and it also provides the club with greater flexibility in terms of financing a new stadium."
Bath, who are currently ninth in the Premiership, lost to Saracens in last year's Premiership final.
Burgess has since returned to rugby league with NRL side South Sydney Rabbitohs.
