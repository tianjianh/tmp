[SN]TITLE[SN]
Glasgow gallery left empty for 'cancelled' exhibition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An empty gallery has been unveiled as the latest work by an artist who "cancelled" her exhibition at one of Glasgow's leading venues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marlie Mul asked for no exhibition to be held in the Gallery of Modern Art.
All that will be visible in the gallery are billboards advertising that the exhibition has been cancelled.
People are being invited to "visit and interact with the space" - and suggest alternative uses for the gallery during the five months set aside for the show.
Gallery 1 at Goma will lie empty from Friday until the end of October.
Visitors will instead be greeted by 21 billboards advertising the cancellation of the exhibition by the Dutch artist.
Goma said Mul's "conceptual gesture" was to act as an "implicit critique of what is displayed within museums and galleries".
It said that by removing traditional content and opening the space for public use, Mul was "augmenting the institution to question the relevance of an art exhibition in 2017".
Goma curator Will Cooper said the cancellation was an "amazing opportunity".
He said: "By removing what would traditionally be considered an art object we are instead presenting the gallery as an empty space, giving us a moment to question the value in turning over exhibition after exhibition after exhibition."
He added: "We're excited by the different types of activities that might be on offer during this cancelled show.
"So far, it's looking like we'll have some life drawing classes, yoga sessions, artist film screenings and I even think my daughter's got Bounce and Rhyme scheduled in.
"We might even get a carpet bowls session on the go."
