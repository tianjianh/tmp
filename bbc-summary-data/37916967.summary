Election 2016: Clinton and Trump in swing states deadlock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are locked in a knife-edge battle in swing states after polls closed across most of the US in the White House election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The contest is too close to call in the battlegrounds of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida and North Carolina.
But Republican nominee Mr Trump racked up wins in the Midwest and South, while Democrat Mrs Clinton swept Northeastern states, ABC News projects.
Republicans are set to retain control in the House of Representatives.
As expected, Mr Trump has been victorious in the Republican strongholds of Alabama, Kentucky, South Carolina, Nebraska, Indiana, West Virginia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Texas, ABC News projects.
He is also forecasted to win Missouri, Montana, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming - all solidly conservative states.
