[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tour coach came off the A83 in Argyll at the Rest and Be Thankful in high winds. It rolled down an embankment before coming to rest on its wheels beside Loch Restil.
Of the 52 people on board, 23 were initially taken to hospital.
All 10 of the remaining patients' conditions were described as "stable."
Of the three patients still at the Southern General Hospital, one is described as being in "a serious but stable condition," while the remaining two are stable.
Three patients at the Western Infirmary and four patients at the Royal Alexandra Hospital are also all in a stable condition.
On Friday, police said they were still looking into the exact cause of the crash.
Ch Insp Fraser Candlish said: "Inquiries are ongoing to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident, however early indications would suggest that the high winds may have been a factor."
