Edinburgh 14-16: Extra metre taken for penalty, says Solomons

Alan Solomons felt the penalty that beat his Edinburgh team against Munster was taken beyond the mark.

Stand-off Ian Keatley struck from just inside Edinburgh's half after prop John Andress had collapsed a scrum.
"If you look where that scrum is, and where the penalty was taken, there was definitely a metre taken there," the head coach told BBC Scotland.
"It looked to me that the ball, had it been taken from the right spot, would have gone under the bar."
As part of the Pro12's post-match review protocols, Solomons said he will "definitely" raise the issue.
The late penalty aside, the South African was frustrated with Edinburgh's inability to secure victory in a match they ought to have won.
Will Helu scored a brilliant, flowing try for the hosts - a rare moment of fluency and precision for Edinburgh, who lacked composure and committed too many errors.
And the hosts almost snatched victory on the last play after Damien Hoyland's interception saw them pound the Munster line well beyond 80 minutes, climaxing with a rather hurried drop-goal attempt from Sam Hidalgo-Clyne that was charged-down and spilled.
"There's no question about that - we should have won this game," added Solomons.
"I thought key decision-makers at times didn't have the composure. That happens. We made a rod for our own back with silly decisions that were taken.
"It was a superb try and I thought we could get in there at the end, but I think we just had to hold the ball down there and the points would have come.
"I thought we played poorly against Zebre [two weeks ago] and fully deserved to lose. I thought we should have come away with a draw at Connacht [last weekend], and this game is a game we should have won.
"We've got to look at ourselves. It's those little things, those fine margins we spoke about at the end of the game between winning and losing, and we've got to make sure those fine margins fall on our side."
