All the casualties are said to be in a "stable condition".
German rider John Degenkolb suffered a partially detached finger and forearm fracture. Warren Barguil, Chad Haga and Max Walscheid also suffered fractures.
A team statement said the riders were side-by-side on their own side of the road at the time.
It added: "A car coming the other direction rode into the group of riders head on."
The other riders were identified as Frederk Ludvigsson and Ramon Sinkeldam.
Helicopters were used in the rescue and the injured cyclists were taken to two hospitals.
An update from the team on Sunday confirmed the injuries suffered by the riders:
Giant-Alpecin chief executive Iwan Spekenbrink said: "It has been a very tough day for the team.
"This team - riders, both men and women, and everyone in the organisation - feels like a band of brothers and sisters. Together, and by standing by each other, the team will come out of this stronger than ever."
Elsewhere, Cycling News has reported that Italian rider Adriani Maloris has been placed in an induced coma after suffering multiple injuries, including head fractures, in a crash during the fifth stage of the Tour de San Luis.
