[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thomas 'Slab' Murphy trial hears someone else signed documents in his name

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of Thomas "Slab" Murphy for alleged tax evasion has heard there is "strong evidence" the prominent republican did not sign a number of documents bearing his signature.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 66-year-old from Ballybinaby, Hackballscross, County Louth, is being tried for tax evasion at the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court.
He denies nine charges against him.
A handwriting expert gave evidence at the trial on Tuesday.
Mr Murphy's defence lawyers claim that his brother managed the accused man's cattle herd and farming activities.
It is the prosecution's case that, although Mr Murphy conducted significant dealings in relation to cattle and land, and received farming grants from the Department of Agriculture, he failed to make any returns to revenue.
The charges against Mr Murphy arise out of an investigation by the Irish police's Criminal Assets Bureau.
On Tuesday, a handwriting expert told the court there was "strong evidence" that Thomas Murphy did not sign a number of documents signed in his name.
He told the court that there is "conclusive evidence" that the three documents, dating from 2007 to 2014, were all signed by the author of another set of documents, which are tax forms in the name of Patrick Murphy, the accused man's brother.
The trial continues.
