London Stadium could stage 2019 Cricket World Cup matches

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Stadium will be considered as a venue for the 2019 World Cup, if it is found suitable for staging cricket.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The England and Wales Cricket Board have been asked by the International Cricket Council to suggest high-capacity venues.
The 60,000-seat capacity former Olympic Stadium - used by West Ham - is much larger than any UK cricket ground.
But a feasibility test of the venue, including the size of the potential playing surface, is yet to take place.
Only if that test were passed would London Stadium potentially be put forward as an addition to the 11 venues vying to host matches.
Those grounds are Lord's, The Oval, Trent Bridge, Edgbaston, Old Trafford, Headingley, Cardiff, Southampton, Chester-le-Street, Taunton and Bristol.
Of that list, Lord's has the highest capacity at around 30,000.
However, the ICC is keen to replicate the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, which saw attendances in excess of 90,000 in Melbourne and games held at other large stadiums in Sydney, Adelaide and Auckland.
Of those, Auckland's Eden Park, traditionally a rugby ground, has dimensions that left the straight boundaries incredibly short.
London Stadium, which has been considered for T20 matches by county side Essex, would have to be able to accommodate a playing surface large enough to host international cricket.
It would also need to be available, but with the tournament running from 30 May to 15 July, it is unlikely to encroach upon the needs of tenants West Ham United or affect the annual Anniversary Games athletics meeting.
