A man has been jailed for life for raping a teenage girl in 1987 - after police reopened the "cold case" almost 30 years later.

David John Mears, 60, broke into the 16-year-old's home in Swindon and attacked her on 12 August.
He was arrested in April after new forensic techniques uncovered fresh evidence.
Mears, from Plymouth, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of eight years at Swindon Crown Court.
He pleaded guilty to rape, false imprisonment and indecent assault at an earlier hearing.
The court heard Mears broke into the house where the girl was staying and blindfolded, then violently sexually assaulted her.
Det Sgt Liz Coles of Wiltshire Police said the sentence was "the result of hard work by our team of officers who resurrected the cold case, re-examined the DNA evidence and used state-of-the-art, modern technology to identify the man responsible for this horrific attack".
