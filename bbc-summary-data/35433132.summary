Francesco Guidolin: Swansea City boss eyes 'one or two' recruits

Swansea City head coach Francesco Guidolin wants to limit his January signings to "one or two".

Chievo's 26-year-old striker Alberto Paloschi is due in Swansea for a medical ahead of an Â£8m move to the Liberty Stadium.
But fellow Italian Guidolin played down speculation linking the relegation-threatened Swans to Crystal Palace's 25-year-old forward Dwight Gayle.
"I think one or two new players would be good but no more," Guidolin said.
Former Udinese manager Guidolin was appointed Swansea's head coach earlier this month, guiding them to a first ever league win at Everton in his first game in charge.
With the Swans 15th in the Premier League and just four points above the relegation zone, the Italian admitted it is a "possibility" transfer targets could be put off a move.
But as he settles into his new role, Guidolin is more concerned about familiarising himself with the current squad than he is with making new signings.
"It is not easy for me because I want to know all my players," he added.
Only bottom club Aston Villa have scored fewer Premier League goals this season than Swansea, for whom signing a striker is a priority.
The Swans have been linked with a move for Gayle, though Guidolin was not aware of an offer.
"I don't know at the moment. In this period, there are many rumours, many names of players," he said.
"If there is a possibility, I hope to have another midfielder."
That midfielder will not be Napoli's Jonathan de Guzman, who spent two seasons on loan at Swansea between 2012 and 2014.
Dutch international De Guzman, 28, has joined another Serie A side, Carpi, on loan until the end of the season.
