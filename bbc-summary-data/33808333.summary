[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prahlad Pandya, owner of Highfields Taxis, was convicted in his absence after a driver refused to pick up Mohammed Khatri from BBC Leicester.
Pandya, of Gwencole Crescent, Leicester, was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £655.50 costs.
The prosecution was brought by the city council which said it hoped it would send a message to other cab firms.
A taxi was ordered for Mr Khatri and his assistance dog Vargo after an interview he gave to BBC TV in January.
When a reporter called to check where it was he was told none of the drivers would collect a passenger with a dog.
At the time, the firm apologised to Mr Khatri and told the BBC it would never happen again.
Speaking after the hearing Mike Broster, from the city council, said: "The operator in this case had a legal duty to provide services to someone who wanted to use an assistance dog and they didn't comply with that.
"The city council hopes that this case sends out a message to other operators that they need to comply with that duty and if they don't the city council will prosecute them."
