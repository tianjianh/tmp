[SN]TITLE[SN]
Preston North End 3-2 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Callum Robinson's late strike gave Preston victory over Blackburn Rovers as five goals were scored in a wonderful Lancashire derby at Deepdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robinson fired in 10 minutes from time after Blackburn had levelled twice.
Daniel Johnson scored two first-half goals for North End, a superb curling 25-yard effort and a penalty.
Rovers' Danny Graham also netted twice - first on the rebound after missing a penalty before the break, and a deflected equaliser in the second half.
Robinson's winner, his third goal in his last five league games, was a clinical finish into the bottom corner from 12 yards and capped a pulsating match, full of drama and attacking football.
The hosts were without strikers Jermaine Beckford and Eoin Doyle, who were beginning three-match bans after being sent off for fighting with each other in last weekend's defeat by Sheffield Wednesday.
But Simon Grayson's side did not suffer going forward as Johnson opened the scoring with a stunning first-time shot into the corner.
Both penalties appeared clear-cut - Johnson first bringing down Blackburn's Sam Gallagher and Darragh Lenihan hand-balling while challenging Preston striker Simon Makienok.
Graham's weak spot-kick for Rovers was saved by Chris Maxwell, but the former Sunderland striker powered in the rebound after a mad goalmouth scramble.
Johnson stroked in his penalty, sending Jason Steele the wrong way, to make it 2-1 to the hosts at half-time.
Graham's second goal had an air of fortune, taking a deflection off Tom Clarke and past Maxwell, but Blackburn could not hold on for a point.
