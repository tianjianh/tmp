Oxford United boss Michael Appleton is glad his side's FA Cup fourth-round tie against Newcastle United has not been chosen for live television coverage.

"We don't turn up when the cameras are on," he told BBC Radio Oxford ahead of Saturday's sell-out home game against the Championship high-fliers.
"I was quite pleased when I found out we weren't going to be live," he added.
"But, there's no doubt about it, if we can cause an upset, we'll be a pretty big deal in the media the next day."
League One Oxford welcome the Magpies to the Kassam Stadium knowing their FA Cup exploits last season accounted for another big name, after beating Premier League Swansea City in round three.

But Appleton feels knocking out Rafael Benitez's side, who are second in the Championship, would rank far higher in terms of achievements.

"For me, if Newcastle were in the Premier League right now, they'd be a top 10 team," he said.
"They've got a fantastic manager, are a great club with a winning mentality and have fantastic support behind them.
"We want to make sure we can compete with them on the day. If we're in the game after 70 minutes, we need to give ourselves a great opportunity of creating an upset.
"If we can, it will be one of those games people won't forget for a long time."
