A shot was fired through the kitchen window of the house at Lakeview Court in the Drumgor area on Wednesday night.
The attack happened at about 22:10 GMT. Four adults and two children were inside the house at the time.
Police have appealed for anyone with any information about the shooting to contact them.
Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie described the attack as "deeply worrying".
"A family home, with children upstairs in bed, was attacked in the hours of darkness," he said.
"We again are seeing the use of firearms on the streets of Craigavon, and we could well have been facing a fatality here this morning."
The DUP's Carla Lockhart said the shooting was a "shocking attack".
