[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some bus services in mid Wales facing the axe because the firm which runs them went into administration could be maintained, a council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceredigion-based Lewis Coaches, which runs buses from Aberystwyth to Cardiff via Carmarthen, is to shut on Friday.
The Confederation of Passenger Transport Cymru said 40 jobs were at risk.
Ceredigion council said it was working to continue some services.
The authority said plans were already in place to see the on-demand Bwcabus service and the 588 and 585 routes from Aberystwyth University to Lampeter taken over by other firms by Saturday.
But the council said it understood the 701 Aberystwyth - Carmarthen - Cardiff service would end on Friday and it did not know if another operator would take it on.
Lewis Coaches is the third bus company in Wales to collapse in the past two months, with 300 jobs lost when Wrexham-based GHA Coaches went into administration in July and Pembrokeshire firm Silcox Coaches, ceasing trading after 134 years in June.
