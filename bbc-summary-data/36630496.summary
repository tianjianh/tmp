[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Rodgers, who was 24 and from Ballymena, died after he fell about 26ft (8m) from a promenade onto a rocky beach in Nice.
Hundreds attended the service at St Patrick's Church in Ballymena.
The funeral took place hours before Northern Ireland's Euro clash with Wales.
The accident happened in the early hours of Monday 13 June, shortly after Northern Ireland played its first match of the Euro 2016 finals against Poland in the city.
Supt Nigel Goddard, who is leading the PSNI team in France, said he was told it was an accident and not in any way disorder related.
Tributes have been paid to Mr Rodgers by his friends, fellow fans, and by the Irish Football Association (IFA).
