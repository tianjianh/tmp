Sky TV pundit Neville and Man United assistant manager Giggs bought the old stock exchange building in Manchester city centre with a view to turning into a hotel.
But a group of homeless people were living in the abandoned site before it was sold and asked if they could stay for the winter.
Now Neville and Giggs have said they can remain in the building until work on the hotel starts in February.
Watch the video to see the reaction of some of the people living there.
