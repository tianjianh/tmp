[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some of the first projects to be funded by the City Deal programme for the west of Scotland are to be discussed by councillors.

They include a new water sports park, railway station and a sliproad from the M77.
The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments.
The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash.
The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year.
Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved.
The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas.
The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m.
Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes.
Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding.
One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world.
A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there.
Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead.
A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed.
