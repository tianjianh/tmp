Bristol City remain in talks with Lee Tomlin over a possible return to the Championship club this summer, says chief operating officer Mark Ashton.

The 27-year-old Bournemouth forward, who joined City on loan in January and scored six times in 18 games, has a contract with the Cherries until 2018.
"We're in ongoing discussions," Ashton told BBC Radio Bristol.
"We'd all love to see Lee Tomlin here. But what we've got to build here is a squad, and it's not about one player."
City, who finished 18th in 2015-16, signed Tomlin on loan after he made three Premier League starts for Bournemouth.
Head coach Lee Johnson praised the "maverick" as a "top-class" footballer after his performance in a 4-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday.
"We've been in constant contact with Lee throughout the summer," Ashton added.
"But there are so many different factors to bringing him here that would have to add up to make it happen, it's ongoing. It has to fit everything else that we're doing."
In April, Ashton promised to "leave no stone unturned" as the club search for new players this summer.
Preston North End midfielder Josh Brownhill is to join the club on 30 June, while Scott Wagstaff will leave Ashton Gate at the end of his contract.
