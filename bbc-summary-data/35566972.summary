Fit-again midfielder Jimmy Ryan had instant impact, setting up Ash Hunter to lob in the opener early on.
Within minutes it was 2-0, with Bobby Grant nodding home Antoni Sarcevic's cross from the left.
In the second half, Scunthorpe's Paddy Madden scored from the spot when Tom Hooper was pushed over, but Fleetwood ended strongly for a deserved win.
Scunthorpe caretaker boss Nick Daws told BBC Radio Humberside:

"I think the performance was probably a bit chalk and cheese in terms of the two halves of the game.
"Everybody knows that getting the first goal is key, we didn't get that.
"We expected a really tough challenge after a really long week and successful week for us, but they got the first goal.
"Two things in the first half put us on the back foot, but we adjusted the shape slightly to stay in the game - I thought we did that really well and that was the foundation for our second-half performance which was excellent."
