Gilston Hill wind farm plans submitted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been submitted for a wind farm on the same site in the Borders as a project which was previously rejected by the Scottish government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gilston Hill Wind Farm Ltd wants to put up seven turbines on land north west of Gilston Farm, near Heriot.
A 16-turbine project in the same area - straddling the boundary with Midlothian - was turned down in 2013 after an appeal to the Scottish government.
A fresh planning application has now gone to Scottish Borders Council.
Developers said that the new proposals had a "much smaller layout footprint", which would "dramatically" reduce the landscape impact.
