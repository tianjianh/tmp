A rambling route from Bath through the Cotswolds to Chipping Campden has been captured on Google Street View.
A walker was sent to chart the 102-mile (164 km) path with a backpack containing a 360-degree camera on the top.
The Cotswold Way passes a significant number of historic sites, such as the Neolithic burial chamber at Belas Knap and Hailes Abbey.
This summer also marks 10 years since it became an official National Trail.
