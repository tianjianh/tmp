The High Street retailer House of Fraser has been fined £40,000 for misleading customers over sale deals for Christmas decorations.

The department store giant was prosecuted following an investigation by south Wales trading standards officers.
Torfaen council teams visited House of Fraser shops in Cwmbran, Cardiff and in Bournemouth in south-west England.
The company said it regretted not meeting its "own high standards".
Newport Magistrates Court was told the issue focused on Christmas items on sale in 2015 labelled with "Was" and "Now" prices.
However, the sale tickets failed to show lower prices offered during the two intervening time periods.
Torfaen council, which brought the prosecution, said that gave shoppers the impression they were getting a better bargain than actually existed.
Fining the firm, District Judge Martin Brown said: "It may seem to some to be a rather trivial affair, but this is a large retailer in whom the public consider they can place their trust.
"This business practice is one that a company of this standing should have been painstakingly guarding against."
Responding to the fine, a spokesperson for House of Fraser said the company accepted "certain charges" brought against it relating to a "small range" of Christmas decorations.
"We are committed to giving our customers great value through price offers and our policy is always to be clear and transparent to ensure that our customers are able to make informed decisions," the retailer's spokesperson said.
"We regret that on this occasion we did not meet our own high standards.
"Although, the charges related to only a very small selection of products, we have taken additional steps to further enhance our procedures going forward."
Torfaen council said the prosecution delivered a clear warning message that its trading standards officers will "crackdown on those who fail to adhere to government guidelines and consumer protection legislation."
In addition to the £40,000 fine, House of Fraser was also ordered to pay £8,621 in costs and charges.
