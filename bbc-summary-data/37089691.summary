[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 68-year-old Dutchman would succeed VÃ­tor Pereira, who was sacked after one season in charge.
Advocaat took over at Sunderland in March 2015 and led them to Premier League safety, but quit in October after a poor start to the season.
He resigned as assistant to Netherlands boss Danny Blind after three months.
Blind said he was "shocked and disappointed" by the decision.
Advocaat has also coached the Netherlands, Russia and South Korea.
Fenerbahce host Swiss side Grasshoppers Zurich in the first leg of their Europa League play-off on Thursday.
