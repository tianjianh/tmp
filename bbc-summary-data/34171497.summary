Pupils will start learning a second GCSE in maths focussing on numeracy from Monday as part of an overhaul of qualifications in Wales.

Other new Wales-only GCSEs in English and Welsh and revised A levels and AS qualifications are also being launched.
Education Minister Huw Lewis said it was an "exciting time for education".
But the Welsh Conservatives said it has "deep concerns" over the Welsh government's decision to establish Wales-only GCSEs.
The ATL union has also said the changes would lead to the curriculum becoming overcrowded and could impact on optional subjects like French, geography and history.
Mr Lewis said: "It is vital that our schools, teaching and exams keep pace with the modern world, and the changes we are introducing this term will give Welsh pupils numerous advantages, in terms of skills and being work-ready.
"Today is also a good day for employers across Wales.
"We worked closely with them when developing the new qualifications, we listened to what they said they will need from a future workforce and we have delivered qualifications that meet those needs."
Conservative Shadow Education Minister Angela Burns said she wished all Welsh pupils undertaking the new GCSEs every success.
"However, we have consistently expressed deep concerns over the Welsh government's decision to establish Wales-only GCSEs and indeed many schools in Wales last year voted with their feet, opting to stick with English qualifications," she said.
"Our over-riding concern with these new qualifications is that they will lack credibility and may not be recognisable around the world, which would be a disaster for pupils who deserve better."
