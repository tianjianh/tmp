NHS Borders Medical Director Andrew Murray asked them only to attend the A&E department in a genuine emergency.
He said staff were putting all their efforts into the safe discharge of patients to create more space.
He added that community pharmacists could give expert advice and treatment for common illnesses and ailments.
"If you or someone you care for is unwell and can't wait until your GP surgery re-opens on Monday, contact the NHS 24 helpline on 111," he said.
"If the condition is immediately life threatening, dial 999 for an emergency ambulance."
