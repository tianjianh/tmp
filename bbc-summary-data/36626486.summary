Ex-Swansea trainee Edwards, 23, has agreed a three-year deal with Posh.
"We have been tracking Gwion for quite a while now. He is a clever footballer and he has had two good years with Crawley, especially last year," boss Grant McCann told the club website.
"He will suit the way we play. He is a special talent and I am confident we can make him better in the future."
Crawley head coach Dermot Drummy told his club's website: "I spoke to Gwion about extending his contract beyond the end of next season but he made it clear he wanted a new challenge.
"It's obviously disappointing to see him go because, even from the short time I worked with him, I could see his qualities."
