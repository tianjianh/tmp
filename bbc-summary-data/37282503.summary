[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading stretched their unbeaten run to five games in all competitions after being held by high-flying Birmingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reading's Ali Al-Habsi made an early save after Lukas Jutkiewicz had got on the end of David Cotterill's free-kick.
Michael Morrison went close for Birmingham before Jutkiewicz was again thwarted by Al-Habsi in the first half.
Diego Fabbrini fired just wide for Birmingham in the 90th minute before team-mate David Davis missed the target in the second minute of stoppage time.
The result means Birmingham drop a place to fifth in the Championship table, while Reading go up one spot to 10th.
Reading manager Jaap Stam: "It wasn't easy because you play against a top side who are dropping deep to prevent us [having] the space to pass the ball through to play.
"If you play against a team who is playing that, you need to be very consistent in what you're doing. You need to play at a very high pace.
"Sometimes in the first half, we didn't do that. We were impatient. Because we wanted to go forward, sometimes you take a lot of risks and you pass the ball too quick.
"We had a lot of possession and we should have created more chances. But at least we got a clean sheet and a point."
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett: "We're resolute, we're a tough team and a hard team to play against. I'm trying to improve our shots on goal, our goalscoring record and the quality of crosses into the box.
"We weren't quite there tonight but again we showed that we can dig in, we can make blocks, we can make tackles and we can keep clean sheets.
"I'll sometimes take that away from home because it's the hallmark of a pretty resolute team."
