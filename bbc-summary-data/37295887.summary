The 30-year-old former Sunderland striker was poised to join the Royals from Chinese side Shanghai SIPG.
But Gyan joined United Arab Emirates club Al Ahli on loan after the Championship club pulled out of a move for the striker.
Asked if he failed a medical, Stam said: "Yes, he wasn't in very good shape."
"They did a very good medical on him and it was very important because he has been injured in the past and has not been playing a lot of games over there [in China].
"He did not think that him not being in good shape was the thing but that was the case," the 44-year-old told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"Our medical people are not going to lying about that. That's why we made the decision not to sign him."
Reading have scored just five league goals but could move third in the Championship with victory against Ipswich Town on Friday.
"We've got two good strikers. We've got Joseph [Mendes] and Yann [Kermorgant] who I think can perform for us," Stam added.
"We were still looking for another striker but we didn't succeed to get one in."
Forwards Deniss Rakels and Yakou Meite remain sidelined while midfielder John Swift has returned to training after sitting out the 1-0 win at Cardiff City.
