Rome, Miami, Beijing and Rio de Janeiro are also among the eight cities so far named as sites for races in 2014.
Alejandro Agag, chief executive of Formula E Holdings, said it was currently working on "the feasibility and design of the street circuits".
London Mayor Boris Johnson said it was a "scintillating concept".
In total 10 cities will host the first championship and formal agreements will be finalised by July.
The race will feature cars that are powered only by electric energy.
Mr Johnson, said: "Zero emission world class motor racing is a scintillating concept and I am hugely keen that London be involved in the birth of Formula E.
"It has the potential to highlight the impressive strides being made in the manufacture of electric vehicles and hosting a street race could also be of considerable economic benefit to our city."
Mr Agag said: "The fact that cities from all over the world are interested in the FIA Formula E Championship is extremely heartening and shows a global commitment to clean mobility and sustainability.
"They will all be in city centres, easily accessible by public transport, and will feature some of the most beautiful and well-known landmarks as a spectacular backdrop for the races."
