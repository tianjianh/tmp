Dumfries and Galloway 'low utilisation' school list grows

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five primaries have been added to a list of schools operating at less than 50% capacity in Dumfries and Galloway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority holds talks with staff, parents and the community over the future of schools which see their roll fall below that level.
Sandhead, Colvend, Amisfield, Brydekirk and Park Primary in Stranraer have moved onto the list.
Three schools - Palnackie, New Abbey and Hottsbridge in Waterbeck - have seen levels rise to above 50%.
The list is used by the council to begin the "engagement process" with schools about their future.
It looks at ways to improve the use of the schools by a number of methods but can also eventually lead to closure.
Last year Drochduil, Mouswald and St Peter's Primary in Dalbeattie were shut following consultation.
A report to councillors said all pupils involved had "settled in well" at their new schools and work was under way to put the properties to alternative use.
The full list of schools now on the low utilisation list is:
The report said the new schools on the list were all projected to remain on the list in future years apart from Park Primary in Stranraer.
A further report on the situation will be taken to the council next year.
