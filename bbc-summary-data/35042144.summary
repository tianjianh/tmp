Port Talbot steelworks to build power plant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Talbot steelworks has been granted permission to build a new gas-fired power plant to help generate its energy needs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will use gases produced by the steelmaking process to generate power.
The Department for Energy and Climate Change confirmed the project had been approved on Tuesday.
In its community newspaper in September, bosses said the new plant would make the "works nearly self-sufficient in energy" once complete.
Last year, they partly blamed "uncompetitive" energy costs as a reason for 400 job losses at the Neath Port Talbot plant.
A Tata spokesman said the development still has a long way to go but it could play an important part in securing the future of Port Talbot.
