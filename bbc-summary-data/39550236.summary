[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield Town 1-3 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull ended a six-game losing run and gave their National League survival hopes a shot in the arm with three late goals earning them a stunning 3-1 comeback win at Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts wasted a great chance to break the deadlock in the 21st minute when Danny Whitehead's cross was fired over at the far post by Chris Holroyd, who went close again a couple of minutes later when he wriggled his way through the Solihull defence but shot the wrong side of the post.
However, the Silkmen broke the deadlock at the start of the second half when Holroyd got the goal his efforts deserved by heading in Whitehead's free-kick.
Solihull nearly equalised moments later as Jack Byrne's header struck the crossbar via a deflection and the ball was scrambled away, but George Carline levelled 12 minutes from time with a bullet header from Connor Franklin's cross.
Byrne headed in a free-kick from Ash Sammons to put Moors in front in the 85th minute and Regan Charles-Cook latched on to an Andy Brown flick in stoppage time to make the points safe.
