Euronext: Finance group to close Belfast office and cut 80 jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The international finance group Euronext is to close its Belfast office with the loss of 80 jobs.

The firm said it would be winding down in the next year as it relocates its IT services to Portugal in order to "be closer to our core markets".
Some of the job losses at will include contract workers.
Euronext operates stock exchanges across Europe and has bases in Belgium, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the UK.
Meanwhile, County Armagh crisp and snack company Tayto said there is a "strong possibility" it will have to consider redundancies.
The trade union Unite said 80 jobs are at risk at the firm's Tandragee base.
Tayto said this financial year had been "difficult", adding that "business is down".
"We always experience a seasonal drop in the first few months of the year, but recovery has definitely been slower this year," the company said in a statement.
"Production costs in Tandragee are considerably higher than at any of our other sites, which are all in England."
The company said "only £25m of our £180m turnover comes from Tandragee" but said it has "no intention of ceasing production" at the site.
But it added: "It could be that in the future we will be forced to restrict production here to what is sold in Northern Ireland in order to ensure the continued success of the company."
Unite representative Sean McKeever said the company appeared "intent on marking the 60th anniversary of Tayto in Tandragee with large-scale job losses and a squeeze on workers' pay".
"This latest announcement leaves Unite with no option but to ballot our members for strike action," he added.
"It is likely that any strike action will cause significant disruption to the production of Tayto crisps but also own-brand products for the multiples."
