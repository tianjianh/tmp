Sam Manton: Walsall midfielder joins Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe United have signed midfielder Sam Mantom on a three-year deal after he rejected a new contract with League One rivals Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former West Brom trainee Mantom scored nine goals in 47 games for the Saddlers last season.
The 24-year-old is the Iron's second summer signing, following the arrival of Bradford winger Josh Morris.
Meanwhile, Scunthorpe have appointed Chris Lucketti as assistant manager to Graham Alexander.
Lucketti worked under Alexander while the Scot was manager of Preston North End, and later with Fleetwood.
The 44-year-old former centre-back stayed with the Cod Army's coaching staff following Alexander's sacking in September 2015.
Previous Scunthorpe assistant manager Nick Daws will remain with the Iron as first-team coach.
Since the end of last season, Walsall have already seen six players turn down offers to remain at the club.
Jason Demteriou has since signed for Southend, while Paul Downing has joined MK Dons, and Milan Lalkovic has moved to Portsmouth.
Mantom's departure follows winger Anthony Forde's exit to Rotherham earlier on Thursday, while Romaine Sawyers remains linked with former Saddlers boss Dean Smith at Championship side Brentford.
