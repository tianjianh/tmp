Newtonmore's Lovat bogey struck again when the seven-times Marine Harvest Premiership champions suffered a 1-0 defeat at Balgate.

The reverse came as another blow to their already struggling defence of the title. Lovat were the only side to beat Newtonmore in any competition in 2016. But this time round the Badenoch side already have three defeats and a draw from eight games in the league alone, leaving them fifth in the table.
In the other Premiership encounter, Kinlochshiel dropped points for the second week in a row after a 1-1 draw with Lochaber.
The south semi-final of the Artemis MacAulay Cup will be between the area's top two sides after Oban Camanachd beat town rivals Celtic 4-0 and Kyles overcame Glasgow Mid Argyll 2-0.
Caberfeidh, with a 6-1 home win over Strathglass, went top of the National Division, where Inveraray thumped Inverness 10-0.
Greg Matheson struck the only goal at Balgate to send Lovat third in the Premiership.
At Spean Bridge, Paul MacRae scored first on the half-hour for Kinlochshiel, a week after their first loss of points. However, Shiel were denied a return to the winning habit when Stuart Callison, early in the second half, got an equaliser which now leaves Lochaber in the relegation zone only on goal difference.
Despite their absence on cup business, undefeated Kyles were also major league beneficiaries and remain three points clear of Kingussie at the top. Kyles have two games in hand and are six points clear of Newtonmore, who are level with Kyles on matches.
A goal in each half from Dunky Kerr ensured Kyles' MacAulay Cup progress. Meanwhile, their future opponents Camanachd relied on a first-half goal apiece from Aiden MacIntyre and Daniel MacVicar and a second-half double from Matt Rippon for their Oban derby success.
Scotland striker Kevin Bartlett has proved a huge asset to Caberfeidh since his return to the club and got four in the second half in their defeat of Strathglass. Craig Morrison and Colin MacLennan set the ball rolling for Cabers and Mike Stokes got the consolation for Strathglass at 3-0.
Inveraray ran riot at Inverness to go third in the National Division. An Alan MacDonald first-half hat-trick was supported by six other scorers, including Fraser Watt who completed a double in a minute to take the final score into double figures.
Bryan Simpson got the only goal of the game as Fort William progressed in the Balliemore Cup on Skye.
