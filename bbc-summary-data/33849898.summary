West Link: Highland Council secures purchase order

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland Council has secured a compulsory purchase order (CPO) from Scottish ministers for its Inverness West Link project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It allows the local authority to begin the process of buying land on the proposed route of the new road.
The West Link has been put forward as a way of easing travel across Inverness but is opposed by a local campaign.
Opponents say the West Link will lead to the loss of green space.
The Â£55m road project also involves relocating Torvean Golf Course and Highland Rugby Club's pitches, creating a new sports hub and parkland at Torvean and extending Kilvean Cemetery.
In June, councillors approved proposals for the replacement golf course.
On Tuesday, they will be asked to grant full planning permission for a new rugby clubhouse, an artificial pitch and two grass pitches.
