[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn with Darwen Council by-election winner disqualified minutes after win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The winner of a council by-election's victory celebrations proved premature when he was informed he had not been eligible to stand in the first place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour's Adam Holden thought he had secured Blackburn with Darwen Council's Highercroft ward with a 277 majority.
But the returning officer declared the result null and void because Mr Holden works for a council-owned company - this is banned under Electoral Commission regulations.
The election will have to be re-run.
Returning officer Harry Catherall said: "Mr Holden gave me an explanation of his oversight and he advised me that that he had made a genuine mistake with regards to his eligibility to stand and that this had been brought to his attention earlier in the day.
"I will now make arrangements to re-run the election in due course."
Mr Holden got 466 votes, ahead of UKIP and the Conservatives on 169 and 133 votes respectively.
The by-election was called after the death of a long-standing councillor.
