The 21-year-old will officially join the Iron on Friday, enabling him to play against Crawley on 22 November.
Williams, who scored twice in seven games during a loan with Hartlepool last season, could make his Iron debut against Notts County on Saturday.
"I've had a good first day today and all the lads seem great," he told BBC Radio Humberside.
