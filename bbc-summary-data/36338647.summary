Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Stepanenko, 26, said their friendship was "over" after Dynamo Kiev forward Yarmolenko kicked him in a league match on 1 May.
But the players shook hands during a news conference on Monday after they were named in Mykhaylo Fomenko's squad.
"I want peace and friendship to prevail inside our team," said Yarmolenko, 26.
Yarmolenko kicked Stepanenko after the Shakhtar player kissed his badge and celebrated in front of Dynamo fans during his side's 3-0 win.
Both players were sent off - as were two of Stepanenko's team-mates. Yarmolenko is likely to be given a lengthy ban.
"We have discussed this situation and I hope this won't happen again as we are likely to play side-by-side in the Ukraine team for many years," said Stepanenko.
"This dispute should be considered settled."
Ukraine have been drawn in Group C with Germany, Poland and Northern Ireland for this summer's European Championship in France, which begins next month.
