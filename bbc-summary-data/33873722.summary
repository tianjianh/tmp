[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour MP Simon Danczuk has added to calls for the party's leadership race to be halted amid claims non-Labour supporters are infiltrating the vote.

His comments echo those of fellow MPs John Mann, Graham Stringer and Barry Sheerman, who have all criticised the voting process.
Labour supporters have until midday to sign up as a member and vote for the next leader.
The party rejects that false supporters are joining just to back Jeremy Corbyn.
Rochdale MP Mr Danczuk said Labour's interim leader Harriet Harman should halt the leadership contest and call an emergency meeting to take stock of the "infiltration" by those he said were not genuine party supporters.
He said he believed the process may have to be rerun and warned that if Mr Corbyn wins he would not be able to command discipline amongst Labour MPs - many of whom would not vote for "crazy left-wing stuff".
A total of 1,200 people have so far had their applications rejected because of their support for other groups or parties.
Mr Danczuk said he believed at least a quarter of those who had applied to join his local Labour party should not be entitled to take part in the leadership vote.
But in a statement, Mr Corbyn said his vision was of a more inclusive, honest and de-personalised form of politics.
A Labour spokeswoman previously rejected calls to suspend the leadership contest.
She said there was a "very robust" system in place to prevent fraudulent and malicious applications and additional checks were being carried out to make sure the rules are upheld.
Backbench MP Diane Abbott, who stood as a candidate in the 2010 leadership election, has also defended the process saying criticism was coming from people "who think their side will lose".
She added: "This election is being fought under rules that were agreed by the whole party last year."
