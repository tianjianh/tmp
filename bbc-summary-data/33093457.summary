Stoke City are still keen to agree a new deal with first-choice goalkeeper Asmir Begovic despite continued speculation linking him with a move away from the Britannia Stadium.

The 27-year-old Bosnia-Herzegovina international has just one year left to run on his current deal.
"He's keeping his options open," said Potters chief executive Tony Scholes.
"I don't know whether or who he might be speaking to. That's not accusing him of anything. That's the reality of it."
Scholes added to BBC Radio Stoke: "He's away on holiday at the moment but we hope to sit down with him and his representatives again in the near future.
"It would be nice if we were able to sort something."
Stoke have strength in depth in the goalkeeper department, with England international Jack Butland, who agreed a new four-year contract with the Potters in March, currently back-up to Begovic.
The Potters have also signed Danish keeper Jakob Haugaard on a three-year deal, replacing compatriot Thomas Sorensen, who was released at the end of the season,.
Meanwhile, Stoke also hope to hang onto Nigeria winger Peter Odemwingie, who missed most of last season with a knee injury.
After undergoing surgery on the injury he picked up against Manchester City in August, the 33-year-old was out for eight months before returning for late substitute appearances in all the Potters' final five games of the Premier League campaign.
"I'd be hopeful that we could do something," said Scholes.
"He had a difficult year with his injury last season, but showed the year before what he was capable of and it was good that he got a few games under his belt at the end of the season."
