'Dog sat on my accelerator' speeding driver is jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver who claimed his excessive speed during a police chase was due to his dog sitting on the accelerator pedal has been jailed for 13 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Winn drove at almost 100mph in a 30mph zone during the pursuit in County Durham in October last year.
The 23-year-old, from Murray Park, Stanley, admitted dangerous driving.
But during mitigation at Durham Crown Court he claimed his Staffordshire bull terrier, Buster, had become stuck in the footwell of his Volvo.
Judge Christopher Prince described as "ludicrous" Winn's claims that the dog made the car speed by sitting on the accelerator pedal, and then moved to the brake, causing it to swerve to avoid another vehicle.
The court heard that an officer spotted Winn driving at speed in Chester-le-Street before pursuing him.
CCTV footage showed the police car travelling at 88mph in an attempt to keep up with Winn as he drove at close to 100mph.
At one point, Winn's Volvo was seen to brake hard, and turn, just missing an oncoming vehicle.
When he eventually stopped and got out of his car, the bull terrier also leaped out.
Following his arrest Winn pinned the blame for his excessive speed on Buster.
Winn claimed the car accelerated and braked "because the dog's backside was on the pedals of the vehicle", Judge Prince said.
He added: "You advanced an utterly ludicrous account on which you were to insist for over a year."
Winn was also disqualified from driving for three years.
