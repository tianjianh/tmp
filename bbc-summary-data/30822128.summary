Darren Fletcher could leave Manchester United during the current transfer window.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fletcher has interested a number of clubs after successfully recovering from a long-standing chronic bowel condition.
The 30-year-old midfielder was named vice-captain when manager Louis van Gaal took charge, but his contract expires at the end of the season.
The Scotland international has only started five times this campaign.
West Brom manager Tony Pulis is reported to be among those interested in signing Fletcher, who has also started twice for Scotland this season.
Fletcher started the first three games of the season and has not missed a training session.
But Michael Carrick was promoted to vice-captain in December as Fletcher's minutes on the pitch were limited.
He has been involved in only 12 club matches during the entire campaign, the latest coming in the FA Cup win at Yeovil on 4 January.
Since making his United debut in March 2003, Fletcher has made 342 appearances for the Red Devils and was a central part of four Premier League-title winning squads between 2007 and 2011.
He was on the bench for the 2008 Champions League final victory over Chelsea, but was suspended when United lost to Barcelona the following season after being sent off against Arsenal in the semi-final.
