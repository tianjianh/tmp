[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newcastle United 3-1 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle won their third successive Championship game as they cruised past Brentford at St James' Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brentford's Scott Hogan headed over from close range, before Jonjo Shelvey crossed for Ciaran Clark to nod in the opening goal for the hosts.
Dwight Gayle's shot doubled the lead and he tapped in a second after the break from two yards out.
Hogan turned in after a corner to reduce the deficit, but Newcastle were rarely troubled in the later stages.
The result lifts Newcastle to second in the table, though the result took longer to secure than it ought to have, with Christian Atsu firing just off target and Ayoze Perez having a goal ruled out for offside in a dominant first-half showing.
Gayle's two goals lifted him above Hogan and Bristol City's Tammy Abraham as the Championship's top scorer on nine, following his move from Crystal Palace in a reported £10m deal in July.
Brentford fell to eighth in the table as they lost their fourth game in their past five league meetings with Newcastle.
The Bees face Derby on Tuesday, but will be without centre-half Harlee Dean for the trip to the iPro Stadium after he was shown his fourth yellow card in five games and his fifth of the season in total.
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez:
"We did everything we wanted to do - we controlled the game and had good chances.
"I'm not watching the table because it's too soon. I said the other day I was convinced we could improve; I'm pleased but we can still improve.
"The team is doing a lot of good things and we have a striker who is confident in front of goal and scoring."
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"With the quality that they have they don't really need a helping hand but unfortunately we gave them one with a two-goal lead.
"We're not renowned for that - defensively we're normally very good.
"We came here with a game plan but when you give away goals like that it goes out the window. There were good things as well - we competed well enough."
