The actress died in January aged 60 after portraying Deirdre Barlow in the soap for 42 years.
The dressing room is now being used by Anne's good friend Beverley Callard, who plays Liz McDonald.
Brooke Vincent, who stars as Sophie Webster, called it a "fitting tribute" to leave Anne's name on the door.
"She was massive to us and to everybody else," Brooke told Newsbeat at Tuesday's TRIC (Television and Radio Industries Club) Awards.
"We were lucky enough to know Annie. A lot of people had the pleasure of watching her be Deirdre.
"Everyday, without fail, if you saw her, she'd say, 'I love you.' That was it, that's all she used to say to people - 'I love you, I love you.'
"She was always the one who kind of lit up a room."
Colson Smith, who plays Craig Tinker, described Anne Kirkbride as the "grandma".
"At Corrie, we act as a big family - we work as a family, we play as a family, and we are a family.
"[Anne] looked after the new people that came in, she'd give you hugs, she'd tell you stories, and she really made the atmosphere good.
"We're all happy to have the pleasure of knowing Anne."
