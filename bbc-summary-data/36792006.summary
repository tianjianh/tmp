The author and illustrator, who died in 1943, is best-known for her stories featuring Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddle-Duck and Mrs Tiggy-Winkle.
The exhibition, featuring about 30 original pieces, is being held to mark the 150th anniversary of her birth.
The collection is on show at Mottisfont, near Romsey in Hampshire, until 18 September.
The exhibition also includes some unpublished artworks and a set of rare vintage Beatrix Potter dolls and figurines, including a Steiff Peter Rabbit and a Mr. McGregor doll, which has never previously been exhibited.
The original drawings and watercolours have all been lent to Mottisfont by The Beatrix Potter Gallery in Hawkshead, Cumbria.
The National Trust said the artworks are "rarely exhibited outside of their permanent home in the Lake District" due to light sensitivity.
Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated 23 books. Her first, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, was published in 1902 while her last, The Tale of Little Pig Robinson, was published in 1930.
