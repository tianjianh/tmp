Warwickshire: Jeetan Patel and Ian Westwood sign new contracts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire have signed up two of their most experienced players - spinner Jeetan Patel and opener Ian Westwood - on new deals at Edgbaston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kiwi Patel, 34, who joined the county in 2009, has signed a two-year deal.
Former Bears skipper Westwood, 32, who made his debut in 2003, captaining the team for two seasons from 2009, has also committed to another two years.
New Zealand are in England for a two-match Test series next May, but Patel is unlikely to be involved.
He made the last of his 19 appearances for his country in January 2013.
