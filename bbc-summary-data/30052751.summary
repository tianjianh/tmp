The Major Oak in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, took 18% of the votes in the poll run by the Woodland Trust.
The tree, which weighs an estimated 23 tonnes, is thought to be between 800 and 1,000 years old.
Old Knobbley, in Essex, came second in the poll and Ickwell Oak, in Bedfordshire, came in third place.
The Major Oak will now represent England in the European Tree of the Year contest, run by the Environmental Partnership Association, which takes place in February 2015.
The Woodland Trust wants a national register to protect important trees, similar to how historic buildings are protected.
Trust chief executive Beccy Speight said: "The number of votes and amount of interest this contest has generated really demonstrate how much people love their trees and I can't think of a better representative for England than the Major Oak."
Councillor John Knight, committee chairman for culture at Nottinghamshire County Council, said the Major Oak was one of the "most iconic trees worldwide".
"We are rightly proud of our famous tree," he said.
"Legend has it that it was the hideout for Robin Hood and his Merry Men, and the Major Oak is a fascinating natural habitat."
More than 200 nominations were whittled down to a shortlist of 10, with the finalists being seven oaks, two yews and an apple tree.
