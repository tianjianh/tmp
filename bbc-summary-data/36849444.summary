The 21-year-old has joined from Monaco on a one-year deal at Vale Park as the influx of new signings under new boss Bruno Ribeiro continues.
Amoros came through the academy at Monaco and was captain of their reserve side last season.
His 12-month contract has an option for a further year.
Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite revealed negotiations over the transfer were delayed over concerns with the player's medical, but that was resolved and Smurthwaite added the recruitment drive may not yet be over.
"Now there's something else come on the radar," he told BBC Radio Stoke. "We should take him but the squad is so big, will he get game time?
"It'll be interesting to see what Bruno thinks about the players who need to go out on loan."
