First police horses to patrol Gloucestershire in 70 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police horses will be reintroduced in Gloucestershire for the first time in about 70 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrols by the force's new mounted division are due to begin later.
Two animals, named Boris and General, have been lent to Gloucestershire Police by the Met and will be stabled at Highnam Court near Gloucester.
The year-long trial, costing Â£195,000, will see the animals used to police large events, patrol town centres at night and search for missing people.
Ch Supt Gary Thompson said the animals will be become part of day-to-day policing.
"As a policing tool, horses are invaluable in terms of crowd control and being able to cover larger and more inaccessible areas of the county on patrol," he added.
If the trial is successful the mounted division could become permanent, a force spokesman said.
