Championship club Bristol City and its supporters club claim 51 fans were prevented from watching their team play at Birmingham City last September.
They say they were marched back to New Street railway station and put back on trains to Bristol.
The police force said it was aware a compensation claim was being made.
Bristol City Supporters Club and Trust said fans were rounded up and issued a section 35 dispersal notice, and claimed their treatment breached the European Convention on Human Rights.
The official supporters' organisation and the club itself have appealed for fans who were affected to get in touch if they want to join the group action.
Supporters club chairman Stu Rogers said: "I was at the game and there was a high police presence.
"What is now very clear is that a number of innocent fans were rounded up, branded as hooligans and forced into a 90-minute march back to the train station."
A Bristol City spokesman said the action was being brought "to ensure that future use of these dispersal powers is not abused and to secure compensation for those affected".
"We are interested in hearing from any fans who were innocently caught up in this, particularly any that were drinking in and around the Square Peg Weatherspoon's pub and then made their way on foot towards St Andrews from 2.30pm that day," he added.
A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: "We are aware a claim is being made for compensation in relation to the Birmingham City and Bristol City Football match last year."
Birmingham City won the match 4-2.
