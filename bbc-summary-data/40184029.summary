Irish police say further arrests are expected as part of an investigation into the background of one of the London attackers who lived in the Republic of Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men have already been arrested and questioned on suspicion of theft and fraud offences.
A man in his 30s is still being detained in Wexford.
Another man arrested in Limerick on Monday has been released without charge.
Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday the news that one of the London attackers - Rachid Redouane - moved there from Dublin should not alter existing travel arrangements between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
The two men were arrested by Garda detectives and questioned about the use of documentation and Irish social security numbers in Redouane's name, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported.
An Garda Síochána (Irish police) detectives are working to identify the activities, addresses and associates of Rachid Redouane during his time in Ireland.
However, Gardaí have stressed their investigation is focused on theft and fraud offences rather than terror.
The investigation into Redouane's time in Ireland has intensified over the past 48 hours.
Thirty-year-old Redouane, who claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan, was based in the the east London suburb of Barking. He was also known by the name Rachid Elkhdar.
Details of his identity and background began to emerge when an Irish identity card was found on his body after he was shot dead by police.
It is understood he arrived in the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum but that the application was rejected in 2009.
It is reported that he lived in Harrow in north-west London.
The details of when he arrived in the Republic of Ireland or how long he stayed there are still not clear.
However, it is believed he obtained a European Union residence permit which allowed him to travel to the UK whilst he lived in Ireland.
He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse Ann O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012.
It is understood that it was this marriage that allowed Redouane to obtain a 4 EU FAM card given to spouses of European Union citizens.
The couple lived in Rathmines on Dublin's south-side. Reports suggest Redouane worked as a pastry chef.
He left Ireland after the marriage and settled in the UK before returning to Ireland in 2015.
Redouane is understood to have had a 17-month-old daughter with Ms O'Leary, although the couple were estranged.
According to reports, he visited his child before carrying out the London attack along with Khuram Shazad Butt and Youssef Zaghba.
An imam who runs a mosque in Galway that came under attack on Monday, has called on both the British and Irish governments to take action in the wake of the recent attacks.
Imam Ibrahim Noonan said "extremists and radical minds" had been visiting and lecturing in certain mosques in Dublin, Cork and Galway.
"I do know that the Garda are working hard and doing something, but maybe they are restricted due to human rights law," he told Good Morning Ulster.
The imam said his mosque had been attacked during the hour of prayer on Monday, as some people blamed he entire Muslim community in the wake of extremist attacks.
"Every time attacks happen, all Muslim communities around Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the rest of the UK become tense," he said.
"Ninety-nine, point nine, nine, nine percent don't associate themselves with these terrorist extremists - they are peace loving people."
