Belfast shooting: Appeal for help to track car used in attack on police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have appealed for help to track a car used in an attack on a police patrol car in west Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A military assault rifle is believed to have been used and up to eight shots struck the passenger's side of the car at Rossnareen Avenue on Thursday.
Two officers who were in the car were not injured but were said to have been badly shaken.
Police said they believe the gunman travelled to and from the scene in a black BMW 3 Series.
It had been fitted with a false Republic of Ireland registration plate and was later found on fire in Cluain Mor Drive in Belfast.
The car had been reported stolen from an address in Ashbourne in County Meath, on 7 September.
Police said it was "critical" to the investigation that they received information on the car's movements from that date up until the attack.
They added that both the owner of the stolen car and the individual whose car registration was duplicated on the false plates had no involvement in the attack.
