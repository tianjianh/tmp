Guido Amsel, 49, targeted law firms that represented him or his ex-wife in a lengthy legal battle, police said.
One bomb exploded at an office last Friday, severely injuring a woman.
Two more explosive devices were found at law firms over the weekend in the city, but they were detonated by police, and no one was injured.
Mr Amsel has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, one count of aggravated assault and a number of offences related to possessing explosives.
Maria Mitousis, the 38-year-old injured by the first bomb, represented Mr Amsel's ex-wife during their divorce and a later case.
She is reported to be in a stable condition at a local hospital but suffered several serious injuries to her upper body.
Friends and family of the lawyer set up a fundraising page to help pay for her medical expenses and have so far raised more than $25,000 (Â£16,000).
They said Ms Mitousis faced "a long road to recovery".
Police said more packages may be delivered to other lawyers or justice officials linked to Mr Amsel and urged "extreme caution" over unusual packages.
Winnipeg city hall was evacuated on Monday after reports of a suspicious package but it was given the all clear after police investigated. There was also a similar false alarm at a Canada Post building.
