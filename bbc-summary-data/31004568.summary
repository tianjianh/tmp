[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former head master "obsessed with spanking" carried out sex attacks at a Norfolk school, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Tuohy, 83, who now lives in Oxford, took charge of Eccles Hall, a special school, in the 1970s.
At Norwich Crown Court he denied 18 counts of indecent and serious sexual assaults on five boys with special needs aged as young as 10.
Prosecutor Andrew Shaw said Mr Tuohy was obsessed with spanking and lost interest in the boys as they got older.
"You may think from the evidence that he had a particular deviant sexual fascination with the bottoms of very young boys," Mr Shaw said.
Mr Tuohy taught at the boarding school for children who found life difficult in mainstream education and later became its head master.
The boys came from different parts of the UK and found themselves alone, isolated and separated from their families.
"As one of the people charged with the duty of caring for these children, he abused the trust placed in him and used these children for his own sexual gratification," Mr Shaw said.
"Many of the now-adult men who suffered abuse went on to have significant problems in their later lives."
All the alleged victims described being spanked by Mr Tuohy.
The attacks are alleged to have happened at the school, now known as the New Eccles Hall School, in Quidenham.
The trial continues.
