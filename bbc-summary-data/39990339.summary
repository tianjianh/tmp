Floyd Mayweather: Conor McGregor fight will happen, says American

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Floyd Mayweather says there is a "90% chance" he will take on Conor McGregor if he returns to the ring as it is "the only fight that makes sense".

Former five-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in September 2015 after 49 bouts.
Ireland's UFC lightweight champion McGregor, 28, claims he has signed his half of the deal to fight the American.
"I think the fight will happen" said 40-year-old Mayweather. "We have to give the people what they want to see."
Mayweather, who was speaking after his fighter Gervonta Davis beat Liam Walsh in London, said he would speak to his advisor Al Haymon and establish their next move.
"There's no rush," he added. "The only fight that makes sense to me is the McGregor fight. I guess I have one more obstacle that I have to get over.
"When we make a move it's going to be huge. When Floyd Mayweather fights it's history."
