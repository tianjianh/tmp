World number four Stan Wawrinka overcame the spirited challenge of Marcos Baghdatis to win the Dubai Tennis Championship.

The Swiss triumphed 6-4 7-6 (15-13) for his ninth straight final win and his second title of the season.
The French Open champion, 30, saved five set points in a tense tie-break and won when a Baghdatis return went wide on a fourth match point.
It was Wawrinka's first time playing the tournament in eight years.
He had reached the final when Nick Kyrgios retired from their semi-final with a back injury.
That had been the first match between the pair since the infamous match in Montreal last August, when on-court microphones recorded Kyrgios making a lewd suggestion about Wawrinka's girlfriend.
The Australian, who later apologised for the remarks, was given a fine and a 28-day ban, suspended for six months by the ATP, which came to an end on Wednesday.
