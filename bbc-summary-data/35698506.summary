[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scrum-half Henry Pyrgos returns from injury to captain the side and make his 100th club appearance.
Flanker Josh Turnbull features for Cardiff after being released by Wales.
Kristian Dacey misses out through injury, having been a replacement in Blues' win over Ulster, and Matthew Rees captains the side at hooker.
Glasgow have lost just once at home this season and have won their last nine games against the Blues.
Wales Under-20 international Jarrod Evans comes in at fly-half for the visitors with Rhys Patchell moving to full-back.
Thomas Davies at loose-head prop is the only other Blues starting change.
Meanwhile, Cardiff's Wales centre Cory Allen is out for the season because of an ankle injury.
Bennett played in Scotland's Six Nations win over Italy last week and Swinson made a late appearance off the bench.
Pyrgos makes his first appearance of the season following wrist surgery while fellow Scotland cap Duncan Weir continues at fly-half.
The Warriors played recent home games at alternate venues after heavy rain took its toll on the Scotstoun pitch but they are back in Glasgow's west end for Sunday's match.
"We are really looking forward to making our return to Scotstoun on Sunday," said Glasgow head coach Gregor Townsend.
"We've missed playing at our home ground, but we've picked up two good wins recently and the players can't wait to get out on the pitch in front of a big crowd.
"Cardiff Blues are a well coached team who are organised in defence and innovative in attack. We will have to play very well to continue our winning run.
"It's great to welcome back Henry Pyrgos, who has been stuck on 99 caps since playing so well in last year's Pro12 final.
"To have him coming back into the selection mix with so much rugby still left to play is a real boost for the squad."
