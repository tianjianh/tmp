French President Francois Hollande expressed "deep sadness" at the death of Huguette Dupeu in a statement.
Most of the dead in the raid were foreign tourists. Two of the attackers were killed by security forces.
A huge march against terrorism is planned for Sunday that will finish outside the Bardo museum.
President Hollande is among those expected at the event in the capital Tunis.

The museum's planned reopening earlier this week was postponed over security concerns.
Schoolchildren and students were allowed in on Friday, with the general public to be readmitted Monday.
The attack, claimed by Islamic State (IS), was the deadliest in Tunisia since the uprising which led to the overthrow of long-serving ruler  Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.
Over 20 people have been arrested in connection with the attack, although just two gunmen are thought to have carried out the raid.
They are said to have been trained in Libya in an area controlled by IS.
The Tunisian Prime Minister, Habib Essid, has admitted "shortcomings" in the country's security system and has dismissed six police chiefs over the attack.
