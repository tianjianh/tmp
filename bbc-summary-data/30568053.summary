Twelve people dressed as Father Christmas invaded the pitch during a football match between Cheltenham Town and Portsmouth.

The fans ran on to the pitch at Cheltenham's Whaddon Road ground during half time of the League Two match.
Gloucestershire Police said they were ejected from the ground by stewards and their names taken by officers.
Police described it as a "minor incident". The match on Saturday ended in a 1-1 draw.
A police spokesman said: "Although pitch invasion is an offence for which people can be charged, police consider this was an appropriate and proportionate response to a low level incident just prior to Christmas."
