The men, aged 18 and 20, were attacked in Holland Street at about 03:00 on Sunday after leaving Bar Budda in Sauchiehall Street.
They were taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for treatment.
The suspects, who were white and in their late teens to early 20s, ran to Sauchiehall Street after the incident.
Most of the suspects were wearing dark clothing, though one was wearing a white long-sleeved shirt.
Det Con Graham Morrison said: "There are several bars and clubs in this area so I'm sure there will have been lots of people milling around despite the hour.
"I am appealing to motorists, taxi drivers and anyone else who was in the area at the time of the incident to contact us.
"In particular, I would ask anyone with any dashcam footage to pass it to police as the footage could provide vital information about the incident or the suspects."
