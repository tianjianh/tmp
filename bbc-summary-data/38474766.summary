Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho:
"We don't need to go to Reading for a replay. It would be even worse if we were out of the competition in the first game. We have to try and win.
"We need points in the Premier League and got 18 in a short period of time. Now it is Reading and Hull in the EFL Cup semi [on Tuesday], which is very important. A busy time for us. We are in good situation with everyone available."
Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC South Today:
"We know it's going to be a tough game, but we've got confidence in ourselves, we believe in what we can do.
"Of course it doesn't make it easier for you if you've got to play Manchester United. But we're looking forward to this game. You want to go to places like Old Trafford and show what you can do.
"It's always nice for a manager to have a game like this, but also for the players and for the squad to have an opportunity to face quality players."
BBC Radio Berkshire's Tim Dellor:
One Portuguese manager who has at times endured a tricky start to his new club this season, and never hides in the shadows, who has won so many trophies in his career, up against a Dutchman who has had the dream start to life at his new club, seems keen to avoid the limelight, and has not yet won anything in his management career.
Of course all the pre-match hype will be around Stam's departure from Old Trafford as a player, but equally the contrasting characters. Mourinho's difficult relationship with Reading (stemming from Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech's accident at the Madejski Stadium 10 years ago), or Reading's impressive recent cup exploits could dominate the build-up.
Two years ago, Reading reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1927. Ninety years ago, they beat Manchester United 2-1 during the run, but haven't repeated the trick since.
They've won both their most recent away games in the Championship 3-2, so they should not be low on confidence.
