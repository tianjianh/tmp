No one was hurt after the roof collapsed at Rumworth School in Bolton at about 16:30 GMT on Saturday, Greater Manchester Fire Service said.
North West Ambulance tweeted that many cars and fences were damaged when debris with "dangerously sharp edges" spread over a large area.
They said it was a "lucky escape" the incident happened during the Easter weekend when no one was at the school.
The school said on its website it was "confident" that it would still re-open on 4 April at the start of the new term.
