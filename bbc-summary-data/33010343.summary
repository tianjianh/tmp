Millionaire fined £750 for speeding at double limit in Rolls Royce

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A millionaire caught speeding at more than double the limit in his Rolls Royce has been fined £750.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Garreth Wood, son of oil tycoon Sir Ian Wood, was banned from the road for three months after driving at 72mph through roadworks with a 30mph limit.
The 36-year-old admitted speeding on the A90 near Kinfauns in August last year in his £250,000 car.
Perth Sheriff Court heard that there were crews working on the road at the time, with traffic lights in operation.
Wood's family is Scotland's third richest, reputedly worth more than £1.3bn. He lives in Gifford, East Lothian, but was travelling to Aberdeen late at night when the offence was committed.
He asked to keep his licence so he could continue his charity work, with his solicitor arguing that banning him from the road could have "a massive effect, not only on himself but on several charities".
Sheriff Gillian Wade rejected his plea for leniency after noting that he had already committed six previous motoring offences, including a number for speeding.
She said: "I have had regard to the testimonials and references provided and they are all very favourable. Mr Wood is very philanthropic.
"However, this is the seventh road traffic offence and a fourth speeding conviction. He was travelling at two and a half times the speed limit and, importantly, workers were engaged on the road at the time.
"The court has to take account of the seriousness of the offence."
