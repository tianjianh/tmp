Co-op store plans are too big: Jersey planning department

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new Co-op store at Charing Cross in Jersey needs to be smaller for it to go ahead, according to the planning department.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Channel Islands Co-Operative society wants to build a new food store, offices and an artists' studio on the site of its existing store.
In the process it would demolish two listed buildings and create a new five-storey building.
Planning officers have recommended rejecting the current proposals.
Colin Macleod, head of the Co-Op in Jersey, said it was "utterly unbelievable" that the planning department was unhappy with proposals for the new St Helier store.
He said he had spent Â£250,000 on plans for the site after positive early meetings with the department.
The development has been described as a major new gateway into the town centre.
Mr Macleod wants planning minister Deputy Rob Duhamel to reconsider after what he described as an "unexplained and unprofessional U-turn".
Andrew Scaite, from the planning department, said officials agreed in principle with redevelopment but were concerned about its size.
The minister will consider the plans at a public meeting on Friday.
