The Irish province's director of rugby Les Kiss said on Tuesday that the trio would all play a part in Friday's game.
Payne, 31, made his return after three months out because of a kidney injury when he came on in Ulster's Pro12 win over Zebre on Sunday.
Coetzee missed that game because of illness while Trimble was a replacement in Ireland's weekend win over France.
Trimble's fellow Ireland wing Craig Gilroy is also likely to return to Kiss' squad after missing Sunday's game.
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has indicated that fit-again Payne could now come into consideration for a recall to the national squad for the remaining Six Nations games against Wales and England.

Ulster boss Kiss was delighted to see New Zealand-born Payne emerge unscathed from his return to action.
"It was great to see Jared come out and have the 20 minutes. Baby steps but they are pretty good baby steps and we'll give him more time this week," Kiss told BBC Sport Northern Ireland.
"Jared's focus is to do the best he can for the Ulster jersey and get himself right and if something happens from there [with Ireland] then great."
With Ireland's full-back Rob Kearney a fitness concern for the Six Nations game in Cardiff on 10 March, there has been speculation that Payne be given game time at full-back against Treviso and when asked about this possibility, Kiss replied: "It's a good question".
The Ulster boss added that he intends make a number of changes this weekend because of the short five-day turnaround from the Parma game.
"We've also got Andrew Trimble back from the weekend [with Ireland] to get him a bit of rugby so I'm going to rotate a few players."
Springboks back row Coetzee has made an impressive start to his Ulster career after starring in his debut against Edinburgh on 10 February and then producing another forceful display in the impressive victory over Glasgow.
Centre Darren Cave remains out of contention for the Treviso game after being concussed against Glasgow while Louis Ludik is waiting to see whether he gets clearance to feature this weekend.
Ludik also missed the Treviso game after taking a bang to the head against Glasgow.
Ireland centre Stuart McCloskey remains unavailable for the visits of the Italians as he recovers from a calf injury which is expected to keep him out for around another fortnight, while Rodney Ah You and Ross Kane also remain on the injured list.
