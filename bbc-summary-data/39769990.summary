A photograph of Princess Charlotte has been released by Kensington Palace to mark her second birthday on Tuesday.

The picture, taken in April by her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, shows the princess at the family's home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk.
The couple released a similar photograph of Charlotte last year to celebrate her turning one.
Kensington Palace said they "hope that everyone enjoys this photograph of Princess Charlotte as much as they do".
In the image, Charlotte is wearing a knitted yellow cardigan with a sheep motif and a navy blue clip in her hair.
The family is expected to throw a birthday party for the Princess.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge keep Charlotte out of the public eye, but she was pictured at the Christmas Day church service in the village of Bucklebury in Berkshire.
Another notable appearance was during the family's tour of Canada, where she was seen several times including at a children's party in Victoria, British Colombia.
The palace said in a statement: "The Duke and Duchess are very pleased to share this photograph as they celebrate Princess Charlotte's second birthday.
"Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank everyone for all of the lovely messages they have received."
Princess Charlotte will be a bridesmaid at her aunt Pippa Middleton's wedding later this month. Her brother, George, will be a page boy at the ceremony.
When Prince William leaves his air ambulance post, the family will spend more time at Kensington Palace as the duke carries more of his royal duties.
