The Shrimps are 19th in League Two having lost four of their last five matches, though they remain 13 points clear of the relegation zone.
That run has coincided with chairman and majority shareholder Peter McGuigan placing the club up for sale.
"The players deserve criticism because they're the ones out there," Bentley, 39, told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"But I've got to take it on the chin as it's me that picked the team, it's my team.
"I'll be asking serious questions of myself as I think this is the lowest I've been.
"We're in a poor run of form - we're nearly safe but you can never take anything from granted in football.
"It was a shocking day for us. Terrible in regards to performance but I'm captain of the ship and I've got to be the one who is going to come out and say it as it is, and I've got to look at myself as well."
