Rogerio Ceni: Sao Paulo keeper into club record books

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rogerio Ceni has become one of the top 10 all-time goalscorers for Brazilian club Sao Paulo - which is not bad for a goalkeeper.

The 42-year-old - a penalty and free-kick expert - scored his 128th goal to beat Santos 3-2 on Wednesday.
"Today, Ceni reached a difficult mark for any attacker," tweeted the club.
Liverpool's Mario Balotelli, Aston Villa's Gabriel Agbonlahor and West Ham's Andy Carroll are just three strikers yet to reach 128 goals.
Ceni got a taste for goalscoring as far back as 1997 but managed a staggering 21 goals in all competitions in 2005 - the same season in which he performed spectacularly as Sao Paulo beat Liverpool in the Club World Cup final.
He plundered 47 goals in three seasons between 2004 and 2007 and, during the spell, broke the record for the most goals ever scored by a goalkeeper.
Ceni, who was in Brazil's World Cup-winning squad of 2002, clearly loves setting records and his trophy cabinet is full - he also holds the greatest number of appearances for a single club, two Copa Libertadores titles and three Brazilian Serie A league wins.
Jose Luis Chilavert
The Paraguay international had his record goal haul for a keeper taken by Ceni but still managed a stunning 67 in his career including the only hat-trick ever scored by a goalkeeper.
Chilavert, who played for seven clubs, was well known in world football as he also managed eight goals for Paraguay including four which helped his country reach the 2002 World Cup.
Rene Higuita
Nothing will surpass the image of his scorpion kick in Colombia's friendly with England at Wembley but Rene Higuita knew where the net was, managing 41 goals from penalties or free-kicks.
He was nicknamed 'El Loco' - translated as 'The Madman' - by media.
Hans-Jorg Butt
A four-time Germany international, Hans-Jorg Butt's 34 goals are impressive but his shake-your-head moment arrived in 2004 when he netted a penalty for Bayer Leverkusen at Schalke only for the home side to score from the kick-off before he returned to his net.
