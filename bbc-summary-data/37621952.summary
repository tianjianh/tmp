A conservationist who was tracking the migration of Bewick's swans from arctic Russia to the UK has been injured near St Petersburg.

Sacha Dench is tracking the birds on their 7,000-mile (11,265 km) journey in a paramotor - a paraglider with a propeller strapped to her back.
She injured her knee while attempting to take-off from a field on Saturday.
Ms Dench hopes her endeavours will help find out why numbers of the birds have almost halved in Europe.
"My screams of pain were obviously heard quite some way away because in true Russian style an elderly couple suddenly appeared from the forest nearby and filled my pockets with cranberries that they'd picked - as they are good for the health and healing - and they wished me success on my travels," she said.
She added she had not broken anything but an MRI scan would reveal if there had been any tissue damage.
The conservationist, who works at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust headquarters in Slimbridge, said she was "looking forward" to catching up with the birds at the wetlands near St Petersburg and "further down the flyway".
"Injury is always a risk for para-motorists, just as it is for the swans, and we just hope that it won't hold me up for too long," she added.
