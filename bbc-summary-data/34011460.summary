The number of young people killed or seriously injured on the roads in Wales has risen by 8% in the past year.

There were 272 causalities aged 16 to 24 in 2014, including 22 deaths, up from 253 the year before.
Road safety charity Brake called for more training for new drivers, saying they were "more likely to take risks".
The Welsh government said it was committed to improving road safety through education, engineering and enforcement.
The report found 16-24 year-olds accounted for 18% of all passenger deaths between 2010 to 2014 and just under half (46%) of casualties aged 16-19 were in vehicles driven by their peers.
In March, four people, including three teenagers died in a crash on the A470 in Brecon, Powys.
Although the figures are down 31% on the 2004-2008 average, the Welsh government wants to see it reduced to 40% lower by 2020. It is investing Â£6m in projects to improve safety in 2015-16.
Dave Nichols, of Brake, said the charity wanted to see a Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL), which would see people learn over a minimum period, as well as post-test restrictions put in place.
"This allows new drivers to build up experience gradually, while less exposed to higher risk situations, such as night-time driving," he said.
"GDL is already in place in many countries, where it is proven to reduce young driver casualties."
Chris Hume, of road casualty reduction partnership GoSafe, said "black box" systems, which monitor speed, acceleration and braking, could reduce the number of casualties by making drivers more aware of their actions, whilst also lowering car insurance.
