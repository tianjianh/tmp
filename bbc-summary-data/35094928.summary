Grand National hoodoo: Pineau De Re ends post-Aintree losing streak

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pineau De Re has ended a 12-year run of post-Aintree disappointment by becoming the first Grand National-winning horse since the victorious Bindaree in 2002 to go on and win another race.

The Worcestershire-trained 12-year-old had failed to win in eight runs since triumphing at Aintree in April 2014.
But leading jockey Richard Johnson steered the veteran to a four-length victory over hurdles at Carlisle.
He is now aimed by trainer Dr Richard Newland to return to Aintree in April.
The 2003 Welsh National at Chepstow, won by Bindaree, was the last race to be won by a Grand National-winning horse, over a year and half after winning at Aintree, since when the accumulated sequence of subsequent losing rides for the next 13 National winners has stretched to 102.
Pineau De Re has been back to Aintree twice since winning in 2014, finishing 12th in this year's National, before falling at the second earlier this month in the Betfred Becher Handicap Chase, over the National Fences, just eight days before Sunday's quick return to action at Carlisle.
Owner John Provan said: "I think he could be back in the National and hopefully run a big race there.
"He's on a mark over fences of 141, which would be a nice mark for the National, so we'll try to look after that mark if we can. We'll possibly run him over hurdles until then. He might have a short break now and then bring him back to go to Cheltenham and then the National."
Jockey Richard Johnson had twice ridden Pineau De Re before, most recently in 2013 in the same race at Carlisle, the 3m 1f Pertemps Network Handicap Hurdle, when they finished second, four months before Aintree.
