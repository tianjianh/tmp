A new night flight helicopter has been launched by the Thames Valley Air Ambulance (TVAA) in order to respond to more incidents.

Currently TVAA operates from 07:00 until 19:00, but the new Airbus H135 with specialist night-vision kit can continue until 02:00.
TVAA chairman Sir Tim Jenner said the new helicopter could "save more lives" because of the extra operating hours.
The new extended hours will start in the new year once training is complete.
The charity, which covers Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, said the service would be operated by a day and night crew using the same helicopter.
It recently recruited and trained two new paramedics and three new emergency medical doctors.
Sir Tim said: "The new helicopter with its night flying capabilities will allow us to extend our hours of coverage and enable our medical crews to respond to more emergency call outs, saving more lives."
South Central Ambulance Service provides the paramedic crew members while the charity funds the helicopter, its associated costs and the majority of the medical service.
It said the 02:00 end time was due to shift patterns, the lack of calls relating to major trauma beyond that time, and the need for the helicopter to be four hours on the ground for maintenance work.
Its previous helicopter has been returned to TVAA's aviation partner, Bond Air Services Ltd.
In its 15th year, the service has carried out 863 missions in 2014, which includes attending 310 road traffic collisions and responding to 265 medical emergencies.
