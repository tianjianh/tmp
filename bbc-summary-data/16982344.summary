Fire crews were called out at about 06:00 GMT to the property, on Bradda Road in Port Erin.
It is thought the blaze, which started in the lounge, was caused by a faulty oil boiler.
A spokesman from the fire and rescue service said a man was treated by paramedics at the scene and a woman was taken to hospital.
