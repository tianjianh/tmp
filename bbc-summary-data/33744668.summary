[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chelsea 2-2 Swansea City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea had Thibaut Courtois sent off as they started their Premier League title defence with a draw against Swansea City at Stamford Bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oscar's free-kick put the Blues ahead before Andre Ayew stabbed a close-range equaliser after keeper Courtois had kept out Bafetimbi Gomis's header.
Federico Fernandez put Willian's cross past his own keeper before Courtois was sent off after bringing down Gomis.
New signing Asmir Begovic came on but failed to stop Gomis's spot-kick.
Swansea played with an extra man for more than half an hour but could not make the most of the advantage.
The dangerous Gomis had the ball in the net but was ruled offside while Jefferson Montero, who was excellent throughout, forced a fine save from Begovic.
Much has been made of Chelsea's failure to attract a box-office name from outside the Premier League this summer.
Even Jose Mourinho, who signed a new four-year contract on Friday, has warned of the danger of standing still yet neither of his two main close-season buys started the game.
Diego Costa did, despite his manager claiming in the build-up that the forward was a major doubt, but the Spain international rarely looked like scoring, let alone repeating his hat-trick in the corresponding fixture last season.
The champions contributed to a high-tempo, entertaining game but did not look like a side that won the league by eight points last season.
Even before Courtois's dismissal, Swansea had more shots than the hosts and were lively throughout, full of enterprise and in Montero had  the best players on the pitch.
It does not get any easier for Chelsea, with last season's nearest challengers Manchester City next up.
It is no secret that the champions have been trying to strengthen their defence, with Everton's John Stones a target.
There are still another three weeks before the 1 September deadline but, if Chelsea's current defence was trying to persuade Mourinho not to strengthen the back four, they failed.
Ayew, Swansea's new signing from Marseille, took his goal well but the Chelsea players were slow to react after Courtois kept out Gomis's powerful header.
Swansea finished eighth in the table last season, a campaign which started with a fine 2-1 win at Manchester United.

They managed to do the double over Louis van Gaal's side - as well as Arsenal - and they look as though they will again cause problems for clubs with serious title ambitions.
Garry Monk has brought in four players over the summer, with Andre Ayew looking a shrewd signing after scoring on his first Premier League start for the club.
Yet it was the familiar face of Montero who really impressed at Stamford Bridge, the Ecuadorian winger a constant menace throughout as he teased and tormented Chelsea's defence.
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho: "They didn't have chances against 11. The team was playing very, very well in the first half. In the second, in one minute, it was a penalty, red card and the goal - 2-2.

"If you have 10 men and are winning you can defend well and try to find a strategy but to play with 10 men and try to win the game is more difficult. I would say we were the best team with 11 players and with 10 we fought hard, some fighting at the limit of their condition."
Swansea manager Garry Monk: "I thought our performance warranted at least that point. We went for it and showed our attacking prowess."
On the red card: "It is a goalscoring opportunity. The letter of the law is that it is a red card and we got what we deserved today."
Jefferson Montero was at the Copa America tournament in Chile for Ecuador during the summer and has not had a full summer's rest since 2011. You would not have known it at Stamford Bridge. The 25-year-old was at his threatening best and used his pace to cause problems. He was also not shy to test Courtois or Begovic.
