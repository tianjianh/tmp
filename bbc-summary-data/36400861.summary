Sadiq Khan said Lord Toby Harris of Haringey would review the "capability, capacity and collaboration arrangements of every London agency".
Lord Harris, a former Met Police Authority chair and member of the joint committee on the National Security Strategy, said the review was "timely".
He will report his findings in summer.
Lord Harris said there was a "developing threat picture" and he would look at whether current arrangements could be "even more robust".
Mr Khan said Lord Harris would report on "what more could be done to ensure Londoners are kept safe".
The strategic review was one of his main manifesto promises.
