Investigations are continuing into the incident on Ferry Road in the Drylaw area at 18:35 on Saturday.
Police said it appeared two motorbikes went through a red light at a pedestrian crossing and the boy was "mown down" by one of them.
He is in a stable condition in hospital and due to have surgery.
Detectives said there had been a number of reports of motorbikes being driven dangerously and recklessly in the area on Saturday evening.
The drivers of the two bikes involved had their faces covered with scarves.
Police are reviewing CCTV and carrying out door-to-door inquiries.
Det Ch Insp Paul Grainger, who is leading the investigation, said: "The boy remains in hospital and his condition is now described as stable.
"He is currently undergoing surgery as a result of the injuries he sustained in this collision and it is too early to assess what impact these injuries may have on his life moving forward.
"At this stage we are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the Ferry Road area last night around the time of the collision, or indeed before or after it."
The first motorbike involved was red and driven by someone wearing a red and black ski-type jacket and a full-face crash helmet which was white with a purple and orange design.
The second motorcycle, which was the one that struck the boy, was a white Triumph Daytona 650cc. The rider was wearing a grey hooded top, dark tracksuit bottoms and a white full-face helmet with a coloured design.
Det Ch Insp Grainger added: "This was a terrifying incident which could easily have had fatal consequences and both the boy's mother and I would urge anybody that has any information to contact the police or Crimestoppers.
"We need the help of the community to catch those responsible for this.
"This young boy was going about his own business, making a routine crossing of a busy road at what should have been a safe pedestrian crossing when he was mown down by this motorcycle.
"Nobody should be attempting to assist, hide or cover up for the people responsible who have shown a reckless disregard for other people's safety with terrible consequence."
Earlier, local community group Trim and Friends of West Pilton posted an update on Facebook from the boy's mother which said he was undergoing surgery and described him as "brave" and a "wee trooper".
Robert Pearson, chairman of the community group, told BBC Scotland there have been ongoing issues with people riding motorbikes dangerously in the area.
He added: "We as a community have said for years it is not a case of if somebody gets hit by one of these bikes, it's a case of when.
"Last night a young child going about his normal business innocently was struck by a bike and left for dead."
Supt Mark Rennie said: "This has been a shocking incident which has deeply affected the local community.
"For over a year now Police Scotland has engaged with a significant range of partners and the City of Edinburgh Council to target offenders and also deal with the root cause of this type of reckless offending and risk taking behaviour.
"Despite that a small minority of offenders continue to steal motorcycles and put themselves and others at risk.
"I would reassure local residents that patrols are ongoing across the area in this regard, and anyone who has any concerns, or indeed information which they would wish to pass on should talk to our officers."
