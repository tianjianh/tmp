The champions dominated the majority of the match as they continued their unbeaten run in domestic competition this season.
Derek McInnes's Aberdeen, who beat Hibs in Saturday's semi-final, are now the only side in the country who can stop Celtic from sealing a treble in boss Brendan Rodgers' debut season.
For Rangers, it was a first defeat for manager Pedro Caixinha.
Here, former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner and ex-Rangers striker Kris Boyd offer their views on how the players on each team performed.
Two or three critical saves in the second half as Rangers began to threaten.
Didn't do anything wrong. Steady. Good long pass for the opening goal to find Moussa Dembele.
Good partnership with Dedryck Boyata. Never really troubled by the Rangers attack until late in the game.
Defended well and won the tackle that led to Celtic being able to break for the second goal.
Wasn't his most influential game in a Celtic jersey but as dependable as ever.
Led by example and could have had a nine. Strolled through the game. He's so influential and so important.
Not at his most influential on the ball but off the ball he caused Rangers problems.
He scored a fantastic goal and had a couple of other shots on target.
Didn't do all that much in the game although he was on the end of a hefty challenge early on. Did enough to cause Myles Beerman problems.
Scored penalty and took up some good positions. Often involved in Celtic's most threatening moves.
Good control for the opening goal and good movement too. Unfortunate to get injured.
Did well to win the penalty, which gave Celtic that comfortable two-goal cushion.
Hit post with a good late effort but clearly still finding fitness after a long period out.
Too late to have a serious impact on the match.
Unlucky with the penalty and made a couple of decent saves to give his side a glimmer of hope.
One of his better games against Celtic. Put some decent crosses in, which might have led to goals but rash in diving in for the penalty.
Did OK to cope with the strength of Dembele and the movement of Griffiths.
Caught out of position for the first goal and made a couple of passes that went astray.
Tough Old Firm debut for the young man and perhaps a little lucky to avoid a second yellow.
McGregor ran off him for the opening goal and another player who can consider himself lucky to stay on the pitch.
Covered a lot of ground but with no influence on the game.
Never involved in the play. Unable to create any danger and no surprise he was eventually replaced.
Late headed chance, which should at least have hit the target, but he had no overall impact on the game.
Not the game for him with Rangers having so little attacking play. The question could be 'why did he start the game?'
Should have scored with a headed chance, but the only one who didn't look out of his depth against Celtic.
One good shot that forced Craig Gordon into a decent save. Raw but showed willingness.
Added a bit of pace when he came on at half-time but was unable to create much.
At least tried to get on the ball but to no avail.
