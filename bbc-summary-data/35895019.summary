Captain Ken Owens wants to avenge some "hidings" when Scarlets play Ospreys in the Pro12 on Saturday.

The 29-year-old is among 11 players set to return from Six Nations duty in the west Wales derby.
"I just want to win one. I've only beaten the Ospreys twice in my 11 years at this place," said Owens.
"I've copped plenty of hidings off them during the last couple of years so it would be nice to get one over on them and get a win, especially as captain."
Scarlets, who won the Pro 12 in 2004, are third in the table while four-time winners Ospreys are eighth.
The hooker added: "They've always been the flag-bearers since I've been here for Welsh rugby.

"They're great games to play in, very competitive."
Scarlets lost to their Swansea-based rivals on Boxing Day in Llanelli and Owens says he and his team-mates must avoid the discipline issues that beset them that day.
"We had two yellow cards and gave away way too many penalties, which cost us," he said.
"That's where it's going to be won and lost.
"They're scrapping and fighting for their lives to push for a European spot and the boys coming back for them will make an impact."
Ospreys fly-half Dan Biggar returns from the Six Nations fray on the bench in the knowledge his side's European Champions Cup ambitions need a boost.
The highest-placed team from each of the four nations in the Pro12 will play in Europe's top-tier tournament, with three more places up for grabs.
Treviso or Zebre from Italy take up one of the best-placed slots, leaving the four Irish, four Welsh and two Scottish teams competing for the other six slots.
Ospreys and Cardiff Blues are tied on 39 points in eighth and ninth places respectively, eight points behind Glasgow in sixth.
"We're looking at picking up a couple of wins to push us up the table for European qualification and we're up against it, there's no doubt about that," said Biggar.
"It's going to be a tough ask, but fingers crossed we can be positive and pick up a few results and see where that takes us.
"If we win on Saturday, it puts us in a decent place to maybe go on a bit of a run."
