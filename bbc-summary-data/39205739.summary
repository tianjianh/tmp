Fraserburgh nursery Peek-a-Boo criticised in inspection report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Fraserburgh nursery has been issued with 13 requirements for improvement in a critical report by inspectors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Care Inspectorate said Peek-a-Boo Nursery was potentially putting children at risk.
The report said staff had insufficient knowledge of how to meet complex care needs, and a poor understanding of how to safeguard children.
A spokeswoman for Peek-a-Boo Nursery said it was urgently addressing all the concerns.
The inspectorate noted that staff seemed genuinely fond of the children in their care.
Seven of the 13 requirements related to the quality of management and leadership.
The unannounced inspection was carried out last month.
Peek-a-Boo Nursery said that the children in their care were their "sole priority".
A spokeswoman added: "We are grateful for the continued loyalty of staff, parents and the wider community, including other local nurseries, many of whom have offered support and good wishes during what has been a challenging time.
"We will honour that goodwill by providing the best care, development and standards of safety for the children who attend the nursery."
