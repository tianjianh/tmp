Election 2016: Polling stations open in Warrington

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Polling stations have opened in Warrington to mark the start of the borough council's new electoral system.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
For the first time, all of the local authority's seats will be contested. Previously only a third of seats would be up for grabs at each election.
Polling stations opened their doors at 07:00 BST and will close at 22:00.
Elections are taking place for more than 120 councils across England, while mayoral elections are being held in cities including Liverpool and Salford.
