Hydroelectric power flows from River Don scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Â£2.1m hydroelectric power plant has started generating electricity using the waters of the River Don.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The river is powering two turbines at Thrybergh Weir, near Kilnhurst, Rotherham, to generate electricity.
It should work constantly for up to 11 months of the year and last 100 years, said the developers Barn Energy and Yorkshire Hydropower.
The plant also includes a passage to help eel, salmon and trout swim upstream towards Sheffield.
It is hoped that salmon could return to Sheffield to spawn.
They have not been seen for more than 100 years given the past pollution and the weirs on the river.
Stuart Mills, of the Canal & River Trust, said: "The Thrybergh scheme shows how renewable power generation can be harnessed with virtually no environmental impact on rivers."
