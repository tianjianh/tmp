Capt Brown was the Navy's most decorated pilot and had flown 487 types of aircraft during his career.
The veteran, who was born in Leith, Edinburgh, and later moved to Sussex, was the first Naval pilot to land a jet on an aircraft carrier.
He also held the record for the most carrier deck landings at 2,407.
British astronaut Tim Peake tweeted a tribute from the International Space Station:  "So sad to hear that Capt Eric 'Winkle' Brown has died - to my mind the greatest test pilot who has ever lived. A true inspiration."
The pilot, who had been appointed MBE, OBE and CBE, died at East Surrey Hospital on Sunday after a short illness.
First Sea Lord Admiral Sir George Zambellas described Capt Brown as one of the Royal Navy's finest.
He said: "The Fleet Air Arm may have lost one of its finest and best known pilots, but British aviation has lost something even greater - the most accomplished test pilot of his generation and perhaps of all time, and a huge advocate of military aviation."
