Alex Zosel told the BBC that his device was safer than a traditional helicopter because its systems had more redundancy built-in.
The Volocopter can continue to fly if some of its batteries or rotors fail, and can land itself when battery power is low.
However, the multicopter can currently fly for only 25 minutes and is expected to cost Â£200,000 when it goes on sale.
