The driver of a BMW, a man in his 40s, left the scene on foot after the crash in Yaxley, near Peterborough, just after 11:10 GMT.
A helicopter and dog unit were brought into to help in the search for the man but he remains at large.
The air ambulance was called for the two pedestrians but they died at the scene, Cambridgeshire Police said.
The two victims are believed to be in their late teens or early 20s.
Police are still trying to trace their next of kin.
Officers are looking into whether the crash is connected to a report from a member of the public that a man had entered their home.
A briefcase containing "a quantity of cash" was also found in the Yaxley area, the force said.
Earlier, police said the circumstances surrounding the deaths were unclear.
The force said the crash was "initially recorded as an RTC (road traffic collision)", but added: "However, we are not sure of what has happened at this time."
The B1091 Broadway remains closed in both directions.
