The victim, aged 50, was stabbed 10 times in Barking and spent weeks in hospital recovering from his injuries.
The suspect is described as aged between 20 and 30, wearing a dark hooded top with the hood up, light-coloured trousers and light trainers.
No-one has been arrested in connection with the attack, said police.
The Metropolitan police said they hoped issuing the footage of the incident may encourage anyone with information to come forward.
The victim was attacked from behind while walking home from a social club on 28 October on Pelham Avenue at around 21:45 GMT.
The suspect then ran off along Sterry Road towards Denham Way.
The victim staggered a short distance before collapsing where he was discovered by his wife.
Police were called and the first officers on the scene administered first aid before the London Ambulance Service arrived.
The victim was taken to the Royal London Hospital in a critical condition where he spent two days in a coma.
Det Con Roxanne Dawe, from Barking and Dagenham CID, said: "This was an incredibly violent attack on a married father-of-two who was just walking home after a night out as he did every Friday.
"He had not had an argument or a dispute with anyone that night and we can find no motive at all for what happened. Nothing was stolen from him.
"We hope the release of CCTV footage showing what happened will prompt someone to come forward with information."
She added the victim "very nearly lost his life" and that the attack was being treated as attempted murder.
