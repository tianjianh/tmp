The woman, aged in her 50s who was injured in the crash, was the same woman whose safety police were alerted to, Norfolk Police said.
No-one else was hurt in the crash.
An East Anglian Air Ambulance (EAAA) spokesman said: "The EAAA crew, which last night included William, attended an incident south of Norwich which involved a road traffic collision-related injury.
"A patient was treated at scene for severe head injuries then treated at Addenbrooke's Hospital."
The Duke of Cambridge is stepping down from his role as a pilot with the EAAA to take on more royal duties on behalf of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh.
The case has been referred to the  Independent Police Complaints Commission.
