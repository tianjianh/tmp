As traders digested the Federal Reserve's statement from Wednesday, they were encouraged by its insistence that rates will only be increased gradually.
"The Fed's likely to raise rates later this year, but maybe not as aggressively as some market participants worried," said Michael Baele, managing director and senior portfolio manager at US Bank Private Client Reserve.
The Nasdaq closing high was more than 25 points above its last record on 27 May.
