Doncaster Mayor Ros Jones said the council would review enforcement all along the A630.
However, the 60mph stretch near Conisbrough is likely to be the first section to be targeted, following the fatal crash there on 15 November.
Blake Cairns, Megan Storey and Jordanna Goodwin, all 16, and Bartosz Bortniczak and Arpar Kore, both 18, were killed.
Ms Jones said: "We were all shocked by the tragic accident in Conisbrough last month and it is understandable that people have concerns about preventing future collisions on this section of the A630.
"Council officers are in contact with the police, and whilst we need to allow the relevant investigations to take place, I have already asked that we review the road and consider what measures may be needed to make it as safe as it can be, including reducing speed limits if it is required."
There had been 61 accidents on the A630 from the start of the year up until the end of October, before the Conisbrough crash.
Council figures show the crashes resulted in 84 injuries. However, there had only been two accidents on the Conisbrough stretch prior to the fatal crash.
Funerals for the teenagers were held last month.
A 21-year-old man from Doncaster has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and released on bail.
