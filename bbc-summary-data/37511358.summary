Fighting among home fans during Legia's 6-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund has also resulted in a Â£69,000 fine from Uefa, European football's governing body.
A group of hooligans also tried to break into the Dortmund sector, before spraying gas at security guards.
The match against Real is on 2 November at the Polish Army Stadium.
A charge of racist behaviour was dropped after a meeting of Uefa's control, ethics and disciplinary committee.
Legia are the first Polish side to reach the Champions League group stages in 20 years, but are unlikely to progress any further after a 2-0 defeat by Sporting Lisbon left them bottom of Group F after two games.
