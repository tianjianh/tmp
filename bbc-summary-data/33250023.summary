The pair were said to have fallen on to tracks at Ealing Broadway at 18:10 BST on Tuesday.
Police said they were treating the deaths as "unexplained" and had not yet identied the victims.
Heathrow Express services were suspended, while First Great Western said there were delays of up to 90 minutes to and from Paddington.
British Transport Police said: "We were called at 6.10pm to Ealing Broadway station following reports that someone had been hit by a train.
"We attended along with the Metropolitan Police, London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade and discovered two people had been struck and killed by the train.
"We're still working to determine the identities of the deceased or how they came to actually be on the tracks."
The force said the train was London-bound.
Last night, commuters took to Twitter to express their concern.

Thomas Clements wrote: "Forensics still on the track at Ealing Broadway. Just witnessed an utterly horrific scene. Feel for the people who have to deal with it now."
Tom Kimber tweeted: "So the train I'm on has hit two people at Ealing Broadway. A sad business."
A spokesman for First Great Western said: "We are doing all we can to help the police with their investigation into this terrible incident."
