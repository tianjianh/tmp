Nile Wilson and Brinn Bevan, who broke his leg in two places in November, complete the men's gymnastics line up.
Dan Purvis and Sam Oldham, team bronze medallists four years ago, miss out.
The women's team includes the Downie sisters Becky and Ellie, Commonwealth champion Claudia Fragapane, as well as Amy Tinkler and Ruby Harrold.
The men's quintet were all part of the silver medal-winning team at last year's World Championships in Glasgow.
Purvis, 25, was the sixth man in that effort but only five gymnasts can be selected per team at the Olympics.
Whitlock, 23, will be hoping to add an Olympic gold to the world gold he won on pommel horse last year, while Smith, 27, is also a strong contender having won medals at the last two Olympic Games on pommel.
Becky Downie, 24, who won European uneven bars gold in June, is the only women's member with previous Olympic experience, having competed in Beijing in 2008.
Ellie Downie, 16, Fragapane, 18, and Harrold, 20, are first-time Olympians, as is 16-year-old Tinkler, who will be the youngest member of Team GB at the Rio Olympics - one month younger than Lois Toulson of the diving team.
Louis Smith, who will be competing in his third Olympic Games, has said people viewed him as "kind of a joke" after his time away from the sport.
Smith won the 2012 series of BBC show Strictly Come Dancing after briefly retiring following the 2012 Olympics.
He returned to the sport in January 2014.
He said: "I needed a break after 2012 because I needed to get my brain back in order and when I decided to make my comeback I was very serious about it.
"But people almost saw me as a kind of joke, because of this other celebrity lifestyle and doing all these showbiz interviews.
"I have never regretted anything that I've done, but sport and showbiz are two different worlds. I'm either a sportsman or I'm not - and for my gymnastics to be taken seriously again I needed to show I was more of the sportsman again.
"In 10 years' time, when people ask me to introduce myself, I will always say I was a British Olympic gymnast - not a celebrity."
Sam Oldham, 23, said he "did everything he could" to try and earn selection for the team.
He suffered ankle ligament damage at the Commonwealth Games in July 2014 and did not return to competitive action until April 2015.
He posted on his Instagram account: "I'm incredibly proud of myself and all my loved ones and support team for what we have achieved in the past two years.
"I'm absolutely gutted that I have not been selected for the Rio Olympic Team. I have no regrets I did everything I could and I will be forever grateful I was able to get back and compete at such a high level again after the injury I suffered.
"I feel blessed to have fell in love with gymnastics once more. I want to wish the Men's & Women's Teams the best of luck in Rio. Do us proud guys."
