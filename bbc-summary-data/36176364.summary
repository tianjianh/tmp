Olusanya scored his first ever goal from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Ben Davies.
Wimbledon will face Accrington Stanley in the play-off semi-finals, while Newport end the season without a win in 11 games.
Warren Feeney's side, who had already secured League Two safety, finished nine points above the relegation zone.
Adebayo Akinfenwa had Wimbledon's best chance of a first half which was delayed for 10 minutes after team-mate Connor Smith suffered a head injury.
Newport's Lenell John-Lewis was denied by James Shea while Akinfenwa struck the post before substitute Olusanya's winner.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It looked like and end of season game.
"It's another sloppy goal we've given away but I think it's that little bit of belief in the final third that we're lacking and have been lacking for a while.
"I don't want to be in this position next year."
