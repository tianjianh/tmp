The Bay in Stonehaven topped the 25th National Fish and Chip Awards 2013 in London on Thursday night.
Owner Calum Richardson described it as a "massive honour" and a "dream come true".
The business stayed open late last year despite being hit by the flood water that caused major damage in Stonehaven.
Ten regional champions were finalists.
Mr Richardson said: "Over the last few years, we have put so much effort into our business and take pride in what we produce and the service we give our customers.
"This is without doubt one of our biggest achievements to date and is a great opportunity for the business to grow.
"It is not without the hard work from all the staff, not to mention the support and loyalty shown by our customers and suppliers, which has helped us win this award.
"To say we are delighted is an understatement and we can't wait to take both awards back to take pride of place in our shop."
The awards, organised by seafood authority Seafish, were hosted by comedian Rory Bremner.
Seafish chief executive Paul Williams said: "The competition gets fiercer each year and this year was definitely no exception, with the battle for top shop getting more difficult for the judges to determine.
"The exceptionally high standards of entrants across all the award categories demonstrates their continual commitment to the industry and the effort towards sustainability and protecting the industry so future generations can enjoy Britain's favourite dish."
