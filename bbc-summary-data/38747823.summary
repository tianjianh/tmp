Visiting suspended at Cumberland Infirmary after norovirus outbreak

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health chiefs have suspended visiting at a Cumbrian hospital following a norovirus outbreak.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patients at Carlisle's Cumberland Infirmary have been affected by vomiting and diarrhoea in recent weeks.
Earlier this month North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust appealed for people with symptoms not to visit.
Now it has temporarily suspended visiting with the exception of people with family in a small number of departments.
Visiting is allowed for people with relatives in the maternity, paediatrics and intensive care units as well as for end-of-life patients.
Anna Stabler, the trust's deputy director of nursing and midwifery, said: "We appreciate this is difficult for patients and their loved ones, but the more people who pass through our hospitals the greater risk of the virus spreading and affecting more vulnerable patients and hospital staff."
Also known as the winter vomiting bug, norovirus is estimated to affect between 600,000 and one million people in the United Kingdom annually.
