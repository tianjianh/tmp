Scarlets will face Munster in the Pro12 final at Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Saturday bidding to win their first title since 2004.
Williams, who made his Scarlets debut in 2010, says the region have the strength in depth to be successful.
"We've always had a strong 15," Williams said.
"We've got boys competing and some boys are unlucky not to be involved or unlucky to be on the bench.

"But that's a good thing. You can't win trophies with 15 men and that's why we believe we can go all the way.
"We've got some really dangerous players who can create something out of nothing."
Scarlets secured their place in the final with a 25-17 semi-final win over Irish side Leinster, despite being reduced to 14 men after winger Steffan Evans was sent-off for a tip tackle.
Williams said they will take confidence from games where they had been under pressure and reserved particular praise for the forwards.
"We've come up against some of the biggest teams in Europe and come out on top," Williams added.
"We've got to give credit to our forwards.
"You can have any backline in the world but if you haven't got the forwards putting you on the front foot then there's no point."
Scarlets, Celtic League champions in 2004, lost to Ulster in the Pro12 play-off semi-finals in 2013.
Williams played in the defeat by Ulster and says Saturday's final against Munster is a big opportunity.
"We know there's a big challenge in front of us and we're looking forward to it," Williams said.
"When you get older you realise that there's less opportunities to win silverware.
"When the opportunities come round you've got to take them with both hands."
