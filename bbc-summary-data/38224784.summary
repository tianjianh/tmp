[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Controversial plans for an Anglesey zorbing centre have been refused.

The activity lets people roll down a hill in a large plastic ball.
Proposals for the centre, situated on Holyhead Road next to the Menai Strait, attracted 365 letters of objection, compared to 85 in support.
Anglesey council's planning committee met on Wednesday and was advised to refuse permission as it would have "a detrimental impact on the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty".
Members also agreed the impact on nearby listed buildings outweighed the economic and tourism benefits.
Plans included a zorbing run which would have been 640ft (195m) long and 39ft (12m) wide, the construction of a lodge and the demolition and rebuilding of a 590ft (180m) long stone wall.
Among the reasons given for refusal included the demolition of the stone wall, which would "result in the loss of a feature which contributes significantly to the appearance and character of this important sensitive location".
Zorb Snowdonia said it chose the site because "people want to visit beautiful areas".
Before the meeting, Anna Matthews from the company said plans fitted well for developments in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
