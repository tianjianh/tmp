[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MK Dons have signed midfielder Chuks Aneke on a one-year contract with a further 12-month option.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old former Arsenal youngster left Belgian top-flight side Zulte Waregem this summer after scoring four goals in 41 appearances.
He is recovering from "routine" knee surgery and is not yet fit to play.
Before his move to Waregem in July 2014, Aneke spent a season on loan from the Gunners at Crewe in League One, scoring 14 in 40 league games.
Manager Karl Robinson told the club website: "While he isn't ready for match action just yet, we didn't want to miss out on bringing him to the football club.
"Also, with the abolition of emergency and youth loans outside of the transfer window, we are limited to what we can do during the season."
