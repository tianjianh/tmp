The 33-year-old was only able to make four appearances for the Exiles last season after undergoing surgery.
The former Wasps, Leicester and England Saxons player worked as an assistant coach of Samoa during the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
Skivington won four Premiership titles and two Heineken Cups with Wasps.
"Wasps, Leicester and London Irish have all been great environments in which to play my rugby and each club has been a unique experience," Skivington told the club website.
"I have been proud to captain London Irish during the last three seasons and I know the club is in good shape to return to the Premiership at the first time of asking."
He added: "I would also like to thank Ealing Trailfinders and the Samoan national team for allowing me to gain valuable coaching experience during the last two years, which I hope to utilise going forward."
