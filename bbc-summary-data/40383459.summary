Armed Forces Day, now in its ninth year, aims to give people the chance to thank people serving for their work.
First Minister Carwyn Jones and Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns attended the Caerphilly event which included a Spitfire flypast.
Events also took place in Swansea, and a service and parade in Wrexham.
Chief of defence staff Sir Stuart Peach said: "The day is a chance for people to say thank you to the extraordinary men and women, stationed across the globe, who dedicate their lives to defending their country and keeping British people safe."
At present, armed forces are involved in more than 20 operations in more than 25 countries across the world.
Armed Forces Day also recognises the work done by reservists and cadets.
In Wrexham, a parade led by the Royal Welsh Band left Hightown Barracks for the town centre and a service was held at the parish church.
The Armed Forces Day flag were flown on Ceredigion County Council buildings on Saturday.
And an all-day event was held at Swansea's Castle Square.
A parachute display in Caerphilly had to be cancelled due to cloudy weather.
North Wales Armed Forces Day event was held in Caernarfon last weekend.
The 10th Armed Forces Day national event in 2018 will take place in Llandudno, Conwy county, Defence Minister Earl Howe has announced.
He said: "Llandudno represents a superb venue for next year's celebrations and I'm sure the town will bring together the whole nation in celebrating our Armed Forces.
"Wales was the proud host of the national event in 2010 when thousands of people celebrated in Cardiff.
"The support from the Welsh Government and local communities, coupled with the rich and vibrant history of Llandudno, means that the town is the ideal choice to make the event even more successful in 2018."
