British 110m hurdler William Sharman is hoping to run the Olympic qualifying standard at the European Championships, starting 6 July, despite injury.

The 31-year-old 2014 European silver medallist has yet to achieve the 'A' standard time of 13.47 seconds in 2016.
The cut-off point to run that standard is 23:00 BST on 11 July.
"If I run well at the European Championships I'll go to Rio," he said. "The difficulty is, will I recover from hurting myself in time?"
He added: "I'm certainly going to give it a go. I'm in good mental spirits and if the body is 100% on the day, which I'm working towards, then I'll be there."
Sharman injured himself while winning the semi-final of last weekend's British Championships in Birmingham, meaning he was unable to compete in the final.
Andy Pozzi and Lawrence Clarke have sealed automatic Olympic selection following that meeting.
And Commonwealth silver medallist Sharman is hopeful his current injury concern is not serious enough to trouble him in Amsterdam next week.
"It's not a major injury, it's like a little strain. In the grand scheme of things this is nothing really to worry about," he told BBC Radio Northampton.
"But in reality the timing is very annoying because when you get out there and put your fingers behind the start line you have to be 100% at whatever sport you do if you compete at the highest level."
