The 22-year-old Scotland Under-21 international was a free agent after leaving Scottish Championship side St Mirren earlier this summer.
Kelly, who can play at centre-back or left-back, becomes Wimbledon's sixth signing of the summer transfer window.
"We wanted someone young who we could develop," Dons boss Neal Ardley told the club website.
The south-west London club have not disclosed the length of Kelly's contract at Kingsmeadow.
