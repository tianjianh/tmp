Pupils from St Paul's High School in Bessbrook are currently visiting Rome, to mark the school's 50th anniversary.
On Thursday, they sang at a Mass in St Peter's Basilica, Rome, which Catholics believe is the burial place of Saint Peter.
Headmaster Jarlath Burns who is on the trip said it was an "amazing opportunity" for the children.
