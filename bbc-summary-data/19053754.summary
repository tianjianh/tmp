English Heritage has awarded £186,000 to the medieval ruins of Greyfriars monastery in Dunwich and £102,000 to the remains of Clare Castle.
Suffolk County Council is giving £112,000 to the projects.
The council manages Clare Castle Country Park and Dunwich Greyfriars but wants to transfer both sites to community groups.
Geoff Abell, of Dunwich Greyfriars Trust, said the ruins of the monastery were "a key part of Dunwich's fascinating heritage".
Dunwich has been called 'Britain's Atlantis' as much of it fell victim to coastal erosion.
Mr Abell said: "The village is very pleased that English Heritage and Suffolk County Council are funding substantial restoration works that will secure the future of this beautiful place."
English Heritage said it hoped the work would enable the sites to be removed from its Heritage Risk register.
John Ette, English Heritage team leader for Suffolk, said: "Clare Castle and Dunwich are nationally important monuments which make a significant contribution to our national story."
The restoration projects are expected to be completed by the winter.
