[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old's arrest, by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service's Counter Terrorism Command, was followed by searches in Larne and Devon.
The pre-planned operation involved several UK police forces, including the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
It is understood MI5 is also involved in the operation in England.
Following the arrest on Wednesday afternoon, police in Devon searched a house in Exminster and a wooded area nearby, while the PSNI has carried out searches at a least two houses in on the Old Glenarm Road in Larne.
It is understood the operation is connected to the discovery of two arms dumps near Larne earlier this year, which were suspected to be linked to dissident republican paramilitaries.
In March, the PSNI said they had uncovered a "significant terrorist hide" of bomb-making components and explosives at Carnfunnock Country Park.
In May, a second significant arms cache, including an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines, was found at Capanagh Forest, near Larne.
The man under arrest is suspected of being involved in preparing for acts of terrorism
He is being held at a West Country police station.
Police said the arrest was pre-planned and intelligence-led as part of a collaboration between the Met, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the South West Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit.
The arrest was made at 12:20 BST by Met detectives supported by officers from Avon and Somerset and Devon and Cornwall Police.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: "We are aware of a police investigation involving the arrest of a member of the armed forces under the 2000 Terrorism Act and will assist this investigation fully.
"It would be inappropriate to comment further on an ongoing investigation."
