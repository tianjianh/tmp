Key points: The Glasgow bin lorry crash report at-a-glance

A fatal accident inquiry into the bin lorry crash in which six people died has made a series of recommendations, mainly relating to how a driver's fitness to drive is recorded.

Sheriff John Beckett said the most effective way of preventing a similar tragedy is "to avoid drivers becoming incapacitated at the wheel".
The sheriff said responsibility for this lies with drivers and the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency), the UK-wide body that issues licences to drivers.
He said the current fitness-to-drive regime was a self-reporting system which was "vulnerable to the withholding and concealing of relevant information by applicants".
The sheriff said the current rules were unlikely to prevent a "deliberate deception" such as that by driver Harry Clarke, who had a history of dizziness and blackouts which were not reported to the DVLA.
Here are the main points from the sheriff's findings:
In his conclusions the sheriff said: "It may well be that the single most useful outcome of this inquiry would be to raise awareness of the dangers involved in driving if subject to a medical condition which could cause the driver to lose control of a vehicle."
