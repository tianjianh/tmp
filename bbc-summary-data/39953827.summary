Fraile finished in a time of four hours 23 minutes 14 seconds with Colombian Nairo Quintana, second overall, in the same group as Dumoulin on Wednesday.
Britain's Orica rider Adam Yates was also in the group that finished one minute 37 seconds behind Fraile.
Wales' Geraint Thomas, second in Tuesday's time trial, dropped to 14th overall - six minutes 21 seconds back.
The Team Sky rider was unable to stick with the leaders in the last climb of the hilly 161km stage from Florence to Bagno di Romagna.
Fraile was part of the breakaway and edged a long chase to the finish for Dimension Data's first win in the Giro.
Thursday's stage 12 is a mostly flat, 234km run from Forli to Reggio Emilia.
