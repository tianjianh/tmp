The body of US national Eva Rausing, 48, a member of the family behind the Tetra-Pak cartons empire, was found at Cadogan Place, Belgravia.
The death is being treated as unexplained, Scotland Yard said.
However, police have refused to comment on reports that a 49-year-old man arrested in connection with the death and on suspicion of possession of drugs is her husband Hans Kristian Rausing.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the man was no longer at a police station and was currently receiving medical attention.
In a statement, her family described her as a "devoted wife for 20 years and mother of four much loved and wonderful children".
Her parents Tom - a wealthy Pepsi executive - and Nancy Kemeny said they were "deeply saddened by the death of their beloved daughter".
"During her short lifetime she made a huge philanthropic impact, supporting a large number of charitable causes, not only financially, but using her own personal experiences," they said.
"She bravely fought her health issues for many years. The family is devastated at her death and asks to be given privacy at this difficult time."
Her parents-in-law, Hans and Marit Rausing, said they were "deeply shocked and saddened".
A post-mortem examination at Westminster Mortuary did not establish how Mrs Rausing died and further tests are being carried out.
The Met said officers from its Homicide and Serious Crime Command were investigating her death.
Police said they searched the address and found the body after making the drugs arrest on Monday.
Officers could be seen guarding the front door of the Cadogan Place home, which was taped off.
The large terraced house is in one of London's most expensive areas just off Sloane Street, between Knightsbridge and Chelsea.
In 2008 Mrs Rausing and her husband Hans Kristian Rausing faced drug charges after crack, heroin and 52g of cocaine were found in their home.
Mrs Rausing had been arrested after she allegedly tried to smuggle small amounts of crack cocaine and heroin into the US embassy in London.
Charges were then dropped and a caution issued instead.
In 2010 Forbes ranked Mr Rausing's father, Hans Rausing Senior, as the 64th richest man in the world, worth an estimated $10bn (Â£6.45bn).
The family made their fortune from the Tetra Laval milk carton, patented by Ruben Rausing in the 1960s.
