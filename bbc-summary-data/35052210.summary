Swansea council has approved controversial plans for a new Â£6m primary school in Gorseinon.

The plans will unite three existing sites with ageing buildings into a new building at Parc Y Werin.
Many Gorseinon residents have opposed the new school being built there.
"We've handed petitions into the Senedd and Swansea City Council, with well over 3,000 signatures", said former Welsh international footballer Leighton James, who grew up using the park.
Local residents claim that the park is the only public open space with sports pitches in the town.
About 6.5% of the park will be covered by the new building, with new pitches being created for the school set to be available for community use, the planning committee was told.
The plans were narrowly passed by the planning committee, with 6 in favour and 5 against.
"This has never been about losing Parc y Werin because the park is not being lost," said Rob Stewart, council leader.
"The new school will help protect and enhance the park and provide additional benefits for the whole community for play, recreation and sport."
