[SN]TITLE[SN]
Final Northern Ireland super council recommendations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Final recommendations for the make-up of 11 new so-called super councils for Northern Ireland have been published.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They will replace the current 26 district councils and will have responsibility for local planning, housing repairs and demolition.
Officials hope the Local Government Bill will make it through all its stages by February or March of next year.
Elections to the new councils are due to be held in May.
The new councils are Antrim and Newtownabbey; Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon; Belfast; Causeway Coast and Glens; Derry and Strabane; Fermanagh and Omagh; Lisburn and Castlereagh; Mid and East Antrim; Mid Ulster; Newry, Mourne and Down; and North Down and Ards.
The new arrangements would see the number of councillors reduced from 582 to 462.
As before, they will be elected by proportional representation.
Here are the proposed district electoral areas under the 11 new councils.
