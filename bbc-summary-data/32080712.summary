The 49-year-old man, who has not been identified, is an officer with the Northamptonshire force.
He was arrested shortly after 13:00 GMT at the couple's home in Wootton Hall Park, Northampton, close to the force's headquarters.
The murder investigation team "will not include anyone from Northamptonshire Police", a statement said.
The overall investigation will be led by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, headed by Det Supt Kate Meynell and including officers drafted in from across the region.
No details were released about the victim, but a post-mortem examination was due to be carried out in Leicester.
The matter has also been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission "as a matter of course".
Det Supt Meynell said: "A full and proper investigation is taking place."
