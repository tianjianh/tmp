Scientists have created a special fabric that meshes together when water and a bit of pressure are applied.
It's inspired by chemicals found in a squid's tentacles which allow the creature to heal themselves quickly.
By using those chemicals in the fabric it's possible to make a material that stitches itself back together when needed.
The scientists at Pennsylvania State University and the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington say this tech could be used to make protective suits to help keep people like soldiers or farmers safe from dangerous materials.
Take a look at some other animals that have inspired technology.
