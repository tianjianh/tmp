Police investigating a man's murder have been granted an extension for a special dispersal zone around the crime scene.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dispersal order in place in The Stow area of Harlow means officers can force anybody suspected of anti-social behaviour to leave.
Arek Jozwik, 39, died after an unprovoked attack in The Stow last Saturday night.
The dispersal order will now remain in place until Monday night.

Mr Jozwik suffered head injuries in the attack. He later died of his injuries on Monday evening.
The extension of the dispersal order comes ahead of a silent march in memory of Mr Jozwik planned for Saturday.
Six teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of killing Mr Jozwik.
One line of inquiry in the investigation is that it may have been a hate crime - though officers stress no motive for the attack has yet been established.
Poland's deputy prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki expressed his sorrow at the death as he visited the UK.
The family of Mr Jozwik said they are "extremely devastated".
