Ben Reynolds could be a late addition to the Ireland team for the World Indoor Championships alongside Mark English and Rose-Anne Galligan.

Letterkenny 800m runner English's championship pedigree has earned him selection although he has not run the qualifying standard of 1:46.50.
Galligan booked her spot by achieving the Portland 1500m standard last month.
Reynolds was 0.01 seconds outside the Portland 60m hurdles mark recently but may qualify under the IAAF list system.
Last year, the IAAF introduced a new system for their championships which saw some athletes narrowly outside qualifying marks having their entries accepted.
After announcing the selection of English and Galligan on Wednesday, an Athletics Ireland statement said that there was "still potential for more names to be added to the squad" for the 17-20 March championships.
Athletics Ireland confirmed to BBC Sport Northern Ireland that Holywood man Reynolds was the leading possible squad addition that they had in mind.
Reynolds ran his new personal best of 7.73 when winning the Irish Indoor title in Athlone on 28 February, cutting 0.01 off his previous fastest time.
However, his new best was still a frustrating 0.01 outside the world indoor standard so he is depending on good news from the IAAF in order to travel to Oregon.
UCD medical student English added a European Indoor silver last March to the European outdoor bronze he won in 2014.
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland trio Kevin Seaward, Paul Pollock and Thomas Frazer will be among a five-strong Irish challenge at the World Half Marathon Championship in Cardiff on 26 March.
Seaward has probably done enough to secure a place in the Olympic Marathon in Rio as he is the fastest of several Irish qualifiers, with only three to make the trip.
Pollock is currently fourth fastest of Ireland's Rio qualifiers, with Mick Clohisey and Sergiu Ciobanu also quicker on the clock than the Northern Ireland man.
Medical doctor Pollock is using the Cardiff race as preparation for his London Marathon challenge on 17 April.
Ciobanu and Sean Hehir will also race in the Welsh capital while Olympic qualifier Lizzie Lee will be sole Irish female hopeful.
Fionnuala McCormack, meanwhile, will run the New York Half Marathon on 20 March before racing over 10,000m at Stanford on 2 April.
