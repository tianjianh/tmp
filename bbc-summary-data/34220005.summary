Plans to expand the Liberty Stadium could cost Swansea City more than £50m, the club's chairman has revealed.

The Swans are in talks with Swansea council over planning issues and could eventually buy the stadium outright from the local authority.
But Huw Jenkins said it could take four to five months to work through the conditions before the club can "weigh up our options".
Expansion plans were approved by councillors in January 2014.
Jenkins was questioned at a meeting of the Swansea City Supporters Trust.
"There are many options open to us and we are working closely with the council to find a solution that suits all parties," he said.
"Our main objective is to make sure our team is competitive on the pitch," he added.
"We all know there is more funding coming into the Premier League next season.
"We have to make sure we're part of that and that will allow us to address issues and move forward."
