Sylvain Distin: Bournemouth central defender among six departures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sylvain Distin is among six out-of-contract players to be released by Premier League Bournemouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Everton and Manchester City central defender Distin, 38, joined the club on a one-year deal last summer.
The Frenchman started just nine Premier League games for the Cherries in an injury-disrupted season.
Goalkeeper Ryan Allsop, 23, who spent time on loan this season at Wycombe and Portsmouth, has signed a new two-year deal at the club until 2018.
Bournemouth have also confirmed Stephane Zubar, Josh Carmichael, Josh Wakefield, Mason Walsh and Jon Muleba will be leaving.
