Scottish and Southern Energy's (SSE) website said areas of Hampshire, Berkshire, Surrey and Dorset had reported power cuts on Tuesday.
Buildings were damaged and transport disrupted after high winds battered England on Easter Monday.
Almost 4,000 homes were initially cut off and a few hundred had been reconnected by the evening.
At 11:00 BST on Tuesday there were dozens of homes in Aldershot, Petersfield, New Forest, Basingstoke and Slough still without power.
SSE said they were all later reconnected.
BBC weather forecaster Simon King said gusts of 105mph had been recorded at the Needles off the Isle of Wight in the early hours of Monday.
On Monday Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service attended more than 30 incidents involving dangerous structures, 10 of which were in Portsmouth.
