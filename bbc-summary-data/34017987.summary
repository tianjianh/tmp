A consultation about plans which could see consultant-led maternity care withdrawn from a district hospital in north Wales has begun.

Betsi Cadwaladr health board has suggested downgrading services at one of the area's three district hospitals due to a staffing shortage.
A legal challenge blocked the plan to downgrade maternity care at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
That prompted the consultation, which includes a series of public meetings.
Residents are unhappy with the plans, suggesting removing the service at hospitals like Wrexham Maelor and Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor will mean women having to travel further for care.
However, bosses said any changes would be temporary and are needed to ensure the safety of mothers and babies.
A dedicated health board website was launched on Monday to collate public reaction to the options, which also includes retaining all services.
Several public meetings are due to take place in September.
