The white and orange objects have appeared above major commercial streets around the city, but their origin remains a mystery.
Locals have been sharing images online, to try and figure out who might be responsible.
A spokesman for Portland General Electric said he did not believe the rubber products posed a fire hazard.
Portland resident Lucila Cejas Epple said that she first encountered the sex toys at a neighbourhood street fair over the weekend, according to Reuters.
"You could spot them in several intersections and you could see all sorts of reactions to them," she said.
"Some would blush, others would laugh, and most would take photos."
The first sightings were reported late last month - but more have appeared in recent days.
