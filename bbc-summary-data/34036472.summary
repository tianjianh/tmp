The 51-year-old bookended his tournament with rounds of 64 to finish on 17 under for a 21st PGA Tour title.
Love's six-under-par final round moved him ahead of Jason Gore, who took a two-shot lead into the final day.
England's Paul Casey finished tied third on 15 under, while 14-time major champion Tiger Woods finished a further two shots back in tied 10th position.
"I gave myself a chance. I had all the opportunities in the world to do it and didn't get it done," said Woods.
The 39-year-old, in a quest for his first title since the 2013 WGC Bridgestone, was joint leader at the halfway stage.
Woods started the day two strokes off the lead but did not make a birdie until the ninth hole.
And after Gore missed a long birdie chance at the last to force a play-off, Love secured the title at Sedgefield Country Club and his third in Greensboro.
It comes four months after foot surgery for Love, who is now the third oldest winner of a PGA Tour event.
USA's Scott Brown briefly tied for the lead when he landed a hole-in-one on the 174-yard third during the final round.
