After a draw with Argentina, GB started brightly against the 2012 Olympic champions, with Lily Owsley striking the bar in the first quarter.
But the momentum shifted with Lidewij Welten and Maartje Paumen scoring to give the Netherlands' all three points.
"We were outclassed today," head coach Danny Kerry told BBC Sport.
"We lost possession too often and found ourselves chasing a lot of the time which is really energy sapping."
The women's Champions Trophy features six of the world's top seven nations and is the final major international competition ahead of the Rio Olympics.
The top nations after the pool stage is completed next Saturday will face-off for the gold medal, whilst third and fourth will battle for bronze.
The Dutch won their opening fixture 6-2, but delivered a more disciplined display to deny GB few real goal scoring opportunities.
Crista Cullen came perhaps closest with penalty corner routines in each of the final two quarters, whilst keeper Maddie Hinch was in top form.
"It was a tough game but we know we can do much better and that's what's so disappointing because we weren't at the races for a while," Hinch told BBC Sport.
"We're still very much in this tournament because teams will take points off one another and we'll get our heads together and come back stronger on Tuesday."
GB can take encouragement from having now faced the tournaments two highest ranked teams and will have a rest day on Monday before taking on New Zealand.
"We believe that we can and are determined to beat all of these sides," captain Kate Richardson-Walsh told BBC Sport.
"It's good to be disappointed with today and now we'll move on to thinking about the next one."
The Team GB hockey squad for the 2016 Rio Olympics will be revealed on 28 June.
