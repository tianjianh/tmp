The company's chief Elon Musk hinted at the device in December, describing it on Twitter as a "solid metal snake".
After the firm revealed a video of the charger in action he joked that it "does seem kinda wrong".
At the moment the gadget is just a prototype and the company has no plans to sell it in the near future.
