[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Transvestite Vampire Biker Nuns from Outer Space is among the contenders for a prize given annually to the year's oddest book title.

This year's seven-strong shortlist includes Too Naked for the Nazis, Soviet Bus Stops and Reading from Behind: A Cultural History of the Anus.
The winner of the Diagram Prize is decided by public vote.
Previous winners include How to Poo on a Date and Goblin-proofing One's Chicken Coop.
Reading the Liver: Papyrological Texts on Ancient Greek Extispicy, Paper Folding with Children and Behind the Binoculars: Interviews with Acclaimed Birdwatchers complete this year's line-up.
All the titles were nominated by industry insiders and members of the public - aside from Too Naked for the Nazis, which was put forward by its author.
"Transvestite Vampire Biker Nuns from Outer Space is not only a trenchant examination of cult film, but would be an excellent theme for your next fancy dress party," commented The Bookseller's diarist Horace Bent, dubbed 'the custodian of the prestigious Diagram Prize'.
The prize, now in its 38th year, was originally conceived in 1978 by Trevor Bounford and Bruce Robertson of The Diagram Group as a way to alleviate boredom at Frankfurt's annual book fair.
It was first awarded to Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice. Two years - 1987 and 1991 - had no award due to the lack of odd titles.
The Bookseller has hosted the prize since 1982 and invites members of the public to vote for their favourite title on its website.
