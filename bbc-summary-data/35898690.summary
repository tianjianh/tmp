Fuel prices at service stations will be advertised on an English motorway for the first time, Highways England has announced.

The electronic signs, which will be switched on from 29 March, will show the price of fuel along the southbound carriageway of the M5.
Five service stations - Gordano, Sedgemoor, Bridgwater, Taunton Deane and Exeter - are involved.
If deemed a success, it could be rolled out across the motorway network.
Roads minister Andrew Jones said: "This trial will allow drivers to be much better informed about the cost of fuel and make it easier to plan their breaks around the cheapest deals."
Andrew Page-Dove, from Highways England, said: "This trial is an important part of a bigger picture and we want road users to be more informed and in better control of their journeys.
"This means they'll be better prepared, more inclined to plan breaks and have sufficient fuel."
The scheme will run until the end of 2017, when Highways England will decide whether the project could be rolled out to other areas.
