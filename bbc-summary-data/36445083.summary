The 23-year-old, who made her senior international debut in 2012, featured at last year's World Cup in Canada.
The former league winner with ADO Den Haag scored 15 goals in 94 appearances for Ajax since joining them in 2012.
"I was looking for a new challenge and I'm delighted to get the chance to play for such a big club," Middag told the Women's Super League leaders' website.
"It's a bonus to be playing in the Champions League and I'm really looking forward to playing at the highest level against clubs from France and Germany."
