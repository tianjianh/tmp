The Premier League leaders visit Everton on Sunday (14:05 BST), where they face the league's top scorer Romelu Lukaku.
Belgian Lukaku, 23, has 24 league goal, while Spaniard Costa, 28, has 19.
"Lukaku is a good guy but for us Diego is very important and, in this part of the season, he will be decisive for us," said the Italian.
"We are talking about two great strikers. But you know that Diego, for me, is the best striker in the world.
"I think it's great to have talent. But I like a lot when you are a warrior during the game and, above all, if players with talent show they work hard during the game."
