A dog described as England's "most unwanted" after spending seven years in an animal shelter has finally found a new home.

Benji, a Patterdale Terrier, who is described as "a character", has been at Easterleigh Sanctuary in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, since he was three.
Now aged 10, he is diabetic and requires injections every 12 hours.
But he has finally been placed with a new owner in Lancashire who is said to be "desperate" to take him home.
Benji arrived at the sanctuary in 2008 as his then owner could no longer keep him. His file said he "can be a bit snappy".
Naomi McGregor, from the sanctuary, told the BBC: "He's an ace little character and a proper fun loving little thing. He's just been difficult to home and in the last few years he's developed diabetes as well."
She said potential owners "tended to panic" but added: "We have got somebody now who's desperate to take him home."
She admitted he "hasn't always shown his best side to newcomers" and had gradually "become part of the furniture" at the sanctuary.
When he went on a visit to his new home, he was "into every corner rolling around on the nice big bed she got for him." Ms McGregor said she thinks "he's going to be really happy" in his new home.
The sanctuary's website profile for Benji reads: "Stubborn but loyal friend. Likes: walks and splashing about in puddles. Doesn't like: most other dogs, cats. Needs an understanding, patient home."
It adds: "Benji has been at Easterleigh on and off (much more on than off though) since 2008."
