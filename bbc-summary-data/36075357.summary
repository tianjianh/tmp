Michael Grimes also sent "inappropriate sexual messages" to girls under the age of 16.
Grimes, 25, from Montrose, sent one girl indecent pictures after she refused his request for photos of herself.
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of sentencing at Dundee Sheriff Court next month.
The court was told Grimes' youngest victim, who was completely unknown to him, was nine-years-old when he started sending her private messages on Facebook after she accepted his friend request.
Fiscal depute Donna Brown said Grimes had asked the youngster to assess the size of his private parts in the messages.
Miss Brown said the girl told her mother, who contacted police.
A search of Grimes' home had revealed pictures on his laptop and his mobile phone, as well as the pair of pink boxer shorts he had been wearing in some of the indecent pictures.
In another incident, Grimes met up with a 14-year-old girl at his home after saying he would give her cigarettes, but the victim left when she "got freaked out" by him.
The court heard Grimes asked the girl to send pictures of herself over Facebook, which she refused to do, but he sent her four or five pictures of his private parts to her.
Grimes, 25, of St John's Place, Montrose, pleaded guilty to using lewd, indecent and libidinous practices towards a 14-year-old girl between March 2011 and October 2012.
He also admitted sending written sexual communications and pictures to another 14-year-old girl between April 2012 and April 2014.
Grimes also admitted a further charge related to a nine-year-old girl who he caused to look at sexual images by sending a picture of his private parts over social media in March 2015.
Sheriff Alastair Brown deferred sentence for background reports and released Grimes on bail.
He said: "Girls who are or maybe under the age of 16 are off limits for any sexual conversation.
"Girls who are over 16 are off limits unless they consent explicitly.
"Unless you observe these rules you will find yourself in jail for a long time."
