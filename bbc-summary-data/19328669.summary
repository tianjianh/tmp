A tyre filled with flammable liquid was set alight outside a door of the property at Mark Street, Glenarm, at about 01:00 BST on Tuesday.
A 40-year-old man, his wife, 37, their 15-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son were in the house, as well as another man. No-one was injured.
It is understood the family is Polish and had been previously targeted.
There was minor smoke damage to the house.
Sinn Fein MLA Oliver McMullan said it was not the first time the family had been attacked.
"To my knowledge, it is the third attack," he said.
"There has been a petrol bomb thrown at the house and there has been another occasion when acid was poured over their vehicle."
The police have appealed for information.
A PSNI spokeswoman said:  "All lines of inquiry are being followed up. At this stage it is being treated as criminal damage and arson."
