Fifteen more operations cancelled at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifteen more operations have been postponed as Aberdeen Royal Infirmary due to "very busy" spell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has brought the total this week so far to 80 as NHS Grampian experienced a "seasonal" peak in demand.
The health board said many staff had been working extra hours and giving up their days off to help colleagues cope.
Twenty operations were affected on Tuesday and 45 more on Wednesday.
