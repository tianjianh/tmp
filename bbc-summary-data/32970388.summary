As search efforts continue for survivors of the Yangtze cruise ship sinking, relatives have gathered in Nanjing and Shanghai as they wait for news.

At least five people are confirmed dead and hundreds are still missing after the Eastern Star capsized late on 1 June en route to Chongqing, in one of China's worst transport disasters in recent memory. The vessel was carrying 458 people.
The vast majority of passengers are retirees from Jiangsu province - where the ship's starting point Nanjing is located - as well as Shanghai.
Many had booked a package tour with Xiehe Travel. On Tuesday, anxious relatives gathered at the company's office in Shanghai which was shut.
One young man was seen sobbing as he crouched by the door, saying: "Mum and Dad I was wrong, I shouldn't have let you go off on your holiday."
Others have spoken to reporters demanding answers.
"I only found out about this on the news while I was at work... I cried all the way here and here I can't find anyone, the door is locked," said 35-year-old Wang Sheng, who said his parents were on board.
"Why did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?" another woman named Huang Yan asked reporters.
The captain and the chief engineer were among the first to be rescued.
In Nanjing, local officials set up a contact centre in a hotel for relatives to register their details and wait for news.
With authorities publicly identifying only a few of those rescued, some relatives have resorted to putting out appeals for information on social media describing their loved ones and listing their national identification numbers.
For at least one family there was some good news.
Brothers Cao Feng and Cao Cen in Nanjing burst into tears of relief when they recognised their 65-year-old mother Zhu Hongmei in news pictures of her rescue.
The Cao brothers told reporters that their father, who was also on the ship, is still missing, and that they were rushing to the site of the sinking in Jianli county.
Others, however, are still waiting.
One is the husband of 60-year-old Zhang Lifen, who had gone on the cruise with 22 of their neighbours.
He told Southern Metropolis Daily that she had rung him around 9pm on Monday and told him: "It's quite stormy and rainy here."
The boat reportedly sank around 9.30pm.
Liu Xianlu, the son of the ship's missing first mate, told Changjiang Daily that his father had spent his whole career on the Yangtze river.
"His grandson just turned one, our whole family hopes Papa gets home safely!" he said.
Another relative, identified in the media as Little W, had been exchanging texts with her father who was on the cruise.
One of his last messages read: "Hi pretty, are you awake?... I'm doing very well, eating lots of healthy food, and everything else's good." Calls to his phone on Tuesday morning did not get through.
But at least two people had a lucky escape.
Nanjing geology expert Yin Jiaheng told reporters that he was supposed to go on the cruise with an old classmate, but dropped out at the last minute because he fell sick.
He rang his old classmate the minute he heard the news on Tuesday morning, praying that his friend had not gone ahead without him. He had not.
