[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City boss Steve Bruce has agreed a contract extension with the Premier League side.

Bruce, 54, took over at the KC Stadium in June 2012 and led them to promotion in his first season with the club.
Last season he took them to their first ever FA Cup final, losing to Arsenal in extra-time, as well as guiding them to 16th in the top flight.
The Tigers are currently 15th in the table, five points clear of the relegation zone with 10 games to play.
Bruce, whose previous deal was set to expire at the end of this season, told BBC Radio Humberside: "It's a rolling contract that I think will suit everybody.
"I've really enjoyed my time here and it feels like we've been talking about extending the deal for a very long time.
"I've been very happy here and why shouldn't I have been? We've had a great two and a half years. Who could forget how we got promoted, the FA Cup run we had and the short excursion into Europe?
"The most important thing now is keeping the club in the Premier League and growing from here."
After comfortably avoiding relegation last season the Tigers are looking to retain their top-flight status for the second successive season for the first time in their history.
Bruce is hopeful that some of the club's players will follow him in extending their deals.
"We have a big summer coming up with players running out of contract so I thought it was only right that I committed first," he added.
"I'm going to try and lead from the front and get a few to come with me."
