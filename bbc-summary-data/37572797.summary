[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The outbreak affected pupils at Glyn Gaer Primary School in Gelligaer and there was also a case at Ysgol Rhydywaun in Rhondda Cynon Taff.
It began in April and cases continued to be identified until June.
Public Health Wales said a multi-agency outbreak control team had taken measures and it was now over.
Heather Lewis, consultant in communicable disease control, said: "Hepatitis A has a long incubation period - or time during which the illness can develop in the body - which is why we have needed to wait three months to declare the outbreak over.
"As part of our work to limit the spread of the disease, we held vaccination sessions at a number of schools, an after school club and a nursery."
