The bridge over the M3 near Windlesham will be taken down, before debris is cleared and the road prepared for reopening.
Highways England said the closure between Junction 2 for the M25 and Junction 3 for Lightwater would remain in place until Monday morning.
Anyone planning a journey on the M3 has been advised to allow extra time.

Woodlands Bridge currently carries Woodlands Lane over the motorway, but Highways England said its condition had deteriorated.
It is due to be rebuilt next year when the M3 is upgraded.
A 13.4 mile stretch of the M3 is being turned into a four-lane smart motorway, where technology is used to manage traffic flows with variable speed limits and use of the hard shoulder.
Project manager Pranav Devale said replacing the bridge would be a "significant milestone".
He said the closure was essential to ensure safety for road workers and drivers.
