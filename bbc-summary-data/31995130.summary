The government recommends that everyone should have at least five portions of fruit and veg a day.
But the survey shows 52 in every 100 kids don't have any veg, and 44 in 100 have no fruit on a daily basis.
What we're eating is a big issue at the moment because one in three kids in the UK is obese or overweight.
Newsround asked food expert Dr Radha to explain why it's important to eat your greens.
