[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Half-centuries from Nick Gubbins, Dawid Malan and Adam Voges put Middlesex on top against Durham on day one at Chester-le-Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors won the toss and England hopeful Sam Robson was bowled by Brydon Carse for a brisk 26.
Malan (74) and Voges' 90-run fourth-wicket stand followed a quickfire 60 from Gubbins as the hosts toiled.
England all-rounder Ben Stokes had Voges (50) caught in the slips but Middlesex closed on an imposing 358-7.
Despite starting brightly Durham struggled on a good wicket and Gubbins hit 10 fours before falling lbw to Graham Onions.
Nick Compton, who will be hoping to retain his place in the England line-up for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka in May, fell for 38 - dragging on off Ryan Pringle.
Durham struck in consecutive overs with Malan and Voges departing, after Malan edged Chris Rushworth to Michael Richardson behind the stumps and Voges was well held by Steve Borthwick.
Middlesex pushed past 300 as Jack Simpson and Paul Stirling (41 not out) put on 71 for the sixth wicket, as the away side remained in the ascendency.
