The body of Stacey Tierney, 29, was discovered in Dreams Â­Gentlemen's Club in Melbourne on 19 December.
Australian police are investigating the death of the former fitness instructor from Manchester, which they are describing as "unexplained".
"This loss has devastated our family", a statement said.
A post-mortem examination is due to be held to investigate the cause of death, Victoria Police said on Tuesday.
Police did not say whether her death was being treated as suspicious.
Ms Tierney's family said in a statement they had been through an "extremely difficult time" since learning about her death and they "wait to hear further news every day".
"Stacey was, and will always be, the most amazing, special, caring person you could ever meet and this loss has devastated our family," the statement said.
"While we continue to work with the authorities in Melbourne our primary aim at this time is to bring Stacey home," the statement said.
"Until we have Stacey home and the investigation is complete we would be grateful if the family's privacy can be respected and we are allowed time to come to terms with what has happened."
Ms Tierney studied dance at Oldham College and had worked as a fitness instructor at Nitro Boxing Fitness Centre and Manchester Aquatics Centre before moving to Australia.
An online funding page set up by Ms Tierney's cousin Colleen Sarah to repatriate her body has raised more than Â£11,000.
