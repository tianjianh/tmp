[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A boy has been arrested in connection with the sexual assault of two six-year-old girls during a trip to Legoland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girls were "touched inappropriately" in the Castaway Camp playground at the park in Windsor, Berkshire, on Thursday 11 August.
Thames Valley Police refused to give the suspect's age or say where he was arrested, citing "safeguarding issues".
The boy has since been released on police bail until 2 December.
Police previously issued an E-fit of a suspect, who was described as a white man in his teens or early twenties.
Officers said he was white, under 5ft 8in tall, wearing dark slim-fitting trousers, a dark t-shirt and trainers.
Police began following up new leads in September after a reconstruction was shown on BBC One's Crimewatch.
A 22-year-old man previously arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attacks was released without charge.
Thames Valley Police said: "This is remains a live investigation and we continue to appeal for the public's help".
