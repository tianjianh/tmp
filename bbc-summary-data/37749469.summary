New Southsea to Ryde hovercraft crossings cancelled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The operator of the hovercraft which serves the Isle of Wight has blamed "bedding in" problems with two new vessels for cancelled crossings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hovertravel is operating a revised timetable between Southsea and Ryde following issues with its new Solent Flyer and Island Flyer craft.
It apologised, saying it had received "many" complaints about delays and disruptions in recent weeks.
The new craft, costing Â£10m, were launched in the summer.
In a message on the operator's website, managing director Neil Chapman said: "Thank you to those who have contacted me and [for] your custom, your comments are all duly noted and my teams are working through the various areas of improvement.
"We are sincerely sorry for the inconvenience over the last few weeks, and rest assured we are focused on the areas requiring improvement."
When the vessels were named by sailing champion Sir Ben Ainslie, the company said the Â£10m investment would "improve passenger comfort through speedier and easier boarding, a quieter ride and better visibility" and a phased introduction of the craft would avoid disruption.
