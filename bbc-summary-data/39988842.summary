[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kumar Sangakkara struck a brilliant second century in the match for Surrey to set up a fascinating final day against Middlesex at Lord's.

James Franklin's 112 had earlier helped Middlesex post 411 to earn the hosts a first-innings lead of 98.
Toby Roland-Jones (3-39) made inroads, but Sangakkara's elegant and patient innings prevented a second collapse.
The Sri Lankan finished unbeaten on 116, as he passed 20,000 first-class runs, and the visitors closed on 194-4.
Middlesex captain Franklin brought up his first hundred since June 2015 by swiping Tom Curran away for four towards the third man region, but fell for 112 after top-edging a full delivery from Stuart Meaker (4-92).
A quick-fire 30 from Roland-Jones propelled the hosts past 400 - and secured maximum batting bonus points - only for Surrey to wrap up their local rivals' innings just 10 balls after lunch.
Following the early loss of opener Mark Stoneman, taken well by Adam Voges at slip, Roland-Jones trapped Rory Burns lbw for just 10 to put Middlesex firmly in the ascendency.
It brought Sangakkara, who had held together Surrey's first innings, to the crease and the 39-year-old edged his first ball off Steven Finn agonisingly short of third slip.
However, it was the last aberration from Sangakkara as he complied another classy innings - sharing a 123-run third-wicket partnership with Scott Borthwick (49) - before bringing up his 60th first-class century with a hard-run three off Ollie Rayner.
A couple of late wickets left Middlesex with just enough hope of pushing for victory on the final day, with the immovable Sangakkara once again looking to be Surrey's main hope of escaping with a draw.
Middlesex head coach Richard Scott told BBC Radio London:
"Toby Roland-Jones is so whole-hearted. He's a warrior. He just keeps on running in day in and day out. At the moment, he's the first name down on our team sheet, to be honest.
"His new ball spell was superb and he all but bowled Sangakkara first ball too. Then there was his batting. He came in and upped the tempo to make sure we got a decent first innings lead.
"As for James Franklin, that was a class hundred. He played brilliantly towards the end of day two, giving us fresh impetus in partnership with Dawid Malan and the confidence to go on and get that lead. His innings and his four wickets in Surrey's first innings are major contributions."
