Emergency rescue crews began a major operation just after 09:00 BST but later said the alert was a false alarm.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the swimmer had been identified and was safe and well.

An online petition calling for lifeguards at Camber Sands has been signed by more than 7,700 people.
