Greater Manchester mayor: What do local people think?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greater Manchester has been promised sweeping new powers by George Osborne in exchange for accepting an elected regional mayor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chancellor described the deal - agreed with the leaders of the region's 10 councils - as "a massive moment for the north of England".
But people questioned by the BBC News website in the centre of Manchester were mostly split three ways between apathy, indifference or ignorance.
In a region where some council wards have turnouts around 11%, there seemed to be little appetite for a new round of elections.
"I'm indifferent. It might be a good thing. If the mayor can cut down on the bureaucracy it would be good.
"But I don't think people are really bothered."
"I don't think anything will change. Politicians say one thing to get in power but they don't do anything for poor people, young people or the disabled once they got elected.
"There's nothing for young people where I live and nothing for people with disabilities."
"I don't see why it shouldn't work. It is a good idea across the political spectrum.
"I have come to Manchester to look work from Belfast and because of the music scene. If the new mayor could find me a job, I'd be very happy."
"I'm not very political [but] I don't see what difference it would make.
"There will be some people my age interested in this idea but most are not."
"I think it is too much responsibility for one person. You need to share the workload if you are going to get anything done.
"I believe it is too much power in the hands of one person."
"I think it is just a reaction to what Labour is proposing. We had Ed Miliband here recently talking about devolving power to the cities.
"This is just electioneering."
