The 31-year-old had surgery on his left ankle in September, missing his nation's 5-2 series win over England.
"He will return for the last two ODIs [on 25 & 29 January] in New Zealand," said Sri Lanka coach Marvan Atapattu.
The 2011 World Cup runners-up begin the 2015 tournament against co-hosts New Zealand in Christchurch on 14 February.
