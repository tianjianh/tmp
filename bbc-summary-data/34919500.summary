The owner of the Arcadia group, which includes Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins, and Burton, has been working with the star on a new athletic street-wear brand.
It had been reported that the global venture would launch this year.
Details came as Sir Philip's group reported operating profits up 5.5% to Â£251.6m despite "challenging times".
Sales for the year to 29 August were almost flat at Â£2.06bn, according to results published by Taveta Investments, Arcadia's family-controlled parent company.
The fashion industry was abuzz with speculation earlier this year when the retail entrepreneur and singer announced they were creating an all-new global company, Parkwood Topshop. Deals between retailers and celebrities have traditionally been branding links.
In an update on Wednesday, Taveta said: "We are developing our distribution globally for the launch of this exciting new brand in spring 2016."
The new company will produce clothing, footwear and accessories. So-called street-wear is a "rapidly growing area of the market", the company said in a statement.
Taveta's profit figures, for the year ending 29 August, do not include High Street chain BHS, which was sold in March to Retail Acquisitions for just Â£1.
Sir Philip said Arcadia delivered "a robust performance in challenging times". In the first 10 weeks of the current financial year, like-for-like sales were down 2.3% on the same period last year, he said.
