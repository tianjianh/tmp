A play area in Bristol is to be torn down, after residents who complained about noise and anti-social behaviour won a court case against the city council.

People living in Manor Farm, Horfield, say there's nowhere else nearby for young people to play and that its removal risks further anti-social behaviour.
Children who use the Multi-Use Games Area (Muga) say they will be very sad when it goes.
Magistrates ordered the local authority to take steps to reduce noise in the area - but the council decided the cheapest option was to demolish it.
