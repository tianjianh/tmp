The Turnip Prize: 'Dismal And' wins spoof art accolade

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doodle on a piece of wood by a former theme park worker has won the top prize in a contest which recognises the "lack of effort" required to create it.

Dismal And by "Bonksy" was one of 69 entries to this year's Turnip Prize.
Accepting his prize Mr Bonsky, from Bristol, said: "If you set your sights on the gutter and refuse to work hard your dreams really can come true".
The 53-year-old winner is said to have reluctantly accepted his prize, a turnip mounted on a six-inch nail
Organiser Trevor Prideaux said, "I am delighted with the lack of effort taken to create this work".
"This year's event attracted a total of 69 entries, which is exactly the same as last year.
"It's fantastic that Bonksy has won, he clearly has what it takes to be recognised in modern art circles and will be remembered in art history for no time at all!".
The ceremony took place at Wedmore's New Inn on Monday evening.
Other entries included a bread roll nestled in hay and a galvanized staple on a paper plate.
The contest satirises the Turner Prize - which is also presented later - by rewarding deliberately bad modern art.
The winner of the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize winner, meanwhile, receives Â£25,000, while runners-up each get Â£5,000.
In previous years, entries have been submitted from Ireland, Italy, France, Canada, Germany and the USA.
Winners of earlier competitions include David Stone in 1999 for Alfred The Grate (two burned rolls on a fire grate) and James Timms in 2003 for Take a Leaf out of my Chook (A raw chicken stuffed with leaves).
In 2007, the competition gained publicity after a work which mocked graffiti artist Banksy was disqualified for "trying too hard".
Titled By the Banksea, it showed a seaside Aunt Sally stencil holding a rocket launcher and firing a turnip over a wrecked seaside pier.
"Someone has thought too much about this one and tried too hard," Mr Prideaux said.
The shortlist of entries in 2015 has been whittled down from 69 to six.
Mr Prideaux said this year's art works were up to the "usual poor standard" with four people submitting "Jeremy Corbyn entries", although none made the shortlist.
