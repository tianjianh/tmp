Dancers and performers, including "the singing jeweller" put on a show in Rochdale for visitors to the newly revealed crossing over the River Roch.
Built in the 14th Century and concreted over in 1904 when the tram network expanded, the historic bridge has re-opened to pedestrians after a Â£5m project.
