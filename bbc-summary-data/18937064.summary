De Villota, 32, was seriously injured on 3 July while testing for Marussia at the track at Duxford.
A statement issued by the Marussia Technical Centre, in Banbury, said she left Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge on Friday.
She had made "significant progress" since the accident, it said.
The statement said: "More comfortable and familiar surroundings, plus the support of her wider family and friends, will undoubtedly provide a more conducive environment in which Maria can commence the next phase of her recovery."
The team praised staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital for the "remarkable care and attention that she has received there".
De Villota was injured during a straight-line test at the airfield. She was making her testing debut for Marussia and driving an F1 car for the fourth time in her career.
She sustained injuries after her car "suddenly accelerated" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses.
Earlier this week, the team said its own investigation had ruled out a fault in the car as a cause of the crash.
The incident is currently being investigated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
