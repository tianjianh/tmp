[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lord Janner not at court to face child sex abuse charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lord Janner has failed to appear at court to face child sex abuse charges, despite the High Court ruling he must attend a hearing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 87-year-old, who has dementia, had been due at Westminster Magistrates' Court in relation to 22 charges spanning the 1960s to the 1980s.
His lawyer told the court he would try to "facilitate" an appearance by the peer later, adding he wanted him to appear via video link from his home.
His family says he is innocent.
Lord Janner's lawyer, Paul Ozin, said a live link from the peer's home would be the option that was "least likely" to cause the peer to suffer.
Mr Ozin added: "There is evidence that moving him carries with it a risk of an adverse reaction to him or other harm."
If it was not possible for the link to be done from his home, a live link could also be carried out from within a court building or a police station, Mr Ozin said.
But prosecutor Louise Oakley said live links were only permitted for giving evidence from police stations when someone was in custody - which Lord Janner is not.
She suggested the peer could appear at Wood Green Crown Court instead, a court closer to his home.
Deputy chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, said she had been in touch with the court and it would be possible for Lord Janner to use a back entrance to attend a hearing there.
The case has been adjourned while the options are considered.
On Thursday, Lord Janner's legal team lost a High Court bid to prevent him having to attend the hearing.
Mr Ozin argued Lord Janner had "virtually no language left at all" and was likely to have a "catastrophic reaction" if he attended court.
But the judges said the public interest outweighed any personal distress he might experience, and any distress would be "of short duration".
His lawyers said they were not planning to appeal the ruling.
His appearance had been expected to last less than a minute and he was to be allowed to be accompanied by a member of his family and a nurse.
Lord Janner's family have strongly denied claims he used his power as an MP to abuse young boys over three decades.
Earlier this year, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders decided not to bring charges against Lord Janner because of his ill health - but this decision was overturned after an appeal by the alleged victims.
If a crown court judge decides the former Labour MP for Leicester is fit to plead, a full trial may take place.
If not, there will be a trial of the facts, where a jury will decide only if he committed the physical acts of abuse, with no finding of guilt and no conviction.
Greville Janner was made Lord Janner of Braunstone in 1997. He remains a life peer, but has been on leave of absence since 2014. He was suspended from the Labour Party in April.
