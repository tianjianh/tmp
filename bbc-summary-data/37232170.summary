#challengeaccepted: Cancer survivor attacks Facebook 'fakes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cancer survivor has criticised a new trend for cancer awareness photos on Facebook as "distasteful" and "fake".

Rebecca Wilkinson, who has undergone a double mastectomy, dismissed the craze for posting black and white "selfies" with the phrase "#challengeaccepted".
In response, the 36-year-old from Lancaster uploaded a topless photo of herself to show cancer's effect on her, The Huffington Post reported.
The mother-of-two was diagnosed with Stage 2b breast cancer in 2013.
Ms Wilkinson, who has had reconstructive breast surgery, also had to have her ovaries removed after tests revealed there was an 80% chance of her breast cancer returning.
She told the BBC: "This latest craze just makes me mad.
"Having cancer is scary, knowing you could die and be taken from your children.
"It is not the subject for some fake selfies as if it's some fun activity.
"People think just because they stick a black and white photo on Facebook they are supporting people with cancer.
"But I've spoken to a lot of people in the cancer community, and it's upset most people as well.
"They are not supporting people with cancer - they should really visit people in hospital with cancer or hold their hand while they're going through the trauma of chemo.
"It's just so fake and these people are just Facebook narcissists."
Her own internet post read:  "Everyone on Facebook is aware of cancer, so you cannot play the awareness card. Particularly as this time it's not even a *type* of cancer. You're not raising money. You're not showing support either."
Ms Wilkinson, who also has bipolar disorder, tested positive for the BRAC1 cancer gene after her own mother Sheila died aged 43 from breast cancer.
Hollywood film actress Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with the same gene.
There is a 50% chance that Ms Wilkinson's two children Connie, eight, and six-year-old Freddie might have the gene, but they will have to wait until they are 18 to be tested.
She added: "Having cancer is scary, knowing you could die and be taken from your children.
"It is not the subject for some fake selfies as if it's some fun activity."
The #challengeaccepted trend was very popular in India early in the summer and arrived in the UK last week.
Not all cancer sufferers share Rebecca's view of the trend.
Grandmother Jean Haines, 72, of Heald Green, Greater Manchester, who has had breast cancer twice, said: "I think any support for cancer sufferers is welcome.
"It can be such a frightening time... it's nice people are thinking of those suffering from this terrible disease."
Cancer charities approached by the BBC declined to comment.
