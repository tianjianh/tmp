The 20-year-old has made 60 appearances for the Stags, 11 of them this term.
"This boy could play a big part next season and I don't say that about many players who are allowed to go out on loan at this stage," Mansfield boss Steve Evans told the club website.
Thomas' arrival at Holker Street follows the loan signing of Barnsley striker Shaun Tuton.
