Former Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he wants to return to management in the summer.

Rodgers, 42, said he has received offers from abroad and would consider managing outside of the Premier League.
He was sacked by Liverpool in October after three-and-a-half years in charge.
"Hopefully in the summer, I can get back in again," he told Match of the Day. "I am open to travelling. I have had a couple of offers to go abroad but I wanted to wait."
The Northern Irishman took over at Liverpool in June 2012, and led them to second place in the Premier League in 2013-14.
They were top of the table with three games remaining, before losing out to Manchester City.
He was sacked after Liverpool won only four of their opening 11 games of this season.
"I had a really enjoyable time at Liverpool but wanted to take a step back and reflect," said the former Swansea manager.
"The first couple of seasons went well and we were building towards a title challenge and we fell just short.
"The last six months were difficult and the owners wanted to make a change."
