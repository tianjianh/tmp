Birmingham City youngster Koby Arthur has been recalled from his loan spell at Cheltenham Town.

The 18-year-old joined the Robins at the start of the season on a youth loan that was expected to run until January.
The winger impressed at the League Two club, scoring four goals in eight games, but has now returned to Blues.
A Cheltenham statement read: "He was a popular member of the first-team squad and we wish Koby the very best for his future with the Blues."
Arthur made his Blues debut towards the end of the 2012-13 season, shortly after signing his first professional contract.
He made two senior appearances before another two first-team games at the start of last season prior to going out on loan to Lincoln City.
