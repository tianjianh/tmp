England fast bowler Mark Wood has signed a new three-year contract with Durham, despite their demotion to County Championship Division Two.

Ashington-born Wood, 26, is a product of the academy and has played Test and one-day cricket for England, but is currently ruled out by an ankle injury.
The England and Wales Cricket Board imposed sanctions on Durham after giving them a Â£3.8m rescue package.
"Throughout the year, I was desperate to stay," Wood said.
"I wanted to not just stay for one or two, I wanted to make sure I was here to make a difference for a long period of time.
"The recent setback we have had gives us a chance to make a big impact and hopefully along with my England duties, I can push the club forward in a good light."
Wood, who is centrally contracted by England, is a member of the 'production line' of Durham players to have made the step up to international cricket, following Steve Harmison, Graham Onions and more recently, Ben Stokes.
"I'm a North East lad from the region, I want to make a difference for this club and I've been here since I was 16-17 years old so I'm delighted I can stay on longer and continue my Durham journey," he continued.
Chief executive David Harker said: "We're very pleased to have Mark's services once again and a three-year deal shows commitment from both parties.
"There was a great willingness from both parties to get a new deal sorted and we are delighted to have got this over the line.
"His potential is vast and we're glad to be supporting him throughout a time when he will be reaching the prime stages of his career."
