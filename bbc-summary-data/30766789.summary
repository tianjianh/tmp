Before pulling pints in the Rovers Return, Kym Marsh was busy singing for a living.

As one fifth of Hear'Say she is no stranger to a TV talent show.
But after her daughter appeared on the new series of The Voice she took to Twitter to hit back at some unwanted comments.
The actress wrote: "Got to say the bullies on here make me sick!! Say what you like about me I really do not care but a 16yr old??? Really?? Sick!!!"
Emilie Cunliffe, 16, sang the song Clarity by EDM producer Zedd, to the coaches on the BBC One show.
At one point Ricky Wilson looked like he would turn, but no-one had spun by the time she reached the end of the song.
On seeing Emilie, Tom Jones immediately said: "I made a mistake here.
"I can't criticise you because I don't think there's anything to criticise."
Ricky said he did press his button but he was too late, and he had a "seed of doubt" in his mind.
But the panel were encouraging.
Rita Ora said: "You're beautiful, you have incredible tone, you've now got this opportunity to go away and tell yourself in the mirror 'what am I going to do to stand out amongst all these other girls in the music industry' and when you've figured that out please come back.'"
And will.i.am? Well, he compared her to an underdone steak.
"It's not that people don't like medium rare, it's just that we asked for well done," he said.
Emilie, who is from Manchester, was left in tears.
Her anxious mother who'd been waiting in the wings rushed to comfort her as she came off stage, saying: "You're amazing and I'm so proud of you. You're just a baby and you did so well."
But later, Kym hit out at some unfavourable comments posted on Twitter, before thanking people for their support.
This morning Emilie tweeted she's "determined to make [her] dreams come true".
