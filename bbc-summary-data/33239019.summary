The duo become the latest players to commit to Albion in National One after being relegated from the Championship.
Dacres, 23, played for Moseley in the Championship last season and has also spent time at Rotherham in the second tier of English rugby.
"Nile is an athletic and agile player in the back five of the scrum," said Albion director of rugby Graham Dawe.
"He still has the appetite to develop as a player and we hope we can make best use of his talent in the coming season."
Jon Dawe, 21, who is no relation to the Albion boss, was part of the Cornwall side that won the County Championship final last month with Graham Dawe in charge.
"Moving to Plymouth Albion will give me the opportunity to play a higher level of rugby which will help my development," Jon Dawe said. "I can play centre or wing but I think Graham primarily sees me as a winger."
So far there are 12 players confirmed for Albion's squad for next season.
Former Exeter and Newcastle centre Tom Bedford, New Zealand-born hooker James Penman, Australians Marc Koteczky and Ethan Ford, Cameron Setter and Dan Pullinger have all signed deals for next season.
The club have also held talks with Cornwall and England Counties scrum-half Matt Shepherd and have signed Exeter academy trio Jack Maunder, Ed Holmes and Harrison Cully on season-long loans.
