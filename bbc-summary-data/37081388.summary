[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Her condition is stable and she has been advised to rest, doctors at Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital said.
Mrs Gandhi, 69, is the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
She is the head of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has mostly governed India since independence in 1947.
Mrs Gandhi was admitted earlier this month after suffering from dehydration, fever and sustaining an injury during a campaign event in the city of Varanasi.
She underwent surgery to repair the shoulder injury, and was discharged from hospital on Sunday.
"Sonia Gandhi's medical condition at the time of discharge from the hospital is stable. She has been advised rest and continuation of medicines," DS Rana of Ganga Ram Hospital was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency.
"Mrs Gandhi is likely to visit the hospital for further evaluation of her condition in the coming week."
Her party lost the 2014 general elections to Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In 2011 Mrs Gandhi went to the US to receive surgery for an undisclosed medical condition. In 2013, she was taken to a hospital for a few hours after she fell ill in parliament.
And in 2014, she was admitted to a Delhi hospital for treatment of an infection.
