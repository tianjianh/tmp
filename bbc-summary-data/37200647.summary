England-qualified players at Man Utd, Chelsea & Man City playing less

As Sam Allardyce prepares to name his first England squad on Sunday, statistics show English players at the three Premier League title favourites are spending less time on the pitch - and that trend looks like continuing this season.

Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City, who between them won the previous 11 titles before Leicester's triumph last season, have provided a large proportion of England's squads at major tournaments in recent years.
United, Chelsea and City players occupied 12 of the 23 places in England's squad for Euro 2012.
However, the percentage of minutes played by Englishmen for those clubs in the Premier League has fallen every season since.
From 30 players accounting for 37% of playing time in 2011-12, 21 players accounted for 25% two years later.
The number of players has remained consistent from 2014 onwards, but their time on the pitch has continued to fall - 22 Englishmen for United, Chelsea and City made up 20% of minutes played last season.
Only six players from United, Chelsea and City featured in England's squad at Euro 2016.
Although the 2016-17 season is only two games old, City, United and Chelsea feature in the bottom five Premier League teams in terms of the playing time for England-qualified players.
They have used a combined eight English players this term, which translates to 19.6% of playing time for City, 18.2% for Chelsea and 18.1% for United.
Joe Hart, England's first-choice goalkeeper at Euro 2016, is yet to feature in the league for Manchester City this season.
United striker Marcus Rashford, another member of Roy Hodgson's squad in France, has not played a league game, while team-mate Chris Smalling has managed only one minute of action.
It is possible that all three may feature this weekend, before Allardyce announces his England squad for the 2018 World Cup qualifier in Slovakia on 4 September.
A total of 104 England-qualified players have appeared in the Premier League this season, although that includes Liverpool's James Milner and Chelsea's John Terry, both of whom have retired from international football.
The only two clubs with worse percentages than United, Chelsea and City this season are Stoke and Watford, with 9% and 10% of playing time respectively.
Ryan Shawcross is the only Englishman to feature for Stoke, while Watford's only England-qualified players have been Troy Deeney and Ben Watson, who was sent off 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute against Southampton.
At the other end of the scale, Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has used the most English players - 11 in the opening two games, accounting for 67% of playing time.
However, none of those players has a senior international cap between them.
