The limited-overs specialist will play 14 T20 Blast matches and eight One-Day Cup games.
The 26-year-old helped Northants to win last year's Twenty20 competition, scoring 360 runs at an average of 32.7.
Meanwhile, Australian Jackson Bird has signed a revised contract at Northants and will play only the first six County Championship matches this year.
David Ripley is currently drawing up a shortlist of potential overseas players
The new arrangement was agreed with Cricket Australia and allows Jackson to have a pre-season in Australia during July and August.
Jackson's final game for Northants will be against Yorkshire at the end of May.
Northants chief executive David Smith told the club's website: "The reduced schedule will see the club try and secure a second overseas bowler for a further six LVCC games.
"Our aim is to find someone that will be able to play in both the T20 Blast and County Championship.
"[Head coach] David Ripley is currently drawing up a shortlist of potential overseas players."
