[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromsgrove school PE teacher banned for life for messaging pupils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A PE teacher who sent "unacceptable" emails and text messages to two students has been banned for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth George, 30, was working at Bromsgrove School when he contacted two students outside of school hours.
He was suspended on 9 December 2014 - nearly a month after staff learned of allegations - and resigned days later.
A National College for Teaching and Leadership panel found he had acted in a way that could bring the profession into disrepute.
The prohibition order prevents him from teaching in any school, sixth form college, youth accommodation or children's home in England, and cannot be appealed against for three years.
Mr George, who had worked at the school for five years, was found by the panel to have singled out one of the pupils when she did not respond to his messages, and also offered to hold her up when she was doing pull-ups with other pupils.
They also judged the teacher knew his contact with the students "was inappropriate and in breach of professional boundaries".
However, the panel was not satisfied Mr George's actions were sexually motivated.
"Mr George should have shown a greater appreciation of the appropriate boundaries that regulate the teacher/pupil relationship," the panel said.
"Public confidence in the profession could be seriously weakened if conduct such as that found against Mr George was not treated with the utmost seriousness when regulating the conduct of the profession."
