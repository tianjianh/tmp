Fifth-placed Reading travel to Sheffield Wednesday, who are sixth, on Friday, looking to halt a run of three successive away defeats.
Wednesday have also suffered a dip recently, with three defeats in their past five matches.
"We don't look too closely at what other people are saying or doing as it's not important for us," Stam said.
Reading have taken just nine points from a possible 24 since the start of February.
But despite his side's form slump, Dutchman Stam believes the race for the play-offs will have plenty of hurdles for the main contenders in the coming weeks.
"Every game's different," the 44-year-old told BBC Radio Berkshire. "All teams struggle for a while in the Championship and we've had it of late.
"This point of the season isn't the best time to have that, you want to win your games obviously.
"But, we need to look at it in terms of the teams we need to play between now and the end of the season.
"Other teams (in the play-off picture) will face each other too, so you don't know how it's going to go in terms of who drops points and who picks them up."
