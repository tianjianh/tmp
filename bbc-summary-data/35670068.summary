Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, died from multiple injuries at the site on Tuesday.
A statement from his family said: "Mike was a much loved husband, father, granddad, son, brother and friend.
"He had a huge enthusiasm for life and will be remembered for his kind and friendly nature."
The company he worked for, Coleman and Co Demolition, tweeted:  "Our MD Mark Coleman: 'Mick Collings was our colleague and friend. We are devastated. Our hearts go out to his whole family'."
The search for three missing people, believed to be men, is continuing, but emergency services have previously said it is "highly unlikely" they will be found alive in the rubble.
Oxfordshire Fire Service said the remaining standing part of the collapsed building has been deemed structurally unsafe and highly unstable.
The service is warning residents to remain inside if the building unexpectedly collapses in the coming days.
It also said one option being discussed is the demolition of the rest of the building so search teams can safely access the rubble to search for the 3 missing people.
Part of the power station collapsed at 16:00 GMT on Tuesday as it was being prepared for demolition.
