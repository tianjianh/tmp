[SN]TITLE[SN]
Violent carer who killed vulnerable MS sufferer is jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man suffering from multiple sclerosis was repeatedly assaulted and later killed by his carer, a court was told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Roddy, 56, died after being attacked by Christopher McAllister, 30, of Priory Street, Warrington.
Jailing him for 10 years for manslaughter, Mr Justice Turner at Manchester Crown Court told McAllister he "was dependant on your care but you were violent and hastened his death".
McAllister's defence said he was "incapable of being a carer".
The jury had been told Mr Roddy was in the latter stages of the degenerative illness when he moved in to McAllister's home in Constable Street, Gorton, Manchester.
But Mr Roddy suffered a series of violent assaults which left him with multiple injuries to his head and body, the court heard. He died on 30 December 2015.
His cause of death was given as pneumonia but the court was told his condition was aggravated by the violent abuse by his carer.
The judge, Mr Justice Turner, told McAllister that, although Mr Roddy was prone to falls, he was satisfied that his victim "died as a result of your blows".
John Parry-Jones, defending, said his client took Mr Roddy into his home because youths had been using the sick man's dwelling to take drugs.
But he added McAllister was "socially, mentally and physically incapable of being a carer."
