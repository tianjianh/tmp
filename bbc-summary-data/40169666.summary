Western Power Distribution said Monmouthshire had been worst hit, with more than 450 customers affected at the height of the problem.
Rhondda Cynon Taff, Carmarthenshire, Caerphilly, Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Powys are also affected.
ScottishPower has restored power to about 200 homes in Porthmadog, Gwynedd.
The properties had been without power since 10:00 BST on Tuesday.
They lost power due to an overhead line fault which engineers are working to fix.
Meanwhile, firefighters rescued a man and a woman stranded in the middle of a swollen river near Waunfawr, Gwynedd, at 06:00 on Tuesday.
The two campers had to be rescued after their tent washed away and they were left stranded on a small patch of land.
Insp Owain Llewellyn of North Wales Police said: "Whilst the full circumstances have yet to be ascertained I cannot emphasise enough the dangers of camping near water sources in a mountainous terrain as weather and ground conditions can change quickly without warning."
They used an inflatable sledge to bring them to safety and the pair were taken to hospital for a check-up.
Elsewhere, high winds and fallen trees caused problems on some roads.
One lane was closed on the Severn Bridge to protect vehicles from being blown into adjacent lanes.
In Vale of Glamorgan, part of the A4050 was closed after a tree fell on an ambulance near Bryn Hafren Comprehensive School in Barry.
A section of the A483 in Carmarthenshire was also closed in both directions due to a fallen tree near Sugar Loaf Mountain, between Llandovery and Llanwrtyd Wells.
All routes have since reopened.
A Met Office yellow "be aware" warning for wind was in place for the whole of Wales until 22:00 on Tuesday, with warnings of gusts of 40 to 50 mph (65km/h - 80 km/h)
Earlier, some households in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, were left without power due to an overhead line fault, but this was restored within 30 minutes.
