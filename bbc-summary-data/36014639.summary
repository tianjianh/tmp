The service, a private enterprise known as Petit Train, will operate in May in St Peter Port.
The island had a tram service between St Peter Port and St Sampson from 1879 until it closed in 1934, after passenger numbers fell.
A light railway was later constructed by the German occupying forces in the Channel Islands during World War Two.
