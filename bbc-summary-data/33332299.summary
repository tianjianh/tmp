The Ivorian Football Federation (FIF) has named a five-man shortlist for Herve Renard's successor as manager of the African champions.

Of the contenders, Patrice Neveu, Paulo Duarte, Michel Dussuyer and Henri Kasperczak have all worked in Africa.
Frederic Antonetti is the only member of the shortlist who has neither coached a national team nor in Africa.
A total of 59 candidates were considered to replace Renard, and the list will now be reduced to three.
Poland-born Kasperczak coached Ivory Coast to third place at the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations and has also had spells in charge of Tunisia, Morocco, Mali and Senegal.
His latest job was a second spell with Mali that ended after the Nations Cup in Equatorial Guinea, where they failed to progress beyond the group stages despite being unbeaten.
The Eagles finished tied with Guinea in Group D but were eliminated after the drawing of lots to separate the teams.
Frenchman Neveu's most recent job, which ended last year, was with Mauritania, but he has previously worked with Niger, Guinea and DR Congo as well as Egyptian side Ismaili.
Another ex-Guinea coach being considered is Frenchman Dussuyer, whose second spell with the Syli Nationale ended after this year's Nations Cup exit, when they lost 3-0 to Ghana in the last eight.
Portuguese Duarte also has Nations Cup experience having been in charge of Burkina Faso in 2012.
He then failed to lead Gabon to the finals a year later.
Frenchman Antonetti's only overseas job was with Japanese side Gamba Osaka in 1998; otherwise he has worked with French clubs including three spells at his former side Bastia.
On its website the FIF outlined the qualities it is looking for in the new coach.
"The highest coaching qualification, good international experience, be ready to live in Ivory Coast for his entire contract, the capacity to adapt, an ability to work in a team and speak French," it read.
