Between 2011 and 2016, 356 parents or guardians in Northern Ireland were convicted because their children were absent from school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is not clear how many times the maximum fine, £1,000, was imposed in that period.
However, according to the latest figures provided by the Education Authority,  two people were fined £1,000 in 2015-2016.
In total that year, 87 parents were convicted for their child's absence.
Seven people were fined £750, one was fined £650, eight were fined £500, with the reminder being fined smaller sums.
The BBC has also learned that in 2014-15, 144 people were taken to court, 50 convicted and 27 fined.
The 2014-15 figures were lower than each of the previous two years, with 41 parents fined in 2012-13 and 60 in 2013-14.
In England, a father has lost his legal challenge against a fine for taking his daughter on an unauthorised term-time holiday.
The Supreme Court ruled against Jon Platt, who had won earlier legal battles against a £120 fine in a case brought by the Isle of Wight council.
By law, parents are required to ensure that children aged between four and 16 receive a full-time education.
If they do not, schools and the education authority intervene.
Normally, if a pupil's attendance at school drops below 85% of days over a period of time, this triggers follow-up action.
Initially, this can involve a parental visit from an education welfare officer, and there is usually a long process before parents are prosecuted.
