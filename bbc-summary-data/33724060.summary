[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Daylen Brickley, a baby from the US state of New Hampshire, is the proud owner of a lifetime permit to hunt and fish - the first licence holder under a new program.

His fishing licence is valid, but he will need to complete a hunter safety course before receiving that permit.
His mother, Erica Brickley, is not concerned about his future training.
The whole family was raised around hunting and fishing, "so I figure he'll kind of get in the swing of things".
"It was only natural to kind of keep it going," she told the New Hampshire Union Leader.
On Tuesday officials began offering The Newborn Lifetime Combination Hunting and Fishing License to residents under one year old. Daylen is six months old.
Lifetime permits are available to adults as well, but for a higher price.
The only negative feedback the department has received so far is from parents of toddlers who are slightly too old to apply for the less expensive lifetime permit, according to Evan Mulholland, an official with New Hampshire Fish and Game.
He said the programme was created to reduce obstacles to young hunters as they are introduced to the activity.
