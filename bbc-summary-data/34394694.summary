[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pro12: Ulster 48-7 Benetton Treviso

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster ran in seven tries as they romped to an emphatic win over Treviso in the Pro12 game at Kingspan Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dan Tuohy, Sean Reidy and Paul Marshall all touched down before Craig Gilroy secured the bonus point before half-time with a fine solo effort.
A Sam Christie try reduced Treviso's deficit but Peter Browne, Gilroy and Lewis Stevenson then crossed the line to ensure a convincing scoreline.
Ireland wing Andrew Trimble made a record 190th appearance for Ulster.
The Irish province were determined to bounce back from a disappointing defeat away to the Scarlets three weeks ago and took only seven minutes to get the scoreboard rolling as lock Tuohy stretched over for a try, Stuart McCloskey converting.
McCloskey knocked over a penalty, before Reidy rumbled over following a good drive by the forwards after Robbie Diack won possession at the lineout. McCloskey again added the additional two points.

The visitors suffered a double setback when tighthead prop Rupert Harden and number eight Robert Barbieri were sin-binned within two minutes either side of the half hour.
Ulster made good use of their numerical advantage when Marshall picked the ball up from a scrum and darted over after a trademark jinking run.
Gilroy then produced a contender for try of the season when he ran from inside his own half and showed devastating pace to weave his way through the Italian side's defence and touch down.
After the break, slack play by Ulster allowed Chris Smylie to offload the ball to half-back partner Christie, who finished impressively, Jayden Hayward converting.
Second row Browne barged over from a couple of yards out for his team's fifth try and McCloskey's successful conversion put 27 points between the sides.
Gilroy grabbed his second, diving over in the corner after a fine passing move involving Roger Wilson and McCloskey. Peter Nelson's conversion bounced off the upright and over the posts.
Stevenson got in on the act by scoring his first Ulster try with three minutes remaining, touching the ball down after a driving maul, Nelson adding the extras.
