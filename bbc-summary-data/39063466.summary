Ronaldsway Airport has been closed due to a plane not being able to taxi off the runway following its unsuccessful attempt to fly to Belfast.
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company cancelled the 08:45 GMT Douglas to Heysham ferry and the 14:15 return.
The Manx Met Office said strong winds were expected to hit the island throughout the day.
Director of Ports Ann Reynolds said the plane had been unable to land in Belfast and had returned to the island, and that all passengers on board had been "returned to the airport by bus".
She added that the pilot landed safely but decided the winds were too strong to taxi back to the airport.
Citywing tweeted that all flights to and from the island were "cancelled for today" and the airport said it would remain closed until 13:00.
A spokesman for the ferry company said the 19:45 service was expected to depart as scheduled.
The strong winds have also brought trees and power cables down across the Isle of Man affecting motorists.
Isle of Man Constabulary have shared pictures on social media of fallen trees and damage to the roof of the power station in Douglas.
A police spokesman said the south of the island was "worst affected".
"Trees are coming down all over the island, so please do not travel - if you have to travel, keep journeys to a minimum," he said.
The Isle of Man Met Office has issued an amber weather warning and also warned of heavy rainfall at times throughout the day.
