Resuming on 91, Aneurin Donald fell two runs short of his maiden first-class century as the visitors slumped from 338-4 overnight to 433 all out.
Will Tavare and Gareth Roderick fell cheaply, but Dent put on 137 for the third wicket with Hamish Marshall (58).
The 24-year-old remained unbeaten on 102 when bad light caused an early end to play with the hosts on 243-3.
Marshall's patient knock saw him surpass 1,000 runs across all competitions this season, before he was caught behind off Michael Hogan.
But Dent safely saw out the final few overs alongside Benny Howell, who made 40 not out from 50 balls to push Gloucestershire towards a second batting bonus point.
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Sport Wales:
"I thought we batted exceptionally well as a unit, most of our batters showed very good form and it's a pity Aneurin Donald couldn't get his hundred, I thought he played really well.
"On a wicket that didn't offer a lot of assistance to the bowlers we didn't quite hit our straps and we weren't stringing enough balls together in the same area to create some pressure.
"From the mental challenge point of view, it's potentially one of the biggest games of the season - a lot of times I've been in these situations, you just hope and pray the game flies by."
