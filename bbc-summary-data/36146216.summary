County Championship: Kumar Sangakkara makes 71 as Surrey draw with Somerset

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kumar Sangakkara continued his excellent form with an innings of 71 for Surrey, before Somerset held out to secure a draw at The Oval.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sangakkara helped Surrey to 181-8 in their second innings before declaring.
Openers Marcus Trescothick and Tom Abell fell cheaply as Somerset were set 292 to win from 42 overs.
Zafar Ansari took three wickets to leave the visitors on 62-4, but James Hildreth's unbeaten 40 helped his side to 122-4 at stumps.
Sangakarra's innings saw him surpass 50 for the third time in four innings this season, having already scored 171 in the first innings.
Ansari, making his return from a dislocated thumb suffered at the end of last season, appeared to have given Surrey the chance of an unlikely victory when he removed Trescothick, Chris Rogers and Roelof van der Merwe.
Hildreth and Peter Trego (34 not out) steadied the innings, with the captains shaking hands on a draw with six scheduled overs remaining.
Surrey, last season's Division Two champions, are bottom of the top-flight table after two games, three points behind seventh-placed Somerset.
Surrey captain Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London:
"The fact that we managed to get to the last session and at least be trying for the points in a positive manner is good.
"You can't change the weather and that time taken out of the game has made a lot harder for us to force a result.
"We're very lucky at the moment, we have bowlers for all occasions. We have two spinners that go one in and one away from the bat, we have seamers that are all different.
"The batting unit played very well, the guys that got starts generally went on. Kumar's still the best player in the world in my eyes - I can't see anyone lacing his boots at the moment."
