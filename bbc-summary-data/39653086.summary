James Mackie, 30, Gordon Ellis, 24, Derek Finlay, 31, and Scott Smith, 23, stole Â£2,500 during the robbery in Kirkcaldy in January 2015.
They pointed a gun at the heads of Dwayne Kinner and his cousin Nicholas Roberts. They were also armed with a crowbar and a machete.
The four men admitted the raid when they appeared in court last month.
Mackie and Finlay were both jailed for six and a half years while Ellis and Smith were each jailed for four years.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard the victims believed they were going to be shot after the gun was pointed at their heads and one of the men threatened to cut their fingers off.
A judge told the robbers: "You have pled guilty to an extremely serious offence.
"In a premeditated and carefully planned enterprise, with a chosen victim, you armed yourself with weapons, some potentially lethal."
Michael O'Grady QC said: "The idea that anyone should suffer such terror in their own home is utterly beyond the pale."
Among the items taken in the raid was a mobile phone on which Mr Kinner had installed a tracking app in case it was lost or stolen.
Hours later he arrived at Kirkcaldy police station with a tablet containing a screenshot showing that in the early hours of 8 January his Sony Experia phone was at a house in Stewart Street, in Dysart.
When officers attended at the address Finlay told them: "There's no a firearm but I've got a phone." They also recovered computers, games, a sound bar and Â£710.
Mr Kinner, who was 25 at the time, later identified the computer equipment and games as his belongings taken in the robbery.
The gun, which was discovered to be an air pistol, was later found behind a kickboard in a kitchen at a house in Glenrothes which Finlay had previously had access to.
