While thousands of local council candidates are hitting the campaign trial, one corner of north Wales has failed to tempt anyone to step forward.

Gwynedd council says the ward of Bryncrug/Llanfihangel in Meirionnydd has attracted no nominations.
It follows a decision by the sitting independent councillor Arwel Pierce to stand down from the authority.
The council said a by-election for the vacancy would have to be held some time after the elections on 3 May.
Mr Pierce was Gwynedd council's portfolio leader for highways and consultancy.
A Gwynedd council spokesperson said after nominations closed on Wednesday: "We can confirm that no candidates have been nominated for the Bryncrug/Llanfihangel ward.
"In accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983, a by-election to fill the vacancy will be held in due course."
The ward covers a largely rural area on the south western edge of Snowdonia, including the villages of Bryncrug, near Tywyn, and Llanfihangel-y-Pennant in the foothills of Cadair Idris.
