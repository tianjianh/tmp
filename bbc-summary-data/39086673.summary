Winger Jefferson Montero is back in full training but will not feature.
Jeff Hendrick returns for Burnley after completing a three-game ban but striker Ashley Barnes is suspended after being sent off against Hull.
Steven Defour and Johann Berg Gudmundsson remain sidelined with respective hamstring and knee injuries.
John Roder: "Swansea's win at Turf Moor on the opening day in August was one of only three Premier League victories the Swans would manage before the New Year, while it was a rare home defeat for the Clarets.
"Burnley started a run of four consecutive away matches with a draw at Hull last weekend to earn only their second point on their travels this season.
"Swansea, transformed under Paul Clement, are entering a crucial set of fixtures. After Burnley, they play fellow strugglers Hull, Bournemouth and Middlesbrough.
"This match could be another tight affair. I wouldn't be too surprised if a single goal settles it, yet again."

Swansea City head coach Paul Clement: "We are all very aware of the run we have coming now with the three games in March and Middlesbrough at the start of April.
"We have come off the back end of a difficult run of games and picked up a good amount of points against teams in and around us.
"That is what we are going to have to do on Saturday. We're very aware that this a crucial period for us, this run of four games, but we are really only focusing on getting a result against Burnley."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche on Andre Gray and Michael Keane being linked to other clubs: "It's a very different business from 10 years ago. I heard another manager the other day speak completely openly about someone else's player. I couldn't believe what I was hearing."
"The way it is now, it's just people throwing names around willy-nilly about who they want, who they can get, what their contract situation is.
"It's not a private business any more. You have to adapt to it and be flexible within it. It's all you can do."
Burnley created some chances against Hull but Swansea are much improved at the back these days.
Eventually, at some point, Burnley will end their long wait for an away win, but I don't see it happening in Wales.
