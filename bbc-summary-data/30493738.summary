[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Roberts, 32, was found dead at his home in Winlaton, Gateshead, on 16 December 2012. Nine people have been arrested and released without charge.
Mr Roberts, a football badge seller, had been facing an abduction charge.
Northumbria Police have spoken to more than 5,000 people and said they would not stop looking for those responsible.
As part of the two-year investigation, officers have also made about 3,000 hour-to-house inquiries.
Mr Roberts was found dead at his home in Park Terrace. He had suffered head injuries.
Det Supt Roger Ford said; "This is still very much an active enquiry and we are continuing to follow new leads and are re-examining evidence every day.
"We want to hear from anyone with any information, even after two years, and would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
In a statement, the Roberts family said: "We miss John, and at this time of the year it's particularly difficult for the family.
"All we want is to see justice be done.
"I'd ask that if anyone has any information, even after two years, to come forward and speak up."
