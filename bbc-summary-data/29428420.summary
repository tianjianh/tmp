Port Vale have signed teenage Newcastle United defender Remie Streete on loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old centre-half becomes the third defensive signing made by interim manager Rob Page inside a fortnight.
Bournemouth loan man Stephane Zubar made his Vale debut in Tuesday night's 3-2 Johnstone's Paint trophy defeat, while West Bromwich Albion youngster Reiss Greenidge is yet to figure.
Vale, who are yet to keep a clean sheet this season, are likely to give Streete his debut on Saturday against Yeovil.
Streete, who has signed for an initial month, has been watched by Page and chairman Norman Smurthwaite several times in recent weeks for Newcastle's under-21s.
