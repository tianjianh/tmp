Childcare 'key to reducing inequality'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Improved childcare has been identified as the single policy that could do most to reduce income inequality, in research at Heriot-Watt University.

That could be allied to closing the gap between women's and men's pay, and finding ways to help families remain together.
Raising the minimum wage and linking benefits to inflation is seen as effective.
A boost to the regions and nations of Britain would also have an impact.
This would, according to the research, spread prosperity more evenly around the UK.
However, the Edinburgh research found that increases in part-time pay, encouragement to take up unclaimed benefits, and efforts to increase housing supply had less effect on inequality.
The research helps explain ways to reduce the inequality gaps highlighted in a week-long series of reports for BBC Scotland news.
They show that Scotland's income inequality is not as extreme as portrayed in some political debate.  Much of Britain's inequality comes from the boost to earnings and wealth for the most prosperous 1%, concentrated in London and south-east England.
By international standards, income inequality in Scotland is mid-range.
However, there remain wide differences between the earning power of those at the high earning end of the scale and those at the bottom.
The most recent figures show the top 1% of earners received more than 9% of the nation's total pay packet.
Economists avoid the extremes of earning to measure inequality, and often compare the person whose income was just ahead of the lowest-earning 10% of Scots with the person whose income was just below the top earning 10% of Scots.
The 2014-15 statistics show that came to Â£264 and Â£881 per week.
The findings of the Heriot-Watt research point to support for women at the lower-paid end of the workforce being particularly effective in addressing inequality. That reflects the fact that poor households are often female-headed.
Figures issued last month showed the pay gap for median hourly earnings has narrowed from 7.7% in 2015 to 6.2%. The gap for the UK as a whole, at 9.4%, was wider, and the narrowing much slower since 2015.
The Heriot-Watt research was led by Prof Glen Bramley.
He said: "The report looks at around 40 individual policy or contextual scenarios as well as combined packages. Most of these make some difference, but in quite a number of cases this is small or ambiguous in terms of effects on different poverty outcomes.
"A smaller number of policies make a sizeable difference. There is no single magic bullet, and to make large inroads into poverty would require concerted action on a number of fronts."
Improved access to more affordable housing was found to have unexpected and sometimes negative effects, as it can encourage people on the margins of poverty to move out of homes shared with other family members - that way tipping the new householder into poverty.
Encouragement for people to take up benefits was found to be ineffective because many of those who are not taking up benefits are not the ones who need them most.
The effect of an increase in part-time pay would often reach households where the part-time worker is bringing in the second income, putting the household into a higher income bracket.
Childcare was found to have the biggest impact of any single policy because it would enable parents to work or to work longer hours. That is apart from the impact that quality childcare can have on helping children develop.
"A further positive element would be measures - counselling, mediation, mental health, substance treatment, offender rehabilitation - which led to a reduced rate of relationship breakdown," according to Prof Bramley.
Jim McCormick, Scottish director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and an expert in studying poverty, told the BBC of his priorities for reducing income inequality: "Short term, it's about attending to the pay and conditions people face when they're in low paid, casual and temporary work, we need to stack the odds in their favour so that people can progress.
"Longer term, the big challenge for inequality is to reduce the gender pay gap, which is about pay, hours, childcare - and within that, to attend to inequalities like ethnicity and disability, because we could reduce poverty, but still have gaping inequalities for new Scots, who have newly arrived, and those with disabilities, who have poor employment prospects."
Ahead of the BBC series Unequal Scotland?, a spokeswoman for the Scottish government said Westminster policies on welfare cuts were having a "direct and devastating impact on Scotland".
"Increasing income and protecting family budgets is a key element of lifting people out of poverty and is a priority for the Scottish Government. We are using the powers of the Scottish Parliament to create a fairer Scotland for everyone, and the devolution of social security powers is a significant step forward in enabling Scotland to chart a different course.
"We are working across the board to ensure people are bringing home more money, through increasing the number of employers paying the living wage, working towards closing the gender pay gap and ensuring we have a strong and inclusive labour market.
"We are also helping to protect low income households, through the likes of the council tax reduction scheme and mitigating the bedroom tax, as well as working towards our target of 50,000 affordable homes in the lifetime of this parliament."
