As part of BBC One's Sport Relief coverage on 21 March, the sketch will see Beckham head to Peckham to join the duo in a greasy spoon cafe.
Sir David and Lyndhurst last played the wheeler-dealing Trotter brothers in a Christmas special in 2003.
Sport Relief runs between 21-23 March.
Beckham has taken part in several sketches for the charity over the years, including cuddling up in bed and sharing a bath with actor James Corden in 2012.
The brief return of Only Fools and Horses has been eagerly awaited by fans of the show, which ran from 1981.
It was regularly voted Britain's best sitcom and the 1996 Christmas special Time On Our Hands, in which Del Boy came good on his ambition to turn the Peckham brothers into millionaires, was watched by more than 24 million people.
This year's Sport Relief television coverage will come live from the Olympic Park with presenters including Gary Lineker, Gaby Logan, Claudia Winkleman, Jack Whitehall and Clare Balding.
The evening will also feature a Strictly Come Dancing special, with four Paralympians and their professional dance partners taking on a group dance challenge in the hope of taking home a Sport Relief glitter ball trophy.
Celebrity fundraisers for 2014 include Davina McCall, who will attempt to get herself from London to Edinburgh in a week - by cycling, running and swimming Windermere.
Little Mix are recording this year's Sport Relief single, a cover of Cameo's Word Up, and have just returned from a trip to Liberia with the charity.
"It was shocking to see how tough people's lives are in the slums there," said the band's Leigh-Anne Pinnock.
"Knowing how the money raised really does help change lives was inspiring and that's why I hope everyone gets involved, signs up to the Games and does their bit this year."
The public will be able to take part in a number of events over the weekend, choosing to run, swim or cycle at the Sport Relief Games.
Olympic cycling champion Victoria Pendleton, singer Michael Ball and actress Samantha Bond are among the celebrities who have been competing in The Great Sport Relief Bake Off this month.
A new show for this year, Sport Relief's Top Dog, will launch on BBC Two in February, featuring celebrity team captains and members of the public competing to see their pet crowned the winner.
