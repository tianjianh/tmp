The 30-year-old tweeted she had "already started testing out ideas" for the show on 1 February in Arizona.
The show is the most-watched musical event of the year, with a record 115 million viewers in the US watching this year's half-time show.
Perry joins the likes of Bruno Mars, Beyonce and Madonna who have previously performed.
The announcement of Perry's upcoming performance was made at half-time during the Cowboys-Giants game on Sunday night.
It was accompanied by a video featuring the singer at a "half-time show testing facility" apparently trying out ideas for her show.
It includes a glitter-filled stadium, unicorns, giant sharks breathing fire, kittens and the suggestion Perry could be wrapped in bacon.
Perry's performance will be the NFL's fourth consecutive show to include younger acts after previous performers Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones, and The Who.
Paparazzi problems
Perry is currently on her Prismatic world tour in Australia.
On the Friday, the singer blasted Australian paparazzi, calling them "perverted and disgusting".
She tweeted: "Your paparazzi have no respect, no integrity, no character, no humanity."
"I was stalked by many grown men today as I tried to take a quiet walk to the beach. These men would not stop as I pleaded over and over to let me have my space.
"This is perverted and disgusting behaviour that should never be tolerated.
The singer then posted images of some of the photographers and singled out notorious Australian paparazzo Jamie Fawcett.
