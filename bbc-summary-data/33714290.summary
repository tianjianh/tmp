Ms Sturgeon visited the site as part of the her trade mission to east Asia.
The first minister officially opened the centre at the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park centre.
It is managed by a group based at Edinburgh University and will work on promoting sustainable construction, energy efficiency and air quality.
Ms Sturgeon said: "This is the first education institution in the world to establish a low-carbon research and innovation centre in another country and I am delighted that it is a Scottish university that is leading the way and setting the standard.
"Like the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, the University of Edinburgh has a world-class reputation and I'm confident that this relationship will help provide Scottish companies with a route into Hong Kong and, through its strong links with China, act as a gateway into China."
The centre, led by the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation (ECCI), will employ five staff recruited from Scotland and Hong Kong.
The ECCI is based at High School Yards, formerly Edinburgh's Old High School, which underwent a Â£10.5m refurbishment to become one of the UK's most energy efficient historic buildings.
Edinburgh University principal Prof Sir Timothy O'Shea said: "This is a great example of a collaborative working relationship between educational institutions and business on a global scale.
"The new carbon innovation centre will help foster productive working practices between policy, community and business leaders in order to support and deliver workable solutions for a low carbon future."
