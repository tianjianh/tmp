Warning of NHS winter beds 'struggle'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The NHS in England will struggle this winter without more beds in care homes and other community settings to ease hospital pressures, researchers say.

The Nuffield Trust said that last winter a small proportion of patients - just 3.6% - had taken up more than a third of hospital beds.
The research group said help targeted at this group - most of them frail and elderly - could have a big impact.
A spokesman for NHS England said moves were being made to improve the system.
The warning by the Nuffield Trust, which publishes research on health issues and its analysis of policy, comes as NHS England prepares to publish performance data for October.
The figures for September showed hospitals had been missing key targets for cancer care, A&E waiting times, ambulance response times and diagnostic tests.
Hospitals in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also struggling with many of these measures.

The Nuffield Trust analysis includes a review of how hospitals responded to last winter, which was the worst in England in terms of performance for a decade.
It found hospitals had spent more than £250m of their emergency £700m pot on opening up extra beds to cope with demand.
But it said despite the investment, a small number of patients had been responsible for using up a third of the bed capacity over the winter months.
This was because they spent long periods in hospital or were readmitted on a regular basis.
The analysis highlighted the squeeze on council budgets that had caused them to ration care services, which are seen as vital for keeping people out of hospital and making sure they can be discharged safely when they are admitted.
The report said investing in intermediate care beds could provide a solution - allowing hospitals to discharge the frailest patients into a safe environment until they have recovered or until care packages could be arranged in their own home, or permanent places found in care homes.
This has been done in Glasgow, where the local council and NHS have worked together over the past year to ensure care home beds have been freed up for hospital patients to move into temporarily.
Nuffield Trust chief executive Nigel Edwards predicted that this winter hospitals were going to find it "even more difficult to cope" unless the health service invested in intermediate care beds to get patients out of hospital.
A spokesman for NHS England said: "It's important patients who are well enough to leave hospital can do so at the earliest opportunity and are treated with dignity and compassion."
Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, backed the findings.
"Hospitals under pressure has become the status quo, and this winter is unlikely to be any different.
"The solution often clearly lies outside of the walls of our hospitals and into communities."
