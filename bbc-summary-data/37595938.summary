[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Savanaca Kokoibulileka, known as Tu, collapsed while playing for Rutland-based club Oakham RFC in a game against West Bridgford on 24 September.
The 38-year-old Fijian had just scored a try when he collapsed. He died later in hospital.
A minute's silence was observed before Oakham's match against Stamford on Saturday afternoon.
Steve Knight, Oakham's membership secretary, said he had been a great role model to the younger players.
He told BBC Radio Leicester: "It happened right in front of the whole crowd and players on the pitch.
"It came completely out of the blue, Tu had just scored a try, came back to take the restart and he collapsed.
"He was a very jovial friendly chap, always smiling and always laughing.
"He was a great inspiration particularly to the younger players, they looked up to him and respected him."
A Fijian farewell is due to be sung by the club's choir following the game.
Mr Kokoibulileka was a former British soldier and was married with four children, according to the Stamford Mercury.
His cause of death has not yet been revealed.
About Â£10,000 has been raised so far for Mr Kokoibulileka's family following his death.
David Smiter, who started the Just Giving page, said he was "one of the greatest men I have ever known".
