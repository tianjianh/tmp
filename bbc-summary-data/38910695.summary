[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS nurse who died after he set himself alight outside Kensington Palace "killed himself while the balance of his mind was disturbed".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An inquest into Amin Abdullah's death heard he died in February last year after losing his job at Charing Cross hospital.
The coroner said he had been "suffering from depression following a disciplinary matter at work."
The 41-year-old died from burns and the "inhalation of fire and fumes."
As she delivered her verdict, coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe, at Westminster Coroner's Court, extended her "very deepest condolences" to Mr Abdullah's partner of 12 years, Terry Skitmore.
Dr Radcliffe said the Malaysian-born nurse became suicidal after he was dismissed from the job he loved.
The three-day inquest heard how problems began when Mr Abdullah had written a letter for a colleague to assist in her response to a complaint which had been made by a patient.
He had also signed a petition in support of her, resulting in him becoming embroiled in the issue, and disciplinary proceedings being taken against him in September 2015.
Following a disciplinary hearing on 16 December, the inquest heard how during the middle of his shift on 21 December he was informed he was "dismissed and needed to leave the hospital".
"He said he felt his whole life was over and ruined, there was nothing else in his life and nothing to live for," Dr Radcliffe said.
She added: "I am unable to identify an action that would have prevented this death.
"He did exactly what he said he was going to do. He was clearly intelligent enough to deflect questions and made it difficult to accurately assess the risk he posed.
"Tragically, it is not an uncommon problem."
