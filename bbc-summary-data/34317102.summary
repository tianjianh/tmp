[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Mercia Police said a post-mortem carried out on 16 September had not established the cause of his death.
Investigators are examining dental records to work out his identity. The skull was found on 20 August by junction four of the M54 at Shifnal.
Tests determined the remains had been at the scene for at least two years.
The skull was found by maintenance workers at the eastbound exit slip road of the motorway.
Police are being helped by the National Crime Agency, the UK Missing Persons Database and forensic anthropologists to identify the person, the force said.
A police search by the slip road ended on 10 September.
