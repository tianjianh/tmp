Carpet python found dumped on doorstep in Lanarkshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An animal charity is appealing for help in tracing the owner of a 7ft-long snake that was dumped in a box on a doorstep in North Lanarkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish SPCA said the carpet python was found outside a home in Imperial Drive, Airdrie, on Monday.
The snake had been well cared for and was dumped outside the home of someone who keeps reptiles.
Staff at the charity's rescue centre have named the snake Kaa and will care for it until a new home is found.
Senior Inspector Bill Little said: "Kaa is in good condition so he seems to have been well cared for until now. However, we are keen to trace the person responsible for leaving him there as abandoning an animal is an offence.
"The finder has reptiles of his own so we think that is why someone chose to dump Kaa on this particular doorstep.
"But leaving him in this way was very cruel as snakes need heat to survive and he would have soon perished had he not been found."
Inspector Little added: "If anyone recognises Kaa or knows of someone in the area who recently owned a large carpet python and no longer has one, please contact our animal helpline.
"We'll continue to care for Kaa until we can find him a suitable new home."
