An off-licence in Edinburgh has been robbed for the second time in two days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The High Spirits store in Slateford Road was targeted at 20:40 on Saturday, and then at about 21:45 on Monday.
Police said they believed the two robberies were linked, and that the same person may have been responsible for both raids.
In the latest incident, the shop assistant was threatened with a knife. A three figure sum of money was stolen on both occasions.
The robber was described as being white, in his mid to late 20s, 5ft 8in, of solid build with a pale complexion and blotchy skin.
During Monday's raid, he was wearing a blue hooded top with dark blue sleeves and white bands on the arms, jeans, grey trainers and a woolly hat with a plastic bag covering the bottom of his face.
Det Con Kevin Walls, of Police Scotland, said: "This is the second time in a matter of days this store has been targeted and we are working with the staff to provide all the relevant support and crime prevention advice.
"If you can help us identify the suspect, or remember seeing anything suspicious around the premises on Monday evening, then please contact police immediately.
"In addition, we would also urge those with any further information relevant to this inquiry to get in touch."
