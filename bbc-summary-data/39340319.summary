Jason Robinson: Warrington Wolves improvement 'only a matter of time'

Warrington Wolves will bounce back from their poor start to the Super League season, says former dual code international Jason Robinson.

The Wire have lost all five of their matches this campaign and are bottom.
They reached a third Grand Final in five years last season, and Robinson believes they will improve.
"They are under the pump, but they have got a great system and some great players and it's only a matter of time before they turn it around," he said.
Warrington were beaten 22-8 by newly-promoted Leigh on Thursday to make it five successive defeats - just three fewer than they suffered in their 30 Super League matches in 2016.
But ex-Wigan and Great Britain winger Robinson, who played in Super League's first Grand Final in 1998, thinks Warrington can use their current situation to their advantage.
The 42-year-old told BBC Radio Manchester: "Sometimes you need that as a team - you need to go through a few harder times to bring everybody together, to make them realise 'we're good players, but we've got to be performing.'
"Yes, they will be disappointed that they are bottom of the league, but it's only a matter of time. It just shows the competitiveness of Super League this year."
