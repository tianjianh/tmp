Keith Davies, a former Carmarthenshire councillor, was elected to the assembly in 2011.
Mr Davies, 75, said it had been "a privilege to represent my home constituency" in a statement released on Friday.
He added: "I believe now is the right time for the next generation to have the opportunity to represent the Llanelli constituency."
He won the Llanelli seat for Labour by just 80 votes over Plaid Cymru in 2011.
Responding to the announcement, First Minister Carwyn Jones, said: "His breadth of knowledge and experience will be sorely missed, not just in the Labour group of AMs, but in the National Assembly more generally.
"I wish Keith all the best for his health and his future."
Mr Davies suffered a serious illness in 2012, when he was treated for a blood clot on the brain.
In May 2012, an official report found Mr Davies had brought the assembly into disrepute following a late-night drunken row at a Cardiff hotel, for which he apologised.
