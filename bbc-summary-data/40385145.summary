England will have seven fighters in Saturday's finals at the European Boxing Championships in Ukraine.

Peter McGrail, Luke McCormack, Cheavon Clarke, Pat McCormack, Niall Farrell, Frazer Clarke and Galal Yafai all won their semi-finals.
But compatriot Calum French lost his lightweight bout against home boxer Iiuri Shestak on a split decision.
By reaching the semi-finals, the eight Englishmen had guaranteed European medals, the nation's best ever total.
Rio Olympian Yafai (light-flyweight) was the first to progress to the final, beating Spain's Samuel Carmona Heredia by split decision.
He will now face defending champion Vasilii Egorov of Russia for gold.
McGrail dominated Spain's Jose Quiles Brotons in a points win at bantamweight before Luke McCormack scored a narrow points win over London 2012 Olympic bronze medallist Evaldas Patrauskas in the light-welterweight category.
Rookie heavyweight Cheavon Clarke then outpointed Dutch third seed Roy Korving to finish off the morning session.
He will have to beat Olympic champion Evgeny Tishchenko of Russia to claim gold.
Farrell continued England's dominance as he overcame Ireland's Brendan Irvine at flyweight, before Pat McCormack - Luke's twin brother - beat Ievgenii Barabanov at welterweight.
Super-heavyweight Frazer Clarke finished an impressive day for English boxing with a split-decision victory over France's Djamili Aboudou-Moindze in his first international tournament.
England have now bettered their total of six medals at the 2015 European Championships in Bulgaria, where the team contested five finals and won six medals in total.
This England set-up features many fighters from the new GB Boxing squad, which has changed significantly in preparation for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics as many athletes who competed at Rio 2016 have either turned professional or are set to do so.
