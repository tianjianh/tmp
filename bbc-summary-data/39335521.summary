Everton loanee McAleny bagged his second hat-trick of the season for the U's as the hosts dominated throughout.
Marvin Johnson's finish and Joe Rothwell's dink came before McAleny strikes either side of the break.
James Vaughan headed a consolation for Bury on the hour before McAleny's third goal came deep into injury time.
Oxford, who head to Wembley on Sunday to face Coventry City in the EFL Trophy final, move to within four points of the play-offs with six games remaining.
Bury are just four points above the relegation places in 17th with five games still to play.
