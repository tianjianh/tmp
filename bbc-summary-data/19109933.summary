St Dennis incinerator work set to start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work is set to begin at the site of a Â£117m waste-to-energy incinerator in Cornwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After years of legal action the work, which includes setting up noise monitoring stations for the St Dennis incinerator, starts on Monday.
A group opposing the incinerator were refused permission to appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision to reinstate the planning permission.
The plant was given final clearance at the Court of Appeal in March.
The St Dennis branch of Cornwall Waste Forum continues to challenge the ruling which upheld the government's decision to grant planning permission.
The Supreme Court refused an application for permission to appeal in July.
Cornwall produces about 300,000 tonnes of waste a year and, according to the County Council, the region will run out of landfill space by 2014.
The incinerator will be built by Sita UK, which signed a 30-year-contract in 2006 to handle Cornwall's waste.
