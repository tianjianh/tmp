Restrictions on how fans attend Wrexham-Chester derby clashes could be lifted in the future, north Wales' police and crime commissioner has said.

North Wales and Cheshire police forces have previously said restrictions could be reviewed if there was no trouble at the two games this season.
Wrexham fans will be ferried to the "bubble match" at Chester on Saturday via designated transport only.
September's 0-0 game at Wrexham finished without incident.
"Bubble matches" were introduced five years ago to curb trouble by some fans.
"If things go well again then hopefully the two forces will look again at this bubble status and lift it which would be great news for both clubs and fans," said commissioner Arfon Jones, a Wrexham season ticket holder.
Cheshire Police Supt Luke McDonnell said the ambition of all concerned was to get to a "position where the current policing arrangements are no longer necessary".
"Following this match, an assessment will be made in consultation between ourselves, North Wales Police, Chester FC and Wrexham AFC, along with the supporters groups from both clubs," he said.
"A decision will then be made on how this fixture is to be policed moving forward in a way that maximises the safety to all those attending the fixtures, as well as the wider community.
"In the meantime, we look forward to another competitive match between the two teams, and good-natured behaviour from all those attending."
