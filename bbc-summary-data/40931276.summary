Maikel Kieftenbeld: Birmingham City win appeal against midfielder's sending off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City have won their appeal against Maikel Kieftenbeld's red card in Saturday's win over Bristol City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old Dutch midfielder was sent off in the 80th minute of Blues' 2-1 win for a tackle on Callum O'Dowda.
Speaking after the game Birmingham manager Harry Redknapp called the decision "diabolical" and "terrible".
Kieftenbeld, who would have faced a three-match suspension, will now be available to feature in Tuesday's game with Bolton.
