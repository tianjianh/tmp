[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hector Duff, 96, has been honoured for his outstanding contribution to the people of Douglas and the wider community.
Councillor Raina Chatel will also receive the honour becoming the first woman to do so since it began in 1924.
Both will receive their awards at services at Douglas Town Hall in the new year.
Mr Duff said: "I am incredibly proud, honoured and very touched to have been chosen and delighted to be able to share this with my family."
Councillor David Ashford said he is the "perfect candidate" for the honour.
Mr Duff, who has been awarded the French Legion d'honneur for his involvement in the the D-Day landings, said: "I can still see in my mind's eye the day I landed in Normandy and it was a privilege to know my fellow servicemen.
"I shall continue to try to get people, especially the younger generation, to recognise the importance of our war memorials as a way of remembering the men and women who have died in theatres of war."
Mrs Chatel, who was elected to Douglas Council in 1985, said she was "humbled" to become the first female recipient.
