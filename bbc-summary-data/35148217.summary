Erik Lamela put the visitors in front when he stroked in a shot after Dele Alli dispossessed Craig Cathcart.
Odion Ighalo equalised when his determination helped him beat Eric Dier and poke home.
Nathan Ake was sent off for a challenge on Lamela before Son scored with a deft flick from Kieran Trippier's cross.

Tottenham had struggled to make the most of their numerical advantage following Ake's dismissal on 63 minutes.

Indeed Watford looked the more likely goalscorers in the closing stages as they earned a succession of corners and could have taken the lead themselves.
Ben Watson's corner almost crept in before keeper Hugo Lloris fended the ball away, with goalline technology showing the ball was only inches away from going in.
Moments later, Spurs scored the winner. Trippier's crosses from the right had caused the hosts problems throughout and it was his delivery that led to Son's clincher.
There was a suggestion of offside in the build-up to the goal, but referee Anthony Taylor allowed it to stand.
Ake caught Lamela studs first and high on the leg as he attempted to get to a bouncing ball.
Taylor took his time before producing his red card to the apparent bemusement of the Watford left-back and the home dugout.
"My view was amazing but I don't like to talk about the referees. It is football," said Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores.
"It is difficult," said Spurs counterpart Mauricio Pochettino. "From my point of view, it was an 'orange' or red - but more than yellow."
Apart from a meeting between two of the league's form teams, the match at Vicarage Road also saw strikers Ighalo and Harry Kane on the same pitch.
Ighalo showed strength and determination in scoring a goal that took him to 14 for the season and 30 in 2015.
Chances were infrequent for Kane and the closest he came was when a brave near-post header went wide.
He was more of a presence than his opposite number, though, was involved in more of the build-up play and also helped out defensively.
Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores: "I feel sorry because we had possibility to draw and it was painful how we lost the match.

"But I am really proud of my players. They fight a lot, have an amazing soul. The line between winning and losing is very small."
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino on whether Spurs can win the title: "In football a lot can happen. The most important thing is we believe - we have a strong squad to squad to fight for it."
He added: "The victory is very important for us, we worked hard to try and win and are happy because Watford are a difficult team and beat Liverpool recently.
"The condition of the pitch made it difficult to play how we usually play but we showed great maturity.  We need to feel proud for the players. It was a great effort after only playing 48 hours ago."
Watford have another testing game at home when they welcome Manchester City to Vicarage Road on 2 January, while Tottenham face a trip to Everton a day later.
