A two-minute silence was observed to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month when the hostilities of 1914-18 formally ended.
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of WW1.
Wreaths were laid at the war memorial at Edinburgh's Waverley Station while a plaque was unveiled at Glasgow's Central Station.
A number of other ceremonies took place to remember those who died during WW1 and all conflicts since.
In Dundee, a two-minute silence was held at City Square.
Lord Provost Bob Duncan was joined by veterans, councillors, local authority officers and civic guests for a short ceremony on the steps of the Caird Hall.
Councillors on Dumfries and Galloway Council's economy, environment and infrastructure committee halted their meeting to mark Armistice Day.
A two-minute silence was observed during proceedings at the main council offices on English Street in Dumfries and at the war memorial outside St John's Church.
In Inverness, people gathered outside the Town House to mark the two-minute silence.
Lord Provost George Adam was at Aberdeen's war memorial at the Cowdray Hall to take part in the silence.

On Sunday, two-minute silences took place across the UK and the Commonwealth.
The Queen, political leaders and military veterans laid wreaths at the Cenotaph on Whitehall - the focal point of Remembrance Day services.
Armistice Day has been marked on 11 November every year since 1919 - a year after the Allied forces signed an agreement with the Germans that would end WW1.
After the Second World War, commemorations were adapted to honour the fallen of both conflicts, and Remembrance Sunday was established to replace Armistice Day.
From 1995, the British Legion campaigned successfully to restore the two-minute silence to 11 November as well as Remembrance Sunday.
Charity proceeds from Poppy Scotland will help to provide support for members of the armed forces and veterans.
Last year's appeal raised more than Â£2.6m in Scotland.
