Coventry made a bright start as Jodi Jones caused problems with his pace and keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen did well to keep out John Fleck's long-range drive.
Wigan raised the tempo after the interval and Grigg slotted home from Stephen Warnock's cross.
He had the chance for a second when Conor McAleny was fouled, but Reice Charles-Cook saved his penalty kick.
The victory put Wigan four points clear of Burton, and 10 points ahead of third-placed Bradford, while it also extended their unbeaten run to 20 games.
Two more victories from their five remaining matches will secure a return to the Championship, while defeat left Coventry in 13th place, 11 points outside the play-off places.

"I think the performance again was excellent against a very difficult team to play against.
"I knew they'd pose us a lot of problems and they did.
"We looked very strong, especially second half I didn't feel in any danger."
Coventry City manager Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry And Warwickshire:
"It's been the problem for the past three months really, not scoring goals.
"The grind of this league has taken its toll on us now.
"I thought we worked hard enough, the commitment was there and the endeavour was there, but we're falling a little bit short at the moment."
