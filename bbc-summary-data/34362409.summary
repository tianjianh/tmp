Sussex cricket manager Mark Robinson is "bitterly disappointed" by their relegation from Division One but adamant they can return stronger.

The Hove side suffered the drop from the top tier of the County Championship following their 100-run defeat by Yorkshire on Friday.
"It is not the end of the world and that is the key," he told BBC Sussex.
"In the winter we will be looking how every single one of us can come back bigger and better."
He added: "We are all emotional because we are passionate and care for our supporters and players.

"But we need to make sure we give ourselves space so all the decisions we make are for the good of Sussex so we can rebuild and come back stronger."
Hampshire's victory over Notts earlier on Friday meant Sussex had to avoid defeat against the champions at Headingley to remain in the top flight.
They were set a target of 309 to win but were reduced to 61-5 and were eventually bowled out for 208, a defeat which ended their five-year stay in Division One.
"We have to congratulate Yorkshire and take our hat off to Hampshire, with a great rearguard action and three wins from the last five games," Robinson added.
"We keep it in perspective. We are a good club, we are a proud club and have got some good people."
Sussex won three of their first five Championship matches in 2015, but picked up only one more victory during the remainder of the season.
Robinson says injuries to their seam bowling department - specifically James Anyon, Chris Jordan and Ajmal Shahzad - have taken their toll.
"It was pretty awful in the middle of the season," he said.
"There were times where we only had three seamers to pick from. That exposed us and we weren't really able to cope.
"There are a couple of things which we need to deal with and address. It is a time to take stock, rebuild and to go again."
