Mr Kay and his three fellow passengers were declared dead at the scene.
A statement from his parents, Stuart and Debra, and sister, Nicola, said the "countless tributes" to Mr Kay had shown he had "touched so many lives".
It added: "His infectious smile and urge to give a hug is what made him so memorable."
Thames Valley Police has formally identified one of the other victims as Brogan Warren. It is understood the other passengers were Nicoletta Tocco and Krop Jones.
