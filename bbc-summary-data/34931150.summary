Festival adviser Cedric Eloy said Jolie would provide moral support and "bring attention to the rebirth of the Cambodian film industry".
The Hollywood star is currently in Cambodia directing her latest movie.
"Cambodia's rich history, long culture and talented people mean it has a huge amount to offer," said Jolie.
She added: "I'm proud to support the Cambodia International Film Festival and Cambodia as a home for vibrant and innovative film-making."
The festival will be held in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, from 4-10 December and will screen 130 films from 34 countries.
First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers, about the Khmer Rouge, is released on Netflix next year.
The film is an adaptation of a memoir by Cambodian author and human rights activist Luong Ung's memoir of the same name, published in 2000.
It recounts Ung's personal experiences of life under the Maoist regime, a time which saw more than 1.7 million people executed, including many film-makers, writers and artists, and left Cambodia's film industry was devastated.
Unlike her latest release, By the Sea, Jolie is only directing this new venture, not starring in it too.
By the Sea, a film that has come in for much criticism from industry commentators, marks Jolie's third time behind the camera since Unbroken, in 2014 and In The Land of Blood and Honey (2011).
It is the first film in which she has co-starred with husband Brad Pitt since 2005's Mr & Mrs Smith.
The film is released in the UK on 11 December.
