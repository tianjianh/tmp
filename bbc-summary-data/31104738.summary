Ince, 23, had a loan spell with rivals Nottingham Forest earlier this season.
Rams head coach Steve McClaren said: "To bring someone of Tom's calibre in is a real coup for us."
Lingard, 22, has made one appearance for United and McClaren added: "He is an exciting talent and someone that we are looking forward to working with."
The midfielder had loan spells with Leicester, Birmingham and Brighton and his only first-team appearance for the Red Devils came against Swansea on the opening day of the season, when he was substituted with an ankle injury.
McClaren continued: "He strengthens the attacking options that we can call upon and given we've lost Jordon Ibe and Johnny Russell in the last few weeks, it was important to strengthen in that particular area of the side."
Ince, who was named Football League Young Player of the Year in 2013, began his career as a trainee at Liverpool and had a loan spell at Notts County under his father Paul Ince.
The England Under-21 international moved to Blackpool in 2011 and spent three years at Bloomfield Road, while also spending four months on loan at Crystal Palace, before a permanent move to Hull in July 2014.
"He knows what the Championship is all about and has made a real impact in the division before," said McClaren. "We hope that he can have an influence on our side for the rest of the season."
