[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Barnsley player McCourt, 22, joins the Spireites on a two-year deal.
He made 32 appearances in all competitions last season after joining Northampton on a free from Barnsley.
"He's technically a good player as well as being very aggressive and a tough tackler," Chesterfield manager Gary Caldwell said. "Jak gives us something we don't have in midfield."
