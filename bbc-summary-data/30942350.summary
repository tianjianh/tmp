Snooker bids to be included in 2020 Olympics in Tokyo

The world governing body of snooker has submitted a bid to have the sport included at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association says snooker should be accepted because of its worldwide appeal.
Chairman Jason Ferguson said: "It has been our belief for some time that we should be given our chance on the ultimate global platform for sport."
Tokyo can accept at least one new sport to its Olympic programme.
The International Olympic Committee recently changed its rules to allow new sports to enter the Games more easily to freshen up the programme.
The approved list of sports has already been agreed and any late inclusion would have to be preceded by a request from the organisers.
Ferguson added: "Snooker alone is watched by nearly half a billion people worldwide and played competitively in over 90 countries."
Baseball and softball are seen as favourites to be named for inclusion due to the sports' popularity in Japan.
The last sports to be admitted to the Olympics were golf and rugby sevens, which will be part of the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro.
