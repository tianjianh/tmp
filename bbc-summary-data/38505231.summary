Local police inspector Hemant Nimbalkar said the arrests were made after several video clips were shared online showing women being attacked by men.
Police initially played down reports of sex attacks, saying they had received no official complaints.
But after viewing CCTV police officials admitted there was "credible evidence".
The attacks took place as a crowd of 10,000 gathered in the centre of the city to see in New Year on Saturday evening.
Several women described being surrounded by mobs of men before being assaulted. One video showed two men on a motorbike attack a woman as she walked down a street.
One woman, a marketing professional who asked to be identified only as Pooja, told the BBC that she was assaulted both in the bar and as she walked to meet a friend.
Even when she formed a circle with another group of girls to try and walk to safety, "there were guys who were trying to touch here and there", she said.
"There was not a single face you could make out or who was doing it," she said, pointing out how difficult it would be to file a complaint.
"I felt helpless," she said. "Although I have hands and legs and I could abuse and slap them, I could not do anything. I didn't know who was touching me and groping me."
Karnataka State Home Minister G Parameshwara caused widespread anger when he blamed young women for "copying the Westerners, not only in their mindset, but even in their dressing".
"These kind of things do happen," he said.
National Commission for Women chief Lalitha Kumaramangalam called for Mr Parameshwara to apologise and resign.
