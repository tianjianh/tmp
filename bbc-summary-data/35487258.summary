It brings the total number of new jobs announced at the airport in the past two months to 298.
Belfast International Airport director of commercial development Brian Carlin said: "These jobs have little or no lead-in times. There's a need for them now as we prepare for a bumper year with hundreds of thousands more passengers.
"Right across the board, we're seeing welcome growth. Airlines and airports generate jobs and new business opportunities at little or no cost to the taxpayer."
