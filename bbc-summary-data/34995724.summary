Lewis, 43, succeeds Dame Kelly Holmes, who spent six years in the role.
The 2000 Olympic heptathlon champion will give "leadership and guidance" before the 2018 Commonwealth Games, to be held on Australia's Gold Coast.
"I am thrilled I have the chance to work with, and support, England's athletes and help them towards becoming a Commonwealth medallist," said Lewis.
"I understand what support is needed in order to allow athletes to prepare and compete to the best of their potential."
As well as her Olympic success in Sydney, Lewis won Commonwealth titles in 1994 and 1998.
Commonwealth Games England manages the participation and preparation of the England team.
Its chairman, Ian Metcalfe, said Lewis' role will be "vital", adding: "We're certain that her experience as an elite athlete will inspire the next generation of Team England athletes and assist CGE in supporting them."
England topped the medal table at last year's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and were third in September's Commonwealth Youth Games in Samoa.
