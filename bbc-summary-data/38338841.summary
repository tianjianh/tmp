[SN]TITLE[SN]
Acas called in over Queensferry Crossing low pay claims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An arbitration service is to be brought in following allegations that workers on the £1.4bn Queensferry Crossing project are being given low pay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The construction union Ucatt has claimed Portuguese sub-contractor Sosia Ltd paid joiners £7.67 an hour and labourers £6.32 an hour.
The industry agreement for minimum rates is £11.61 and £8.73 respectively.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown will ask Acas to work with the lead contractors, Transport Scotland and Ucatt.
Mr Brown met representatives from Ucatt and Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who has called for a pay audit of the scheme, at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday.
He said: "I advised Ucatt that I had ensured that their allegations regarding low pay had been fully investigated, with no evidence being uncovered to substantiate the allegations.
"In response, Ucatt have advised that they remained of the view that such practices had been prevalent.
"I have therefore offered to ask Acas to undertake further work in conjunction with Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC), Transport Scotland and Ucatt to examine this and related issues. Ucatt have agreed with this approach.
"It remains the responsibility of our contractor FCBC to manage matters relating to its workforce and sub-contractors. The Scottish government will continue to work together with all parties to ensure that all obligations over workers' rights, health and safety and pay are being met on the Forth Replacement Crossing project."
