The Spanish champions were 5-3 down on aggregate in the 88th minute, but scored three goals in the final seven minutes in one of the greatest European ties of all time.
We've been taking a look at some other incredible Champions League comebacks.
First leg: Napoli 3-1 Chelsea
Second leg: Chelsea 4-1 Napoli (aet)
Aggregate: Chelsea 5-4 Napoli
On the way to winning the Champions League that season, Chelsea completed this dramatic comeback. Didier Drogba, John Terry, and Frank Lampard sent the second leg to extra time, before Branislav Ivanovic netted the winner in the 105th minute.
First leg: AC Milan 4-1 Deportivo
Second leg: Deportivo 4-0 AC Milan
Aggregate: Deportivo 5-4 AC Milan
Holders AC Milan demolished Deportivo in the first leg of their 2004 encounter. However, three goals in the first half of the second leg wiped out Milan's lead. Deportivo then made it 5-4 on aggregate in the 76th minute to complete an unforgettable fight-back.
First leg: Real Madrid 4-2 Monaco
Second leg: Monaco 3-1 Real Madrid
Aggregate: Monaco 5-5 Real Madrid (Monaco go through on away goals)
Real Madrid looked certain to reach the semi-finals when club legend Raul scored in Monaco to give them a 5-2 aggregate lead. But Monaco powered back to score three times and go through on away goals.
Half time: AC Milan 3-0 Liverpool
Full time: AC Milan 3-3 Liverpool
Extra time: Liverpool win 3-2 on penalties
One of the most famous comebacks ever. Liverpool were down and out 3-0 at half-time in the their final against AC Milan... and then came three goals in six second-half minutes. They battled through a nervy extra-time before winning 3-2 on pens.
90th minute: Manchester United 0-1 Bayern Munich
Full time: Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich
It might not have the goals as other comebacks, but it certainly shares the drama. One-nil down in the 90th minute, it looked like Man United were set to lose. What followed, though, is considered the greatest comeback in United's history. Teddy Sheringham scored a 91st-minute equaliser before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer netted the winner in the final seconds of the game.
