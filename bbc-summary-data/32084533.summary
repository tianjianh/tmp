Andi Patrascu, from Preston Road, Hockley, died in hospital after a head on crash on the A38(M) Aston Expressway at about 12:30 GMT on Monday.
The 43-year-old Romanian national had been living in the UK for more than 30 years, West Midlands Police said.
Police are still investigating why the silver Rover MG was travelling against the flow of outgoing traffic.
PC Stuart Thorpe said: "It's clear the Rover MG crossed the tidal flow lane and into traffic heading away from the city, but we are still trying to understand why this happened."
Police said they are still keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened but have not yet contacted them.
Two other drivers were taken to hospital to be treated for injuries after the collision and were later discharged.
