Police officer, Det Con Heather Bickley and her sons, Oscar, 10, and six-year-old Felix, died at their home at Tyn-y-Gongl near Benllech at the end of June.
The fire  virtually destroyed the entire bungalow, and an investigation into its cause is continuing.
More than 200 mourners attended the funeral at Bangor Crematorium on Wednesday afternoon.
John Bickley, a shopfitter, gave an emotional tribute to his family during the service.
Mrs Bickley's divisional commander, North Wales Police's Chief Supt Mark Jones, also addressed the congregation.
"Of all the challenges police officers and others from emergency services face during our careers nothing prepares them for the loss of a colleague in circumstances such as this," he said.
He called the detective a "highly respected and successful" officer.
"Her love of children was enormous and this led to the final posting of her career, to the public protection unit," he added.
The service ended with the Doctor Who theme tune, and family members were driven away through a police guard of honour.
Fire crews were called to the family's home on 30 June after the blaze broke out at around midnight.
The family had been living at the bungalow in the small hamlet of Tyn-y-Gongl for the last 18 months.
The 46-year-old police officer had served with the north Wales force since 1994, and had been a member of the child protection team since 2000.
