Election 2015: UKIP manifesto at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP has launched its 76-page manifesto ahead of the general election. The full document is available online. Here are the main things you need to know.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
UKIP leader Nigel Farage introduced his party's "gold standard" manifesto "Believe in Britain" by claiming it was the only one that had been "fully costed" and independently verified by the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
In his opening remarks, he called for an "Australian-style" points system to assess all potential migrants to Britain and claimed benefits would only be paid to migrants who had been in the UK for five years and had paid their taxes.
The main policies the party says it will fight for in government, in addition to leaving the European Union, include:
Economy
The party says it believes in low taxation, enterprise and fairness. It claims economic policy and spending commitments are rooted in savings made from leaving the EU, making "reasonable cuts to the overseas aid budget", reviewing the Barnett Formula and cancelling HS2.
Immigration
UKIP says it believes immigration "is far too high" and the pressure on housing, schools, hospitals, transport networks, power and water supplies, "is far too great".
NHS
UKIP says it is "fully committed to keeping the NHS free at the point of delivery and at time of need for UK citizens". The party will spend Â£12 billion more on the NHS in England by 2020 "to make sure it stays that way".
Care for the elderly and pensions
The party claims there is "a national crisis" in elderly care, with one million hospital bed days lost each year because patients cannot be discharged. UKIP also claims raising the retirement age to 67 "will be especially tough on women".
Welfare and disability
UKIP says it is fully committed to maintaining "a strong and supportive safety net for those who fall on hard times" but without being a soft-touch on welfare.
Education and childcare
UKIP says it will prioritise teaching and learning, and bring forward improvements to primary, secondary and higher education. Childcare should be "affordable and accessible for all parents," it adds.
Housing and transport
UKIP claims there "is a dire shortage of affordable homes in Britain" and green fields "are being concreted over". On transport, the party says it does not want to "wage a tax war" on the motorist.
Energy
UKIP pledges to:
Employment and small business
UKIP claims being in the EU "is damaging job prospects for British workers", while "uncontrolled mass immigration has lowered wages".
