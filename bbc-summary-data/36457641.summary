A charity will have to cut programmes for children caught up in domestic abuse after the loss of two donors who accounted for Â£250,000.

Survive has warned the number of people it helps could drop from 1,600 in 2015 to fewer than 200.
Four of the six services the charity provides for children are currently scheduled to close on 1 July.
South Gloucestershire Council said it was in talks with the charity about funding.
Helen Chignell, Survive's children and young people's services manager, said domestic abuse "really affects children on a profound level".
"These children will have seen everything in the family home - the violence and sensing it - and it will be affecting their emotional and mental wellbeing," said Ms Chignell.
The two programmes which will continue are funded by South Gloucestershire Council.
In a statement the authority said: "We are in discussion with the charity to see what support we can offer. These discussions are at an early stage. Our current funding arrangement with them still stands."
Survive has operated in South Gloucestershire for 40 years providing three refuges, one-to-one support, information sessions and support for domestic abuse victims and work in schools.
