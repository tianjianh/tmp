Aftal Azram, 43, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, died in the crash outside the Holden Arms pub, in Haslingden, at about 2230 BST on 27 May.
His black BMW crossed onto the other side of the road and was in collision with a silver Ford Mondeo estate.
Detectives want to speak to the driver of a black hatchback who was also travelling on Grane Road at the time.
Police said the man driving was possibly overtaken by the BMW before the crash happened.
He stopped at the scene and spoke with a number of other witnesses before driving down Holcombe Road.
Sgt Mick Young, from the road policing unit, said: "If this was you then please come forward. I'm also keen to speak with any other witnesses at the scene who may have spoken with this man.
"Just to be clear, we simply think this man could provide us with important information about the circumstances of the collision."
The driver of the Mondeo, a 50-year-old man from Suffolk, was treated in hospital for a fractured collarbone after the crash.
A 44-year-old woman passenger in his car was treated for a bleed on the kidneys, and a three-year-old child, who was also in the car, was unhurt.
