Hamilton Academical 1-1 Inverness CT

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hamilton Academical surrendered a lead for the second week running as Inverness Caledonian Thistle struck late at New Douglas Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexandre D'Acol got the opener - a rebound after keeper Owain Fon Williams had kept out Ali Crawford's header.
Crawford almost doubled Accies' lead, his chip tipped over by Fon Williams.
Robbie Thomson replaced injured keeper Remi Matthews and kept out a Ross Draper header but could not stop Liam Polworth's long-range leveller.
The away team in this fixture had won the five previous meetings and perhaps more pertinently, Caley Thistle had not lost at New Douglas Park since January 2009, winning on all six of their most recent visits to Hamilton.
Although they could not preserve that record, they will be delighted to emerge from this match with a point, having looked second best for much of the game.
Accies' renowned youth academy is a gift that keeps on giving it seems and in Greg Docherty they appear to have cultivated another star-in-the-making.
Cut from a similar cloth to James McCarthy and James McArthur, Docherty is a tidy, energetic box-to-box midfielder, with an eye for a pass.
Called up for Scotland Under-21 duty this week, Docherty showed why as he and fellow academy graduate Crawford dominated the midfield, with Crawford getting beyond D'Acol to glance a header at Fon Williams before the striker's emphatic finish.
Pleasingly for player-manager Martin Canning, Scott McMann - another youth product - made his first Premiership start, filling the left-back slot that has been a problem for Accies this season.
Caley Thistle appeared to have turned a corner recently, with a fine run of four games undefeated following three losses in their opening three matches.
And they began the match well as Brad McKay had a header cleared off the line by Louis Longridge.
But they drifted out of the match, though Gary Warren did go close on two occasions.
It was not until the closing stages they really began to push Accies back and when the home side lost Matthews to injury, Draper pulled out a magnificent save from his replacement Thomson.
But Thomson could not get to Polworth's ferocious low drive deep into stoppage time, which extended Accies' winless run to four.
Hamilton player-manager Martin Canning: "For the seventh out of the eight games, I think, we've gone ahead - we've only managed to see it out once and win one game.
"It's not enough, we know that, we need to do better, to see games out. I thought again we did enough to win the game. But obviously we got hit again in injury time, which was disappointing.
"We didn't lose the goal because tactically we were unaware or were undone. Sometimes all you can say is maybe Lady Luck isn't on our side at the minute."
Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "I thought we had the better chances, their keeper pulled off one or two decent saves, we had one cleared off the line so on chances alone I think we deserved a point. On overall play, I thought they were the better team.
"We've scored a couple of late goals now so I always thought one was going to drop for us. It's a great finish by Liam Polworth.
"The spirit was great. I'm delighted with the lads."
