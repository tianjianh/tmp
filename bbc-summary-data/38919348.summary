JacobTaute crossed the line either side of Andrew Conway's score and the hosts were awarded a penalty, with Rhys Buckley hitting back for the Dragons.
Munster led 31-10 at the break before Elliott Dee's converted try gave the visitors hope of a comeback.
But this was Munster's night as Dave Kilcoyne and Ronan O'Mahony touched down to seal a six-try win.
Munster began well and out-half Tyler Bleyendaal kicked their first penalty although the Welsh side responded through a Dorian Jones penalty.
It was 3-3 after 11 minutes but the Munster forwards put in all the work before Duncan Williams' pass sent Taute over for a try in the 14th minute.
Bleyendaal converted and then brilliantly set up Conway's converted try - the fly-half intercepted a pass near his own line and kicked down-field for Conway to re-gather and touch down.
Munster led 17-3 after 20 minutes and it got worse for the visitors when Springbok Taute scored his second try in the 28th minute.
Bleyendaal added the extras again and despite a consolatory try from Buckley in the 37th minute, Munster secured the bonus point before half-time.
Williams' pass was about to send replacement Dan Goggin over in the corner, but a deliberate knock-on from Carl Meyer meant that the Dragons number 15 got yellow and Munster had a penalty try.
Munster led by 21 points at half-time but after Darren O'Shea got a yellow card for a shoulder charge on Jones at ruck-time, the Dragons pressurised their opponents and mauled their way over the home side's line for Dee's try in the 59th minute.
Dragons trailed 31-17 at that stage and the losing bonus point was in sight but Kilcoyne touched down in the 64th minute and O'Mahony in the dying seconds.
