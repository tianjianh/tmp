No-one has been convicted of the murder of Mrs McAreavey (27), the daughter of Tyrone gaelic football manager Mickey Harte.
She was strangled at a hotel in Mauritius 12 days after her wedding in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.
Mr McAreavey wants justice for his dead wife.
Before leaving for Mauritius, he told the BBC he was prepared "to go to the ends of the earth to ensure that justice is achieved for Michaela".
Other family members are expected to join him on a short visit to the island.
Mr McAreavey said: "We need to appeal to the people of Mauritius, so we felt that the best way to achieve that is to get on a plane and get out there."
John and Michaela McAreavey went on honeymoon to Mauritius in January 2011.
She was found dead in a bath at the four-star Legends Hotel, after returning to her room to collect a packet of biscuits.
Two hotel workers - Avinash Treebhoowoon and Sandip Moneea - were later accused of murdering her and stood trial in the Mauritian capital Port Louis in 2012. Both were cleared of her murder in a unanimous verdict by a jury at the Supreme Court.
Mauritian police launched a fresh investigation following the trial, but it came to nothing.
Mr McAreavey remarried in September last year. His wife, Tara Brennan, is an accountant from County Kildare.
He said: "I'm very, very fortunate that I've such a loving family.
"You move forward with life, you enjoy the good things, but you don't shy away from the hard things either."
When he arrives in Mauritius, Mr McAreavey is expected to hold a news conference at which he will appeal for anyone with information about the murder of Michaela to come forward.
