Villagers' legal action over sea-threatened Fairbourne

People in Gwynedd are set to launch legal action against plans which could see their village lost to the sea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwynedd council's shoreline management plan could see maintenance of flood defences stopped in 40 years.
Villagers have now voted to hire a specialist barrister to fight the proposals and are raising Â£20,000 to fund the action.
A council spokesman said officers were in regular discussions with residents about the community's future.
People in the area first discussed the possibility of legal action in 2014.
Pete Cole, chairman of action group Fairbourne Facing Change, told BBC Radio Wales' Country Focus programme: "This is something which continues to frustrate and upset people in the village...  there's been a lot of talk, but no practical solutions to enable people to move on with their lives.
"We are committed to working with Gwynedd council and the Welsh government, but if we can't find a solution we can all live with, then a legal challenge may be our only way forward."
A Welsh government spokesman said: "It is important that all those at risk of coastal flooding or erosion are aware of the risks they face and plan for future change."
