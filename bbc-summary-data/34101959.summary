Although there is some discrepancy over when the inaugural event was held, the consensus is the first carnival was staged sometime between 1964 and 1966.
Organisers say they are marking the 50th anniversary of one of Europe's biggest street parties during the 2014, 2015 and 2016 events.
Held every August Bank Holiday weekend, Sunday is reserved for Children's Day.
