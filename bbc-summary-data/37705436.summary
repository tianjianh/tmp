The device, produced by Bullitt Group, takes its name and looks from Kodak's 1941 Ektra camera.
The Eastman Kodak company invented digital photography in the 1970s, but was outpaced by rivals after it decided to focus on its film business instead. The company exited the digital camera market in 2012.
"There is no doubting Kodak's heritage as a photography brand. The challenge is whether it remains relevant to the Instagram generation who have grown up in the era of digital photography," said Ben Wood of the CCS Insight consultancy.
"Bullitt will be hoping it can revive the Kodak brand as a cool retro product offering. That's a tough challenge, particularly when most smartphones already have a great camera," he told the BBC.
BBC Click's Lara Lewington was one of the first to get hands-on with the camera.
