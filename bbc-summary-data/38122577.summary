Tyrone couple fearful of more flooding this winter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple in their 60s who have been living in a caravan since their County Tyrone home flooded last year have said they are fearful of repeat flooding this winter.

Eugene and Mary McShane's home on Urney Road in Clady was damaged by about 5ft of water on 5 December 2015.
The entire ground floor of the house was destroyed and the couple lost many of their belongings.
Since then, they have been living in a caravan in their back garden.
The story was first reported in the Strabane Chronicle.
The couple said that due to the extent of the damage, organising repair work and payment from their insurance company has been a lengthy process.
Speaking to Radio Ulster's Sunday News programme, Mrs McShane said the last year had been a "nightmare".
She said she never expected that flooding to such an extent would affect her home, which she and her husband have owned for 35 years.
"I was sitting watching Strictly Come Dancing and the girl next door phoned over and she said, 'you know the water's rising beside your house'," Mrs McShane said.
"I looked out and there it was pouring in the back door. It was just like a big wave.
"It was completely destroyed; the worst bit is all the photographs of my children, wedding photos were ruined.
"I'd only just got the house done up for Christmas, new furniture and carpets and it was all destroyed.
"I just wanted to walk away and never come back. It was just heart-breaking."
Mrs McShane described conditions in the caravan she and her husband are living in as "claustrophobic".
"I've two heaters on, the last couple of days it was like a freezer," she said.
Mrs McShane said she and her husband have been told that it could be up to another six months before they can begin to move back into their home.
For the moment, her concern is the prospect of bad weather this winter.
Their home is close to the River Finn, which burst its banks last December and caused widespread flooding across Clady.
"I'm very worried it's going to happen again. Although they've fixed the bank where it burst, it's not to say it won't happen again," said Mrs McShane.
In a statement, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said it is "currently working on the design of a flood defence system at Stephenstown / Urney Road" and hopes to complete those works within the next financial year.
"DfI Rivers is currently in discussion with the local community group with a view to identifying a suitable location in Clady for a publicly accessible sandbag store for use by the community in case of a flooding," it added.
"To further assist the local community in being more prepared for flooding a High Water-Level Alert Station is planned to be installed by the end of 2016."
