Tolls for the Humber Bridge are to be frozen for the next five years, officials have announced.

Motorists pay £1.50 for a one-way car journey across the bridge or £1.35 for drivers using an electronic tag.
The Humber Bridge Board said there would be no increase until 2021 despite plans to install a glass lift at the bridge and create a visitor centre.
Chairman Rob Waltham said the toll had been "significant in growing the Humber economy".
A planning application for the proposed tourist development at the site was submitted in June.
Project costs have not been released by the board but Bridge Master Peter Hill said it would be financed by the bridge board and "not be funded from bridge tolls".
The tolls were halved in April 2012 after the government cut £150m from the bridge's outstanding debt.
