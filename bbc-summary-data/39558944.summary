Ben Westwood: Warrington Wolves back-rower charged with Grade D striking offence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington back-rower Ben Westwood could be banned for up to five matches after he was charged with striking in Friday's Super League win over Leeds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old's challenge on Leeds Rhinos player Liam Sutcliffe was given a Grade D ranking in terms of the severity of the incident.
Westwood does not have the option of an early guilty plea, as he has submitted one previously in the past 12 months.
His case will be reviewed at Tuesday's hearing by an independent panel.
Leeds centre Jimmy Keinhorst has been given a Grade A charge of dangerous contact for an incident in that same game but does have the EGP option.
If he submits one, the potential one-game suspension would be ruled out, but he would not be able to use an EGP for another 12 months.
Leigh back-rower Gareth Hock has a Grade B charge of foul and abusive language towards a match official without an EGP available which would carry a one or two-game ban.
Catalans prop Sam Moa has the EGP to offer for his Grade A charge of raising the knee in a tackle from the same match.
St Helens centre Mark Percival could submit an EGP for his Grade A charge of disputing the referee's decision.
