[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health officials refused requests to protect a woman from her schizophrenic son because they did not think she was at "imminent risk", a coroner has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tamara Holboll made several calls for help in the days leading up to her death in May 2014.
Coroner Mary Hassell was told mental health workers did not think Peter Holboll would harm his mother,
However, just days later he stabbed her and set fire to her Kentish Town flat.
Holboll, 44, was sent to a secure hospital for an unlimited time last November after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
St Pancras Coroners Court was told Mrs Holboll and her son made a number of calls to the South Camden Rehabilitation and Recovery Team on 7 May 2014.
The centre provides services for adults with serious and long term psychosis.
Holboll and his mother told social workers they wanted to get him admitted to hospital. She said she was afraid he would harm her.
The inquest heard Mrs Holboll, 76, was in denial that her son had a mental illness and there was "enormous tension" between the two.
Social workers who saw Peter on 7 May said he was anxious and hearing voices.
Clinical Team Manager Anthony Jemmott told the coroner: "He said it (the voice) was telling him to hurt his mother but wasn't sure, he seemed confused".
The team were unable to find him a bed at Highgate Mental Health Centre.
When the coroner asked why they did not push harder for a bed, two of those who saw Peter said they did not believe he was an "imminent risk" to his mother.
The inquest continues.
