Developers win Solwaybank wind farm appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A renewable energy firm has won its appeal against the refusal of plans for a 15-turbine wind farm at Solwaybank near the border with England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council turned down the scheme because of seismic and radar concerns.
Developer RES said both those objections had now been withdrawn.
A Scottish government reporter has upheld their appeal and ruled the wind farm, near Langholm, can proceed.
Ruth Elder, development project manager, said: "RES is delighted that consent has been granted for Solwaybank wind farm which will be capable of generating enough renewable electricity to power the equivalent average demand of more than 19,000 households.
"As well as providing homegrown, secure and affordable energy, onshore wind farms like Solwaybank contribute cleaner, greener energy - particularly important when the world's eyes are focusing on international efforts to urgently tackle the long-term threat of global climate change."
