"Exceptional" Roman artefacts discovered in a field in Hertfordshire date back to 174 AD, an investigation has found.

A metal detectorist found three jugs and a bronze dish in a field in Kelshall near Royston last year, North Hertfordshire District Council said.
A subsequent dig unearthed artefacts from a "cosmopolitan" burial including mosaic glass dishes and cremated bone.
Experts are "clamouring" to study the "unique find," the council said.
The treasure hunter made the initial discoveries, including a complete Roman jug, late last year and council archaeology officer Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews decided the finds merited further investigation.
Glass bottles and cups, an iron lamp, a box with bronze corner bindings were later uncovered, as well as a bronze coin dating from 174 to 175 AD.
A "major find" were two shattered - but otherwise complete - mosaic glass dishes, which were probably made in Alexandria in Egypt in about 200 AD, the council said.
Mr Fitzpatrick-Matthews said: "After 1800 years, finds like these still impress us with their workmanship."
The artefacts are not currently classed as treasure and are owned by the farmer and the finder but North Hertfordshire Museum Service wants to raise the money to buy them.
The value has not been revealed but is estimated to be "more than Â£20,000".
