Formartine had beaten League Two Annan Athletic in the last round but their hopes of causing another upset were dealt a blow when Erskine rolled the ball home from David Amoo's cut-back.
Erskine missed another chance shortly after but Lawless drilled past MacDonald after a neat exchange with Kris Doolan.
A fine solo run and finish by Erskine following another Doolan pass effectively ended the tie as a contest.
It was almost a hat-trick for Erskine when his ferocious shot went wide before Osman completed the scoring.
The visitors' Scott Barbour flashed a shot wide and Amoo and Mustapha Dumbuya came close for the hosts late on.
