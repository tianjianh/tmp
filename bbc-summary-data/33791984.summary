The 14:25 BST service from Liverpool Street to Stansted came to a halt at about 15:10 near Bishop's Stortford.
Three other cows made off through the town's high street before being contained, Hertfordshire Police said. A stockman was called to rescue them. No-one on board the train was injured.
Passengers on trains between Broxbourne and Stansted Airport and Cambridge have been told to expect disruption.
Charlie Page and Hannah Turner, both from Bishop's Stortford, were trapped on board the train for about an hour.
"The train stopped just near Bishop's Stortford. The driver said 'we've struck some cows' and then about five or six police cars arrived," Miss Turner said.
"I did see one dead cow and I think one might have been under the train.
"Others were running up and down alongside the train."
A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said officers were called to the rail line near Cannons Mill Lane in Bishops Stortford, at 15:08.
"Officers from BTP and Hertfordshire Constabulary attended the scene and found that three cows had been struck and killed by a London Liverpool Street to Stansted Airport train," he said.
