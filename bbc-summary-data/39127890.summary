The Big Lottery Fund grant for the facility at Lincluden will finance a programme of repairs and upgrades.
The work includes new lighting, replacement windows and doors and internal and external redecoration.
Manager Lynn Uygun said it would revitalise the centre which plays host to a wide variety of activities and organisations.
"This funding will ensure the community centre's future for years to come. Planned works have already attracted two organisations to bring their projects to the centre," she said.
"People from all age groups will benefit from more comfortable surroundings and we will be able to hold more community events, helping to encourage an interest and pride in the refurbished centre."
BLF Scotland's Maureen McGinn said the Our Place funding was a "different way" of investing lottery money, based around local priorities.
"I wish the people of Dumfries the very best as they work to bring their vision to life," she said.
