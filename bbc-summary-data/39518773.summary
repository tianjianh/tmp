Antrim's quest for a 16th title in a row got off to a brilliant start as they beat Donegal 3-24 to 1-10 at Celtic Park.
In Inniskeen, Armagh edged a keenly-contested local derby with Down on a 1-17 to 2-12 scoreline.
The provincial final will be played on Sunday, 16 April.
Donegal led briefly against the Saffrons after a Davin Flynn goal, but James McNaughton's netted 26th-minute reply handed Antrim a lead they would not relinquish.
Antrim led by 2-9 to 1-5 at half-time, with Loughgiel clubman McNaughton firing a second goal in the 32nd minute.
The reigning champions built up a 15-point lead inside 12 minutes of the restart, with Daniel McKernan scoring their third goal.
In the other semi-final, two goals by Malachy Magee helped Down to a 2-5 to 0-7 lead.
Down were reduced to 14 men at this stage, after the dismissal of Caolan Baile in the 25th minute.
A Dylan McKenna goal levelled the tie at 1-10 to 2-7 inside 13 minutes of the restart, with the sides level on three further occasions, until Armagh fired two injury-time points, to ensure a two-point win.
