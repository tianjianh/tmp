England 2-2 Spain: England player ratings from Wembley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England conceded two late goals as Gareth Southgate's final match as interim manager ended in a 2-2 friendly draw against Spain in a Wembley friendly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty assesses England's display as they brought the curtain down on 2016.
Joe Hart (goalkeeper) 6
Very well protected in his 45 minutes. He had little to do.
Nathaniel Clyne (right-back) 7
Maybe not enough to oust Kyle Walker as England's first-choice right-back but very capable.
Gary Cahill (central defence) 6
Relatively untroubled first half before being substituted.
John Stones (central defence) 6
Still takes too many risks - one first-half pass put England and Eric Dier in trouble. Needs to tighten up against the top teams.
Danny Rose (left-back) 7
Growing as an international defender. Good display.
Eric Dier (defensive midfield) 6
Decent defensive shield. Played his part in helping England control most of this game.
Jordan Henderson (central midfield) 7
Led by example as captain and delivered a superb cross to set up Vardy's goal.
Jesse Lingard (right winger) 7
Showed promise with some good running. A work in progress but good signs.
Raheem Sterling (left winger) 7
Excellent 65 minutes. Lively, pacy and linked well with Lingard.
Adam Lallana (forward) 7
Excellent for 25 minutes until he picked up an injury.
Jamie Vardy (striker) 8
Got away with a shocking early tackle on Cesar Azpilicueta but after that showed last season's Leicester City form and scored an excellent diving header.
Substitutes
Theo Walcott (for Lallana 25 minutes) 5
Odd moments but very little impact and should have scored to make it 3-0.
Tom Heaton (for Hart 45 minutes) 6
Looked very good until Spain's late rally. Could do nothing about Iago Aspas's goal but Isco's equaliser sneaked through his legs at the near post.
Phil Jagielka (for Cahill 45 minutes) 6
Solid - but why not give Burnley's Michael Keane 45 minutes?
Andros Townsend (for Sterling 65 minutes) 5
Couple of decent crosses.
Marcus Rashford (for Vardy 67 minutes) 5
Very quiet performance.
Aaron Cresswell (for Rose 79 minutes) 5
Tough introduction as Spain came to life.
