Ipswich Town have had a bid accepted for Cardiff City midfielder Emyr Huws and hope to conclude the loan signing Manchester City midfielder Bersant Celina, says boss Mick McCarthy.

Huws, 23, spent the final four months of last season on loan at Portman Road, scoring three goals in 13 appearances.
"He was outstanding when he came last season, one of the best players from January onwards," said McCarthy.
Celina, 20, spent last season on loan at Dutch club FC Twente.
The Kosovo international, who has featured four times for City's first team, scored five times in 27 appearances for the top-flight side.
McCarthy told BBC Radio Suffolk: "We've been looking for a replacement for Tom Lawrence - no pressure on him there, player of the year in every department.
"He's a similar type, right-footed left winger and can play in behind the striker."
Wales international Huws joined Cardiff in August 2016 on a three-year deal but struggled to break into the Bluebirds first team, and Warnock revealed that the player dipped into his own pocket to ensure he could go on loan to Ipswich to play regularly.
"Right on the [transfer] deadline day I said: 'I want you to stay, but if Ipswich don't come up with the wages you're going to have to stay'," Warnock told BBC Wales Sport.
"He ended up paying some of the wages himself, which I found incredible and I can't take my hat off to him enough.
"It's paid off for him, because he's going to get himself a club and a contract where he'll be happy playing."
Huws made his senior debut for Wales in a friendly against Iceland in March 2014 and has won 11 caps, scoring one goal.
Cardiff manager Warnock has also confirmed he wants to sign a further three players ahead of the new season.
Last week Cardiff signed striker Danny Ward from Rotherham United and the Bluebirds have also recruited goalkeepers Lee Camp and Neil Etheridge this summer on free transfers, as well as Scotland defender Callum Paterson and winger Nathaniel Mendez-Laing.
