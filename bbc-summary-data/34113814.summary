Strictly stars reveal hopes, fears and leotard struggles

As Strictly Come Dancing fans gear up for the return of the show this weekend, the celebrities have been opening up on their first days of training, sweaty palms and leotard struggles.

"I am a carthorse," says BBC Breakfast weather presenter Carol Kirkwood.
"You know there is normally a comedy figure - that's me."
She is convinced that she will be the first celebrity voted off the show.
"I've resigned myself to that fact already," she says, laughing.
Kirkwood already seems to have formed a double act with Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell, as both have struggled in the training session where they were taught a number of different dance steps.
"Daniel and I were at the back looking at each other. The cha-cha-cha was like a what-what-what? It was a nightmare," she says.
"You know those races that you put ducks into water and they float away - my duck was just stuck," says O'Donnell.
The singer admits he is feeling "excited and terrified" despite years performing on stage.
"I think the hardest thing is to let yourself go on the dance floor. I don't do that easily," he explains.
With a loyal army of fans, it is expected that O'Donnell will stay in the show for a long time.
"I hope they keep me a while anyway but I think at the end of the day that the dancing wins out in the end."
The bookies' favourite to take home the glitterball trophy this year is singer Peter Andre - something he is not happy about.
"That is the worst pressure anyone could ever have," he says.
"It's so nice but it is such [pressure]  - you can't stuff up once."
And he points out bookies are not basing their odds on having seen any of them dance on the show.
"That'll all change once we start dancing and even if you're good at one style of dancing, this is a different world for everyone."
Singer Jamelia, however, is not having any of his modesty, admitting she's been "getting him mixed up with the professionals".
"He is a fantastic dancer - I don't know why he's playing it down."
Jamelia says her dancing is "the family joke" and despite Carol's belief she is like a carthorse on the dancefloor Jamelia believes the standard of dancing this year is pretty good.
"When we were rehearsing, I thought that there would be obviously amazing people and obvious clangers but there were no clangers, so that gets you a lot more nervous.
"I don't think anyone's automatically safe. I think we're all going to have to work our butts off."
Professional boxer Anthony Ogogo faces a bigger struggle than most as he has had to rehearse with his arm in a sling. He is still recovering from an operation after injuring it in a fight.
He took advice from his surgeon, doctor and physio before signing up and says he will be out of the sling for the first live shows.
"It's hard," he admits, "but as an athlete you've got to work around stuff. I've had 200 fights in my career and probably about 10 of them I've walked into the ring 100%."
Both Kellie Bright from EastEnders and Helen George from Call The Midwife will need to find time to rehearse while filming their shows.
However, George admits the thing she is struggling with most is being herself.
"I find it really intimidating not being in character. I'm getting sweaty palms just thinking about it.
"We practised the bit where they introduce you for the first time and we walk down the stairs and Kirsty [Gallacher] turned round and I was just stood there doing nothing saying, 'Someone take me home.'"
Entering the Strictly world sees the stars dressing up in clothes they would probably never normally wear, which has caused a few issues for some of them.
"I actually put two legs in one hole of my leotard," admits sports presenter Kirsty Gallacher.
"I said, 'Please say I'm not the first to do that' and they said, 'No, Kirsty, you're not'."
"They are good at convincing you," says Countryfile presenter Anita Rani.
"God knows how they managed to get me into the dress I'm wearing.
"It's a bondage number, it's just straps. This bit of my arse is actually on display," she says pointing to her side. "It's never seen daylight before."
"I guess I've been Strictly-fied."
Athlete Iwan Thomas, however, did not need any persuasion when it came to his outfits.
"I fully went in saying I need it brighter and tighter and with more sparkly bits."
And he has a plan.
"Week one it's Lycra, very fitted and the trousers are tight.
"Week two I'm hoping to unzip a bit and week three it's off.
"If I'm still in, I might have one of those wardrobe malfunctions and rip it off.
"I think you have to embrace the outfits - you've got to embrace everything about Strictly as it's the chance of a lifetime."
Strictly Come Dancing starts on BBC One on Saturday night at 19.15 BST.
