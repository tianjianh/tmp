The star doesn't stand a chance as the incredible gravitational pull from deep within the black hole sucks it apart.
Some broken up parts of the star are whipped outwards at super high speeds, like food in a kitchen blender, whilst the rest of the star is sucked into the black hole causing a flare.
What is a black hole?
A black hole is a dying star that has collapsed inward from its own weight.
The pull of gravity from its centre becomes so strong that even light can't escape, which is why it looks black.
