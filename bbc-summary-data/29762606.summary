[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danny McKay, who was 36, was shot at his home on Longlands Road on 25 October 2012.
At least two armed men were involved in the attack. Nine arrests have been made as part of the investigation. No one has been charged.
The senior investigating officer said Mr McKay's family deserved answers as well as justice.
Before the murder, five masked men entered a house at Dunore Court in the New Lodge area of north Belfast and forced the occupant to hand over his silver Volkswagen Bora car, registration number KLZ 9787.
At 20.50 BST, this car was found burnt out in Ardmoulin Place in the Lower Falls area of west Belfast.
Det Chief Insp John McVea said he believed this incident was linked to Mr McKay's death.
