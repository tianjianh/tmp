It also stated that the Natural History Museum was the second most searched-for and the British Museum was third.

The research was carried out by  London & Partners, the London mayor's official promotional company.
The director of the Science Museum, Ian Blatchford, said: "It's fantastic that so many people across world are seeking out the Science Museum, and this new data provides yet more evidence of the world class status of British museums."
