[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl was with her parents and a younger brother when she attended St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, on Sunday afternoon.
But the family left two hours later before the girl, who police believe is diabetic, could receive treatment.
Police said the family had now been found and the child is safe and well.
It had been feared the girl could fall into a coma if not treated immediately.
