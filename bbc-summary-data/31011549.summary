The 23-year-old has signed a three-and-a-half year contract at The Hawthorns and is new manager Tony Pulis's first signing.
"I'm delighted we've got Callum and I believe he will be an exciting addition," Pulis said.
"Callum is a player who can improve our options and I am really looking forward to working with him."
McManaman was Wigan's joint top-scorer this season with five goals in his 23 appearances and scored twice in the top flight for the Latics in 2012-13.
After his release by Everton, Huyton-born McManaman joined Wigan in 2007 and had a loan spell at Blackpool before his first-team breakthrough at the DW Stadium.
He was named man of the match when the Latics beat Manchester City in the 2013 FA Cup final.
McManaman is the second player to leave the struggling Championship side on Wednesday - after Adam Forshaw left to join Middlesbrough.
