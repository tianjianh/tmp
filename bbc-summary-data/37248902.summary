Pay to jump passport queues at Edinburgh airport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Passengers arriving at Edinburgh airport could pay to skip passport queues, under new plans to ease congestion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood the scheme would offer people flying into the airport the chance to jump the queue for about £5.
The FastTrack service would be the first of its kind in Scotland.
It comes after chief executive Gordon Dewar wrote to then Home Secretary Theresa May to raise concerns about cuts to the UK Border Force.
In an open letter to Mrs May in July, before she became Prime Minister, he said Edinburgh airport was preparing for its "busiest summer ever".
But he warned that queues at passport control could hit unprecedented levels following "very serious" staffing cuts.
The airport already offers passengers the opportunity to pay £4.49 to use a priority security lane for departures.
The new FastTrack passport control scheme for arriving passengers is a joint venture with the UK Border Force.
Similar services are already offered at Gatwick and Heathrow airports.
A spokesman for Edinburgh airport said it was likely to be trialled in the "near future".
"This new service will offer choice to people flying into Edinburgh Airport," he added.
"We look forward to being able to offer our overseas passengers and returning UK-based passengers an even smoother arrival into Scotland."
The Home Office confirmed that the Border Force was "working closely" on the project.
A spokeswoman said it would "allow business travellers and those on tight schedules to make the most of their stay with the shortest possible wait".
She added: "Working with airport operators, Border Force is committed to providing an excellent service to all passengers arriving in the UK."
