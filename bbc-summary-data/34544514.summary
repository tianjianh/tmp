[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A leukaemia sufferer has converted his mobility scooter into a "magical" replica of the Coca-Cola truck to help raise money for a cancer charity.

Barry Hall, 73, from Lincoln, customised the scooter with LED lights, a trailer and air horns.
Mr Hall, who last year turned the scooter into a sleigh complete with reindeer, said his "silly idea" has put a smile on people's faces.
The truck is due to take to the streets and collect cash on 16 December.
Mr Hall, whose wife died from cancer, said:  "I can't believe it, I'm overwhelmed, over the moon.
"A silly idea but I've made it happen, it's put a smile everybody's face who's seen it.
"An old mobility scooter can turn into something magical... stupid idea I had, but I've made it come to life."
Last Christmas, Mr Hall's "reindeer" scooter raised Â£467.
