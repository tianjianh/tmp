Two new railway stations are due to open in September, months behind schedule.

Work has been taking place for stations at Coventry's Ricoh Arena and Bermuda Park, in Nuneaton, in a Â£13.6m scheme.
The so-called Nuckle project was originally expected to be completed in 2014, although that was later put back to May 2015.
Coventry City Council said construction was due to finish in August, with the stations opening a month later.
The authority said there had been delays in relocating signals and procuring some technical equipment.
London Midland director of passenger services Tom Joyner said the firm would be training up some 90 staff, including station personnel, drivers and conductors, but that could only be done once construction was finished.
He described the latest delays as "disappointing".
A local rail users group and Nuneaton's Conservative MP, Marcus Jones, have both previously expressed their frustrations over the setbacks.
Rachel Lancaster, Coventry City Council cabinet member for public services, said it had been "a complicated job".
"There will be one train an hour stopping at the new stations - this will provide a great park and ride option for people in the north of Coventry who work in the city centre and for local people travelling between Coventry and Nuneaton to work," she said.
