[SN]TITLE[SN]
Manchester Victoria Metrolink station closes for upgrade

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work is starting on a new tram stop at Manchester's Victoria Station, putting the Metrolink stop out of use for the next nine months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Metrolink passengers will have to use the stop at Shudehill as the platform and tracks at Victoria are redesigned for the second city tram crossing.
Trams will pass through Victoria in both directions on a single track but cannot stop for safety reasons.
The work is part of a wider Â£44m refurbishment of the station.
