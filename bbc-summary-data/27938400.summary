Hull City have unveiled a new crest for the 2014-15 season, which does not feature the club's name.

The latest redesign follows owner Assem Allam's plans to change the club's name to Hull Tigers, which was rejected by the Football Association in April.
The FA has no jurisdiction over badges, but this undermines their judgement
The badge bears only a tiger's head and the year of the club's formation, 1904.
"Why, when the club is more successful than ever, would you not tell everyone your name," said Mark Gretton, of fans' group City Till We Die.
According to the club's vice-chairman Ehab Allam, the new crest is a "more stripped back and modern approach which still celebrates the club's heritage and history".
Yet, as the Premier League club prepare for their Europa League debut after reaching last season's FA Cup final, the move has angered the supporters' group.
They have described the move as "extremely foolish".
"It is ludicrous," Gretton told BBC Sport.
"The FA has no jurisdiction over badges, but this undermines their judgement. We have become the club with no name. It is remarkable. We have a global brand already. It is Hull City. Our nickname is the Tigers."
