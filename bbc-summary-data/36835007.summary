Nugent, 47, joins the club having been first-team coach at Luton last season.
He is reunited with Slade, who he previously worked alongside as assistant manager at Orient during a four-year spell.
"This is a fantastic club to join and I'm really looking forward to getting started and working with Russell again," Nugent told the club's website.
His coaching career has also included spells at Swansea alongside Kenny Jackett, with whom he secured promotion to League One in 2007.
