Pensioners plea to save Gortin day centre from closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of pensioners at a day care centre in County Tyrone have made a plea to prevent its closure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They say the service is a "lifeline" for their mental health and well-being.
The Western Trust has outlined proposals to close the service at Owenkillew community centre in the village of Gortin.
Fermanagh and Omagh District Councillors are due to raise the issue at a meeting later on Tuesday.
The Western Trust has suggested users be bussed to a similar facility in Newtownstewart, about eight miles away.
Ita Flanagan, 82,  suffers from Parkinson's disease and is confined to a wheelchair.
She started attending the day care service in Gortin after her husband died.
She said she did not think she would be able to go to the alternative facility.
"It's a 14 mile round journey and it's not very pleasant sitting on a wheelchair in a bus on a bendy road which is not very well surfaced.
"I don't see the necessity to move because we have everything so well where we are in Gortin.
"So please just listen to our plea, we're just looking to be left where we are and that the decision-makers will listen to our plea and see the sense of it."
Rosalla McCrory is a 96-year-old retired nurse who lives a short distance away from the Gortin centre.
"It's the loneliness that gets you. I have bad eyesight and I no longer drive so I'm dependent on people taking me out," she said.
"I'd like to say please don't close Gortin. We all like it, we all benefit so much for it and we all look forward to going there. It's a lifeline."
Ita and Rosalla are two of 14 pensioners who attend the centre every Monday.
In a statement the Western Trust said that in August it was agreed to move forward with the recommendations contained within the Reform of Day Care Services Consultation Feedback Report.
The existing service users will get the same quantity of day care they currently receive, but it may be in a different facility that better meets their need.
The Trust will review current transport services to ensure that all service users can be accommodated in a timely manner. It will undertake to give feedback on the consultation process and is committed to implementing its plan by 31 March 2016.
