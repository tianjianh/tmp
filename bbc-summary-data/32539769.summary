Coventry City Highfield Road collector regrets move

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Coventry City fan whose garden is full of memorabilia from the club's old ground has said the team should never have left - on the 10th anniversary of the final game at the stadium.

The Sky Blues left Highfield Road, the club's home since 1899, for the Ricoh Arena in 2005.
Paul Sheehy, of Coventry, has items including signs at his home and created a cinema in his garage to watch footage he filmed of the ground's demolition.
He said Highfield Road was "perfect".
Mr Sheehy said: "It suddenly dawned on me it was over and I thought 'they don't need a bigger ground, this place just needs a little bit of tarting up. It's perfect.'.
"And I still think I'm right - (they) should never have left."
The Sky Blues beat Derby County 6-2 in their final game at Highfield Road on 30 April 2005 to avoid relegation from the Championship.
A Mowbray Street is in the area of the old ground - a coincidence, given the club's current manager is Tony Mowbray.
The Sky Blues played home games at Northampton Town from the start of the 2013-14 season over a long-running row over rent, but returned to the Ricoh Arena in September 2014.
