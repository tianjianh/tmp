The strong winds and low temperatures caused water from Lake Ontario to blow over the house and then freeze.
It is part of a winter storm that is expected to bring blizzard-like conditions from New York City to Boston this week.
More than half a metre of snow is expected in some areas.
The mayor of New York has called on people to stay indoors to stay safe.
