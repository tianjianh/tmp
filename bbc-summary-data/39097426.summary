The former Cambridge, Coventry and Oldham forward, 31, had scored once in 29 appearances for the League Two side.
"We're pretty sure he's broken his ankle - he'll be needing an operation," boss Paul Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon.
"There was a big part for him to play at the end of this season, but it looks like we'll have to wait for next year."
