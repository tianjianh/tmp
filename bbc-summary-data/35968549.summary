Ignite 2016 will see hundreds of people recreate Dundee's Royal Arch from cardboard before toppling and trampling the structure the following day.
The festival includes a new programme selected to celebrate Scotland's Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design.
The original Royal Arch was built between 1849 and 1853.
It was constructed to commemorate Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's visit to Dundee in 1844.
It was demolished in 1964 as part of preparatory work for the Tay Road Bridge.
Artist Olivier Grossetete will work with the public to recreate the Royal Arch from cardboard over the weekend of 28 and 29 May.
A series of events celebrating design and construction will take place alongside evening projections before the tower is destroyed.
The festival will also include two pop up markets and highlight work from emerging artists and designers from local universities and colleges.
