During the mid-1940s, the Llandaff North building was home to Idloes Owen, a founding figure in the establishment of the company.
It made its debut at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Cardiff, in April 1946 with a double bill of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci.
The event coincides with the company's 70th anniversary celebrations.
The celebration were accompanied by songs from pupils of Ysgol Glan Ceubal, Hawthorn Primary School and Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf.
Sian Meinir, mezzo soprano with the WNO chorus, also performed at the event.
Organisers said Arfon and Rachel Jones, who live in the house with their three children, "happily agreed" to the commemorative plaque.
