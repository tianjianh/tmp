Whitstable Museum reopening in July amid transfer delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A refurbished museum will re-open in Kent next month despite legal work continuing to transfer its management from a council to a community group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Whitstable Museum should have opened on 1 June, run by Whitstable Community Museum Group, but the transfer was delayed by legal issues.
Canterbury council said the museum will now open on 9 July with an exhibition on the town's shipbuilding past.
The building has been revamped with an Arts Council England grant of Â£15,000.
Currently, the museum is still officially under city council management in partnership with the museum group.
The group has researched and organised the new exhibition.
Councillor Neil Baker, chairman of the council's community committee, said: "The delay is unfortunate but it's not the fault of anyone involved in the project.
"Legal matters often take a while to sort out. We're still committed to the transfer and look forward to a successful resolution."
