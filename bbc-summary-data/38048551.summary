'Twenty ambulance staff' queue for hours in A&E; corridor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to "20 ambulance staff" were left waiting to hand over patients at a Liverpool A&E department because of a "significant increase" in 999 calls.

World War Two veteran Albert Hooley, 92, was one of a number of patients who queued to be seen at Aintree Hospital on 14 November.
One paramedic spent more than half of her shift "standing in corridors".
The North West Ambulance Service said it was working with the NHS to address the issue.
Mr Hooley's granddaughter Emma Satchell posted photographs on Facebook to highlight the issue after seeing "20 paramedics/ technicians" standing in a corridor.
"The delays, due to lack of beds had a massive impact on emergency calls as the paramedics are unable to hand over the patient until a bed becomes available," she said.
Her grandfather, who has Alzheimer's, was taken to hospital at 22:00 GMT with suspected heart problems. He was seen by a doctor at 01:00 "still in the corridor with no dignity whatsoever", she said.
Ms Satchell said she has "nothing but praise" for the NHS and paramedics "who face these battles on a daily basis".
One comment on the post said: "I was a paramedic standing in that queue, in fact I spent 7 hours out of a 13 1/2 hour shift standing on corridors of hospitals!
"It is utterly soul-destroying and frustrating, this is not what we are paid to do.
"The only answer to this is more hospital staff and more beds. Will this ever happen? NO!"
North West Ambulance Service said it was continuing to see a "high demand" for services.
"As these are patients in a serious condition that need to go to hospital, this in turn impacts on an increase in activity at hospital emergency departments that can unfortunately result in ambulance crews having to wait longer to hand over patients into the care of hospital staff.
"We monitor ambulance handover times daily and are working closely with our NHS colleagues to address the issue."
