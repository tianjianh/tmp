Passengers have spoken of their relief after docking in Wales almost 24 hours late because of a storm which left them stranded in the Irish Sea overnight.

The Stena Line ferry between Rosslare and Fishguard in Pembrokeshire was unable to dock on Monday with 87 passengers and 59 crew stuck onboard.
It was forced to sail to sheltered waters off the Llyn Peninsula in north Wales overnight.
It follows flooding across Wales in the wake of Storm Angus.
The journey usually takes around four hours to complete but stormy conditions meant the crew were forced to change the route several times eventually taking shelter in calmer waters off north Wales overnight.
The vessel finally made it to Fishguard on Tuesday morning.
One passenger leaving the port said: "You couldn't get up from your seat, everything was toppling over. It was horrendous.
"It's the worst I've been on in all of the years I've been travelling."
Others described the situation as "terrible" and some said "never again" about using the ferry but it was a "relief" to be on land.
Ian Davies, trade director for Stena Line, said passengers would be compensated.
He added: "There's many things we can control in life and weather, unfortunately, isn't one of them."
On Tuesday morning, a number of flood alerts remained in place across Wales, with higher risk flood warnings cleared at Boverton and Ewenny in Vale of Glamorgan, and on the Gwendraeth Fawr river at Pontyberem and Pontyates in Carmarthenshire.
Train services between Bridgend and Cardiff Airport remain suspended, while services on Arriva Train Wales between Shrewsbury and Hereford have now resumed following earlier flooding.
Dozens of roads also remain flooded across the whole of Wales, with motorists being urged to check their travel plans.
Meanwhile, a search has resumed for a man who went missing near the River Ogmore in Bridgend.
The heavy rain and winds have caused flash flooding and travel chaos across other parts of the UK.

Jeremy Parr, Natural Resources Wales' head of flood management, said the events of the last few days emphasised the need to be prepared.
"It's been a very wet period for the last couple of days across large parts of Wales," he said.
"It can happen again and it can happen anywhere.
"Find out if you're at risk - sometimes people don't think they are - and find out about insurance.
"The best advice is to think about these things in advance and not wait until it's too late."
