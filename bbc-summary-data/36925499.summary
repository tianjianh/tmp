[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry Parkinson, 46, from Liverpool was convicted of burglary, supplying drugs and admitting misconduct in public office at an earlier hearing.
Parkinson, of Beechburn Crescent, was convicted with three other Liverpool men - his friend Robert Sloan, 45, Shaun Blackburn, 32 and David Gould 53.
Merseyside Police said the officer had "let his colleagues down".
Parkinson used the force's computer system to gather information about suspected cannabis crops before passing it on to his co-conspirators for money.
Sloan of Steeple View, who also admitted aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, was jailed for six years.
Gould, of Grange Avenue received a five-year sentence while Blackburn, of Kenbury Road, got four-and-a-half years.
Merseyside Deputy Chief Constable Nikki Holland said: "This former officer let down his colleagues and his behaviour was completely unacceptable and serves to undermine the public's confidence and trust in the police.
"We are quite clear, no officer is above the law. If any officer is found to be behaving in a way that does not meet our standards we will take swift and robust action."
