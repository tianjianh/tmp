Last Christmas, consumers who were not compensated were out of pocket by an average of Â£30 a parcel due to damaged or lost goods, hours wasted and time away from work, it said.
The charity said it is retailers' duty to solve delivery problems.
Up to 390 million parcels will be dealt with in the run-up to Christmas 2016.
The figure covers all parcels being handled by delivery companies and Royal Mail in November and December.
The charity found UK consumers had 4.8 million delivery problems last Christmas and spent 11.8 million hours trying to resolve them.
Problems meant customers were left Â£148m out of pocket overall.
Citizens Advice anticipates an increase in requests for help, after calls rose by a third last year.
The charity analysed hundreds of calls about deliveries made to them over the past 12 months.
It found the most common problem reported by members of the public was difficulty getting through to the delivery company, along with confusion about responsibility, compensation and unexpected handling fees on parcels from outside the EU.
Tom MacInnes from Citizens Advice said of the 1,600 people the charity spoke to, one had spent Â£200 on the phone to a delivery company.
"As well as the money, it's the time," he said.
"Two and a half hours phoning delivery companies, waiting in, trying to find where things are, going to depots.
"The first and most important thing you should do is take it up with the retailer."
