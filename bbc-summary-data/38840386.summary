Matty Taylor: Bristol Rovers to make complaint over striker's Bristol City move

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers are to make an official complaint to the English Football League over Matty Taylor's deadline-day move to local rivals Bristol City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They claim City knew the details of a release clause in striker Taylor's contract before making an offer.
EFL rules state that such details are confidential and cannot be disclosed to other clubs.
BBC Radio Bristol understands Bristol Rovers have made contact with the league's legal department.
In a statement to the Daily Mail, Bristol City confirmed they "made an offer over the weekend to Bristol Rovers for an undisclosed fee for Matthew Taylor and that offer was accepted".
The club declined to make further comment when contacted by BBC Sport.
Taylor, 26, scored 61 goals in 118 league appearances for Rovers.
He is the first player to leave them and join City since Trevor Morgan in 1987.
