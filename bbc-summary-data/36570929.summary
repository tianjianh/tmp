The Belgian association is charged with the setting off of fireworks and the throwing of objects during their win over Republic of Ireland, while Portugal are charged with a field invasion during the draw with Austria.

On Monday, Croatia will find out whether they will be punished after crowd trouble marred the closing stages of 2-2 draw with the Czech Republic in Saint-Etienne on 17 June.
Referee Mark Clattenburg had to briefly halt the game when fireworks were thrown on the pitch, one of which exploded near a steward who was trying to remove it.
Earlier in the tournament, the Russian Football Union was fined 150,000 Euros (Â£119,000) and given a suspended disqualification after supporters caused trouble inside the stadium during their draw with England in Marseille.
Uefa threatened to disqualify England and Russia if there is any repeat of the violence that occurred in the centre of Marseille prior to kick-off.
