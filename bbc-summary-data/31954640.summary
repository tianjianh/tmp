Parents have demanded governors at a special school reinstate its sacked head teacher.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trystan Williams was sacked by Springfield Academy in Calne, Wiltshire, after a pupil was seriously injured with a knife in 2013.
Parents have described the school's response as "disproportionate".
Governors said their investigation was "incredibly thorough" and carried out by an independent person.
Mr Williams was investigated by police for 12 months, and bailed 11 times, but was not charged with any offence.
The school's own case was heard by a panel of three governors, with Mr Williams allowed to call and question witnesses.
During a meeting on Wednesday, chair of governors Nina Gibson told parents she understood their "concern and anger" but the case had been properly investigated.
Mr Williams has not taught at the school since October 2013.
The decision to dismiss him was based on a failure to submit written reports about the incident.
Parents at the school have said Mr Williams has "worked wonders" with their children, with many telling the BBC of their anger and astonishment over the sacking.
One said: "I have to believe that justice will be done, I've seen the evidence, I've seen the documentation and the reasoning behind his sacking.
"Even a child from the school would read that documentation and say something isn't right here."
Conservative MP for North Wiltshire James Gray has written to the education secretary and described the sacking as a potentially "significant miscarriage of justice" or "at the very least a disproportionate response to a minor misdemeanour ".
A Wiltshire Council spokesman said it was satisfied the appropriate procedures have been followed.
