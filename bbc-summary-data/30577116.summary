Hereford United's Edgar Street ground is repossessed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hereford United's Edgar Street ground has been repossessed after the football club was wound up at the High Court on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A spokeswoman for Herefordshire Council said its officers had taken possession "achieved through peaceful re-entry for breach of three leases".
The winding-up petition was brought by HM Customs and Revenue, after a series of tax bills went unpaid.
The club had also failed to pay players, staff and other creditors.
A last-ditch attempt to save the 90-year-old club fell through on Friday when owner Andy Lonsdale, who promised he would invest Â£1m of his own money, was late to court claiming he had been stuck in traffic.
The council, which owns the land, said on Friday: "[We] will consider the appropriate process for procuring a new tenant to ensure the continuation of football."
Chris Williams, chairman of Hereford United Supporters' Trust, said a "phoenix club" could be established by August, in time for the start of the next football season.
