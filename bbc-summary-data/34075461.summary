[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pembroke pond death inquest: Man's drowning accidental

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a man at a Pembrokeshire pond where two others have died this year was accidental, a coroner has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Lyall fell backwards into the water at Pembroke's Mill Pond on 16 April.
Two passers-by tried to help but the 56-year-old, of Pembroke Dock, could not be resuscitated.
On Thursday, Coroner Mark Layton said Mr Lyall died by drowning, at a hearing in Milford Haven.
Wayne Anthony Young, 52, of Pembroke, died at the pond on New Year's Day and the body of 18-year-old Robert Mansfield, also of Pembroke, was found there on 27 July.
Inquests into their deaths are yet to take place.
Pembroke Council has rejected calls for safety netting to be erected at the pond, with Pembrokeshire Council backing that decision after saying such structures would be impractical.
