Rita King was killed at De La Mer House in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, on Monday morning.
Police confirmed that Ms King was related to the man arrested on suspicion of murder.
A post-mortem examination is due to take place. Detectives said they had found a revolver at the home.
Earlier, the home's manager described how she confronted a man carrying a gun and convinced him to hand over the weapon.
When armed police arrived, staff said they had already taken a weapon off a man in his 80s and locked it away.
Julie Curtis, who has run the residential home for two years, told the BBC on Monday she had seen a man walking towards her with a gun.
She said: "I put my left arm around him and put his right arm between him and the gun and said 'please, please give me the gun', and he let go."
Mrs Curtis said at first she had not realised the gun was real or whether anybody had been injured.
The manager said her staff had been "brilliant" and had been "staying calm and speaking to the residents who live here".
She said: "Under the circumstances, everyone is coping very well."
Det Ch Insp Simon Werrett, of Essex Police, said: "At this stage we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation and our inquiries are ongoing."
