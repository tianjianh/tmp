Daniel Morgan murder: Home Office to hold independent review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Home Office is to announce an independent review into the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan in south London in 1987.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six criminal investigations have failed to identify who killed him with an axe.
It has been alleged police corruption prevented the Metropolitan Police from solving the Welshman's murder.
The review will look at documents gathered by police and is likely to focus on informing public understanding of the case.
However, any new leads would be followed up by Scotland Yard.
A Home Office spokesperson said: "Discussions are continuing with the family and we hope to make an announcement shortly."
The body of Daniel Morgan, originally from Llanfrechfa, near Cwmbran, Torfaen, was found in Sydenham, London, in 1987.
He had been attacked in a pub car park with an axe, which was found in his head.
It is believed Mr Morgan was about to expose police corruption when he was killed. A trial of four men charged with his murder in 2008 collapsed in 2011, following alleged failures by the police and prosecutors.
Mr Morgan's family have campaigned for a judicial inquiry into his death.
His mother Isobel Hulsmann, from Hay-on-Wye in Powys, met Home Secretary Theresa May at the end of 2011 to press the case.
They were not satisfied with her offer of an investigation into police failings.
