The BBC has learned that former Chelsea boss Mourinho could be set to take over at United this summer.
Asked about his future, Van Gaal, 64, accused media of "inventing" the story and said there was no need for United to issue any kind of denial.
Van Gaal's contract runs until the end of next season.
Speaking after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Chelsea, he was involved in a frosty exchange with a reporter in the post-match news conference.
Van Gaal questioned whether the reporter had spoken to either Ed Woodward, the club's chief executive, or the Glazers, the owners, to find out what was going on behind the scenes.
Instead of writing stories about his future, Van Gaal said the media should be praising his team for their recent performances, including the one that gave them a point against Chelsea.
"It was not a 'boring' match," insisted the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager.
"For the third game in succession, our football was sparkling. So I hope to get the support of the media this week. But you write what you like."
He also referenced Sir Alex Ferguson's three years without a trophy at the start of his United reign, clearly insinuating that things would get better under him.
"Maybe you remember the difficult first years of Fergie," said Van Gaal. "You have to study... study statistics."
He has clashed with the media before.
Last month, the former Netherlands coach claimed journalists had "sacked" him three times already this season.
United had the better of the first 70 minutes at Stamford Bridge and led through Jesse Lingard's goal, only for Diego Costa to equalise in added time.
United lie fifth in the Premier League table, six points short of the top four.
