The 27-year-old also claims to have "no motivation" for his rematch with Wladimir Klitschko on 9 July - now confirmed at the Manchester Arena.
Fury, who calls himself "Gypsy King" on Twitter and is from a family of Traveller heritage, says "no-one wants to see a Gypsy do well".
"I get a lot more racial abuse than I ever did before," he told BBC Sport.
"I've done well and people don't like that - the quicker they can knock me off my perch the better. I expected it, because no-one wants to see a Gypsy do well.
"That doesn't bother me because it's what I do for a living. If I was a German, an Indian, a Chinese person, I'd still be doing what I've got to do to pay my bills."
In a lively first news conference since the Klitschko rematch was announced, Fury reignited his war of words with fellow British fighter Anthony Joshua.
Before his victory over American Charles Martin for the IBF heavyweight world title, Joshua, 26, suggested Fury was jealous of his physique and afterwards said he would "walk through" Fury to unify the division.
Fury replied on Wednesday by claiming Joshua "looked like a pumped-up weightlifter, out of his mind on drugs" and then said Joshua's opponent Martin "came to lay down and had as much fight in him as that glass of water right there. Zero."
He also said that Klitschko was "10 times the man" of his British rival.
Speaking to BBC Sport's boxing correspondent Mike Costello, the WBA and WBO title-holder, who defeated Ukrainian Klitschko on points in Dusseldorf last November, Fury then claimed he has "no motivation" for the upcoming rematch, suggesting he was currently seven stone above his fighting weight.
"I'm 24 stone at the minute," said the Manchester fighter. "Klitschko don't go overweight, Klitschko don't lose his rag. I'm out drinking, partying 24/7.
"I am the number one in the division, I'm the top dog. I have achieved my goals. I've got no more to achieve."
Fury said "talent" rather than motivation would be key against the 40-year-old in July.
"I love boxing, but when I achieved all the goals that I set out to achieve it's finished for me, it's over.
"I'll go into a camp, train and I'll just show people how to win. Even though I'm not interested in the sport.
"You don't need motivation, you need talent and ability. That's it."
