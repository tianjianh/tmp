Real substitute Isco was sent off for lashing out at forward Neymar in the 85th minute of his team's 4-0 defeat at the Bernabeu.
Barca claim Manolo Sanchis and Poli Rincon "repeatedly justified the aggression" on Spanish radio.
The club contacted a Spanish government group seeking to end violence in sport.
"FC Barcelona believes these statements to be an incitement to violence and therefore ask for action from the anti-violence commission," the club said in a statement on their website.
Barcelona claim former Real captain Sanchis said: "Neymar is going over the line, he isn't getting [hit] enough."
Ex-Real striker Rincon was accused of saying: "If I am there, I hit him, there should be no doubt that I hit him; me and anyone else."
Spanish authorities have been seeking to crack down on violence and verbal abuse in soccer since a Deportivo La Coruna fan was killed last year in organised fighting before a La Liga game at Atletico Madrid.
