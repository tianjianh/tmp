The concert at the Excelsior Stadium - the home of Airdrieonians FC - will take place on 24 June next year.
Securing a date on the Wonderful Crazy Night tour was hailed as "a major coup" for the club, stadium and town.
Sir Elton is not a stranger to touring across Scotland, having played Kilmarnock in 2005, Inverness in 2007, Perth in 2008 and Falkirk in 2012.
Excelsior Stadium owner Paul Hetherington and Tom Wotherspoon, owner of Airdrieonians FC, said in joint statement: "To have secured Airdrie FC's ground as the only Scottish venue of Sir Elton John's 2017 UK tour is something we should all take pride in.
"This will be a night to remember for all of us. Indeed, a wonderful, crazy night in our town."
The three other dates on the tour will see performances in Derby, Birmingham and Leeds.
