Campagnaro, 23, will start at centre for Italy against England in the Six Nations on Sunday, and has agreed a one-year extension.
Full-back Dollman, 31, was Rob Baxter's first signing as head coach in 2009, when they were in the Championship.
Winger Woodburn, 25, has scored seven tries in 20 appearances this season.
"We are challenging them in different ways, and I think it is a great testament to those guys that they have been able to adapt to change and thrive on those challenges as well," said Baxter.
