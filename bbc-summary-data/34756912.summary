Sam Warburton: Money no lure for loyal Cardiff Blues flanker

Sam Warburton claims he could have doubled his earnings if he had left Cardiff Blues to play in France.

But the Wales captain, 27, says he would prefer to stay in Wales and perhaps win only one trophy during his career than seek success elsewhere.
"If it takes me another 10 years to win another trophy, then I'll do that - I'll stay here," said Warburton.
"I probably could have earned twice as much money going to France, but I wanted to stay in Cardiff."
Warburton was the first Welsh player to sign a national dual contract.
There are now 16 players on the deals which see the Welsh Rugby Union pay 60% of their wages.
The contracts also give the governing body greater control over the players, and can limit the number of games they play.
Warburton is one of only two Blues on the joint deals with utility back Gareth Anscombe the other.
Blues wing Alex Cuthbert turned down an offer of a contract during the 2014-15 campaign, according to Wales coach Warren Gatland, prompting speculation about his long-term future.
Fly-half Rhys Patchell is also being linked with a move away from Blues.
Warburton insists his heart is with the city of his upbringing and where he used to watch Wales and Cardiff predecessors Martyn Williams and Robin Sowden-Taylor play.
"I remember watching Dan Baugh playing when I was really young," said Warburton before Saturday's 35-30 Pro12 defeat by Glasgow.
"I didn't really know many players then and I remember seeing this guy with his collars tucked in and his socks down, just taking people's heads off and I was like 'I want to do that. I want to play for this team and do that'.
"I love Cardiff. That's why I've stayed here."
Warburton has helped Blues win one significant trophy, coming off the bench in 2010 when they beat Toulon in what was then the Amlin Challenge Cup final, Europe's second-tier tournament.
The 2013 British and Irish Lions captain and Six Nations Grand Slam winner believes "in time" Blues can go on to win more silverware under boss Danny Wilson, who is in his first season in charge.
Warburton returned from Wales World Cup duty as battling Blues lost to Pro12 title-holders Glasgow.
He says the Scottish team are an example of how his side can attain future success.
"If you've watched them over three or four years, they've slowly built nicely and that's hopefully what we're going to start doing."
