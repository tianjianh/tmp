On 17 July, 2017, the side announced a coaching staff switch, with Franco Smith becoming the new director of rugby and Rory Duncan the head coach of the Cheetahs and Free State Cheetahs.

After the South African Rugby Union (SARU) took over the running of the franchise in November 2015, the franchise had no formal ties to any of the provincial unions.
