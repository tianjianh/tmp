Rescued Chibok girl: Who is Amina Ali Nkeki?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Amina Ali Nkeki was found on Tuesday in the Sambisa Forest area of north-east Nigeria more than two years after she was kidnapped from a school in Chibok by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram.

She is the first of the 219 schoolgirls to be freed since the immediate aftermath of their capture.
This is what we know about her so far:
Chibok community leader Hosea Abana Tsambido told the BBC that she is 19 years old.
She is from Mbalala, which is about 10km (6 miles) from Chibok.
Journalist Samson Aboku, who is from Mbalala, says that it is a mostly Christian town of approximately 30,000 people, but Amina is a Muslim.

He adds that she grew up in a small mud house with her widowed mother. She had 13 children, but Ms Nkeki and her older brother were the only two to survive.
Ms Nkeki's mother is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying that her daughter "always sewed her own clothes".
Aboku Gaji, who heads the vigilante group that found Ms Nkeki, described to the BBC Hausa service the emotional reunion with her mother.
"When we arrived at the house, the door was closed, I asked the mother to come and identify someone, the moment she saw her, she shouted her name Amina, Amina!
"She gave her the biggest hug ever, as if they were going to roll on the ground, we had to stabilise them.
"The girl started comforting the mother, saying: 'Please mum, take it easy, relax, I never thought I would ever see you again, wipe your tears. God has made it possible for us to see each other again'.
"That's what this girl, Amina kept telling her mother."
Blamadu Lawan, the vice-principal of the Chibok secondary school where Amina was boarding before she was taken, told the BBC that she was a "quiet and humble" student at school.
He saw her in Chibok when she was driven to the town on Wednesday and said that her appearance had changed and she now looks very thin and unhealthy.
While being held by Boko Haram, she gave birth to a baby girl, who can be seen with her in a photograph that the Nigerian military has released.
The child is four months old, #BringBackOurGirls activist Hadiza Bala Usman told the BBC's Newsday programme.
In a statement, the army says that Ms Nkeki was rescued along with a man called Mohammed Hayatu "who claimed to be her husband", and calls him "a suspected Boko Haram terrorist".
