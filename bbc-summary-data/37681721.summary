[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sevilla 1-0 Atletico Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sevilla went briefly top of La Liga as Steven N'Zonzi's goal gave them victory over title rivals Atletico Madrid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Angel Correa missed a sitter for Atletico and Vitolo should have put Sevilla ahead with a volley which Jan Oblak brilliantly kept out.
With 17 minutes left midfielder N'Zonzi settled the game by sprinting away from Atletico's defence to slot home.
The visitors, who were unbeaten and would have gone top with a draw, had Koke sent off for two yellow cards.
European champions Real Madrid leapfrogged Sevilla to the top of the table after a 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao.
