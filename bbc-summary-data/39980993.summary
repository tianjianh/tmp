Zander Fagerson: Gregor Townsend more detailed, but less fearsome than Vern Cotter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prop Zander Fagerson says Gregor Townsend has brought "more attention to detail" in his first Scotland camp.

After succeeding Vern Cotter as head coach, Townsend will lead the Scots on a three-Test tour against Italy, Australia and Fiji during June.
"If you don't run your line, they'll both call you out, but in different ways," Fagerson said of the coaches.
"One of them puts the fear of God into you; the other you can sort of say: 'OK, I'll do it next time.'"
The Glasgow Warriors tight-head, 21, has started Scotland's past eight Tests, including every game of their most successful Six Nations for 11 years.
While he worked under New Zealander Cotter with the national squad, Fagerson has been nurtured by former Glasgow boss Townsend.
"They're two fantastic coaches," he said. "They've got different ways of coaching but they get their point across the same, and you either buy in or you don't.
"Gregor likes a review - he likes to see you do your own work, and make sure you review your own clips instead of him coming to you.
"Vern was the same, he would call you out if you did something wrong, but Gregor has a wee bit more attention to detail, I feel."
Townsend stepped up to become national head coach after six years in charge at Scotstoun, during which he delivered the club's first major honour - the 2015 Pro12 title.
All of his injury-free home-based players are available for the first week of pre-tour training in Edinburgh, with only those exiles involved in the latter stages of domestic and European competition still at their respective club sides.
"Everything's different," Fagerson said of the camp. "It's quite a relaxed atmosphere; everyone's getting to know everyone.
"You can make a mistake, and not get murdered, compared to with Vern when you made a mistake you'd get shouted at.
"It's a blank slate for everyone; we're just trying to get in as much detail as possible. There are a lot of notes, a lot of learning - it's been tough.
"There are few calls and I'm like, 'we haven't done that before'.
"The end of the season has been great for us. We've been quite lucky - I'm quite gutted more boys aren't involved in the (British and Irish) Lions squad, or play-off rugby - but that gives the opportunity to get everyone together, get used to all the new calls, and gives us the best possible chance on the summer tour."
