The singer's video for his track She Knows feat. Juicy J is full of semi-naked dancers, but he's told us it's not a typical "strip club video".
It's been two years since the singer released his last album and this time around Ne-Yo has taken inspiration from his fans - quite literally.
Some of the songs on Non Fiction were based on stories sent to him via social networks.
Ne-Yo was speaking to Newsbeat's Entertainment Reporter Nesta McGregor.
