Europe refuses UK air pollution reprieve

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Government plans to delay air pollution improvements in 12 UK areas have been refused by the European Commission, which says air quality must improve.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK  
          may now face fines if it fails to improve air quality quickly
.
Air pollution reduces average life expectancy in the UK by up to eight months,  
          according to the government's own statistics
.
But ministers have been slow to meet agreed European standards on cutting levels of the pollutant NO2.
This comes mainly from vehicles. It causes problems with breathing - particularly for people with heart or lung problems.
The UK has been denied permission by the commission to delay air quality improvements in 12 areas - Aberdeen and north-east Scotland; Belfast; Birkenhead; Brighton; Bristol; Liverpool; Preston; Sheffield; south-west England; south Wales; Swansea and Tyneside.
A judgement will be made at a later date on government plans to delay meeting NO2 standards in major cities until 2020 - or in the case of London, 2025.
London has the worst air of any European capital
, and the UK is likely to be fined over the failure.
Air pollution is recognised by the government as the second-biggest public health threat, after smoking. It costs the UK an estimated Â£20bn a year - that's more than twice the amount estimated for obesity, which gets far more publicity.
Daniel Instone, giving evidence on behalf of Defra, said ministers were considering a nationwide network of low-emission zones in which the most polluting vehicles were banned.
Simon Birkett, a campaigner from Clean Air in London, said the commission's ruling suggested that such a network would now be inevitable.
NO2 pollution affects long-term health. Experts giving evidence to the Environment Committee, EFRA, said the health of Olympic athletes visiting over the summer should not be harmed as long as the UK avoids a heat-induced smog episode.
