And Tom Ford, ranked 52, rallied from 5-3 down to beat Mark Williams 6-5.
Ford made a clearance of 66 in the deciding frame to defeat the two-time world champion, now ranked 13th in the world, for the first time in seven meetings.
John Higgins, 40, winner of four world titles and three times a UK champion, made two centuries in beating China's Tian Pengfei 6-2, finishing the match with a 103.
