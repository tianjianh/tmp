Environmental campaigners have built a temporary hotel largely from rubbish in the Italian capital, Rome, to raise awareness of European beach pollution.

Save the Beach Hotel, taking guests for four days only, is adorned with debris from the world's beaches.
Its five rooms and reception are lined with 12 tonnes of rubbish, including toys, cans, car exhaust pipes.
Danish supermodel Helena Christensen, who has stayed at the hotel, said it was a striking work of art.
"When you're inside the house, there are walls as there would be in a normal house, but they are all made of inorganic waste," Ms Christensen, who is also an environmental campaigner, told the BBC.
"And then the outside... is completely covered in everything that we throw on beaches.
"And so you can basically just go around the house, and look at a lot of very personal objects, and some of them make you really wonder what made a human being throw this away on a beach."
The hotel, which stands beside the 2nd Century Castel Sant'Angelo on the banks of the Tiber, was created by German artist HA Schult.
"We are in the trash time," he was quoted as telling AFP news agency.
"We produce trash and we will be  trash. So this hotel is the mirror of the situation.
"We have to change the world, before the world changes us."
Would-be guests at the hotel will have to hurry to book a room: it is open from 3-7 June, and bookings may be hard to come by on 5 June, which marks World Environment Day.
