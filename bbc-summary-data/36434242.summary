It happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning. In all, eight people were arrested.
Two of the people involved are foreign nationals and police are investigating a hate crime element. Three people were taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries.
Ch Supt Garry Eaton said police are reviewing CCTV footage.
"I would encourage anyone who was in the area of Church Pass in Portstewart during the early hours of Wednesday and witnessed the altercation to contact detectives in Coleraine," he said.
"Discipline Branch is also conducting an internal investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate for me to comment further however what I can say is that the Police Service of Northern Ireland expects its officers and staff to behave professionally, ethically and with the utmost integrity at all times.
"Any deviation from those standards is unacceptable and we are committed to ensuring that where officers and staff fail to maintain the high standards expected of them they are dealt with appropriately."
