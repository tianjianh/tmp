Lancashire average speed cameras plan for notorious roads

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Average speed cameras are being installed on notorious stretches of road across Lancashire in which 13 people have been killed in five years.

The cameras will be placed along eight routes, including a stretch of Grane Road in Haslingden, which has seen a series of recent incidents.
Average speed cameras are more common on motorways rather than rural roads, and the scheme is Lancashire's first.
The devices use number plate recognition to calculate average speed.
They will be installed over a staggered period beginning this month, with all cameras activated by the end of 2017.
As well as the fatalities, between 2011 and 2016, the eight routes involved have seen 406 casualties - with 62 of those resulting in people suffering serious or life-changing injuries.
Lancashire's Assistant Chief Constable Tim Jacques, who is also chairman of the Lancashire Road Safety Partnership, said: "Our primary aim is for all drivers to adhere to the safe speed limits on our roads, and these particular roads are proven to be amongst some of our most dangerous.
"It is well-researched and documented that speeding can kill."
