[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Quamari Serunkuma-Barnes was attacked in Doyle Gardens just before 15:30 GMT on Monday as other children made their way home from school.
The suspect, who is also 15 but cannot be named, was due to appear at Willesden Youth Court on Friday.
A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a haemorrhage and a stab wound to the chest.
Piera Serunkuma-Hutton, Quamari's sister, said he was much-loved and had a heart of gold.
She said: "Everyone who knew my brother loved him to bits. He was such a good role model to everyone, old and young. He loved reggae music and could sing any song that came on the radio.
"He could make anyone laugh no matter the situation."
A fundraising page set up by Quamari's godmother to help pay for his funeral and burial expenses has reached more than Â£27,000.
His mother, Lillian Serunkuma, said the donations would instead be used to "honour his life and keep his legacy alive".
She added: "By starting something he would want in his name. Keep spreading love. No more violence please."
Police are continuing to appeal for anyone who may have information about the stabbing to contact them.
