NHS deaths to be investigated after man drowned in bath

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's health watchdog is to examine how NHS trust services learn from the deaths of patients, especially those with learning disabilities.

The nationwide review comes after Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust was criticised following the death of 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk.
Mr Sparrowhawk drowned in a bath at an Oxford mental health facility after suffering an epileptic fit in 2013.
Inspectors found the trust's review of deaths was not robust enough.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) announced it would inspect 12 NHS trusts to ascertain how services investigate all deaths in hospitals and in the community, and would be "paying particular attention to investigations and and learning from deaths of people with a learning disability or mental health problem".
It will also look at what "support" is given to families of patients who pass away.
Chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, said: "Every year thousands of people under the care of NHS trusts die prematurely because their treatment or care has not been as good as it could have been."
An inquest into the death of Mr Sparrowhawk found that neglect from Southern Health staff contributed to his demise.
A report commissioned by NHS England showed that of 722 unexpected deaths at Southern Health over four years, only 272 had been investigated.
After an inspection in January, the CQC found there were "longstanding risks to patients" and investigations into deaths "were not good enough."
In March, Mr Sparrowhawk's mother, Dr Sara Ryan, said the family was "angry and upset" that Southern Health had not improved enough.
Southern Health chief executive Katrina Percy said that "good progress has been made" since the CQC inspection.
