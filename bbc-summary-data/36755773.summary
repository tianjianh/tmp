Lewis Hamilton: I'll give everything I've got at British Grand Prix

Lewis Hamilton says he will "give it everything I've got" to take a fourth career victory in the British Grand Prix from pole position on Sunday.

Hamilton starts ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg and is aiming for his fourth win of 2016 which would reduce his 11-point championship deficit.
The world champion said: "It is going to be a very tough race, as always.
"I've got the car in a real nice place. We've started on the right foot and can't wait to see everyone tomorrow."
A crowd of 135,000 is expected at Silverstone on Sunday - the biggest since Nigel Mansell won on his way to the 1992 world championship.
His pole position time was 0.319 seconds quicker than Rosberg managed and more than a second clear of third-fastest driver Max Verstappen of Red Bull.
But Hamilton's pole lap was not his fastest of the day - that honour went to his lap in the second part of qualifying, which was 0.044secs quicker.
At the time, that was 0.7secs faster than Rosberg and Hamilton revelled in his performance on one of his favourite circuits.
"It was a very good lap, a really, really nice lap," Hamilton said.
"All weekend, I had not put all three sectors together. So I knew if I did I would be 0.3-0.4secs ahead."
Much of Hamilton's advantage was through the fast Becketts swerves, a left-right-left-right-left combination which is regarded as one of the most challenging sections of race track in the world.
"It was amazing," he said. "I have never had such speed through there before.
"I just hit all the right spots. It is like a pinball machine, if you hit all the right spots you get all the maximum points. Ping-ping-ping-ping. I came through that section and I don't think I could have done it much faster."
Hamilton and Rosberg are under strict instructions from Mercedes to give each other space in the race, following a series of meetings in the wake of their last-lap collision in last Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix.
They have been warned they face "financial and sporting penalties" if they crash again - after three collisions in the past five races, two of which have left at least one car damaged and have cost the team as much as 50 points.
Hamilton said: "We are going to race as we always do. Of course what we have been told before this weekend we are aware and conscious of, so it will be in the back of our minds for sure - but that does not mean we can't continue to drive hard as we have done."
Rosberg added: "It is now clear there are some clear deterrents which were not in place before and the rules have been slightly modified.
"But we are free to race and there is going to be a battle."
