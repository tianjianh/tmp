North Ferriby United 2-1 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Ferriby ended a run of 11 games without a win by beating Sutton 2-1 at Grange Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Topliss' looping header gave North Ferriby, whose last win was at Gateshead in mid-September, a dream start after 11 minutes.
Reece Thompson doubled their lead just after the break, profiting from confusion in Sutton's box as Jamie Collins' blocked clearance fell kindly for him to slot home.
Maxime Biamou set up a tense finale by racing clear and slotting home through Rory Watson's legs, but there was not enough time for Sutton to get a second and clinch their fifth draw in a row.
