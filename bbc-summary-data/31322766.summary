The Dutchman, 63, now has until 18:00 GMT on Tuesday to explain comments made after his team's 0-0 draw at FA Cup fourth-round opponents Cambridge.
He had already said he plans to contest the charge which relates to him saying referee Chris Foy was against his side.
"I do not think I said something wrong," Van Gaal said on Friday.
He added: "In 30 years as a trainer-coach, I've never been charged. You can confirm, as the media, that I never say anything about the referee, in all the matches I have played."
