The Hartlepool fighter, celebrating her 21st birthday, secured a 17-15 victory.
She told BBC Sport: "I was only 12 when I walked into a boxing ring, I loved it ever since and now I'm world champion."
Earlier, Nicola Adams had to settle for flyweight silver after being outpointed 14-10 by China's Ren Cancan.
This was Savannah Marshall's second successive world final appearance after taking a silver medal as an 18-year-old at Barbados in 2010.
Marshall, who had qualified for the Olympics on Friday, nudged 7-5 ahead at the halfway stage but had to hold on through a tough third round when an excellent uppercut from Vystropova gave her a bloody nose.
With Marshall still holding her two-point advantage heading into the final round, Vystropova came on strong again but a neat combination in the dying seconds from the Briton helped edge her to an historic win.
"It hasn't even sunk in that I'm going to the Olympics yet. It's crazy," Marshall added.
Leeds boxer Adams started slowly in her bout against Cancan, who she had also lost to Ren in the 2010 final in Bridgetown, and trailed by two points after the first round.
Although Adams enjoyed increasing success with her right hand in the remaining three rounds, Ren scored consistently to stay ahead.
The 29-year-old was unhappy with the judges' verdict and told BBC Sport: "I thought the scoring was a bit wrong, but that's boxing for you. "
I believe I won it but didn't get the decision."

The Yorkshire fighter is now aiming for revenge at this summer's London Olympics, having secured her place in the Great Britain Olympic squad by reached the semi-finals in Qinhuangdao.
"This hasn't dented my confidence. It's been a great experience and I've had an amazing time," added Adams.
"I qualified for the Olympics and that's what I came to do. In London, it'll be on my own turf so the score will be different then.
"I'll be going for gold. I'll get a bit fitter and have a bit more technical ability."
Women's boxing will feature at the Olympics for the first time at London 2012.
