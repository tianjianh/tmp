In 1997 a goods container filled with millions of Lego pieces fell off a ship and into the sea.
Since then hundreds of pieces have washed up on the beaches of Cornwall.
By chance many of the lost toys were ocean themed, so locals started finding miniature life jackets and octopuses on the beach - as well as dragons and daisies.
Ayshah visited the beach to talk to some keen Lego hunters.
