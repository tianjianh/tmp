The 33-year-old seam bowler, who has taken 420 Test wickets, is in the United Arab Emirates for his country's series against Pakistan.
This summer, he helped England regain the Ashes and took 7-77 for Lancashire against Essex, his best county figures.
"I consider it an honour and a privilege every time I wear the Red Rose," said the Burnley-born bowler.
"I am delighted to sign a new deal with the county I grew up supporting.
"Last season was a great year for Lancashire and I'm looking forward to seeing us progress under Ashley Giles back in Division One."
