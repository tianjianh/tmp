The region experienced a brief period of independence in the 1940s but China regained control after the Communists took power in 1949.
It is home to the Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighur minority who make up about 8 million of the province's 19 million people.
Rich in natural resources, economic development in the region has been accompanied by large-scale immigration of Han Chinese.
Many Uighurs complain of discrimination and marginalisation by the Chinese authorities. Anti-Han and separatist sentiment has become more prevalent since the 1990s, flaring into violence on occasion.
Population 21.8 million
Area 1,660,000 sq km (640,930 sq miles)
Major language Chinese, Uighur
Major religion Islam
Life expectancy 71 (men), 71 (women)
Xinjiang's media are tightly controlled by the local Communist Party and government. The Urumqi People's Broadcasting Station and the Xinjiang People's Broadcasting Station run radio and television broadcasts in Chinese, Uighur and minority languages.
Major state-run newspapers include the Chinese-language Xinjiang Economic Daily.
The authorities imposed a months-long shutdown of internet access in Xinjiang following the violent unrest in July 2009. Bloggers, netizens and website managers were "singled out for repression", Reporters Without Borders said.
