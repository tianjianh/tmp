[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull KR captain Terry Campese will miss the rest of the season after suffering a second serious hamstring injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Australia international scrum-half Campese ruptured a tendon in the second half of Rovers' 20-18 defeat by Wigan Warriors on 10 June.
The 31-year-old has only made five Super League appearances this season.
"His quality and leadership skills have been clear to see, so we shall certainly miss his influence," head of rugby Jamie Peacock said.
Hull KR are currently ninth in Super League with four games left to play, five points outside the top eight places.
