Garth Crooks' team of the week: De Gea, Bellerin, Mkhitaryan, Vardy, Costa, Zaha

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What a weekend in the Premier League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were goals galore, with champions Leicester putting four past Pep Guardiola's Manchester City and Watford and Burnley both scoring three times in their wins over Everton and Bournemouth respectively.
Hull and Crystal Palace shared six goals while Swansea scored three in a much-needed win over Sunderland.
Arsenal moved top on Saturday by beating Stoke, before Chelsea saw off West Brom a day later to regain the summit.
Manchester United and Southampton both claimed narrow wins against Tottenham and Middlesbrough, before Liverpool and West Ham played out a thrilling draw.

The save from Christian Eriksen's free-kick was first class but it wasn't my favourite. The save I thought was immense came in the first half when De Gea was confronted by every goalkeeper's nightmare as the Spain international suddenly couldn't see the ball.
In his keenness to set up his defensive wall, he found himself scampering across his line to save what would have been a certain goal. What made the save even better was the fact that the free-kick picked up pace as the ball spun off the turf. To put these saves into perspective, you had to see the relief on the faces of the Manchester United players, not to mention manager Jose Mourinho. It would appear the boys at Old Trafford are starting to feel the pressure.
Well, Irish eyes must be smiling in Lancashire after two goals by Irishmen and three well-earned points for Burnley.
Jeff Hendrick got the stunning opener but Stephen Ward provided the goal that gave the Clarets a little breathing space in what became a stifling encounter. What impressed me most about Ward's goal was the speed of his reaction. Artur Boruc did well to make the save but Ward was on the rebound like a cobra to make it 2-0.
However, I continue to be slightly bemused by managers. Sean Dyche felt that football is a time trial and the whistle must be blown in line with the time added board. Players play until the whistle. The time added is an indicator for the referee, and players continue to do their job until the referee blows for time. It's not the referee's fault if they can't defend in the meantime.
I have always thought highly of this defender, especially his competitive qualities. He reminds me of his compatriot and 1978 World Cup-winning captain Daniel Passarella - relatively small in stature but a giant in the battle.
Rojo can play anywhere across the back four, but I like him at centre-back where he can attack the ball and the man if necessary. Manchester United never heard a peep out of Tottenham's Harry Kane and that was all down to Rojo.
Nine wins on the trot for the Blues suggest a Premier League title could be calling for Gary Cahill and his team-mates once more.
The Chelsea captain was superb against a disciplined and well-organised West Brom side - a point Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola might want to consider.
It was obvious that David Luiz was still suffering from the effects of last week's appalling challenge from Sergio Aguero. The Brazilian was determined to play but needed some care and attention at the back, and he got it from his skipper.
Cahill covered everything and took charge of a situation that normally Luiz would have handled. Another clean sheet for Chelsea and a captain's performance by Cahill.
When Hector Bellerin plays for Arsenal they tend to win. His quality of pass is so good when he is in the final third of the pitch, it's quite impressive.
The substitute had only been on the pitch for a few minutes, having come back from injury, and he was causing Stoke all kinds of problems down the right. The full-back then produced the most wonderful ball for Theo Walcott to equalise and almost immediately set up a chance for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who should have done better. Bellerin is a fabulous talent and earned his place in the Arsenal team.
As for Stoke, it was a valiant effort with notable performances particularly from Joe Allen and Charlie Adam. However Adam needs to be careful. He caught Alexis Sanchez with a nasty clip as he played a one-two with Alex Iwobi for Arsenal's third goal.
He got away with what might have been interpreted as an clumsy error by some, but a stamp by others who know what actually takes place on a football field. Adam got away with it this time but it might cost him and his team in the future.
This lad is capable of unbelievable things, the only problem is you don't know when the unbelievable is going to happen. Against Hull he was unplayable.
You sensed something special was going on when he danced around three players, got in on goal and missed the target but what took place thereafter was just sensational as he almost single-handedly took Hull apart. He was brought down for Crystal Palace's penalty and assisted in their equaliser. But the moment to savour was Zaha's goal because it was special.
The draw was the least Palace deserved after a shameful dive in the box by Hull's Robert Snodgrass, and two penalty appeals turned down by referee Michael Jones. Both of the challenges were on Christian Benteke, the second of which looked more like an assault than a foul.
Thank goodness Zaha is capable of producing the occasional performance like this. I suppose if he did this every week, he'd be playing for Real Madrid and not Crystal Palace.
What a goal. The control was a bit special but the quality of the finish just blew me away. He said in his post-match interview that he wants to score goals - well he won't score many better goals in his career than his strike against Bournemouth.
However, it wasn't just the goal that set Hendrick's performance apart from the rest, but his overall contribution. On another day he might have had a penalty when Harry Arter bundled Hendrick over in the box and it again showed that the player has a healthy nose for sniffing out goals.
I was as surprised as anyone to see Henrikh Mkhitaryan find it so difficult to get into this Manchester United side. I had observed his talents when he was at Borussia Dortmund and thought "what an excellent signing". His performance in the opening game of the season proved again that the Premier League is no stroll in the park, and the player paid the price for not starting well.
However, this week has proved a great success for the Armenia international. His goal and performance in the Europa League demonstrated what he is capable of and against Spurs he looked even more impressive. What a pity that such a poor tackle by Tottenham's Danny Rose robbed the best player on the pitch from finishing a match he seem to control from the start.
Three brilliantly taken goals by Jamie Vardy made Manchester City look less than ordinary. Vardy was back to his predatory best and I can't make up my mind which of his goals I enjoyed the most - his first, which he rifled past Claudio Bravo into the side of the net? Or his third, which he screwed over the line from what appeared an impossible angle?
However, what is most disturbing about this encounter was Manchester City's attitude. When is Pep Guardiola going to take the Premier League seriously? How on earth the Manchester City boss expected go to the King Power Stadium with such a cavalier approach to their defensive responsibilities I can't imagine.
What did Guardiola expect? That Leicester would be so intimidated by the reputation of City's attacking flair they would be scared stiff? Well, we saw what Vardy and his team-mates thought of that notion, didn't we? They absolutely shredded Manchester City in 30 minutes and it was nothing less than the visitors deserved for displaying such arrogance.
I hated this player last season and now I am starting to love him. What a finish, what a performance and what a victory for Chelsea. One goal was always going to decide this fixture and it was a simple matter of who was going to make the first mistake.
Unfortunately for West Brom, it was Gareth McAuley, who has been outstanding for the Baggies once again this season. He let Diego Costa in on a pass he had no right to win and what then took place was quite extraordinary.
Costa, having won what appeared to be a lost cause, took aim from the most acute angle and curled a sensational shot into the top corner. Costa seems to be putting all his efforts into his game and seems to be less concerned with setting fires all over the pitch.
His first goal was just fabulous and his second wasn't bad either. Stefano Okaka has found adjusting to life in the Premier League quite demanding, having been delayed by injury.
However, his manager has persevered with the striker, which has been fortunate for Walter Mazzarri with Odion Ighalo suffering from second-season syndrome.
This was Everton's fourth successive away league defeat and I can't remember when I have seen such abject defending on set plays. I have said it before, something is not quite right at Goodison Park and they need to fix it quickly.
