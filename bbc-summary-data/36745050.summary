[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Bates, 43, and Fraser, seven, died after being hit by a car in Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taff, in December.
Joshua Staples, 22, from Tonyrefail, admitted two counts of causing death by careless driving without due care and attention at Cardiff Crown Court.
Mr Bates' wife Anna-Louise said the family would never get over their loss.
The father and son, of Llanishen, Cardiff, died after being hit by Staples' car as they crossed the A4119 at Talbot Green, at about 12:30 GMT on 6 December.
Mr Bates, an IT programme manager, was taken to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital at nearby Llantrisant, where he died from his injuries.
Fraser was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital but he died from head injuries.
Staples pleaded not guilty to charges of causing death by dangerous driving and his plea was accepted.
As well as being jailed, he was also disqualified from driving for two years and eight months.
In a statement released after the case, Mrs Bates, who also has a young daughter, said her family was relieved Staples had accepted responsibility for his actions.
"We as a family will never get over the tragic and sudden loss of Stuart and Fraser," she said.
"Whilst we understand and respect our legal system we have never sought retribution against the driver.
"However, we are relieved that he accepted responsibility for his actions.
"The custodial sentence imposed will give all parties the time and opportunity to reflect and for the healing process to begin."
She added: "We would like to thank the wider community for the support they have shown our family and now look to continue the positive legacy of the boys with our charity, Believe."
