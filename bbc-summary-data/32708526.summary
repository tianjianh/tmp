Lord Hardie said: "The Edinburgh Tram Inquiry must base its findings on direct evidence from those affected by the planning and construction phase."
He added: "Whether a local resident, business, developer or other interested party, this is the public's opportunity to offer views on the direction of the inquiry and to provide evidence for consideration."
Trams started running last year on the 8.7-mile (14km) route between Edinburgh's New Town and Edinburgh Airport, which cost Â£776m to build.
An inquiry into the project was commissioned by Scottish ministers in June 2014. Its terms of reference are to:

The deadline for submitting written evidence to the inquiry is 4 August.
