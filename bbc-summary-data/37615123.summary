[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gillingham 1-1 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Franck Moussa's second-half strike earned Walsall a draw at Gillingham, who are now without a win in five games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cody McDonald headed the Gills into a half-time lead, but Moussa converted from close range after 59 minutes to leave the home side still awaiting their first clean sheet of the season.
Defender Max Elmer forced a fine double save from Walsall keeper Neil Etheridge in the 18th minute.
Seven minutes later Gillingham went in front when a long pass forward from centre-back Deji Oshilaja found Scott Wagstaff, whose cross to the back post was met by McDonald to plant a header home.
Having offered little threat going forwards, the visitors then grabbed an equaliser against the run of play.
Paul Konchesky was robbed of possession and, after Jonathan Bond had spilt the eye-catching Erhun Oztumer's long-range strike, Moussa scored the simplest of rebounds.
With 10 minutes remaining, Gills went close to a winner when a curling Bradley Dack free-kick from 25 yards brought an acrobatic save from Etheridge who tipped onto the crossbar.
