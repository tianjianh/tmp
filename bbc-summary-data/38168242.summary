[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£30m centre at Berkeley will focus on skills for green and nuclear energy, as well as digital and cyber training.
It has been partly funded by South Gloucestershire and Stroud College and the Local Enterprise Partnership.
SGS Berkeley Green UTC is intended to help tackle a local shortage of skills in science, technology and engineering.
Principal Andy Keenan said: "Considering that engineering and digital sectors are such large employers in the region, it's really important that we have people graduating from schools and colleges who've got the skills to work in those sectors."
The centre is located on the Gloucestershire Science and Technology Park, and will provide education for students aged 14-18 from next September.
It is one of 60 UTCs planned or already established nationally.
