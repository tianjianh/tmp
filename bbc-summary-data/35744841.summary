[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Underground train drivers with the Aslef union have voted to accept a pay deal for a new all-night Tube service.

Drivers from the Rail, Maritime and Transport union have unanimously backed the deal.
Aslef officer Finn Brennan said the new agreement offered "real improvements in conditions".
Maintenance workers represented by the TSSA and RMT have rejected the proposal, as have Unite members.
Aslef said its members voted by almost nine to one to accept the deal, clearing another hurdle in plans for a Night Tube.
The service was due to start on some lines at weekends last September but has been delayed because of failure to reach agreement with the unions over pay and conditions.
Aslef officer Finn Brennan said union members' "strength and solidarity have achieved an above-inflation pay rise and real improvements in conditions that will give drivers, and other grades, much more flexibility and control over their work-life balance".
Steve Griffiths, London Underground's chief operating officer, said: "I'm pleased that Aslef members have voted to accept our offer.
"This is a fair and affordable pay deal."
Mr Griffiths added LU wanted to "deliver the night Tube for London as quickly as possible".
