Nicknamed Trevor the Weather, he began his broadcasting career with the BBC before presenting weather bulletins on Southern Television and TVS throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s.
ITV said he had been a "much loved" presenter.
A family statement said he died at his home in London following a short illness.
Swansea-born Baker joined the Met Office at the age of 18 before serving with the RAF during World War Two.
In the early 1960s he began his TV career with the BBC before joining Southern Television in Southampton as a regular presenter on the Day by Day programme and was later given his own show - The Trevor Baker All Weather Show.
Because of his Welsh origins, he soon established the nickname Trevor the Weather although to many viewers he was simply known as Trevor.
He continued appearing on the Coast to Coast regional news programme after TVS took over the ITV franchise for southern England.
After his retirement in 1987 he spent 20 years working as a volunteer at Southampton General Hospital, taking a confectionery trolley around the wards.
