Jersey bus fares stay the same despite petrol price cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cost of travelling by bus in Jersey will not go down despite a drop in the price of oil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bus operator Liberty Bus said its prices are set a year in advance by its supplier so fuel price changes have no direct impact on tickets.
The company would not say when the fuel price was last set, claiming it is commercially sensitive and controlled by parent company HTC Group.
Some petrol stations in Jersey are now selling petrol at 93.9p per litre.
There are two fare bands for travel in Jersey; shorter journeys are Â£1.30 and longer journeys are Â£1.80.
The last increase in bus ticket prices was in January 2014, up by 10p per journey and was the first increase in two years.
