Cardiff Blues' George Earle 'devastated' after red card against Bath

Cardiff Blues head coach Danny Wilson says George Earle's sending off in the European Challenge Cup defeat by Bath was harsh.

South African Earle was sent off after making contact with the eyes of Bath lock Tom Ellis early in the second half of the 38-3 loss.
But Wilson believes the contact was accidental and the TV replays will have misled the officials:
"He's devastated, he's not that type of player," Wilson said.
"I don't think there's any intent to go for his eyes or any foul play in that.
"He's come to me straight afterwards and said 'I certainly wasn't going for any face or eyes, that's not me.'
"It doesn't help when it's slowed down and freeze framed and it makes it look like his on his face for a period of time.
"He's fighting to try and get through a maul. His head is down in the maul and once in that split second his hand is anywhere near his face he's moved it away.
"But I know laws are laws and if his hand is on his face and it's slowed down and made to look like it's on there for a period of time then the referee's put in a difficult predicament.
"It's now happened and we've got to deal with it."
Bath ended Blues' 100% start in the Challenge Cup with a comfortable win at The Rec and are joint leaders of Pool Four.
"Up until the red card I was reasonably pleased - we were away from home and being very competitive," Wilson said.
"Ultimately the game was decided on the red card giving us a very difficult position to defend against a good Bath team.
"We go into the last two matches now with all to play for."
Injury-struck Blues also suffered further injuries to captain Sam Warburton (back), Blaine Scully (concussion) and Steve Shingler (hamstring).
Wilson said Wales captain Warburton's back injury is not too serious.
