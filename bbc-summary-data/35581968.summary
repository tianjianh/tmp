Jak Alnwick: Port Vale keeper taking transfer talk in his stride

Port Vale goalkeeper Jak Alnwick says he is not letting speculation over his future affect his form for the League One play-off contenders.

The 22-year-old has kept 11 clean sheets this term for ninth-placed Vale and was linked with promotion rivals Wigan and Championship club Preston in the January transfer window.
"You're always going to have rumours if you're playing well," Alnwick said.
"I'm over the moon to be here and there's no reason for that to change."
Alnwick, who signed a two-and-a-half year deal in October after initially joining Vale on a short-term deal from Premier League Newcastle United, has been an integral part of a defence that has let in 36 goals in 32 games - the sixth best record in the division.
And he says he takes the reports over his future as a compliment.
"I think you have to but it's good to see other people are recognising that I'm doing well," he added to BBC Radio Stoke.
"I'm playing games and it's a great group of lads here - I love it."
Successive draws - against Coventry and Fleetwood - have checked Vale's push towards the top six after their 1-0 win over Swindon at the start of the month.
And Alnwick admits they need to be more ruthless if they are to close the current five-point gap to Millwall in the last play-off spot.
"We're hard to beat and we create a lot of chances but we weren't clinical enough and got caught on the counter-attack - it happened against Coventry and again against Fleetwood," he said.
"We've got a great record at home but we need to start picking points up on the road."
