Al-Qaeda training manual 'found in Aberdeen flat'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An al-Qaeda training manual was found at the Aberdeen flat of a man accused of terrorism offences, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yousif Badri, 29, is accused of being involved in conduct "with the intention of committing acts of terrorism".
The medical student denies three charges under the Terrorism Act.
A jury at the High Court in Glasgow was told the manual was found on a computer hard drive.
DC Mark White, a member of Police Scotland's organised crime and counter terrorism team, was asked to describe the document, which ran to dozens of pages.
He replied: "A manual created by al-Qaeda. This appears to be a scanned copy which has been translated into English."
The court heard the document discussed weapons, explosives, and how to prepare false documents.
DC White said: "It is basically a manual if you want to kill somebody or blow something up and how to avoid detection."
The jury was also shown photographs found on a memory stick taken from the flat.
One of them showed a man with his face partially covered with a red and white scarf and holding an assault rifle.
DC White was asked if the photograph resembled anyone and he replied: "I believe it resembles Mr Badri."
Mr Badri's flat at Ashgrove Road in Aberdeen was searched in June, 2013.
The offences are said to have been carried out at two places in Aberdeen - Mr Badri's former flat in Ashgrove Road, and in Berryden Retail Park.
His current address in Halifax, West Yorkshire, is also listed in the allegations.
The trial, before judge Lord Turnbull, continues.
