The 20-year-old centre-back is yet to make his debut for the Blues but has been a regular for the club's under-21 side over the last two seasons.
"Dion has to force his way into the side but this move will be good for his development," Shots manager Garry Waddock said.
"The physical demands of the league will be a learning curve for him."
