Adrian Bayford, 41, and his 40-year-old wife Gillian, of Haverhill, Suffolk, won the UK's second biggest ever lottery prize in Friday's lottery draw.
Speaking at a media briefing, Mrs Bayford said they would share the money with people who had supported them.
They have a six-year-old daughter Aimee and a son, Cameron, aged four.
Mr Bayford, who co-owns Suffolk Music Centre in Haverhill, said he convinced his wife that they had both forgotten to buy a ticket when they watched Friday's draw.
He then went and checked the ticket he had bought, with Mrs Bayford describing him as "going a bit pale".
She said: "I checked the numbers on my phone, the TV, the internet - and we just looked at each other and giggled."
Mrs Bayford, a health care assistant at the children's ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, said they did not sleep that night.
The couple, who have been married for eight years, spent the night on the internet deciding how to spend the huge jackpot, the result of 14 rollovers.
Mrs Bayford said she planned to quit her job but her husband, originally from Hayle in Cornwall, said he wanted to return to the business he started as a market stall.
"I find it hard to take in the actual quantity of it," added Mrs Bayford.

It was the moment the identity of Britain's newest multi-millionaires was revealed.
As Adrian and Gillian Bayford stepped into the media briefing, they were met with a flurry of flash bulbs and television cameras.
The assembled ranks of around 50 journalists were waiting at the luxury hotel in Hertfordshire, keen to learn what they intended to spend their vast fortune on.
After spending time smiling, kissing and turning on cue for television cameras and newspaper photographers, it was time for the questions.
Sitting side by side, they seemed happy to speak about what their lives had been like and how it might change now.
Despite their newly-found riches, Gillian confessed it might be hard to kick old habits, revealing that she had already bought another lottery ticket.
"We have always worked and saved up for holidays or things that we need.
"We have lived within our means and been comfortable but we have been like ships in the night to earn the income we needed.
"It will be fantastic to spend more time as a family now.
"This money has come at the right time for us and is going to benefit the whole family."
They said the amount they won was life-changing "not just for us, for everyone", saying they would look to repay people who have helped them financially, both friends and family.
"It is such a large amount that it isn't something for one person," Mrs Bayford added.
"It is something to share with other people, people that need help, people that have helped us and supported us."
She added: "I'm Scottish, we're known for being tight, I'll still be hitting the sales.
"This month had been an extremely tight month, to be honest.
"We had gone shopping the other day and I had spent some money on the children for some holiday clothes.
"I actually got home that night and thought 'hmmm, I really shouldn't have spent that' because I'm a bit short this month, my night shifts hadn't been as many as I previously had."
The couple plan to start the search for their dream home, with Mrs Bayford keen to buy the car of her dreams, an Audi Q7.
Her husband said he had always wanted to visit the Canadian Rockies by train, and the children want to go to Disney World.
Mrs Bayford, who is originally from Kirkcaldy in Fife, added: "Children's charities are close to our hearts so we will be exploring how we can use this money to help those charities but it is too soon to say exactly what."
According to The Sunday Times Rich List, they now have a fortune to rival Jamie and Jools Oliver (£150m), Sir Tom Jones (£140m) and Eric Clapton (£130m).
Their win places them 516th in Britain's Rich List.
