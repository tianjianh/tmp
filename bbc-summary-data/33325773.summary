Campaigners lose Blackdog substation challenge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two campaigners have lost a bid to stop the construction of electricity substations for the Aberdeen offshore wind farm opposed by Donald Trump.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developers had earlier won an appeal against an Aberdeenshire Council decision to reject the proposal.
Lawyers for local residents Nicola Brown and Edna Booth argued in the Court of Session that the Blackdog works could pose a danger to health.
But Lady Smith said the earlier appeal had been considered legally.
The substation development at Blackdog is just a few miles from the American tycoon's Menie estate and golf course.
Mr Trump claims the wind farm development would spoil the view from his complex.
