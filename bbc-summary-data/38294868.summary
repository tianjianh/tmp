The FA has also spoken to ex-Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and former Chelsea skipper Frank Lampard about getting involved in the pilot scheme.
Individuals are assessed and then the FA puts together a learning programme.
Three of the 92 Premier and Football League managers played for England.

Keith Curle, Mike Phelan and Nigel Clough have 18 caps between them.
"St George's Park is very much open to ex-England players," said FA technical director Dan Ashworth.
"We are keen to get more English coaches either working with our national teams or back into the Premier League or Football League as coaches and managers. I have been in regular contact with several current and ex-England internationals about a pilot programme."
In the case of Scholes, the assessment would determine whether he has the right skills to coach other players how to pass the ball, based on his playing career which shows he has all the practical ability required to demonstrate that skill.
The length of time it takes to complete the courses depends on the individual, as they still have to complete the modules required to get their badges. Scholes, 42, is currently doing his badges at Blackburn.
