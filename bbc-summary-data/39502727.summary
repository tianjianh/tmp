The Royal Yachting Association (RYA) has extended its programme of sailing and windsurfing taster sessions to 360 clubs across the country for 2017.

Entitled 'Push the Boat Out' and running from 13-21 May, the scheme allows beginners to take to the water and learn the basics of water-craft in free or low-cost sessions.
"Sailing is such an accessible sport and many aren't aware of opportunities close to them or how affordable the sport can be," said Alistair Dickson, RYA Director of Sport Development.
More than 90,000 people have taken part since the programme's initial launch in 2013, with hundreds becoming members of sailing clubs and signing up for further courses of instruction.
Saskia Clark - who won gold for Team GB at Rio 2016 in the 470 Women's class - said Push the Boat Out is an ideal way to get people who have never tried the sport before out onto the water.
"I got into sailing through my local sailing club [Royal Harwich Yacht Club], so it's fantastic to see so many people given the opportunity to discover what the sport's all about, right on their doorstep," she said.
To sign up for Push the Boat Out, visit the RYA website and find your nearest participating sailing club or centre.
