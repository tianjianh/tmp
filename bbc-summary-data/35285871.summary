Leading Logistician Scott Furber, 29, denies voyeurism in relation to the incident on board HMS Diamond.
A woman told the court she felt "horrible and violated" when she found out the consensual act was filmed.
The trial at Portsmouth Naval Base heard sex violates the navy's "no touching rule" for sailors.
The hearing was told the pair had sex in the showers of HMS Diamond while it was docked alongside Limassol in Cyprus on 9 June 2014.
The alleged victim told the court martial she had spent time earlier that day with a group, including the defendant, on a beach, during which they had drunk and he had applied sun cream on her back.
She said they had flirted over text message and arranged to have sex in the showers on this ship later and denied she had agreed to film the meeting.
When she was informed they had been filmed, she said: "I was shocked, completely shocked."
The court heard the defendant had put his iPhone on a shelf in the shower before his colleague arrived and made a 10-minute recording of their encounter.
He can be seen grinning at the camera.
Major David Whittaker, prosecuting, said the recording came to light in October when colleagues asked Mr Furber about it.
He said Mr Furber, based at HMS Excellent in Portsmouth, initially denied making the recording and had told investigators the only recording on his phone was of his fiancÃ©e.
The defendant later admitted making the recording but claimed the alleged victim had agreed to the filming.
The court martial continues.
