Barnsley 3-2 Leeds United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnsley scored three goals in nine minutes to come from behind and beat Leeds United in an enthralling Championship derby at Oakwell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Wood tapped in his 18th goal of the season to put Leeds ahead, before Tom Bradshaw's header on the stroke of half-time began the turnaround.
On-loan winger Ryan Kent swivelled and fired in low to put the Tykes in front.
Conor Hourihane's free-kick made it 3-1, before Wood's penalty after a handball resulted in a tense finish.
The spot-kick was highly controversial, with the ball appearing to hit Barnsley defender Marc Roberts' hand outside the area, but referee Mike Dean pointed to the spot and Wood coolly converted.
It gave Leeds more than 20 minutes to try to find an equaliser, but the hosts' defence - which has leaked 41 goals this season - held on.
Kemar Roofe did have a glorious opportunity to level for Leeds in stoppage time when he bundled wide from a few yards out.
Barnsley captain Hourihane's 25-yard set-piece, which he bent into the top corner, was the pick of the five goals - although it could be his last for the Yorkshire side having been strongly linked with a move to Aston Villa.
The game was also marred by pockets of crowd trouble after Wood's opening goal, but police seemed to quickly separate opposing fans and the rest of the match appeared to pass off peacefully.
Defeat brings Leeds' six-game unbeaten league run to an end, with Huddersfield overtaking them to go third in the table.
Barnsley move back up to eighth and just four points outside the play-offs.
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom: "I was pleased from the first minute to the last. We did everything we spoke about before the game.
"I think we deserved the win and to come back from behind shows our character.
"We demand a lot and the players love it. They love performing that way and it's good to watch, high intensity and high energy.
"When we play as well as that it'll be tough for a team to beat us."
Leeds boss Garry Monk: "A disappointing result and we're frustrated to lose the game.
"We made the critical mistake of conceding on the stroke of half-time. We were too reactive and they got the goal.
"In the second half they get two quick goals and from our point of view they're poor goals to concede.
"We've been playing at such a high standard so we will have this odd game now and then where we don't perform at our usual high levels."
