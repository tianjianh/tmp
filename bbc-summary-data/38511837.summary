National Botanic Garden of Wales' John Gwyndaf Ellis dies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Gwyndaf Ellis, vice-chairman of the board of trustees at the National Botanic Garden of Wales, has died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Ellis, 78, from Llanddarog, near Carmarthen, had been at the garden for more than 20 years. He was also the last director of education for Dyfed County Council.
He was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours last year.
The botanic garden's director Huw Francis said he would be "sorely missed".
Mr Ellis was also a prominent figure in a number of other public bodies.
He was a founder member of language promotion body Menter Cwm Gwendraeth; vice-president of Dolen Cymru Lesotho, which helps orphans in the southern Africa kingdom; and an ambassador for the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.
Mr Francis said: "John had not been well for a while but, like most things in his life, he fought hard to maintain his usual high level of passion and commitment.
"He will be sorely missed here at the garden where the impact of his unstinting efforts and hard work, over many years, cannot be underestimated."
Born in Abergynolwyn in Gwynedd, Mr Ellis, a widower, leaves two children and six grandchildren.
