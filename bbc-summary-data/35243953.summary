Conor Townsend: Scunthorpe sign Hull City full-back

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe have signed Hull City full-back Conor Townsend on a free transfer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old scored twice in 12 games during a recent loan spell with Grimsby Town this season and now joins the Iron on a two-and-a-half-year deal.
Townsend, who spent time on loan with Scunthorpe last term, will not be able to play against Chelsea in the FA Cup on Sunday as he is Cup-tied.
He is the second defender to join the Iron this month after Huddersfield's Murray Wallace made his loan permanent.
