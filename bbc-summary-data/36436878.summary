Rhyl jobseekers face 40-mile trip for appointments

Up to 100 jobseekers in Rhyl face a round trip of more than 40 miles to attend mandatory job search appointments, following the closure of the local PeoplePlus office.

People have been told they will have to travel to Flint after the office shuts on Friday.
The jobseekers found out when they overheard staff being told.
PeoplePlus said "rising employment" was responsible, and it would continue to pay for jobseekers' travel.
The company offers support and training to people looking for work on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions.
Former steel erector Ieuan Mulholland, 21, who has been unemployed for a year, said he felt people in Rhyl were being discriminated against.
"This will decrease my chances of finding a job.
"I have to use the service twice a week, but can pop in any time and often use it up to four times a week. I won't have that option any more."
Joel Payne, PeoplePlus's regional director for Wales, said the organisation would continue to run an outreach office in Rhyl.
"However, due to rising employment and fewer referrals to the scheme, most of our activities will be based in Flint," he added.
"Those who are unable to make the journey will be able to use our office in Rhyl."
