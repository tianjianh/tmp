The Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner has expressed concern that more officers are not interested in becoming chief constables.

Tim Passmore revealed the issue had been raised with the Home Office after Gareth Wilson was appointed Suffolk Chief Constable - the only candidate.
The last chief constable, Douglas Paxton, appointed in 2013, was also the only candidate for the job.
Mr Passmore said he had raised the issue with the Home Office.
The Home Office said: "It is entirely a matter for Police and Crime Commissioners to make decisions around appointing chief constables.
"In their leadership review, the College of Policing made a recommendation to create more flexibility in police careers and we will support them in considering other options to encourage more movement."
Mr Passmore stressed that Mr Wilson was an extremely good candidate with strong "energy, drive and leadership qualities".
Asked on BBC Radio Suffolk if he had been the only candidate, Mr Passmore replied: "He was, and I know that people might be critical of that but if I may share with you that... I think six out of the last eight appointments to constabularies have actually only had a single applicant, including surprisingly Thames Valley, which is a huge force, covering three counties.
"So yes, we're not alone in this."
He said he had raised the issue with the Home Secretary on why more police officers were not interested in becoming chief constables.
Mr Wilson joined Suffolk Constabulary in July 2014 in the role of Deputy Chief Constable, and was Assistant Chief Constable at Norfolk Constabulary from 2012.
Prior to that he spent 23 years with Essex Police in a mix of both CID and uniformed roles.
The Police and Crime Panel's chief constable confirmation hearing takes place on 6 January.
