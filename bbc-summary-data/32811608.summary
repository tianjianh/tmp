[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pace bowler Tom Bailey produced a career-best performance as Lancashire skittled Leicestershire for just 78 to win by 244 runs at Grace Road.

He claimed 5-12 after the Red Rose club declared on 203-5, leaving the home side a target of 323 from 59 overs.
Leicestershire went from 20-0 to 29-7 in the space of seven overs, thanks to Bailey and Kyle Jarvis (2-10).
Clint McKay hit 24 before Nathan Buck (2-22) took the last wicket against his old club when Charlie Shreck fell.
The manner of their defeat was a body blow for Leicestershire, who are still searching for a first Championship victory since 2012.
But they were undone by fast, straight bowling from Bailey and Jarvis, who each sent down nine overs with the new ball and were backed up by some excellent catching from Lancashire's fielders.
Home skipper Mark Cosgrove was late getting into position for an attempted hook from a short Jarvis delivery and top-edged a catch to wicketkeeper Alex Davies, who later sprinted several yards into the leg-side to catch McKay off Buck.
Only two batsmen apart from McKay reached double figures as they were dismissed in just 30.3 overs.
Earlier, Davies made 54 off 57 balls in a partnership of 107 with Ashwell Prince, who remained 76 not out when Lancashire made their declaration.
Leicestershire captain Mark Cosgrove:
"So far this season we've played some pretty good cricket, so to put up a performance like that was pretty disappointing.
"Sometimes it happens. The pitch was fine, we just didn't play as well as we should have.
"The dressing room isn't happy, but we know we're moving forward and while this is a setback, it's how you bounce back."
Lancashire paceman Tom Bailey:
"I've done a bit of work with Chappie (former captain Glen Chapple) during the games, and it's really helped.
"I was trying to bowl like Brett Lee from the top end in the first innings, and I'm not that fast.
"I calmed down a bit in the second, tried to use my skills, and it paid off."
