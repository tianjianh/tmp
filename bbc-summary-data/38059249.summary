Flood sirens were sounded in the Calder Valley in West Yorkshire, including the town of Hebden Bridge which took the brunt of last winter's floods.
The Environment Agency uses the sirens to warn communities when rivers are expected to flood.
Twenty flood warnings remained in force across the region on Monday night.
Localised flooding was reported in Sheffield, Ilkley, Otley and Todmorden.
Meanwhile, many train services were disrupted with Trans-Pennine Express advising people not to travel and Northern Rail reporting all lines blocked due to flooding between Sheffield and New Mills.
