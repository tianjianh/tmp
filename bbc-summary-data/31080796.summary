Namibian childbirth safety helped by UHW doctors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A team of doctors from the University Hospital of Wales are trying to make childbirth safer in Namibia to ensure fewer mothers and babies die.

Mothers in the sub-Saharan African country are 17 times more likely to die as they give birth than those in Wales.
Now the doctors are working on Cardiff University's Phoenix Project to run anaesthesia courses for their counterparts in Namibia.
It is hoped they will then be able to give better care to expectant mothers.
Prof Judith Hall, who is running the project, said she will be visiting the country to run three intensive courses this year.
"We need to save mums from the three big killers: infections, bleeding and fitting because of high blood pressure," she said.
"After that I'm hoping to introduce, along with the University of Namibia and the health system, the first ever speciality course for doctors over there, so that they can have specialists just as we do in Wales."
