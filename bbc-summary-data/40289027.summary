Zoo bosses say a decision not to put down a rare male Malayan tiger that killed its keeper was supported by the victim's parents.

Rosa King, 33, died at Hamerton Zoo Park in Cambridgeshire on 29 May when she and the tiger, which the zoo said was called Cicip, entered an enclosure.
The zoo, which has been shut since the attack, is due to reopen on Friday.
It comes after it passed a licence and public safety inspection by Huntingdonshire Council.
The park's director Andrew Swales said the decision to reopen had been taken "in consultation with the police, our staff and Rosa's family".
He added: "While this remains a very difficult time for all concerned, there has been tremendous support for this."
He described Ms King as the "life and soul of Hamerton Zoo Park".
"She loved working with animals, particularly the big cats, and was an inspiration to those of us lucky enough to work with her as well as the many visitors who benefited from her knowledge and passion for wildlife."
He said he could not comment further while a joint health and safety investigation led by the council and Cambridgeshire Police was ongoing.
An inquest into Ms King's death was opened and adjourned at Cambridgeshire Coroner's Court in Huntingdon last week.
Senior coroner David Heming said Ms King died of "traumatic injuries".
Following her death, Ms King's family said she "lived and breathed a vocation that meant the world to her".
A funeral service was held for her at St Andrew's Church in Chippenham on Wednesday.
