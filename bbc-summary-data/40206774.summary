The 29-year-old has signed a two-year deal with Karl Robinson's side after helping the Bantams to May's play-off final, where they lost to Millwall.
Clarke scored 25 goals in 122 games over three years for the Bantams.
"Billy is someone that I've tried to sign a number of times and I'm really excited that he will be joining us," boss Robinson told the club website.
"Billy ticks all of those boxes and on top of that he is also very talented. If you look on paper, he is up there with some of the best players in League One.
"He is very effective - can play in a number of positions - and he is certainly going to bring goals, creativity, energy and an aggressive streak to the team."
