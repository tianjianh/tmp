Gaviria, who has already won two stages at this year's event, was closely followed by Ireland's Sam Bennett.
It is a first Giro stage win for 22-year-old Australian Ewan.
Thomas retained second behind Jungels after the 224km ride to Alberobello - with fellow Briton Adam Yates third.
Orica-Scott rider Yates is 10 seconds behind Quick-Step's Jungels, on the same time as favourites Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali, who also finished safely in the main bunch on Friday.
Saturday's stage is a 189km route from Molfetta to Peschici that features a category-two climb about halfway through.
