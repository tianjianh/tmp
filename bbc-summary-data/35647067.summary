The winning player matched numbers 23, 25, 32, 37, 42 and Lucky Stars 01 and 11 to make them the sole winner of Tuesday's draw.
It is the second British ticket to win the top prize this month, after a £24m jackpot was won in 12 February's draw.
A National Lottery spokesman said it had been a "lucky" year for UK National Lottery players.
"Last year saw an unprecedented nine UK EuroMillions jackpot winners and this year we have already had two massive wins here and it's only February," the spokesman added.
EuroMillions began in 2004 and the biggest prize in UK history was £161m, won by Scottish couple Chris and Colin Weir in 2011.
