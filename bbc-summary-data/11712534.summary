[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cyril Donovan Brown, 44, of Lyndhurst Road, Luton, was told by Judge Barbara Mensah at Luton Crown Court that he was a "dangerous predator".
Brown raped two women in Luton in August months after finishing a six-year sentence for another rape.
Judge Mensah said he would serve a minimum of 24 years in prison.
Prosecutor Isabel Delamere said Brown was violent towards women who he formed controlling relationships with.
He raped them when they did not want to have sex with him, she said.
He also had a previous conviction for assaulting another woman who refused to have sex with him.
Brown, who claimed he was having affairs with 15 women at the same time, was convicted of eight rapes and three assaults.
Judge Mensah said she was passing a life sentence to ensure he would be on licence for the rest of his life.
"You are obsessed with sex and delusional about your relationships with women," she added.
She said the earliest he would be able to apply for parole would be after serving 12 years of his sentence.
