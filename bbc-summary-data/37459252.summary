Carlisle United 2-0 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Second-half goals from Jason Kennedy and Jabo Ibehre helped Carlisle beat Colchester 2-0 and extend their unbeaten start to the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cumbrians have gone 11 League Two games without defeat since the start of the campaign - a club record - and are up to third in the table.
Carlisle's early pressure failed to yield too many clear-cut chances although Michael Raynes was inches off sliding home a Jason Kennedy flick-on after Danny Grainger swung over a corner from the right.
The home side were second best for periods before half-time, but improved after the break and Raynes forced Sam Walker to tip his close-range header on to the crossbar.
Raynes was involved again when Kennedy gave Carlisle the lead in the 50th minute, the defender heading Nicky Adams' corner back across the face of goal for Kennedy to force home.
Colchester missed a great chance to level the scores in the 66th minute when Sammie Szmodics found himself one-on-one with Gillespie but lifted the ball over the goalkeeper and over the bar from eight yards.
Szmodics then had a diving header cleared off the line, but substitute Ibehre relieved the tension in the 79th minute when his header from Grainger's corner on the left slipped through Walker's hands and into the net.
