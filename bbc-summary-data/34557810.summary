Vale's on-loan striker Uche Ikpeazu received a second yellow card halfway though the first period for diving.
Robbie Weir was then shown a straight red for a foul 10 minutes from time, just before Naylor fired Burton ahead.
El Khayati secured victory, finishing a fine solo run to slot past Jak Alnwick.
Vale, who have slipped to 17th after four league games without a win, also had four other players booked in an ill-tempered game of six yellow cards and two reds.
Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's promotion-chasing Burton remain third, just two points off top spot, following their first win in four matches.

Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told BBC Radio Derby:
"I must say, we deserved it. We were the better team. They made it very difficult for us and it is all respect to the boys for what they have done.
"We will see more teams coming here, trying to upset us, trying to shut up shop, not to give nothing away. We have to find a way to break them down. It took a while but we found the net and it was important for morale.
"I've no complaints about the red cards. The only thing I didn't understand in the first half was the yellow for their striker. When you see an elbow it's a straight red."
Port Vale manager Rob Page told BBC Radio Stoke:
"You give a performance like that, when they're throwing their bodies on the line in defence and do what they've done for a large part of the game with 10 men, it's harsh to come away with a 2-0 defeat.
"It's a big ask for anybody. They've given me everything. They had to work their socks off. The fans were superb. They really got behind the lads. They could see and appreciate the work the lads put in.
"We're all frustrated, but it's important we all stick together and get through this tough spell. We can't feel sorry for ourselves now. Only we can change it."
