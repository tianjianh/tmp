They were deregistered by the firm following a regionwide review.
Now new services have been registered for Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk along "similar routes" to those previously operated.
Perryman's Buses will run services in Hawick town centre, Bannerfield to Galashiels and a school bus between Oxton, Lauder and Earlston High School.
The announcement follows the decision by Peeblesshire firm BARC Coach Hire to operate the Peebles town services on a commercial basis.
Negotiations are continuing regarding other services which First identified as part of its review.
All the new services will start on 15 August.
Councillor Gordon Edgar said: "I am pleased that the council has managed to work with local bus operators to ensure a number of vital services will continue.
"Going forward, the message is now that communities must support these services in order for them to have a future.
"Otherwise we could be faced with a similar scenario in future years."
Claire Lark, operations manager at Perryman's Buses, said it was committed to "providing a reliable bus service in and around the Scottish Borders".
"We are pleased to be introducing a number of new routes in Hawick, Selkirk and Galashiels and look forward to quickly establishing good working relations with the towns and their people," she said.
She added that the company would be investing about Â£500,000 in new vehicles.
