She is four behind Americans Cristie Kerr and Mo Martin who lead on six under with South Korea's In Gee Hun.
World number one Lydia Ko is two over as she prepares to defend her title at next week's ANA Inspiration tournament, the first major of the season.
England's Mel Reid and Wales' Becky Morgan - who dropped two shots in her final nine holes - are on the same mark as 19-year-old New Zealander Ko.
Four-time-major-winner Laura Davies, 53, is a shot further back on three over.
