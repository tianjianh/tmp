[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Wales Police officers had been pursuing a red Ford Focus around the Cardiff area at about 18:00 BST on Saturday. A stinger was also used.
Minutes later, the car collided with a Land Rover Freelander on the eastbound side between junctions 30 and 32.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is probing the incident.
Police said the Land Rover's driver was cut free but did not suffer serious injuries.
The Ford's Gloucester-based driver died.
An IPCC spokesman said: "We were notified by South Wales Police and the IPCC deployed investigators to the scene, and to attend the police post incident procedures. "
Both sides of the carriageway were closed but have since reopened.
