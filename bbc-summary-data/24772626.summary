The Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset is sporting facial "hair" in support of Movember, which raises awareness of prostate and testicular cancer.
The National Trust's Rob Rhodes said: "It's all a bit of fun to highlight an important subject so we were happy to give our support and join in the fun."
He said the moustache would remain for one day, and that there would be no damage to the giant.
"I am sure the giant would approve," he added.
The 180ft (55m) tall giant's new moustache is 36ft (11m) by 9ft (2.7m).
A spokesman at British Seed Houses, which grew the whiskers, said it gave him a "rakish" appearance.
Local folklore describes the club-wielding figure, which dates back to at least 1694, as a symbol of spirituality and fertility.
The giant attracted attention in the summer of 2007 when a temporary chalk figure of Homer Simpson was drawn next to it, to promote The Simpsons Movie.
Money is raised for Movember during November each year by men growing moustaches to support health programmes that combat prostate and testicular cancer, and mental health challenges.
