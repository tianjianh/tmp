England and Scotland meet in Utrecht. The last time the two asides played each other was at the Cyprus Cup in 2013, when they drew 4-4.
Scotland go into the tournament as one of five debutants, along with Belgium, Portugal, Austria and Switzerland.
The Scots, who have never played in a major tournament before, qualified as runners-up in their group, their one defeat in eight games coming against group winners Iceland.
"It's a tough group but one for us to relish," said Scotland manager Anna Signeul. "Our players will be very motivated."
England recorded seven wins and a draw to beat Belgium to top spot in their qualifying group.
Mark Sampson's side are ranked third at Euro 2017, behind France and Germany, the side they beat to finish third at the 2015 World Cup.
The Netherlands meet 2013 runners-up Norway in the opening match of the tournament in Utrecht, with Belgium and Denmark completing Group A.
England meet the Netherlands in a friendly on 29 November and also have a fixture with Italy scheduled for 6 April.
