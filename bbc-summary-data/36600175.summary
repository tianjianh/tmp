A parade began in Caerphilly at 11:00 BST, followed by a drum head service at the castle at 12:00.
Flag-raising ceremonies are being held at Castle Square in Swansea and the Centenary Gardens in Beddau, Rhondda Cynon Taff.
Military-themed celebrations are also taking place in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, and Garndiffaith in Torfaen.
Events to mark the occasion took place earlier in the week, with flags flown from council offices including those in Newport, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion.
And on Thursday, hundreds of people turned out to support the council's Armed Forces Day event in Ferndale.
