[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tammy Abraham scored a last-minute winner as Bristol City came from behind to beat Fulham in the EFL Cup third round tie at Craven Cottage.

Lucas Piazon headed Fulham into an early lead from Cauley Woodrow's cross from the right before Aaron Wilbraham levelled before the break for City.
Fulham missed the chance to retake the lead after the interval when Woodrow had a penalty saved by Ivan Lucic.
Callum O'Dowda's low cross then found Abraham to poke home City's second.
Abraham had come off the bench to score the decisive goal, the 18-year-old's ninth in only 11 appearances since joining on loan from Chelsea.
O'Dowda, himself a summer addition from Oxford United, was the provider for both of the Robins' goals.
His surging run to the edge of the area and neat ball in allowed Wilbraham to dink the ball over Fulham goalkeeper Jesse Joronen.
O'Dowda then calmly picked out Abraham's run to the near post as Joronen was unable to get enough on the ball to stop it crossing the line.
Earlier Piazon, another Chelsea loanee, had given Fulham the perfect start but they ultimately paid the price for Woodrow's missed penalty after the break.
The striker failed to convert his chance from 12 yards after Taylor Moore was booked for fouling him.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic said:
"You have to play from the first minute to the last in all the games. It's disappointing for us but we made many chances in the first half, we missed the penalty in the second half.
"To be honest, at the end of the game Bristol City had some very good chances, and then scored the goal in the last minute.
"On the other side, I managed to make the team believe it can do it, and we were very close.
"We played many minutes of good football and we created the chances. We played very well in the first half."
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson said:
"Tammy Abraham comes on again, he's the trump card for the last 20 minutes and I'm delighted for him to carry the weight of us yet again.
"The world is his oyster, the test will be does he keep his feet on the ground? I think he will, he's got his family behind him.
"I think had they scored the penalty, I still believe this group would have had chances to get back in it because they don't know when to throw the towel in.
"I'm really chuffed, I'm quite proud actually. We've got a lot of young players on the pitch, in the first half Fulham were the better side but the second half we were outstanding."
