Tahnie Martin, 29, died from serious head injuries after she was hit by a piece of timber in Wolverhampton city centre during Storm Doris last month.
Miss Martin, from Stafford, worked at the University of Wolverhampton.
Her family thanked emergency services, shop staff and a hot dog vendor for their help.

They added it had been a "desperate period" for them since her death.
"We have met a number of people who were present on the day when Tahnie tragically died; and we would like to extend our special thanks to those who tried to help her," they said.
"This includes the police, fire service and medical teams, staff from the local Starbucks and Marks & Spencer stores and the local hot dog retailer."
An investigation into her death is being led by the City of Wolverhampton Council.
Miss Martin was struck by part of a 2m-long piece of timber which was part of a wooden water tank cover as she walked near a Starbucks cafe in Dudley Street.
It is believed the cover was attached to a structure on the roof of the nearby Mander Centre shopping mall.
An inquest will take place next month.
