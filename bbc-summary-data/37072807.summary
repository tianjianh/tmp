Great Britain's Justin Rose leads the Olympic golf tournament by one shot heading into Sunday's final round.

Rose, the 2013 US Open champion, hit a six-under 65 to move to 12 under, with Sweden's Henrik Stenson (68) second.
Overnight leader Marcus Fraser of Australia (72) is third on nine under.
American Bubba Watson (67), David Lingmerth of Sweden (68) and Emiliano Grillo of Argentina are tied fourth on six under, while Ireland's Padraig Harrington is in a group on five under.
"It would mean an awful lot to win, especially when you see what it means to other athletes here," Rose said. "It would be unbelievable.
"The top three have really separated themselves from the rest of the pack so it is going to be a fun last group."
Rose and Open champion Stenson, who combined to win all three of their matches as Europe retained the Ryder Cup against the United States at Gleneagles in 2014, will tee-off their final round alongside Fraser at 14:39 BST on Sunday.
Further down the field, Britain's Danny Willett is on three under after a two under par round of 69.
It means that Willett, the 2016 Masters winner, is six shots behind current bronze medallist Fraser, in a tie for 14th.
"After three days we have left ourselves with a little bit too much work to do," admitted Willett.
"I am going to have to keep playing well and see,"
Meanwhile, South Africa's Jaco Van Zyl sank Olympic golf's second hole-in-one at the par-three eighth hole.

Clubhouse leader Rose hit the first hole-in-one on Thursday.
The men's winner will become the first Olympic champion since 1904, with the sport returning to the Games following a 112-year absence.
More than half of the world's top 10 are not in Rio, including number one Jason Day and four-time major winner Rory McIlroy who pulled out citing concerns over the Zika virus.
In July, Northern Ireland's McIlroy added that he was unlikely to watch television coverage of the golf, preferring "track and field, swimming, diving, the stuff that matters".
