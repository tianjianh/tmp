#TrumpInauguralBands: Who might sing at Trump's inauguration?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With less than two months to go, Americans are eagerly awaiting news not only of President-elect Donald Trump's new cabinet, but also of his inauguration day plans.

Prayers, poetry and music, all common elements of inaugural ceremonies, are organised by a bipartisan congressional committee.
Presidents-elect also choose their own committee to plan subsequent festivities including a parade and a ball, often accompanied by music.
Songs featured on the day can include performances by formal choirs, military bands, pop stars or classical artists.
In previous years, President Barack Obama's ceremonies have included renditions from the likes of Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, James Taylor and Kelly Clarkson.
Mr Obama, renowned for his love of music, even released an inauguration day playlist on Spotify for fans of his 20 January music choice.
Mr Trump's top music picks are not as clear, although there is a Trump rally playlist also available on Spotify which could provide some clues.
Only a week after the election, Mr Trump appointed his inauguration committee run by several affluent businessmen including the founder of a global investment firm, an NFL football team owner and a few casino tycoons.
So with only a few more weeks to pull together the celebrations, who might the Mr Trump and his team choose to perform?
More than a few celebrities have expressed their lack of enthusiasm for the new president.
Elton John will definitely not be playing in Washington come January.
Earlier this week, a member of Mr Trump's transition team told the BBC Elton John would be performing during the inauguration.
But Elton John, who previously played a rally for the Clinton campaign, quickly responded with a "categorical denial" of the Trump team's suggestion.
We can also safely rule out Green Day. Performing at the American Music Awards on Sunday, the band chanted "No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA" while performing their song "Bang, Bang".
Motley Crue singer Vince Neil is out. Neil had apparently been invited to sing months ago, but in an interview with TMZ last week the singer said he had been uninvited by the Republicans.
"I assumed that it didn't matter who won - it is still a big party. But I guess it's not- I guess there's more politics involved," he said.
"I don't know who's playing at Trump's party but God bless em."
Donald Trump's own inaugural committee has not given many hints.
But he does have several musician fans like Kid Rock. In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this year he said the Trump campaign was "entertaining" and that as a businessman Mr Trump should run the country like a business.
"I'm digging Trump," he said.
Kanye West might also have a shot. Although the rapper said he did not vote, he "would've voted on Trump". He said the debates were great and Mr Trump's "approach was absolutely genius because it... worked".
Finally, if all else fails social media users have also had a few ideas.
