Visitors will now be able to travel on a Pole-to-Pole journey that features flightless birds of Australasia as well as the scenery of the Arctic.
Work on the gallery began in 2015, with the first phase completed in April this year.
It was closed again at the beginning of October and reopened on Saturday.
Situated in the museum's West Court, the Life Gallery is home to Sir Roger the Asian elephant and the ever-popular Spitfire.
The work was completed after a public consultation found that visitors wanted to know where in the world the animals on display had come from and how they had lived.
The new displays will group animals, plants and some geological and world culture objects from the same areas of the world into distinct eco-zones.
Archie Graham, chairman of Glasgow Life and depute leader of Glasgow City Council, said: "The completion of phase two of the redisplay of the Life gallery at Kelvingrove Art Gallery will allow visitors to fully experience this new vision for the West Court of the building and these items from Glasgow's collection.
"The process, which started with the lowering and re-installation of the spitfire, is a reminder of how much flexibility the refurbishment of Kelvingrove allows.
"The gallery tells new stories and includes objects our research told us people wanted to see on display and which you can enjoy over the festive period and for years to come."
Situated on Argyle Street in Glasgow, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is among Scotland's most popular attractions, with more than 1.2 million visitors in 2015.
