Firefighters moved 30 propane cylinders from the site but believe others could still be in the vicinity of the blaze.
Crews at the scene described it as a "difficult fire to fight".
Highways England earlier tweeted that ash and sparks were drifting towards both carriageways of the motorway.
Whitewebbs Lane, which is currently closed, is the location of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club's state-of-the-art training centre.
The club said that although the road has been shut, the centre is still open and running as normal.
London Fire Brigade said the blaze is now under control but crews remain at the scene.
