The Insolvency Service said enough coal would be bought to keep the ovens alight as talks with "interested parties" continue about their future.
A spokesman said a further decision would be made next week.
The steelworks are with receivers after owners SSI UK went into liquidation, blaming a slump in global steel prices.
A statement from the Insolvency Service said: "A decision has been made to buy sufficient coal to keep the Redcar Coke Ovens going until the weekend, enabling the Official Receiver to continue discussions with interested parties about purchasing assets in working order.
"A decision about purchasing further coal to keep the ovens operational beyond the weekend will be taken at the end of this week."
The government has promised an Â£80m aid package to help the 1,700 workers who have lost their jobs.
