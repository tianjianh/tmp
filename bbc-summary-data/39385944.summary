Even if we are different we are still brothers and sisters and friends and we are supposed to be one, one man said.

Five people including the attacker died in Wednesday's incident. Fifty people were injured, with 31 receiving hospital treatment.
Fawn Goodwin, 20, who helped organise the event, said: "It's really important that we show solidarity with the people who are affected by it, but also that we are anti-racist and that's the main reason why I'm here.
"I don't want the attack that happened to reflect badly on the Muslim community. I think it's really important that we all stand together."
Gahlla Gebriel, 58, said the attack had made him feel "upset" and "sad".
He stated: "Even if we are different we are still brothers and sisters and friends and we are supposed to be one. It was a bad thing, Islam is about peace. I just don't know why he did it."
Israr Hussain, 20, from Bordesley Green, said: "I've come here to show support. We all need to stand together because what's going on isn't good.
"It makes me happy that people are at this event to bring people together."
