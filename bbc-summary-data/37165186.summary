Great Britain's great athletes have now arrived back in the country - and everyone wants to speak to them!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Wednesday, Newsround will be lucky enough to chat to Jack Laugher and Chris Mears, who won gold in the 3m synchronised diving, as well as a silver individual medal for Jack.
We'll also be speaking with Bryony Page, who impressed judges to win a silver in the trampolining.
And we need your questions for them!
Thanks for your questions - this page is now closed.
