CMAL has 'overall control' of MV Loch Seaforth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) has said it has overall control of a new ferry for the Ullapool-Stornoway route.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company, which owns ferries and port facilities in Scotland, commissioned a Germany yard to build the Â£41.8m MV Loch Seaforth.
There were concerns last week that the sale of the yard could affect the handover of the vessel to CMAL.
The ferry is expected to arrive in Scotland "within weeks".
Caledonian MacBrayne will operate the ferry on the Ullapool-Stornoway route.
Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft (FSG) is nearing the completion of the MV Loch Seaforth, which has already been delayed in coming into service.
A Norwegian company is in the process of taking over the yard.
In a statement, CMAL said: "Following negotiations in Germany last week, CMAL now has overall control of the MV Loch Seaforth and she will not be impacted by negotiations over the future acquisition of FSG.
"Work continues in the yard on final fitting out and preparation of systems for handover to Calmac Ferries.
"The ship will be sailing to Scotland in the next few weeks."
