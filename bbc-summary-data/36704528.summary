Heat's TV critic Boyd Hilton is one of those saddened at the news.
He has also earned support from The Mirror's TV critic Ian Hyland.
But some fans were not so kind and were very keen on co-host Matt LeBlanc taking over the show.
Some fans were supportive too.
His exit gained the hashtag #Chrexit on Twitter, in reference to Brexit, Britain leaving the EU.
And some famous people have been putting themselves forward to fill his shoes - including fellow DJ Chris Moyles and singers John Newman and Ellie Goulding.
