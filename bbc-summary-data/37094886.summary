The age old rivalry between Wales and England fills the pages of sporting history books.

Now Wales will try to steal the title for the world's largest human scrum from England's grasp to take their place in the Guinness Book of Records.
Cardiff hopes to smash the record with at least 1,500 rugby lovers, including veteran players from all over the world, with international referee Nigel Owens blowing the starting whistle.
The current record of 1,198 was set in Middlesex as England hosted the Rugby World Cup in 2015.
The attempt, at University Sports Fields in Llanrumney, comes as rugby legends and players from days gone by travel from across the globe to the capital for the Golden Oldies World Rugby Festival.
Teams of rugby players from countries including Germany, Japan, America, Australia, New Zealand and Wales will play during the veterans' tournament, which kicks off with a parade through Cardiff city centre on Sunday.
Festival Director and brain child behind the record attempt Paul Guest said it would be an "enormous undertaking" as it needs to move like a normal scrum despite having at least 750 players on each side.
But he said Wales could "absolutely" take the record on Wednesday.
The Principality Stadium will host the opening ceremony.
It is the first time Wales has hosted the over-35s festival after beating London, Toulouse and Treviso to secure the bid.
With the oldest registered player being an 87-year-old man from Japan, players wear different coloured shorts for rules, including if and how they can be tackled.
The week-long festival features legendary Welsh players including JPR Williams, Shane Williams and Graham Price.
Mr Guest said the festival was a celebration of the love of rugby and friendship, not about big names.
"I don't think Welsh people realised the reputation Wales has gained as a rugby nation.
"The fact that they are going to be able to go into the Principality Stadium and are going to be eating and drinking with Welsh players is just massive.
"Just to experience the Welsh rugby culture is unique."
Part-funded by the Welsh Government, the festival aims to keep over-35s involved in rugby - the age group has the second biggest drop out rate behind teenagers.
"Think about all the different roles in a rugby club - they are all filled by people who are over 35, the majority are volunteers," said Mr Guest.
"Without these people these clubs wouldn't exist.
"The love of rugby doesn't go away just because you are unable to play at the level you did in your 20s."
