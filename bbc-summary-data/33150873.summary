A 19-year-old man has pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent following an attack on an autistic teenager in Lisburn in 2012.

Scott Vineer was found with severe brain and head injuries close to the towpath on Laganbank Road.
Ryan Craig, from Ashmount Gardens, Lisburn, County Antrim, was due to go on trial for attempted murder.
In light of his guilty plea to the lesser charge on Tuesday, the crown decided not to proceed.
Mr Vineer, who now walks with crutches, was in Craigavon court supported by his family.
Speaking afterwards, he said he was pleased and relieved.
His mother, Helen-Louise, said: "The night they found him, they told us they expected him to die, and when he survived for 24 hours, they thought he would be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life - so he has proved them wrong, and that's my boy."
She said the attack on her teenage son had left him with brain damage.
"He has tremors in his left arm, and being left-handed that causes him problems," she said.
"His balance has been affected, his short-term memory has been affected and his speech can be quite slurred at times."
Scott Vineer also revealed that he was now preparing for a different challenge, that of being best man at his mother and step-father's wedding in August.
"I'll have to write a speech and all. It's going to be nerve-wracking, but I'll get over it," he said.
Craig will be sentenced in August.
Scott Vineer was 17 when he was assaulted on his way home from the South Eastern Regional College in September 2012.
He was beaten about the head and left unconscious behind a disused warehouse on the Lagan towpath, in Lisburn.
He spent three months in a coma, only returning home six months after the attack.
