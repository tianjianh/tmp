Great Britain suffered a setback in their opening Eurobasket 2017 qualifier after being defeated 96-77 by Hungary.

They fell behind by a double-digit deficit midway into the second quarter and only occasionally chipped that down to single figures in Kecskemet.
Dan Clark and Andrew Lawrence hit 22 points each to lead GB's scoring.
They now play three home qualifiers in a row at the Copper Box in London, against Macedonia and Luxembourg and the return leg against Hungary.
For a team that has lost all five games of the summer so far, coach Joe Prunty's team played a secure, competent first quarter, trailing just 25-22 after 10 minutes.
Hungary's 11-4 start to the second period - much of it coming on the fast break after GB handling errors - brought them their first 10-point lead of the night.
Clark had 14 points at half-time and was the team's only consistent scoring threat until Lawrence hit 12 points in a row in the third quarter.
Hungary, led by a stellar performance from Adam Hanga, with 32 points, never looked likely to let GB back into the game.
To reach the 2017 finals, GB need to either win the group or finish as one of the four best runners-up from the seven qualifying groups.
