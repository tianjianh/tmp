The hour-long episode will see two couples from different sides of the Brexit debate swap families.
The UK voted to leave the European Union in a referendum last June - with 51.9% of voters opting for Brexit.
"Wife Swap was largely about how people chose to run their homes, but it always had political undertones," Channel 4's Emily Jones said.
"Now the world has changed and recent events have brought political issues into the heart of every household."
Wife Swap became a huge hit when it aired its first series in 2003.
It ran for six years in the UK and also became a successful format overseas.
