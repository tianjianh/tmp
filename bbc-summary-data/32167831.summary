Weston-super-Mare's annual sand sculpture festival has marked its 10th anniversary, despite fears the event might not go ahead.

About 5,000 tonnes of beach sand is scooped up and compacted for the event every year at a cost of about Â£30,000.
In October, organisers raised doubts over the event's future, but announced last month it would go ahead.
Organiser Alec Messchaert said a "flurry of support" had made it possible.
"Weston has always been close to our heart but having to completely dismantle the site each year was extremely disheartening and extremely expensive," he added.
"This is a cost and a hassle we wouldn't face if we went elsewhere.
"We have been inundated with support from local businesses and authorities so we couldn't leave without celebrating our 10th birthday."
Both Weston-super-Mare Town Council and North Somerset Council had also shown the event "great support", Mr Messchaert said.
The festival will celebrate the previous decade by "paying tribute" to each year's theme, including Under the Sea, The Jungle, and Great Britain.
It runs until 27 September.
