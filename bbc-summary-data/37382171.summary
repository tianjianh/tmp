The man, in his 50s, crashed off Corn Du, near Pen y Fan, at about 15:20 BST on Thursday.
Rescue teams were called and treated him for suspected spinal and pelvic injuries, Brecon Mountain Rescue Team (MRT) said.
He was then flown to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.
Central Beacons and Western Beacons rescue teams were also involved, along with a helicopter from the Maritime Coastguard Agency.
Brecon MRT team leader Mark Jones praised passers-by who helped the injured man.
"In this instance having help from passers-by was critical," he said.
"Those members of the public that helped this gentleman were calm and professional and were able to help his breathing difficulties without compromising any spinal injuries that he may have suffered until mountain rescuers were on scene."
