Super League leaders Wigan will host neighbours Widnes while Hull FC will have to travel to France to face Catalan Dragons.
The only non-Super League team left in the competition Sheffield Eagles will host London Broncos.
The games will be played between 12-15 July.
Two of the games will be screened live on BBC Two over the weekend of 13 and 14 July.
The final will be at Wembley on Saturday 24 August.
Warrington are seeking a fourth Wembley triumph in five seasons and in Huddersfield they face the side who they beat in the 2009 decider and who claimed an impressive win over Grand Final winners Leeds to reach the last eight.
Warrington's former Huddersfield coach Tony Smith was happy to avoid a cup trip to Catalan for a second successive year.
The Wolves won 32-22 in the quarter-finals in Perpignan last May but Smith appreciates how tough the Dragons are on home soil.
"The tough draw would have been Catalan at Catalan but Huddersfield will provide good, hard opposition," Smith said. "We've got a healthy respect for the Giants."
Wigan are the most successful side in the competition with 18 wins and will be bidding for a Cup double after Wigan Athletic's win in the FA Cup.
Sheffield coach and chief executive Mark Aston, who was man of the match when the Eagles stunned Wigan to win the Cup at Wembley in 1998, admitted he could not have been happier with the draw.
"We wanted either one of the top clubs away or London or Widnes at home and I'd say we're happy with how it's turned out," Aston said.
"It would be massive for us to get to the semi-finals and we're capable of it. We're at home and we know how to play at home."
The tie will almost certainly be played at Don Valley Stadium, which is due to close at the end of the year.
"It's a great way to close the stadium," Aston added.
This year's final will be the 71st at Wembley since the old Empire Stadium first hosted rugby league's big day out in the capital in 1929.
