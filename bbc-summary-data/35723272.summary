Motherwell 2-1 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motherwell broke into the top six of the Premiership with victory over Dundee United at Fir Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A fabulous opening strike from Henri Anier - a former Motherwell player - ignited United hopes.
They were doused, however, on the stroke of half time by an equaliser from Marvin Johnson.
The same player set up Louis Moult to tap home a second-half winner, his 17th goal of the season.
It leaves United isolated at the bottom of the Premiership with Kilmarnock still eight points ahead of them with nine games remaining.
United had yet more goalkeeping bad luck inflicted upon them.  After the loss of Eiji Kawashima, his replacement Lius Zwick failed to recover from an injury sustained in training and Mixu Paatelainen had to turn to Michal Szromnik.
And just to make things interesting the manager made two changes in his back three.
Szromnik produced what was a remarkable save with just four minutes gone.  Cadden crossed and Scott McDonald should really have scored from just three yards out, but somehow the replacement goalie stopped the ball on the line.
Add Dixon's sizzling shot at the other end, a great run and shot from Marvin Johnson which rattled the post and it was clear that the wet surface was adding to the zip of the game.
The early game was peppered with chances and a goal had to come. And so it did after 21 minutes.
It was a sensational strike from Henri Anier, found by a John Rankin pass.  The former Motherwell hero took a fine first touch and a thunderous second to drive the ball beyond Ripley.  It really was a top class finish from the Estonian, dismaying the fans who once roared him on.
It was a thrilling opening half and seconds before it ended Motherwell produced an equaliser.
Josh Law floated a free kick into the box and Johnson met it with a looping header which seemed to take an age to beat the desperate, out-stretched fingers of Szromnick.  It triggered an outbreak of tangible relief from the home support.
And what they did see was an outstanding display from Johnson featuring dazzling footwork and electric pace which lit up the night. He even hit the bar in the second-half.
With 65 minutes gone he tormented United again with a run to the line and a cut back for the easiest of tap ins for Moult.
Again the old curse of slack defending let the Tannadice club down.  Gavin Gunning was the culprit this time.
It was a bad defeat for United who started so well.  They are not lost souls yet.  But hopes are fading.
