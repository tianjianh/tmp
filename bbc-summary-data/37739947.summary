Sky Blues supporters' groups arranged a march ahead of their home match with Rochdale.
Some fans also boycotted the match at the Ricoh Arena and staged protests outside the ground.
The team are fourth from bottom of League One and a deal allowing the club to continue playing at the Ricoh Arena expires at the end of next season.
Concerns around the ownership of the club have recently been raised in Parliament.
Fans have been stepping up their protest against the club's owners Sisu in recent weeks, with the match away to Charlton Athletic on 15 October briefly stopped after inflatable pigs were thrown onto the pitch.
Moz Baker, from the Sky Blues Trust, said a "tremendous number" of supporters came out to oppose the club's owners in a "peaceful" way.
"The message is simple: people don't want these owners here anymore," he said.
Campaigner Steve Brown, from the fans' group Fighting the Jimmy Hill Way, said the fans are frustrated with the way the club was being run.
"We'll do whatever it takes for our club to survive," he said.
"I don't think that our owners care one little hoot about what we're doing out here. However, it's a feelgood factor for us, and we feel as if we're doing something... we're not going to go away."
