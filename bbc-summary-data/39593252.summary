Tracey Wilkinson, 50, and son Pierce, 13, a keen Baggies fan, were stabbed at home in Stourbridge on 30 March. Father Peter Wilkinson was seriously injured.
A minute's applause in their memory will be held at The Hawthorns ahead of Sunday's fixture against Liverpool.
The club added Mr Wilkinson was also hoping to attend.
West Bromwich Albion chief executive Martin Goodman said: "We know from the huge public reaction to the incident just how much these awful events have shocked everyone.
"It says everything about Peter's strength of character that he has fought back from life-threatening injuries and is now so determined to return to The Hawthorns on Sunday to watch the team he loves.

"They have asked us to celebrate the lives of Tracey and Pierce and I am sure all Baggies fans will want to do so in the spirit of community support and understanding for what they are enduring."
East Stand season ticket holders Mr Wilkinson, daughter Lydia and other family members will be the club's guests for the game and there will also be a tribute in the match day programme.
Aaron Barley, 23, of no fixed address, has been charged with the murders of Mrs Wilkinson and her son, and the attempted murder of Mr Wilkinson.
