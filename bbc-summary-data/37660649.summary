[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Azhar Ali struck 302 not out - Pakistan's fourth-highest individual score - as his side took control of the first Test against the West Indies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Azhar's 469-ball innings in Dubai lasted 11 hours and included 23 fours and three sixes.
Only Hanif Mohammad (337), Inzamam ul-Haq (329) and Younus Khan (313) have scored more for Pakistan in a Test.
In only the second day-night Test, Pakistan made 579-3 declared, with West Indies 69-1 at the close of day two.
Pakistan are second in the Test rankings, behind India, following a 2-2 draw in the summer series against England.
They have beaten West Indies 3-0 in both the one-day and Twenty20 international series.
BBC Sport's Kalika Mehta in Dubai:
Azhar Ali's almost faultless innings showcased why the 31-year-old is considered one of the leading candidates to take over the Test captaincy when Misbah-ul-Haq departs.
Although the pitch was as flat as they come, Azhar's concentration and watchfulness was matched by the occasional flurry as he amassed just the fourth triple century by a Pakistan player.
Azhar's stock has been steadily rising following his 139 against England at Edgbaston and it is easy to see why.
