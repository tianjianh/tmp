Scotland women call up teenager Abigail Harrison against Iceland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coach Anna Signeul has given Hibernian Ladies' Abigail Harrison a first call-up to Scotland women's squad for the Euro 2017 qualifier with Iceland.

Striker Harrison, 18, joins an experienced squad for the match in Reykjavik on 20 September.
A point for the Scots against the group leaders will seal qualification to the finals in the Netherlands next summer.
However, Signeul's side could qualify for their first major event before then if results elsewhere go their way.
Group winners and the six best runners-up progress to the finals, with the remaining two second-placed teams competing in a play-off for the last spot at next year's 16-team tournament.
And the results of matches involving other second-placed teams on 16 September could confirm Scotland as one of the six best runners-up.
Harrison, who is the former captain of Scotland's Under-19s, is the only player new to international football: uncapped Mallbackens forward Zoe Ness is also in the squad but she has been called up before.
Seattle Reign defender Rachel Corsie misses out due to injury.
Signeul told BBC Scotland that the Scotland squad represented "a good mixture" of younger players and those with more experience.
"We have four of five of the older players who are not giving in, who are still very good and doing well for their club teams," she said.
"I don't think age should matter if you really play well. We have a lot of young players coming in so I think it is a good mix."
The coach is looking for her players to compete better with Iceland's physicality in Reykjavik than they managed in the 4-0 defeat in Falkirk in June.
"We realised that we cannot just play good football," said Signeul, who will take charge of the team for the 150th time.
"Against teams like that you need to fight and really battle like we did in the old days when we refused to concede goals. We will need to be more aggressive.
"We can qualify on Thursday next week, or the Friday, with the help of other teams.
"I think we have done it under our own steam. We have managed to take maximum points from teams three, four and five in the group.
"I don't mind if we have qualified before we play. It will be good for my nerves!
"I am confident that either with the help of others or by getting a point that we will be there. We have already secured the play-off but we don't want to play a play-off."
