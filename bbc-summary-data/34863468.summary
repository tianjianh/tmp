Andy Murray: Aljaz Bedene Davis Cup decision 'disrespectful'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Murray has described the tennis governing body's decision to postpone Aljaz Bedene's appeal against his Davis Cup ineligibility as "disrespectful".

Adjourning the case until March means the British number two will not be eligible to represent Great Britain in next week's final in Belgium.
"I can understand from his side why you would be very frustrated," said Murray.
Bedene, 26, played in the competition for Slovenia three times before gaining UK citizenship in March.
A Davis Cup rule change now prevents players representing a second country, but Bedene - who has lived in the UK since 2008 - has appealed on the grounds his passport application was lodged before the rule changed at the start of 2015.
The world number 45 travelled to Prague for the hearing with the Lawn Tennis Association's legal director, Stephen Farrow, and his agent Allon Khakshouri.

The British number one said Bedene should have been told a decision would not be made before he had gone to the Czech capital.
"The fact that he had to go all the way over to Prague just to be told that they hadn't made a decision is a bit disrespectful towards him," Murray told BBC Sport.
"If they hadn't made a decision, they could have just said 'we haven't made a decision yet - we're going to decide in March' and he could have stayed at home."
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the International Tennis Federation said the hearing would be adjourned until the next board meeting on 20-21 March, 2016, to "ensure the rights of all parties are to be considered".
World number two Murray will lead Britain's bid for a first Davis Cup title since 1936 when Britain take on Belgium in Ghent on 27-29 November.
