Mr Jammeh said anyone marrying a girl aged below 18 would be jailed for up to 20 years.
Speaking at the Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations at the end of Ramadan, he said parents and imams who perform the ceremonies would also face prison.
Some 46% of girls in The Gambia get married before they are 18, according to the UN children's agency (Unicef).

Announcing the ban and jail terms, Mr Jammeh said:  "If you want to know whether what I am saying is true or not, try  it tomorrow and see."
In December last year, he also outlawed female genital mutilation (FGM) with a prison sentence of up to three years for those that ignored the ban.
He said the practice had no place in Islam or in modern society.
Three-quarters of women in the mostly Muslim country have had the procedure, according to Unicef.
