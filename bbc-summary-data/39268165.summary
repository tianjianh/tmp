Jim Magilton's stepdaughter assault charge withdrawn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Retired footballer Jim Magilton has agreed "to be of good behaviour" after an allegation that he assaulted his stepdaughter was withdrawn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Northern Ireland player, 47, had been charged with common assault against the 14-year-old on 7 January.
A prosecutor told Antrim Magistrates' Court on Tuesday that the charge would be replaced with a binding-over order.
Mr Magilton was bound over with a Â£500 bond and the judge warned he faces five days in jail if he breaks the order.
The prosecution lawyer said the order had been agreed "in the usual terms - to keep the peace and be of good behaviour" for the next 12 months.
Mr Magilton, from Aberfoyle Gardens in Belfast, is the current Northern Ireland Under-21 team manager and the Irish Football Association's elite performance director.
At an earlier hearing, the court was told that police believed Mr Magilton had hit his stepdaughter "a couple of slaps to the head and allegedly dragged her down the stairs by the arms".
But a defence solicitor had said that Mr Magilton did not accept that allegation against him and gave a "full account" during police interviews.
Mr Magilton won 52 international caps for Northern Ireland, scoring five goals.
He started his playing career with Liverpool before joining Oxford United, and he also played for Southampton, Sheffield Wednesday and Ipswich Town.
His playing career ended at Ipswich in 2006, having made over 250 league appearances, before he managed the club.
