Miqdad Al-Nuaimi's suspension came after the Guido Fawkes blog reported tweets from him which suggested he thought Jews have the "same arrogant mentality as the Nazis".
Labour said the move, taken over allegations of anti-Semitism, was "pending an investigation".
But Mr Al-Nuaimi said no one had informed him of the decision.
The Guido Fawkes blog reported a tweet from the councillor in 2015 which said that "Jews in whose name #Israeli #Zionist regime commit war crimes should worry: its's same arrogant mentality as #Nazis".
Another tweet from 2014 said: "#Israel regime & army are increasingly assuming the arrogance & genocidal character of the #Nazis. Curious &strong irony here".
Mr Al-Nuaimi, a councillor for the Stow Hill ward who is Iraqi-born, said: "How can I be anti-Semitic when I myself am Semitic?
"I think it's a sad day that any criticism of Israeli government is equated with anti-Semitism and racism," he said.
He said he would fight the suspension "with every grain in my body".
"There's no truth in it," he said.
Mr Al-Nuaimi said "no one has told me officially that I am suspended".
Ray Truman, deputy leader of the Newport Labour group, said it had been told Mr Al-Nuaimi had been suspended by the party over tweets "he was supposed to have made".
"I'm obviously concerned but I can't give a comment. It's got to be investigated," Mr Truman said.
A Labour spokesman said Mr Al-Nuaimi has been suspended "pending an investigation".
