A superb century from Middlesex's Brendon McCullum set up a 28-run win at Glamorgan in the One-Day Cup.

McCullum (110) and England T20 call-up Dawid Malan (70) smashed their way to 176-0 in 27 overs, before Glamorgan's bowlers restricted them to 294-7.
Glamorgan reached 114-1, before James Franklin took three quick wickets.
Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke (41) revived Glamorgan, but Ingram's dismissal for 85 signalled the end as the hosts were bowled out for 266.
Former New Zealand captain McCullum was at his destructive best in Cardiff as he struck 11 fours and five sixes in his 85-ball innings after the visitors were asked to bat.
Ingram's 10 straight overs of leg-spin put a brake on Middlesex in mid innings, with England one-day captain Eoin Morgan part of the procession.
A late unbroken stand of 46 between Toby Roland-Jones and Ollie Rayner added some impetus to the visitors' cause.
David Lloyd (41) and Jacques Rudolph (45) got Glamorgan off to a good start before the home side in turn faltered.
They were left needing 87 runs off the last 10 overs but two wickets from part-time spinner Malan left too much on the shoulders of Ingram.
Middlesex eventually clinched their second win of the campaign with 10 balls to spare.
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport: "For long periods I thought we stood a strong chance of winning the game, I think with the way Colin Ingram has been batting, if he was there in the last over we would have had a chance.
"McCullum is a world-class player and he'll always put you on the back foot, but we also had our chances against him, Hoges (Michael Hogan) got him with a no-ball and we also dropped him three times.
"All in all I'm happy with the way we're playing, but we made a few minor mistakes and unfortunately we were on the wrong end of the result."
Middlesex captain James Franklin told BBC Radio London: "It was quite a topsy-turvy game, we did our best at times to lose it but the character of the side shone through in the end.
"The togetherness we had in the field in some difficult times, we stuck together well so it was a good team performance.
"Amazing start (from McCullum and Malan), those guys can play exceptionally well on wickets that some other guys can't.
"We're two (wins) and two (defeats), we've still got a lot of improvement to do and that's the exciting part."
