More young doctors need to be trained as GPs to solve shortages, AMs say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Incentives to attract trainees to rural or deprived parts of Wales - and to persuade older GPs not to retire early - are called for by the health and social care committee after an inquiry.
But it added that GP training may need extending from three to four years to handle the complexity of the job.
"We all have higher expectations about the care we should receive," said committee chair David Rees.
The Welsh government said it would respond "in due course".
