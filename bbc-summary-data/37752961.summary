The show, set 19 years after the final Potter book, is up for best play, best director for John Tiffany and best emerging talent for Anthony Boyle.
The National Theatre's revival of August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom also has three nominations.
Actress Sheridan Smith is in contention for the best musical performance prize for her role in Funny Girl.
The nomination comes after Smith took almost two months off from Funny Girl due to stress and exhaustion earlier this year.
She will go up against Glenn Close for Sunset Boulevard and Groundhog Day's Andy Karl.
Helen McCrory, Noma Dumezweni, Sophie Melville and Billie Piper will compete for the Natasha Richardson award for best actress.
Dumezweni is recognised after stepping into the Royal Court's play Linda two weeks before opening night, replacing Kim Cattrall, who was suffering from extreme insomnia.
