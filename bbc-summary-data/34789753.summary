Crowborough Birthing Centre takeover agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A birthing centre in Sussex which temporarily closed two years ago is to be taken over by a Kent hospital trust.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a long-running campaign to transfer control of the Crowborough Birthing Centre to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS.
In October 2013 the birthing centre, run by East Sussex Healthcare NHS, shut for four days so midwives could cover staff shortages in Hastings.
Both trusts said the takeover had been agreed in principle.
They said the plan had been agreed with High Weald Lewes Clinical Commissioning Group in order to provide a more seamless maternity service for women in that area.
Campaigners had called for the transfer amid fears of further closures.
Details of the transfer still have to be finalised.
