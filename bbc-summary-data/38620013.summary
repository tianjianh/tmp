[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 2-2 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nathan Delfouneso came off the bench to score in added time and ensure Blackpool earned a point against visitors Yeovil Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Delfouneso, in his first match back at Blackpool after rejoining from Swindon, tapped home from close range in the 95th minute at Bloomfield Road.
Yeovil took the lead after 34 minutes. Tom Eaves did well to hook the ball to the far post, where Francois Zoko beat his man to tap into an empty net.
Blackpool deservedly drew level in the 70th minute thanks to brilliant play by Delfouneso, who broke down the left and crossed for Kelvin Mellor to tap home at the far post.
Then, entirely against the run of play, Darren Ward slotted Yeovil ahead from 12 yards after goalkeeper Sam Slocombe could only parry Eaves' cross into his path.
But Blackpool denied the visitors in the fifth of nine added minutes as Delfouneso pounced to turn the ball home from two yards.
