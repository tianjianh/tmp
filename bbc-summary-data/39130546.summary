Demolition work on Colwyn Bay's Victoria pier begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Demolition of the damaged sections of Colwyn Bay's Victoria pier has begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grade II-listed pier partially collapsed into the sea off the Conwy coast on 1 February, and suffered more damage during Storm Doris.
The initial work will disconnect the collapsed section from the pier and clear any materials. The remainder of the seaward section will then be dismantled.
It is estimated the work will take about three weeks.
Heritage body Cadw and the health and safety executive are monitoring the demolition.
Security arrangements remain in place, and Conwy council has asked the public to keep a safe distance.
Conwy council is due to consider future plans for the structure's possible restoration as a "truncated pier boardwalk" tomorrow.
It will also examine a plan to salvage any heritage elements, including balustrades and the pier's main 1930's pavilion.
The Colwyn Victoria Pier Trust told the council it wants to restore the pier to its original 1900 length, complete with kiosks and a pavilion to serve beach-goers - but recognised the remaining pier needs to be dismantled "so the community can move forward".
The Heritage Lottery Fund said the trust should enlist the support of the council before applying for any funding.
In 2013, Conwy council voted to demolish the Grade II-listed structure, but this was refused by the Welsh Government in 2015.
