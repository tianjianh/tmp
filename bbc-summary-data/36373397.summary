Jose Mourinho would be a "fantastic signing" as Manchester United manager, says Carlo Ancelotti.

United are in talks with the Portuguese coach, 53, to replace Dutchman Louis van Gaal, who was sacked on Monday.
"In the last year, Manchester United has lost its identity," Ancelotti, 56, told BBC Sport pundit Jermaine Jenas.
However, the Bayern Munich boss said Van Gaal had been faced with the tricky task of rebuilding United and perhaps needed more time to make his mark.
"The job of Van Gaal was not easy, he had to rebuild the team," said Italian Ancelotti. "It takes time. In football, you need time to build something."
Old Trafford legend Eric Cantona says new Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola would have been a better fit for United than Mourinho.
"I would have loved to have seen Guardiola at Manchester United," Cantona, who celebrated his 50th birthday this week, told the Guardian.
"Guardiola was the one to take. He is the spiritual son of Johan Cruyff. He is the only one to change Manchester United.
"I love Jose Mourinho, but, in terms of the type of football he plays, I don't think he is Manchester United."
Mourinho's agent, Jorge Mendes, flew into London on Tuesday morning and is leading discussions with United.
If he is confirmed in the role, Mourinho will renew his rivalry with Guardiola, who was Barcelona boss when Mourinho was in charge at Real Madrid.
