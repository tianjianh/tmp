The Tony Martin-trained gelding sustained the injury while working at the Curragh on Saturday.
County Meath-based Martin spoke of his sadness after the seven-year-old's death.
"He did everyone proud and was more than a horse, he was some character and so genuine," said Martin.
"So many people wanted him when he retired because he was such a lovely horse.
"He took us to so many places and the plan this season was to go back out to Melbourne and have another whack.
"He was having a gallop ahead of running on the Flat next week at the Curragh."
Heartbreak City won the Ebor at York last August before heading to Australia where he was beaten just a head by Almandin in the Group One feature at Flemington in November.
Darren Dance, whose Australian Thoroughbred Bloodstock syndicate raced the seven-year-old in partnership with the Here For The Craic Partnership, also paid tribute to the six-times winner.
"It's just so tragic because he was such a lovely, quiet animal and he gave us so much joy."
