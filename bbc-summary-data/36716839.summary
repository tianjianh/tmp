The final was held at the Sheffield Arena in 2015 and 2016, with the newly-opened Cardiff venue successfully bidding to stage the next one.
"At the last board meeting we put in a bid for it, and we got it," said Devils managing director Todd Kelman.
"But I'm sure we could see it in maybe Belfast or Braehead in the future."
The match will be played on Sunday, 5 March, with the face-off to be confirmed.
