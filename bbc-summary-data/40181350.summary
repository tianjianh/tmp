Crues manager Stephen Baxter has raided the squad of their title rivals to secure the services of the 33-year-old.
The former Glentoran player, who can play in both midfield and defence, says it was "an easy decision to make".
Ward is Crusaders' second signing of the transfer window following the arrival of Danish goalkeeper Brian Jensen on a one-year deal.
Having played almost 400 games for Glentoran, Ward joined Linfield in 2013 and made his 150th appearance for the Blues in their 5-1 win away to Coleraine last April.
However, he struggled for a place in the starting team this season as the club claimed a league and cup double and he has now opted for a switch to Seaview.
"It was an easy decision to make once I had spoken to Stephen Baxter," Ward said.
"He shared his vision going forward as Crusaders move to regain the Premiership and I am looking forward to getting involved. I already know several of the team and I look forward to playing with them rather than against them."
The Crues boss has expressed his delight with his latest signing.
"Sean's experience will help us as we go again in the season ahead," Baxter said.
"Sean has been around the Irish League and knows what it is all about and by bringing him here it shows we are determined to go for a lot more silverware as soon as we can."
