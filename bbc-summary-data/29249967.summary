The Berlin ceremony honoured the year's best and most creative TV and radio shows with nine Golden Rose Awards.
Toast of London, starring Matt Berry as eccentric middle-aged actor Steven Toast, won Channel 4 the sitcom award.
Gogglebox, which won the reality and factual entertainment category, films real people watching and discussing the week's TV in their own living rooms.
The Channel 4 show returns for a new series on 26 September.
It has made stars of many of its sofa-dwellers, such as 'posh' couple Steph and Dom Parker and George Gilbey, who recently entered the Celebrity Big Brother house without mother Linda and step-dad Pete.
Comedian and actor Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman host popular early evening game show Pointless, which is made by Endemol for the BBC. It has aired several celebrity specials.
BBC Radio 4 comedy Bridget Christie Minds The Gap, featuring the comedian's personal take on the state of modern feminism, was also honoured at Wednesday night's ceremony, hosted by Croatian TV entertainer and journalist Aleksandar Kostadinov.
Winners from other countries include Israel's Little Mom, which won the comedy award, after what organisers called "a record-breaking year" for entries from TV companies around the world.
