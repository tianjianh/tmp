The man was pulled over in Devonshire Place, Eastbourne at about 20:00 GMT on Monday, but as an officer approached him he drove off, police said.
The BMW car he was driving was found soon after in nearby Paradise Drive.
The driver, 31, who was the only person in the vehicle, was pronounced dead at the scene. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating.
No other vehicles were involved in the crash, Sussex Police said.
A spokesman said the officers on patrol had not pursued the car after it was driven off and it was not seen again until an area search discovered it had crashed.
Paradise Drive was closed for seven hours following the crash.
Sussex Police's professional standards department is also investigating.
