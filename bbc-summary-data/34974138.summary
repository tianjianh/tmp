Emi, 22, wrote The Things She Told Me to reflect her own experiences as a woman, but she hopes it will resonate across the world.
The Sudanese-American who originates from Darfur only began writing slam poetry - work that is written for performance and that is often powerful and emotional in tone - when she arrived at university.
She is studying anthropology and molecular biology at Yale, and is one of the BBC's 100 Women 2015
