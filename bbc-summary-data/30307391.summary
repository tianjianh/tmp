The message, 'Curry my yougrt (sic), oil my AK-47', was sprayed on a wall outside DUP councillor George Duddy's house on Sunday.
The police said the attack on Mr Duddy's home at Drumaquill Road was a hate crime.
The men, aged 26 and 37, were released on police bail on Wednesday night, pending further enquiries.
A number of properties in the Coleraine area were searched on Wednesday and items were taken away by police for examination.
Part of the graffiti refers to comments made in the Northern Ireland Assembly when DUP MP Gregory Campbell said: "Curry my yoghurt can coca coalyer."
