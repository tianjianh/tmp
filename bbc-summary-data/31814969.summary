For her second track she played All Day by Kanye West as well as the new single Believe from Mumford and Sons.
"The new job has begun! I am looking forward to spending my evenings with you.
"I'll be playing the most exciting, fresh new music... here first."
The DJ took over from Zane Lowe who had been at the station for 12 years and has left to work with Apple in Los Angeles.
Annie said she was keen to keep the new music features from Zane's show but also bring her own ideas she developed from her time at Radio 1.
"We'll have a chunk of music that is just reflective of the mellower side of stuff; all genres, put my mic down, talk less and just let people get lost in the music a little bit", she said.
New band Wolf Alice, described as a cross between The xx and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, are from North London and made up of Ellie Rowsell, Joel Amey, Joff Oddie and Theo Ellis.
The name comes from a short story by Angela Carter, a Gothic retelling of Little Red Riding Hood, about girls growing up.
After playing at Reading Festival last year, they've gone from strength to strength, wowing critics and starting a cult following, including making fans of Manic Street Preachers and Peace.
In a recent interview they revealed Theo wanted to be a rugby player and Joff wanted to be an actor before they made the band, so they're a multi-talented bunch.
In February they released the lead single Giant Peach from their debut album My Love Is Cool, which is due to come out on in June.
