[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
France's government has survived vote of no confidence put forward by the opposition in protest over controversial labour reforms.

The motion, brought by the centre-right party Les Republicans, garnered 246 votes, shy of the 288 needed to defeat the reforms and topple the government.
Thousands of people marched through Paris as the vote took place, to protest against the proposals.
They will now be debated in France's Senate.
The controversial proposals, backed by Prime Minister Manuel Valls and President Francois Hollande, sparked ongoing and sometimes violent street protests across France, and fresh protests are now planned for next week.
Unions and student groups have so far blocked roads and barricaded schools in the western cities of Nantes and Rennes.
The opposition was expected ahead of the vote to be around 40 votes short of the required total.
Some lawmakers within President Hollande's own Socialist Party were expected to vote with the motion, in protest as what they see as legislation that is too pro-business.

The changes make it easier for employers to hire and fire, but opponents fear they will also enable employers to bypass workers' rights on pay, overtime and breaks.
The government argues that it needs to make the labour market more flexible in order to create jobs.
Mr Hollande chose to push through the legislation without parliamentary approval, using special executive powers, after months of resistance.
The law can only be defeated if a no-confidence vote is held and lost by the government - in which case the cabinet is forced to resign.
The tactic has only been used once before during his presidency, again to pass disputed economic reforms.
Demonstrators outside the National Assembly on Wednesday called for President Hollande to resign and protests continued into the night.
Police used tear gas against protesters in Grenoble and Montpellier, reports from social media say. There were also demonstrations in Lille, Tours and Marseille.
In Toulouse two young protesters were injured in clashes with police, according to Le Parisien (in French).
