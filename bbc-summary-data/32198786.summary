[SN]TITLE[SN]
Duke of Kent in hospital with hip injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duke of Kent is in hospital with a hip injury, Buckingham Palace has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Queen's cousin, 79, was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on Monday.
He is believed to have been staying at the Balmoral estate when he suffered the injury - suspected to be a dislocated hip.
The duke, who undertakes a large number of official royal engagements and has close associations with many charities, suffered a "mild stroke" in 2013.
He is perhaps best known as president of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, in which capacity he has presented trophies to winners at Wimbledon.
He is the son of the late Prince George and grandson of King George V, and became Duke of Kent at the age of six after his father's death in an RAF plane crash in 1942.
Balmoral is the Scottish home of the Royal Family.
