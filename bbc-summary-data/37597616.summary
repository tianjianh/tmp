The match at Hampden Park on 21 May was disrupted when fans invaded the pitch after Hibernian's 3-2 win over Rangers.
Hibs supporters flooded the pitch and some Rangers fans also made it past stewards before mounted police officers restored order.
A total of 81 people have been arrested as part on the ongoing investigation.
A police statement said: "Anyone with information about the identities of the persons pictured is asked to contact the incident room at Govan Police Office, Greater Glasgow CID on 0141 532 5457 or the dedicated mailbox address.
"Alternatively Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555111, where anonymity can be maintained."
The Scottish Football Association has said neither club will face punishment for the crowd trouble, in line with the governing body's disciplinary rules.
An independent report commissioned by the SFA said the Scottish government should consider making it a criminal offence to run on to a football pitch.
