The incident happened at about 08:00 BST in Glentham, near Market Rasen, while the 14-year-old was walking to catch her school bus.
The suspect is described as white, around 5ft 8in tall, and of medium to plump build.
He was wearing a black and white mask and had cream coloured trousers.
Sgt Clive Farmer, from the local policing team, said while the incident had been "very distressing for the girl and her family, it is extremely rare".
He said officers would be maintaining a presence in the village and asked that anyone with information should contact the force.
