Osborne's five-year funding pledge for Wales 'disappointing'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is "extremely disappointing" the minimum funding pledge for Wales can only be guaranteed for five years, Wales' finance minister has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jane Hutt said any funding deal should be permanent.
Her call comes following Chancellor George Osborne's promise on Wednesday that spending per head on devolved services in Wales would not fall below 115% of spending per head in England.
Mr Osborne's Spending Review covered the period up until the next election.
Ms Hutt  told Sunday Politics Wales: "They said it could be re-set for the next parliament. Well that means they could get rid of it.
"If we're going to have this funding floor, it has to be permanent.
"If we secure that, and I'm willing to sit with the UK government and secure that long-term inter-governmental agreement, then I do believe that we will have made progress in getting fairer funding for Wales."
Mr Osborne also said control of some of the income tax levied in Wales can be devolved to the Welsh government without a referendum.
It means Welsh ministers could control ??3bn of taxes a year by 2020.
