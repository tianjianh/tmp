The BBC has announced the British singer will be spinning on the big red chair for the fourth series of the show.
She's replacing Kylie Minogue, but the rest of the line-up is the same.
Will.i.am and Sir Tom Jones are back for the fourth time, while Ricky Wilson from Kaiser Chiefs returns for his second series.
In a statement, Rita Ora said she was "excited" to be joining the show.
With four UK number one singles, she currently ties with Geri Halliwell as the British female artist with the most solo chart-toppers.
She recently made her movie debut in the 50 Shades of Grey adaptation.
Her fellow coach will.i.am said: "Sir Tom Jones is our rock, Ricky is awesome and it's our pleasure to welcome the very talented Rita Ora. Rita is sweet, spicy and sassy - she's going to be a great addition to the Coaches team."
Emma Willis and Marvin Humes return to present the BBC One show as well.
While the show has been a ratings success, the programme has yet to find a star who's achieved mainstream UK chart success.
Jermain Jackman won the third series of the programme but hasn't released a debut album yet.
Previous winners included Leanne Mitchell and Andrea Begley but neither were a success.
Moira Ross, The Voice UK's executive producer, said: "The Voice has gone from strength to strength with each passing year and series four promises to be bigger than ever."
The new series launches in January 2015.
