Djibril Sidibe had put Monaco ahead when he chipped keeper Alphonse Areola.
But Alves, who signed from Juventus on a free transfer earlier this month, netted a 51st-minute equaliser from a brilliant 35-yard free-kick.
The Brazilian, 34, then set up Adrien Rabiot to head home the winner for the Coupe de France winners.
It is the fifth time PSG have won the trophy contested between the cup winners and league champions of France.
The game was staged in front of a capacity crowd of 45,000 in Tangiers, Morocco.
