World number 14 Wilson had seen a 5-0 lead whittled down to 9-7 by the end of the second session on Friday morning.
But he kept Bingham at bay with an open and attacking style of play to progress in an increasingly edgy encounter.
Ding Junhui withstood a classy Liang Wenbo fightback to secure a 9-7 lead in an all-Chinese second-round meeting.
Wilson, who lost to eventual winner Mark Selby in the last eight in 2016, showed impressive maturity to stave off Bingham's determined fightback and said he is fully focused on winning the tournament.
"I love the World Championship. I feel comfortable here," he said. "I feel like I am a consistent top-16 player.
"I'm not here to think about just getting through to the next round; I am here to win it. It's been my dream to win the tournament since I was a little boy and that's the aim."
Bingham took Friday morning's opening frame with one of four breaks of 50 plus in the session.
Wilson replied with a well-constructed 110 and then won a captivating final frame, clearing up after laying a brilliant snooker on the final red to ensure he stayed in front at 9-7.
Bingham won two of the next three to get back to 10-9, but the Kettering potter then took two frames in a row.
And after the Essex man missed the 11th red in a 147 chance, Wilson, who faces John Higgins or Mark Allen in the quarter-finals, closed out victory.
Bingham, who made the highest break of the tournament so far, 137, said: "That obviously hurt. It was so on, as soon as I went into the reds."
He plans to work with coach and 1979 world champion Terry Griffiths next season.
Ding, last year's runner-up, was in imperious form as he established a 6-2 advantage in the morning session with breaks of 111 and 113 and three half-centuries.
He outscored his opponent 626 points to 200 and ended with a 93% pot success rate after a one-sided morning session
But Liang, the world number 13, knocked in breaks of 84, 75 and 130 as he got back to 7-5.
The pair shared frames after the mid-session interval to tee up a fascinating final session on Saturday afternoon.
