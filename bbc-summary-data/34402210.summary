Cardiff council has announced the initiative to ensure short-distance fares are being accepted, in the wake of three sex attacks in the city.
The city's taxi association has denied claims some drivers have turned people away for short-distance taxi trips.
Trading Standards Officers will pose as the mystery shoppers, the council said.
Residents, visitors and commuters have been advised to use the taxi ranks at Greyfriers Road and Lower St Mary Street on Thursday night.
Councillor Jacqueline Parry, licensing committee chairwoman, said: "I read with interest the recent media reports on taxi drivers and claims that people are being refused because the fare is too short.
"We take these matters very seriously. Taxi drivers should be ambassadors to our city and complaints will be investigated.
"If you are getting a taxi from a taxi rank, the light is on, and the fare starts and ends within Cardiff, the driver has to take you home and must use the meter. It is as simple as that."
