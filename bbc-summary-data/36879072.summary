Police in Narayanganj say it is unclear why Sagar Barman was assaulted.
Last year, a 13-year-old boy was killed in the same way in a vehicle workshop in another part of the country.
Two men were sentenced to death over the case, which sparked large protests.
Bangladesh boy killings: Six sentenced to death
Rakib Hawlader died in August last year after air was pumped into his body in retaliation for leaving his job.
His death followed the killing of another teenager, Samiul Alam Rajon, who was beaten to death by a mob after allegedly stealing a bicycle.
Four men were sentenced to death over that killing.
Child labour is common in Bangladesh, with many children working in unofficial garment factories, often in harsh conditions.
