[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative Peter McCall has been elected Cumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He polled 41,345 votes after the second round of counting, ahead of Labour's Reg Watson, who totalled 30,437.
As Mr McCall had not secured more than 50% of the vote initially, a second count was required with second preference votes added.
He said he was "proud to serve his home county" and would avoid "Punch and Judy politics".
Liberal Democrat Loraine Birchall, Independent Mary Robinson and UKIP's Michael Pye were eliminated after the first count.
