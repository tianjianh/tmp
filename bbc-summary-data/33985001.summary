Residents in Balcombe, which was at the centre of anti-fracking protests two years ago, purchased the panels.
They are being installed on Balcombe Primary School and also Turners Hill School, in nearby village Turners Hill.
More than 1,000 protesters set up camp in the village in 2013 when energy firm Cuadrilla test-drilled for oil.
There were fears this could lead to fracking, which the company denied.
Joe Nixon, spokesman for the Repower Balcombe project, said: "We are very happy to get solar panels up on Balcombe and Turners Hill primary schools.
"The local kids returning from summer holidays will learn how solar energy works and attend lessons powered by the sun.
"We are also excited about our plans for Chiddinglye Farm for a 5MW solar farm that will provide more clean energy to our community in sunny Sussex."
The organisation said Balcombe Primary School would use about 80% of the power generated which would save it Â£530 per year.
