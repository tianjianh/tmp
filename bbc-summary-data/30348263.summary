[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trucker who killed a fellow lorry driver in a crash fell asleep at the wheel seconds before, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Nimmo, 24, of County Durham, died in the collision on the A19 outside Middlesbrough, in August 2013.
John Kirk, 26, had slept for only a few hours in the previous 31 and ploughed into Mr Nimmo's Volvo and a Ford Focus, Teesside Crown Court was told.
Kirk, of Boston, Lincolnshire, was jailed for five years for causing death by dangerous driving.
Mr Nimmo, from Murton, had been involved in a minor collision with the Ford Focus and was parked on the hard shoulder exchanging details with its driver, Lada Khazanovych, 38.
Kirk's Skania articulated lorry smashed into them at around 05:25 BST - killing Mr Nimmo instantly while Ms Khazanovych suffered serious leg injuries and a cut to her scalp.
Prosecutor Shaun Dodds said Kirk had been driving back to Spalding from Washington in good conditions and daylight.
In the aftermath, Kirk admitted to police: "I was nodding".
Analysis of his phone showed he had accessed porn sites on the outgoing drive to Washington and he had made a 40-minute phone call despite not having a hands-free kit, the court was told.
The defendant had altered his tachograph and was flouting rules about breaks and minimum daily and weekly rest periods, the court heard.
Matthew Gent, defending, said Kirk had been overworking and had a second job as a printer, as he wanted to make a better life for him and his wife, who has since left him.
He pleaded guilty on a previous occasion to causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and falsely recording rest days.
Kirk was also disqualified from driving for five years.
