Wasps: Coventry City fans worried by possible groundshare

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry City fans have added their weight to concerns over media reports linking Premiership rugby union club Wasps with a move to the Ricoh Arena.

The Wycombe-based club are considering a possible move to the Midlands.
Worcester director of rugby Dean Ryan has already expressed concerns.
And the Sky Blue Trust, who proved a loud voice during the League One club's year-long exile in Northampton, say that Wasps coming to the city would again make the future "uncertain".
Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), the Ricoh owners, first looked at Wasps as potential tenants as an alternative revenue stream during the long battle over rent with the Sky Blues.
That has been settled in the short term, with City having played two games back at the stadium since their emotional return to Coventry at the start of September.
But, although any move is still subject to both Premiership and Rugby Football Union approval and would also be an issue for the city's three rugby union clubs, Coventry, Broadstreet and Barkers' Butts, the City fans are already making their feelings known.
"The recent story about Wasps taking a majority stake in ACL, the Ricoh Arena operating company, raises some major concerns among Coventry City supporters," said the Sky Blue Trust statement.
"The Sky Blue Trust has stated it believes that for the good of the football club its long term future lies at the Ricoh Arena, either as tenants or owners, with access to all relevant income streams and, on the face of it, this news makes that future uncertain.
"We are in contact with all the relevant parties to establish the facts and the potential implications on the future of Coventry City. Once we have obtained these, we will be in a position to make a decision on what stance the Sky Blue Trust should take."
Wasps were also reported to have looked at Birmingham's Alexander Stadium - primarily an athletics venue.
The near-century old rugby club spent the vast majority of their amateur days playing in their traditional home at Sudbury, in north west London.
They started their existence as a Premiership club at Loftus Road before moving to their current home at Adams Park in 2002.
Having failed to find a new home close to their current base, where they share with Wycombe Wanderers, they are now understood to have considered a move to Coventry, where they once played a Heineken Cup game in 2007.
