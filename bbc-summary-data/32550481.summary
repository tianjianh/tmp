South Western Ambulance Service said the child was hit "at slow speed" as a train pulled into Camborne, Cornwall, on Thursday at about 16:50 BST.
An eyewitness said the girl grabbed a carriage door handle and was dragged down "almost instantly".
Devon and Cornwall Police said the girl was airlifted to hospital with minor back and leg injuries.
Witness Jade Willoughby was waiting on the platform to meet her boyfriend when the girl fell and described hearing her scream. "It went right through me" she said.
"She completely disappeared from sight and then the scream suddenly stopped. I didn't want to look because I thought she wasn't going to make it."
Miss Willoughby, 21, said a man on the platform ran over and pulled her out.
The girl was alone so Miss Willoughby travelled with her by air ambulance to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.
She said the girl spent the night in hospital.
British Transport Police (BTP) is investigating and said it was being treated as an accident.
First Great Western, which runs the service, says it is working with the BTP "to ascertain the full circumstances".
