The Korea Swimming Federation (KSF) is suspected of forging documents and siphoning off expenses, South Korea's culture ministry said.
One of the KSF's executive officers and other officials have been arrested.
Subsidies to other sports federations have been cut, suggesting further investigations could be announced.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it had confiscated computer hard drives and documents on projects supporting the country's sports industry, the Yonhap news agency reported.
There were also raids on 20 other organisations linked to the KSF.
The raid came after the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism cut subsidies to the KSF over the corruption allegations.
Other sports federations, including the Korea Shooting Federation and Korean Equestrian Federation, have also had subsidies cut.
The KSF has not yet commented on the raids.
Last year, a number of sports company bosses were charged after an investigation into misappropriation of state funds at the state-run Korea Sports Promotion Foundation (KSPO).
