Google Play, YouTube and XBox Movies users will be able to see the film.
It will also be streamed on a dedicated site, seetheinterview.com.
The deal comes a day after Newsbeat was told that there would be limited viewings of the film in several US cinemas on 25 December.
Sony had previously cancelled the film's release following threats from hackers to target screenings.
The unusual release marks one of the first times a studio movie will be shown simultaneously in cinemas and video on demand.
The film, which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen, follows the story of a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The comedy led to hacks on the studio, which the US blamed on North Korea.
The studio is expected to name more streaming partners for the Thursday release of the film.
US President Barack Obama has said he "applauds Sony's decision" to screen The Interview on Christmas Day.
"As the president made clear, we are a country that believes in free speech, and the right of artistic expression," a White House spokesman said.
The statement added the decision "allows people to make their own choices about the film".
The film is expected to show in 200 mostly independent cinemas in America on Thursday.
The interview was originally scheduled for release in the UK on 6 February, it is not yet clear if these details have changed.
