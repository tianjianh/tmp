[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The latest plans for a £2bn "garden village" on the outskirts of Cardiff have been submitted to planners.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Redrow Homes' outline proposals for the greenfield site near St Fagans includes almost 6,000 homes, four schools, shops and parks.
If passed, Plasdwr will be built over 20 years and will also include sports and healthcare facilities.
But residents and politicians have objected over traffic, overdevelopment and environmental concerns.
Plans for the first stages of the development, which will see about 1,000 homes built on land near Pentrebane Road and Llantrisant Road, have already been granted.
The latest phase of the scheme is for homes on a 900 acre-site (368 hectare) of fields bordering Fairwater, St Fagans, Danescourt and Radyr.
As well as homes, it includes proposals for three primary schools, a secondary school, playgrounds, play areas and facilities for teenagers such as a BMX or skateboard park.
There could also be two food stores, a GP surgery and dentist, sports pitches and allotments as well as restaurants and pubs.
New roads, bus routes and cycle paths are also planned.
But community councils in Radyr and Morganstown and St Fagans are against the scheme, while a petition of more than 200 names and 130 letters have also been submitted in opposition.
Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy and Rod McKerlich, councillor for Radyr and Morganstown, are also against it.
Their concerns include worries about wildlife, increased traffic, and questions over whether local services could cope with the large influx of new residents it would bring.
The planning application will be considered by councillors on Wednesday.
