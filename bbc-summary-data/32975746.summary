[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who stabbed his family to death before killing himself had done online research days before about carrying out executions, an inquest heard.

Jitendra Lad, 49, killed his wife Daksha, 44, and daughters Trisha, 19, and Nisha, 16, at their home in Clayton, Bradford, last October.
Bradford Coroner's Court was told Mr Lad had searched the web on "how to cut someone's throat and executions" .
Coroner Martin Fleming recorded a verdict of suicide on Mr Lad.
The bodies were found by a neighbour on the evening of 27 October, in what Mr Fleming described as a "scene of unimaginable horror".
Mr Lad had used a scuba-diving knife to stab his daughters and his wife in their beds in the early hours of 25 October, the hearing was told.
He was found hanged at the family's detached home in Blackberry Way and had probably taken his own life two days after the killings, having been spotted by a number of people over that weekend.
Pathologist Brian Rogers said Trisha had suffered 33 different wounds, including to her neck and chest, which indicated she had put up a "considerable fight" before she died.
Her sister, Nisha, suffered eight different wounds, while their mother suffered a total of five injuries, of which four were deep stab wounds that severed arteries in her neck and her chest, he said.
The hearing was told how Mr Lad had no medical history of mental illness and no sign of financial problems.
Relatives and friends told the hearing they had appeared to be a normal, loving family.
In a statement read out in court, Mr Lad's brother Raman said: "There was nothing about the family that was anything other than normal and close.
"I can think of no reason at all for what's happened."
But Det Sgt Duncan Jackson told the inquest how Mr Lad had also carried out research on depression in the days leading up to the killings.
He said Mr Lad had been stressed at work as an IT manager.
Feeling he had been over-promoted, he had asked his boss about reverting to his previous position, the officer told the hearing.
He also said how the father had told a woman on holiday two months before his death about how unhappy he was with his life and imminently turning 50.
Mr Fleming said: "We will never know for sure what was going through Jitendra's mind at that time."
He said he was sure Mr Lad had intended to take his own life.
Evidence pointed to him trying to take an overdose of painkillers during the weekend. He was also seen driving to the 12th floor of a city centre car park shortly after he killed his family.
