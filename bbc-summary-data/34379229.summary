Mother-of-five Tracey Fidler, from Reading, has been taken to court by Reading Borough Council for the non-attendance of her now 11-year-old son.
She says Adam, who was aged nine at the time his father was killed, was "grieving" and "in a state".
Reading council said it was urgently trying to find a resolution.
The next hearing will be at Reading Magistrates' Court on 9 October.
Ms Fidler, who denies the offence, could be fined up to Â£2,500, given a community order or jailed for up to three months.
She said being in court for her son not attending Battle Primary Academy enough times was "unbelievable".
She said: "He wasn't going to school basically because he was grieving for his dad. Since the incident he's been suffering big time.
"He wasn't off school because he was truanting, he was off because he was grieving.
"He's scared his mum is going to be taken away from him now. I'm just dreading the outcome."
Ms Fidler is representing herself in what is a civil prosecution.
Her fiancee, Kris Jarvis, 39, who worked for Reading council, died on 13 February 2014 when he and his friend John Morland were hit by Alexander Walters, 31, from Purley-on-Thames.
A petition set up by Mr Morland's fiancee Amy Parks asking for proceedings to be dropped has attracted more than 6,500 signatures.
Reading council said it had "made contact with the family with a view to urgently meeting with them and finding a resolution".
