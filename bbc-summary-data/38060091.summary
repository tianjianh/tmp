[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fabio Saraiva scored a late winner as Woking edged out Bromley in their National League meeting at Kingfield Stadium.

The home side took the lead just after the half-hour mark when former Wycombe striker Gozie Ugwu headed home Frazer Shaw's cross for his seventh goal from the last four games.
The Cards' lead did not last long as - three minutes later - Bromley were awarded a penalty for a foul and, although goalkeeper Brandon Hall guessed the right way, Blair Turgott slotted the ball home to level the scores at the break.
But man-of-the-match Saraiva unleashed an unstoppable 25-yard drive into the top-right corner to clinch maximum points for Garry Hill's hosts with 10 minutes remaining.
