NHS Scotland staff 'less positive' about jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS workers in Scotland are slightly less positive about their jobs than they were last year, according to the annual health service staff survey.

The survey suggested that staffing levels and a lack of consultation continued to be the biggest concerns.
But the vast majority said they were happy to "go the extra mile" and trusted their direct line manager.
The survey was completed by 60,681 of NHS Scotland's 160,635 staff - the highest response rate in its history.
Overall, health workers responded less positively to 17 of the 29 questions and more positively to four questions. The remaining eight questions saw no percentage change.
Among the key findings were:
The 33% of all employees who thought their department had enough staff fell to 26% for nurses and midwives and 12% for ambulance personnel.
The report said there had been "statistically significant" improvements in one of the 29 questions, and significant deteriorations in four questions.
But all eight statements relating to the overall experience of working for the NHS received a positive response from 53% or more of all respondents.
Norman Provan, Royal College of Nursing Scotland associate director, said: "Demand on NHS services resources continues to outstrip supply, putting staff under enormous pressure.
"It is worrying that nurses and midwives, like other staff groups, say that they are not consulted about changes and that they are also unclear about how changes will work out in practice.
"The experience of staff on the frontline is key to building sustainable services and better, safer patient care. It is crucial that they are listened to."
Health Secretary Shona Robison welcomed the increase in responses to the survey, and said the feedback was "extremely important in letting us know what is going right and where we can make improvements".
She added: "It is welcome that staff remain committed to their roles, with almost nine out of ten willing to go the 'extra mile' at work. It is also promising that so many staff members have confidence and trust in their direct line manager, and get help and support from colleagues when needed.
"However, we know there are challenges to be addressed, in particular making staff feel engaged and involved in the decisions being made within their health board.
"It is vital that we learn from these findings, and I will be expecting all health boards to use their individual survey results to work with staff to bring in changes which will further improve staff experience."
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the survey "highlights again just how short we are of nurses, and the SNP has to take full responsibility for that".
Scottish Labour's Dr Richard Simpson said NHS staff do "incredible work every day" but were "under valued and overworked" by the Scottish government.
