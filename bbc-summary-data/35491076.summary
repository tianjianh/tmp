The event was called-off on Saturday and Ffos Las are prepared to compensate some of those who were set to feature.
"I will be contacting all trainers to discuss a contribution to travelling expenses," Ottesen said.
"And the Professional Jockeys Association to ensure some compensation for jockeys with travel expenses."
The meeting was called off at midday after 30mm of rain fell in 20 hours leading to the track becoming waterlogged.
"The course was fit for racing at 9am but the weather deteriorated during the morning," Ottesen confirmed.
"A delegation of racecourse officials, trainers, jockeys and BHA officials inspected the course at midday and felt the surface was unsafe for racing to go-ahead."
The next meeting at Ffos Las Racecourse is on Sunday, 21 February.
Ffos Las' Champion Hurdle was one of several Welsh sporting events to fall foul of the weather.
In football, Newport County's League Two game at Rodney Parade against Barnet was postponed.
Cwmbran Celtic v Goytre, Guilsfield v Airbus UK and Afan Lido v Cardiff Met in the Welsh Cup were called off.
In rugby's SSE Swalec Cup, Llanelli v Merthyr and Pontypridd v Bridgend Athletic were among the postponements.
Colwyn Bay and Merthyr Town's home games were also called off.
In Friday the Welsh Premier League's Carmarthen v Haverfordwest County game was called off for a second time and is now to be played on 4 March.
