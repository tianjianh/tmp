The former midfielder, 37, captained the side when they won League One and the Football League Trophy in 2014-15.
Elliott, who made 222 league starts for Burnley and joined the Robins from Birmingham City in 2014 after an initial loan spell, retired last year.
"He's been a fantastic servant for the club and I wish him the very best of luck in his future career," head coach Lee Johnson told the City website.
A club statement said: "The club is in the process of restructuring its coaching setup and, following detailed discussions, (Elliott) will depart BS3."
