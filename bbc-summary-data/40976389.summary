Firefighters were called to the reservoir at 15:42 BST and found the boy had been pulled from the water.
Station commander Simon Woodward, from West Midlands Fire Service, said his death served as a "tragic reminder" of the dangers of swimming in open water.
"We commend the actions of those who tried to save him but would urge people to call 999 as soon as possible in such circumstances, to avoid putting themselves in danger," he said.
"Drowning is one of the most common causes of death for people under 16 in the summer months.
"Many misjudge how well they can swim, often unaware of how cold the water can be and what this does to their stamina and strength."
A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: "When ambulance staff arrived, they found a teenage boy who had been pulled from the reservoir and was being given CPR.
"Ambulance staff took over resuscitation efforts on scene before the teen was taken by land ambulance on blue lights to Birmingham Children's Hospital."
