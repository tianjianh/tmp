Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has stressed the importance of taking their opening day Premier League defeat by Manchester United in "isolation".

Howe saw his Cherries side beaten 3-1 at home in Jose Mourinho's first league game as United manager.
"There were some very good aspects of play," Howe told BBC Radio Solent.
"I'm certainly not all doom and gloom as we're not going to be judged against the top four this season, it's going to be against other teams."

Goals from Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Zlatan Ibrahimovic put United 3-0 up, with Adam Smith's effort after 69 minutes coming as a consolation goal for the hosts.
"We have to take these games in isolation, like you need to against all of the top four sides," Howe said.
"It's important that we don't go negative and everyone stays very strong in the belief that we will come back from this."
Howe also handed debuts to summer signings Jordon Ibe and Lewis Cook in midfield, with the pair encouraging Howe with their performances.
"It's difficult to come into this team quickly because of how we play," he said. "But, both players did very well and I think showed glimpses of what they will bring."
