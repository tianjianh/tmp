Robbie Brittain, who used to teach at Langley School at Loddon, was charged by officers from Norfolk Police's child abuse investigation unit on Wednesday.
Mr Brittain, 29, is accused of engaging in sexual activity with a girl under 16 and abuse of a position of trust.
The alleged offences took place with one girl when he taught at the school in 2012 and 2013.
Mr Brittain, of Old Oak Close, Wymondham, is due to appear at Norwich Magistrates' Court on Friday 28 August.
The school said Mr Brittain was suspended as soon as the allegations came to light and has not been at the school at all during this academic year.
"We are assisting Norfolk Constabulary with their investigation in whatever way we can and have worked closely with Norfolk County Council and have followed all safeguarding procedures.
"Our focus continues to be the wellbeing of our students, and staff."
The school would not comment further due to the nature of the investigation.
