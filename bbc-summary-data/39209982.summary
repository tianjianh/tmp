[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An on-the-run sex offender who committed crimes as a man but was tried as a woman has been arrested following an appeal on BBC's Crimewatch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lisa Hauxwell, 48, was sentenced to 14 years in her absence in November 2016 for rape and indecent assault.
Hauxwell, from Darlington, was arrested in Newark, Nottinghamshire on Tuesday, police said.
Hauxwell, who police said was living as a man when found, was tracked down after dozens responded to the appeal.
Nottinghamshire Police said of the 48-year-old, who committed the crimes as Craig John Hauxwell: "The fugitive had carried out the offences while living as a man, but was sentenced under the name of Lisa."
Det Insp Yvonne Dutson of Durham Police said: "This a fantastic result and due entirely to the calls we had following the appeal on Crimewatch.
"We understand Hauxwell had been living at the address in Newark for several months, without anyone knowing his true identity."
The sex assaults took place in the Newton Aycliffe area of County Durham during 2001 and 2002.
The two rapes and seven indecent assaults were described by police as "horrendous".
Hauxwell will be handed over to police in Durham "in due course", police said.
