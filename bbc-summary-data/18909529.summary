President: Michel Temer
Michel Temer was sworn in as president in August 2016 after senators voted to remove Dilma Rousseff from office over financial irregularities.
His inauguration brought to an end the 13-year rule of Ms Rousseff's left-wing Workers' Party.
A veteran of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Mr Temer will serve out the rest of Ms Rousseff's term to the end of 2018.
Once political allies, Mr Temer served as vice-president in Ms Rousseff's government for over five years before playing a key role in impeachment proceedings against her. He acted as interim president during her trial.
In his first televised cabinet meeting following his inauguration, Mr Temer pledged to bring back "political stability" to the recession-stricken country.
"My only interest is in handing over to my successor a country that is reconciled, pacified and growing economically," he said.
Descriptions of his public persona have ranged from "a good negotiator" to "conspirator", and Mr Temer has himself been implicated in corruption scandals. The former law professor is married, and has five children with three women.
South America's biggest media market is home to thousands of radio stations and hundreds of TV channels. TV has long been the most influential medium.
Media ownership is highly concentrated. Domestic conglomerates such as Globo, Brazil's most-successful broadcaster, dominate the market and run TV and radio networks, newspapers and pay-TV operations.
The constitution guarantees a free press and there is vigorous debate in the media on social and political issues.
