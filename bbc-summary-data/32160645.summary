Boy and grandmother attacked by French Mastiff in Staffordshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A three-year-old boy and his grandmother are in hospital after being attacked by a dog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boy had his leg broken and suffered numerous cuts to his face and body during the attack at a farm in Staffordshire on Wednesday evening.
The grandmother was bitten several times as she tried to protect the boy from the French Mastiff dog which is thought to have escaped from its pen.
The dog has been destroyed and a man arrested under the Dangerous Dogs Act.
The boy has been taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where his condition is described as stable, but not life-threatening. His grandmother is recovering after an operation to treat her wounds.
The arrested man, in his 60s, has since been released on bail.
Insp Bob Champeau, from Staffordshire Police, said it was a distressing incident for those involved and the family are shocked and upset.
"Police and ambulance crews attending had to work quickly with those at the farm to bring the dog under control before they were able to treat the two injured people.," he said.
The circumstances which led to the dog attacking the family are being examined.
Insp Champeau said the incident occurred at a family-owned farm, in a isolated location, and no other members of the community were put at risk.
French Mastiffs are more commonly known as Dogue De Bordeaux.
