Mrs Beshenivsky was killed outside a travel agency in Morley Street on 18 November 2005 while responding to an armed robbery call.
The service was held in Norfolk Gardens where a minute's silence was observed at the exact time she was shot.
Her husband Paul and family were joined by police colleagues.
The mother of three and stepmother of two died after she was shot in the chest on what was her youngest daughter Lydia's fourth birthday.
Her shift partner, PC Teresa Milburn, was also shot and injured during the incident.
Two men were jailed for life for her murder.
Dozens of new floral tributes have been left at the memorial in the city centre.
Ch Supt Simon Atkin, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "The memorial service for family, friends, colleagues and community members from across Bradford is to ensure that we can collectively come together to remember police constable 6410 Sharon Beshenivsky.
"Our thoughts are still with Paul and his family as we recall that fateful day 10 years ago when Sharon was killed in the line of duty.
"We come together as friends within the police family to reflect and support as we ensure that Sharon will not be forgotten."
Lord Mayor of Bradford Joanne Dodds said: "Sharon made the ultimate sacrifice and gave her life protecting us and ensuring we could continue to enjoy the liberty, freedom and way of life we all value so dearly."
