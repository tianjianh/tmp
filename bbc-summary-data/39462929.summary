[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers 0-2 Barnsley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals in the first 10 minutes gave Barnsley a victory at Blackburn which put Rovers in deeper relegation trouble in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wins for Nottingham Forest and Bristol City, and Burton's draw with Aston Villa, left Blackburn four points from safety with five games remaining.
Captain Marc Roberts headed Barnsley in front from Ryan Kent's corner after just three minutes at Ewood Park.
Marley Watkins fired a superb second in off the crossbar from 25 yards.
Having made a bright start under Tony Mowbray following his appointment in February, Rovers have not won in seven games and results elsewhere have pushed them closer to the drop.
Blackburn have not been in the third tier since 1979-80.
Connor Mahoney offered the main threat in reply after Barnsley's fast start, and his delivery from a corner created the home side's best chance as Derrick Williams' header was cleared off the line by George Moncur.
Blackburn boss Tony Mowbray: "It's always been a big job and today's results obviously don't help at all.
"If you're looking for a positive and a light at the end of the tunnel, the next two games are against Forest and Bristol City and we have to go and try and take maximum points of course.
"It's a time to stick together, it's a time not to pick holes in each other. It's a time to find team spirit that will hopefully get us results."
Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom: "In terms of the money we've spent and the budget we've got, it's an unbelievable  achievement. If there was a league table for points per pound, we may be top.
"I'm delighted, but we've also set the players a little target of finishing with as many wins as losses as a minimum, plus positive goal difference.
"We're on course and if we do that, we'll probably be the best Barnsley team since the one that got into the play-offs in 2000."
