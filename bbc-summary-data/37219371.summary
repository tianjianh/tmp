[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five detainees took control of a residential unit at Oberstown Youth Detention Centre after keys were taken from a member of staff.
The detainees were joined by three others, and gained access to the roof.
A fire began on the roof at 20:00 BST causing extensive damage to the building.
Six fire engines were used as rescue workers battled the flames, said the Dublin Fire Brigade.
A Garda (Irish police) emergency response unit and ambulances also attended the scene.
A Garda police investigation is under way into the cause of the fire.
The detention centre had been operating with minimum staff coverage due to strike action, said its director, Pat Bergin.
A number of staff had came to the assistance of colleagues from the picket line, but the strike action continued, added Mr Bergin.
Irish Minister for Children Katherine Zappone has ordered a report following the fire, called on the facility's staff, management and the unions to resume discussions to resolve their industrial relations dispute as soon as possible.
Bats and golf clubs
Earlier this month, five detainees escaped overnight from the campus armed with bats and golf clubs.
The boys, aged between 15 and 17, were returned to the centre following a police search involving air and dog units.
The campus caters for residents under the age of 18, including young offenders and criminals with multiple convictions for serious offences.
