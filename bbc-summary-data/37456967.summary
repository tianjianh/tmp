[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gwernyfed and Brecon Powys schools shake-up gets go ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A final decision on plans to reorganise schools in Powys has been made by the council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Llandrindod and Builth high schools will close and reopen as one school from September 2018.
Llanbister and Llanfihangel Rhydithon primaries will remain open, due to an increase expected in pupil numbers.
A proposal to merge Gwernyfed and Brecon high schools and establish one new school has been abandoned, with a new 11-18 campus planned in Brecon.
The Gwernyfed campus will also be improved.
The authority will re-consult on proposals to close the Welsh stream at Brecon high, and deliver it instead at the Builth Wells campus of the new two-site high school.
The decisions follow a wide-ranging consultation earlier this year.
