The Liverpool singer, whose 1987 single Wonderful Life was a top 10 hit around the world, suffered head injuries and has been placed in an induced coma.
"He is likely to remain under heavy sedation for a number of days and the outcome at this stage is unclear," said his spokesman.
The star is surrounded by "warmth, love and the best possible care," he added.
"We know he and the family will appreciate your thoughts and positive hopes for his full recovery."
Hundreds of fans have written messages of support on the musician's Facebook page.
Although he is best known for the 1980s singles Sweetest Smile and Wonderful Life, the singer has released 15 albums under his own name. Last year, he returned to his original stage name for a crowd-funded album, Blind Faith, which received positive reviews.
He has also published poetry and staged exhibitions of his paintings in south-west Ireland, where he now lives.
