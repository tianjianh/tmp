[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 40 skeletons have been uncovered by archaeologists at the site of a Roman cemetery in Gloucester.

The discovery was made during a dig at the former Gloscat site at Greyfriars in Brunswick Road, ahead of a housing development being built.
It has been described as one of the most significant archaeological finds in the city in the past 30 years.
The skeletons could end up in the care of Gloucester museum after scientific tests have been carried out.
Stuart Joyce from Cotswold Archaeology said: "We're just outside the walls of the Roman city of Glevum and this would have been the Roman cemetery associated with the city.
"This is probably one of the most significant finds that has been made within Gloucester within the last 30 years. It will add greatly to the knowledge of the [city]."
Forty skeletons were uncovered nearby in the 1960s. These are now kept at Exeter University.
"The cemetery itself was known previously, but this is the first time that such an [archaeological dig] in this area has been conducted under modern excavation practice," added Mr Joyce.
"Maybe another 20 to 30 will come up during subsequent excavations, but the number is very hard to say."
Excavation work on the site is expected to last for at least another two years while a new housing development is built.
