Two men were badly injured when a black Seat left the A698 Hawick to Kelso road near Timpendean, Jedburgh, and landed in a field at about 14:00 on Monday
The men, who were both passengers in the vehicle, were treated at Borders General Hospital.
The male driver of the car suffered minor injuries in the accident, about a mile west of Cleikimin.
A police spokesman said a Vauxhall Corsa was also in the area at the time, but was not involved in a collision with the Seat.
The road was closed for about six hours while police investigated the incident.
Sgt Vinnie Fisher said: "This was a serious collision and we are eager to speak to anyone who may have witnessed this collision or who saw two dark coloured cars on the A698 between Hawick and Cleikimin between 13:45 and 14:10 on Monday to come forward."
