The match will be played at Doncaster's Keepmoat Stadium on 21 October.
"We're pleased that France have agreed to come over. We've not beaten them for a long time so we're looking to change that," said England boss Mark Sampson.
England and France's last meeting ended in a goalless draw at the SheBelieves Cup in March.
France, third in the Fifa world rankings, were among the first to qualify for Euro 2017. England sealed qualification with a 7-0 win over Serbia in June.
They finish their qualification campaign against Belgium in Leuven on Tuesday (18:00 BST), where a draw will be enough to see them top Group Seven.
The draw for the final of Euro 2017 will take place in Rotterdam on 8 November.
Coverage of England's final Euro 2017 qualifier is available on the BBC Red Button and BBC Sport website from 18:00 BST on Tuesday.
