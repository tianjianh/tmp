Wentworth PGA: Danny Willett shoots 68 to lead at 10 under

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Masters champion Danny Willett carded 29 for the opening nine holes of his second round as he took the clubhouse lead in the PGA Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Englishman, 28, had six birdies in his outward nine as he shot a four-under-par 68 at Wentworth.
On the 10th tee, Willett was 12 under and threatening Paul McGinley's tournament-record halfway score of 13 under but a bogey stalled his progress.
Kiradech Aphibarnrat, Rafael Cabrera-Bello and Joost Luiten are five under.
