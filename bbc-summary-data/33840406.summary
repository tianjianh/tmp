The teenager from Bracknell overcame a nose bleed to shoot a perfect 16 as she beat Poland's Aleksandra Jarmolinska in the bronze medal match.
It was Hill's second success in quick succession in Azerbaijan, after she won gold at the European Games in Baku earlier this year.
"To come away with bronze was more than I could have asked for," Hill said.
"To win two medals in a matter of a couple of months is an amazing feeling and it really feels that my hard work has paid off. I've got a great support team around me which is helping me get to that point."
Italy's Katiuscia Spada took gold, with American Morgan Craft picking up silver.
The World Cup continues until 15 August, with 22 Britons competing across rifle and shotgun disciplines.
