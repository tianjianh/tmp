Torbay air show safety road closures 'over the top'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Safety measures introduced for an air show following the Shoreham disaster are "over the top" it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 70 Torbay roads are being closed or restricted to comply with new measures introduced after the disaster that killed 11 people in 2015.
Some residents have said three-day closures are excessive and a money-making ploy by Torbay Council.
The council rejected the claim and said it had to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles.

Hundreds of yellow no parking signs have been put up along Paignton seafront, Preston seafront and surrounding residential areas for Torbay's first three-day air show, which starts on Friday.
Nigel Courtney, of the Preston area, said: "It's great to have an air show, but it is virtually shutting down the town.
"Everywhere is a no parking zone, so how are we meant to go about our daily business?"
Patricia Toft, who lives on one of the streets where parking is being banned, said: "The closures go right along the seafront.
"I don't see why they have to block off so many roads."
Chris Ashington, who runs a health clinic in Torbay, said: "I think the council just wants money for parking in its car parks.
"It is after the money to pay for the show, I'm pretty sure."
Phil Black of Torbay Council said the closures were to maintain unrestricted emergency routes and for access for the park and ride buses.
He said: "The measures are not excessive and most businesses and homes will have access to go about their normal business.
"Following Shoreham, which was a significant incident in terms of air shows, we had to make sure the event was completely safe.
"Audience management is vital to make sure everyone is safe."
