Top scorer Matt Rhead gave Lincoln the lead with a penalty after Jack Muldoon was fouled by keeper Rhys Taylor,
Paul Farman denied James Gray before Wes York equalised with a glancing header from Connor Jennings' cross.
Jennings and Simon Heslop's second half goals secured Wrexham's first win of 2016.
Captain Jennings put the Dragons in front early in the second half after Farman could only parry Dominic Vose's cross.
Man of the match Taylor twice denied Muldoon before Heslop scored his first Wrexham goal with a late 25-yard strike.
Wrexham had lost their previous four league games as well as defeat at Torquay United in the FA Trophy the previous Saturday.
Gary Mills' side are 10th in the table and six points off the play-off places.
Lincoln, who have not won in the National League since a 3-1 victory at Torquay on 21 November, are down to 11th.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "We all needed that and what a difference three points make.
"The lads have gone over that white line to win today. You could see that.
"It's great to get three points and we go into two important away games on the back of a win."
