Two others suffered serious burns and several more migrants were injured in clashes with police at the Moria camp.
Nearly 16,000 migrants have been blocked on Greek islands near Turkey since the EU's March deal with Turkey to curb the migrant influx to Europe.
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he might let that influx resume.
He reacted angrily to a non-binding European Parliament vote on Thursday to freeze Turkey's EU accession negotiations.
"If you go any further, these border gates will be opened. Neither me nor my people will be affected by these empty threats," Mr Erdogan warned.

Migrant camp attacked on Greek island
Since March there has been a dramatic fall in the numbers of migrants making risky journeys in crowded, unstable boats from Turkey to the Greek islands.
Reports say an accident probably caused the blaze which killed the woman and boy in Moria. It is suspected that a gas canister exploded while she was cooking in her tent.
According to Greek police, some migrants then set fire to other parts of the camp and clashes broke out. The fires were later brought under control, but there was extensive damage.
Moria has been afflicted by unrest for months, as migrants endure long waits to have their asylum requests processed.
Under the Turkey deal, failed asylum seekers are supposed to be sent back to Turkey, which is already housing about 2.7 million Syrian refugees.
Last month migrants in Moria set fire to temporary EU offices during a protest.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
