Rochdale 3-3 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jorge Teixeira scored twice, including a late equaliser, as Charlton Athletic shared six goals with Rochdale in a thrilling draw at Spotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side's first goal in five games arrived with just four minutes on the clock.
Donal McDermott's delivery into the six-yard area forced Declan Rudd to catch the cross at an uncomfortably high angle and, with Calvin Andrew looming menacingly, the Addicks goalkeeper spilled the ball, Niall Canavan applying the simplest of finishes from two yards.
Charlton enjoyed a slice of luck which paved the way to their 42nd minute equaliser. Keith Keane slipped as he attempted to head clear of Jordan Botaka, losing his footing just as he was about to connect with the ball and managing only to head it against his opponent.
The loose ball sent Botaka clean through on goal and, although his initial shot struck the post, he converted the chance at the second time of asking.
The visitors took the lead in the 66th minute when Patrick Bauer's header was nodded across the line by Teixeira, but Dale were level within three minutes, Ian Henderson's cross to the back post picking out Andrew's run and there was no stopping him as he powered a header into the net.
Rochdale regained the lead in the 84th minute when Nathaniel Mendez-Laing side-footed a firm finish into the bottom corner but, four minutes later, Teixeira headed his second.
