[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Chakrabarti described her 12 years as Liberty's director as an "enormous privilege", and said she was leaving the group "stronger than ever".
Under her leadership, Liberty, which was founded in 1934, has campaigned on issues such as stop-and-search powers and compulsory ID cards.
The 46-year-old will remain in her role until a successor is appointed.
Liberty said recruitment for her replacement would begin in the coming weeks.
Ms Chakrabarti said: "With members, colleagues, lawyers, journalists and politicians from across the spectrum, we have held three prime ministers and six home secretaries to account.
"Liberty's first president, EM Forster, rightly called defending civil liberties 'the fight that is never done'.
"I leave Liberty secure in the knowledge that we're stronger and more ready for that fight than ever."
Liberty would now be looking for a director who was "ready to defend [human rights] well into the future", she added.
The group's chairman, Frances Butler, said Liberty had "greatly extended its expertise, influence and membership" under Ms Chakrabarti's leadership.
Ms Chakrabarti was born in London and studied law at the London School of Economics.
Between 1996 and 2001, she worked as a lawyer at the Home Office, before joining Liberty as in-house counsel in 2001 and becoming its director two years later.
During her time at the helm, she often appeared on political programmes alongside other public figures to debate topics such as the aborted plans to impose ID cards, surveillance and detention limits.
She was made a CBE in 2007 and was one of six people to have worked with Lord Justice Leveson on his inquiry into press ethics.
