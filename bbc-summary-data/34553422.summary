[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City footballer Yaya Toure has admitted driving at 101mph (163km/h) on a motorway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder was caught speeding in his Porsche on the M6 in Staffordshire on 20 May.
Prosecutors claim he drove at 123mph (198km/h) on the same stretch of the carriageway six minutes later but, in a hearing at Cannock Magistrates' Court, he denied reaching the higher speed.
The 32-year-old will face trial on 3 December at Burton Magistrates' Court.
The Ivory Coast international, who lives in Cheshire, was not required to attend the hearing and submitted his pleas through his solicitor.
However, he is expected to give evidence at the trial.
Separate charges relating to insurance were dropped.
It is understood the speed of Toure's Porsche was subjected to police checks at two different points governed by a 70mph (113km/h) limit on the northbound M6 near Keele services.
