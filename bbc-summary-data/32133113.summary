Rory Trainor: Newry money launderer's sentence suspended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Down businessman, who pleaded guilty almost a year ago to running a multi-million pound money-laundering operation, has been given a suspended sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rory Trainor ran a bureau de change on the Old Dublin Road in Newry.
Last year, he admitted converting the proceeds of crime for several criminal gangs, primarily drug dealers.
In two and a half years' his business handled more than Â£63m.
Much of it, according to HM Customs, was profit made by gangs north and south of the Irish border.
He also used a stolen identity to move money to bank accounts in Bulgaria.
On Tuesday, Newry Crown Court heard that since last year's hearing, he had complied with all the requirements of a serious crime prevention order which was imposed on him.
The judge said separate proceedings next month would try to recover from him "the best part of a million pounds".
He said Trainor's "poor decision-making" which led him into this business had come at a heavy price personally and financially.
