He was turned away for not wearing a jacket, tie and shoes, having arrived in a bright floral shirt and a hat.
His spokesperson said: "Due to a misunderstanding over dress code, he is disappointed to have missed the final."
Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer in four sets to win Sunday's climax.
Prior to the final, Hamilton had posted Wimbledon photos on Instagram, one of which accompanied a message in which he expressed his delight of having been invited to the Royal Box.
A Wimbledon spokesman said: "If he [Hamilton] was not adequately dressed you could infer that he would not have been let in, but we do not comment on our guests.
"If he came without a jacket, tie or shoes he would have had two choices - not staying or going to get some extra stuff."
Stars from TV and film, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Kate Winslet, Bradley Cooper and Hugh Grant were present to watch the showpiece, while former France football international Thierry Henry also took in the action.
