Cornish Pirates coach Alan Paver says he has been impressed with Luke Chapman's commitment after injury.

The 21-year-old prop, who joined the club this summer under their Player Development Foundation scheme made his debut in the weekend win over Ospreys.
"He had a nasty injury early on and he came back and we weren't happy with his fitness and form," Paver said.
"He went to Redruth and I had a few doubts, we had a frank conversation and he's taken the bull by the horns."
The former Launceston player spent the 2014-15 season with Plymouth Albion in the Championship, but did not start a league game during the Devon club's relegation season.
But Paver says Chapman's performance in the British and Irish Cup win on Saturday has raised some eyebrows at the Mennaye.
"I left him out there for 80 minutes, started him at loose-head, pushed him to tight-head, not many can do that but he can do that, and he put his hand up and he's really impressed me," he added.
"The guys will give him a big slap on the back because he's valued within our squad and he's got an opportunity next week to back it up and that will be great for this young man.
"The Championship is not an easy place to play your rugby and the British and Irish Cup is a good place to start from. If he can impress next week who knows."
