Aston Villa have confirmed that captain Ron Vlaar is expected to be out for up to six weeks with a knee injury.

Vlaar, 29, who is out of contract in the summer, limped off 15 minutes into Villa's 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace on New Year's Day.
Villa manager Paul Lambert said the Netherlands international would be out for "four to six weeks".
Lambert also denied newspaper claims that there had been bids for Vlaar and midfielder Fabian Delph.
Vlaar, who has featured in 12 of Villa's 20 Premier League games this season after also suffering a calf injury, had been linked with a Â£1.5m move to Manchester United in the January transfer window, with Arsenal and Liverpool also reportedly interested in the defender.
In November, Lambert insisted the club had begun negotiations to extend Vlaar's contract but that "the message from his agent was thanks but no thanks".
