Swansea's population 'too small' for tram system

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tram or monorail-style system in Swansea could be unsustainable because the city is not big enough, a transport expert has warned.

Prof Stuart Cole has looked into the feasibility for such a scheme aimed at reducing the amount of cars in the city centre but favours a bus option.
He found the 242,000 population is too low to sustain a tram network unless they were heavily subsidised.
Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said he had not yet reviewed the report.
"Swansea could become as successful in reducing car use through bus priority schemes on a similar scale to Bristol where Â£44m has been spent over several years," said Prof Cole, Professor of Transport at the University of South Wales.
"While I would love to have a tram system in Swansea, what there isn't is enough people.
"It would cost hundreds of millions of pounds but how much money is available and how is it going to be paid?
"Is it going to be funded by government grant and subsidised or is it going to be funded by the public?"
The number of people entering the city could be boosted by the Swansea Bay City Region deal which is due to be signed imminently with the aim of creating thousands of new jobs over a number of years.
Swansea council is already trying to cope with a long-standing congestion problems at peak times, especially on the main gateways into the city.
It is understood a tram or monorail-style system is an idea favoured by those in authority.
Prof Cole carried out a recently-published report for the Welsh Government about "the clear, urgent and well-evidenced need to introduce smart interconnected transport arrangements".
He said a new transport system, based on models in Dublin and the Netherlands, could help serve to bring people into the city centre to work from park and ride hubs on Swansea's outskirts.
It could also carry tourists to areas such as Mumbles and sports fans to the Liberty Stadium.
Prof Cole has also suggested local transport hubs to improve cross-region routes including nearby towns Gorseinon, Pontarddulais, Neath, Llanelli, Ammanford and Port Talbot.
"Swansea has three entrances and you've got towns with big centres around it," he added.
"Swansea doesn't have the same characteristics like the centre of Cardiff which are big pulls for passenger movement on a daily basis.
"My report of buses was relatively cheap and doable in the short term."
