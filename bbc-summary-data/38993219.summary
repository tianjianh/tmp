Delays expected as Bailleston Interchange work on M8 begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work to complete the "missing link" on the M8 in North Lanarkshire has begun with drivers warned to expect significant delays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work, which began at 20:00, is taking place on the M8/A8 approach to the Bailleston Interchange and will last 10 weeks.
Delays are expected on the M8 corridor, the M73 and on local roads near the interchange.
The work is part of the wider M8/M73/M74 improvements project.
Transport Scotland said the major diversion of the A8/M8 was needed to remove 13,000m² of existing carriageway and 40,000m³ of earth to connect the new M8 to the existing M8, which is about 5m higher.
Also, 12,000 tonnes of blacktop will then be laid to complete the "missing link", a seven-mile stretch of A-road that lies in the middle of the M8 motorway from Glasgow to Edinburgh.
When the work is complete, the new M8 between Junction 8 Baillieston interchange and Eurocentral will be opened to traffic.
Transport Scotland warned drivers to avoid the Baillieston interchange, which lies about eight miles east of Glasgow city centre.
The transport body said access to all routes would be maintained via the newly-aligned A8.
However, significant disruption was expected on the approach to Junction 8 Baillieston interchange from the M8/A8 east and westbound and the M73 north and southbound.
It said the following local roads would also be affected:
About £500m is being spent on upgrading the roadwork in the central belt and the link between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
It has been predicted that journey times along the route could be cut by 20 minutes during peak times.
