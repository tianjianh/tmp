Leicester City winger Riyad Mahrez says he does not "want to think" about relegation after the champions lost a sixth top-flight game this season.

The Foxes were beaten 2-1 at Watford on Saturday and are in 14th place in the Premier League - two points above the bottom three.
"Nothing is wrong. We need to keep working hard like we do and I am sure we will get the wins," said Mahrez.
"I know we have good quality to stay in the Premier League and maybe more."
In contrast to their league form, Leicester are on the verge of qualifying for the last 16 knockout stages of the Champions League, in their debut season in the competition.
They have three wins and a draw from their opening four group games, having not yet conceded a goal, and play Club Brugge on Tuesday.
"Maybe there is a bit of frustration in the Premier League. It is the frustration not about that we are not playing good but about losing," added Mahrez.
"I am confident, we have a good team and squad and I know we can react.
"Last season was last season, we were champions. But champions or not, this is another season.
"Others teams are more hungry, and every team wants to beat Leicester. We just have to keep going and I know we will win games."
Mahrez is on the 23-man shortlist for the Best Fifa Men's Player 2016 award but played down any chances of success.
"There are bigger players than me. I'm just happy to be in the list," he said.
