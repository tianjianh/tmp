The event, which started on Wednesday and wraps up later on Thursday, involves workshops, talks, film screenings and music performances.
Musical acts include The Voice South Africa's Lana Crowster, Kenyan pop star Silas Miami and Isle of Barra musician Claire-Frances MacNeil.
This year's XpoNorth has attracted more than 2,500 delegates and is to feature more than 120 speakers.
Pop stars Crowster and Silas feature on the soundtrack of Sidney and Friends, a new documentary exploring the hopes, dreams and reality of Kenya's intersex and transgender community.
The film, made by Tristan Aitchison from the Black Isle, received a special screening at XpoNorth on Thursday ahead of its international festival release.
