Landlord admits modern slavery charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A landlord who forced a tenant into full-time work and kept his wages to fund a "lavish lifestyle" has admitted slavery charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sajmon Brzezinski, 43, brought the man from Poland to Nottingham in 2011.
He forced him in to work, giving him just £20 to £30 per week of his £480, police said.
Brzezinski, who owned multiple cars and properties, admitted one charge of human trafficking and two of forced labour at Nottingham Crown Court.

He also owned a home in his native Poland which police described as a "palace" with 50 windows.
Brzezinski, of Overdale Road, Old Basford, met the man at a building site in Poland, and offered him travel to the UK for £60 so he could find work.
When he arrived, police said, his passport was taken from him and he was told he owed £2,000.
Brzezinski set up bank accounts for the 38-year-old, into which his wages were paid, but kept his bank card so he was unable to access the money.
Eventually, the worker confided in a colleague at a Christmas party, which led to Brzezinski's arrest.
Jon Hammond employed the worker on a farm near Arnold, Nottingham, from 2013 and said it was "shocking" to find out he was being exploited.
"You can't see it. It is happening under your nose and when it pops up, when you finally find it, it is embarrassing, it is abhorrent. It made me hugely angry," he said.
"To us, there was nothing wrong. It is quite frightening that this stuff is happening."
The Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) began an investigation with Nottinghamshire Police after Mr Hammond's company contacted them.
Ian Waterfield, the GLAA's head of operations, said Brzezinski controlled the man's work in the UK through threats of violence.
Brzezinski also admitted a charge of fraud against another victim and is due to be sentenced on 15 June.
