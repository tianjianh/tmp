Daniel Brosinski put Mainz ahead again with a penalty, but Thiago equalised after being picked out by Robben.
Borussia Dortmund beat Borussia Monchengladbach 3-2 to move up to third in the table.
Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead with a penalty but Lars Stindl and Marcel Schmelzer's own goal put Gladbach ahead.
Substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised, before Raphael Guerreiro's 87th-minute winner.
Elsewhere, Max Kruse scored four goals as Werder Bremen came from behind to beat second-from-bottom Ingolstadt 4-2.
Augsburg remain in the relegation play-off place after blowing a 1-0 lead with 12 minutes to go to lose 3-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt.
Bottom club Darmstadt's relegation will not be confirmed for another week at least after they beat Hamburg 2-1, their second win in a row.
Wolfsburg are only one point above the play-off place after losing 1-0 to Hertha Berlin.
