Corfu gas deaths of Horbury children 'a tragedy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has told an inquest the deaths of two children on holiday in Corfu was "a most appalling tragedy".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert and Christianne Shepherd, aged six and seven, of Horbury, West Yorkshire, died from carbon monoxide poisoning in October 2006.
Coroner David Hinchliff said the children died on "what should have been a happy half-term break".
Their father Neil and his partner, now wife, Ruth were found in a coma at the holiday bungalow.
In May, the family were awarded legal aid for the inquest after their initial application was rejected.
Mr and Mrs Shepherd were both at Wakefield Coroners' Court earlier to see the jury sworn in.
The children's mother, Sharon Wood, was also in court.
The jury of seven men and four women were told the children had complained of feeling unwell in the bungalow the day before they were found dead by a maid.
Mr Hinchliff said: "The family of these children have waited a long, long time for this day to come."
