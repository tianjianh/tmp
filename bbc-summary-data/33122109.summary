They have used aerial equipment to tackle the blaze at Urban Forest Ltd in the Carnbane industrial estate.
The company recycles discarded wood into bedding material for animals.
Firefighters were alerted to the fire just after 06:30 BST on Saturday.  Six fire appliances and two aerial appliances were deployed to the scene.
Group Commander Edward Carroll said fire crews were "confronted with a well-developed fire" when they arrived at the plant on Derryboy Road.
"In the early stages there was a considerable risk of the fire spreading but due to the prompt actions of the crews we were able to contain the fire to the building of origin," Mr Carroll said.
Newry and Armagh MP Mickey Brady described the incident as a "major fire".
In a tweet, the Sinn FÃ©in MP thanked fire crews, saying their "prompt and professional action" had ensured the containment of the blaze.
