Southport 2-0 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport clinched their first National League win since September by beating York 2-0 at Haig Avenue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides traded chances in the first half, but the game sprung into action two minutes after the break with Jamie Allen giving Southport the lead from the penalty spot.
Moments later it was almost two, but substitute goalkeeper Scott Flinders denied Andrai Jones from point-blank range.
Flinders was in fine form, saving again from Jones and Allen, but he could do nothing to stop the latter wrapping up the points in stoppage time with a well-timed finish.
