[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England batsman Jonny Bairstow hit an unbeaten century as Yorkshire began the defence of their Division One title with a strong start against Hampshire.

He shared a 205-run fourth-wicket partnership with Adam Lyth, who made 111 before falling lbw to Sean Ervine.
The hosts had been 41-3 after Alex Lees and Gary Ballance fell cheaply and captain Andrew Gale was caught behind for a duck off Ryan McLaren.
Bad light stopped play with Yorkshire 270-5 and Bairstow unbeaten on 107.
Hampshire toppled Yorkshire's top-order with some good length bowling as Lees was caught at third slip by James Vince off James Tomlinson before Chris Wood had England hopeful Ballance caught behind.
However, Lyth and Bairstow steadied the ship and piled on the runs for the home side before the former fell just after tea to give Zimbabwean Ervine a wicket in the 200th first-class match of his career.
After remaining in the nervous 90s for 31 balls, Bairstow dispatched Fidel Edwards for successive boundaries to reach his ton off 166 balls, having hit 13 fours and a six.
Adil Rashid joined the 26-year-old wicketkeeper at the crease for Yorkshire, after Jack Leaning was caught behind for Wood's second wicket of the innings just before the end of play.
Meanwhile, Hampshire have been deducted a point for a slow over rate against Warwickshire during the opening week of the County Championship.
