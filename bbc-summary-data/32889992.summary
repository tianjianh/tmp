A former soldier who spent a week living on a life raft as a charity challenge, said it was "a lot harder than I could have imagined".

Wayne Ingram, 45, of Weymouth, lost 8kg (17lb) during seven days and nights in the raft in Portland Harbour for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.
The effect on his body and mind is being reviewed by experts from Portsmouth University.
He has raised more than Â£5,000 for the London hospital.
Mr Ingram said he was "struggling big time" since returning to dry land on Monday.
"I've been really tired and not wanting to do anything. I never realised that it was going to be the hardest thing I've done in my life."
The former staff sergeant, who suffers from seasickness, stayed in the 1.2 cubic metre raft with one day's food and a daily allowance of 500ml of water.
He managed to catch a few fish to eat and used the raft to catch couple of mouthfuls of rainwater which he described as "absolutely fantastic".
"If I could struggle through for seven days, it's nothing compared to what those children in hospital go though," he said.
Changes in his physical and mental health during his time on the raft were tracked by Portsmouth University's Department of Sport and Exercise Science.
Money raised will go to the hospital's patient and family support accommodation.
