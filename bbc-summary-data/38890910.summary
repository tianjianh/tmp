The Wales under-20 wing scored a spectacular try for his country in their Six Nations victory over Italy.
The 18-year old will graduate from the Scarlets academy this summer, having already featured in the Anglo-Welsh Cup against Bath and for Llanelli RFC.
"Having grown up in west Wales playing for the Scarlets is something that I've always aspired to," he said. "Hopefully I'll have more opportunities."
