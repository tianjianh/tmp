[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Veteran goalkeeper Stephen Bywater has signed a new one-year deal at Championship side Burton Albion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old former West Ham and Derby man was approaching the end of his contract at the club.
Bywater, whose previous clubs include Millwall and Sheffield Wednesday, has not played for the Brewers since signing on a free transfer from Doncaster in January.
But he will continue to act as cover for first-choice keeper Jon McLaughlin.
"It's great news that Stephen is staying," Burton manager Nigel Clough told the club website.
"He works very well with Jon McLaughlin, providing us with experienced cover, and has been a very positive presence around the club since joining."
