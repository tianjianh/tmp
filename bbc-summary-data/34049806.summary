[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria have taken part in strike action.

About 400 health physics monitors, who carry out manual radiation checks on staff and equipment, staged their second stoppage in a month.
The GMB union claims management have reneged on a pay rise deal.
A spokesman for Sellafield said the action, which began at 08:30 BST and ended at 12:30, did not impact on the site's operations.
The union has said a further 48-hour stoppage is planned to start on Wednesday.
The dispute centres on the re-grading of some monitors and what they are paid.
The company said staff had recently been awarded a 2.5% pay rise and, while the principle of a further increase was "not in contention", it did not think there should be a "blanket" rise.
Sellafield employs about 10,000 people and reprocesses and stores spent nuclear fuel from around the world.
