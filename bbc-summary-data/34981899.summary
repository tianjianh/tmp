The driver of the Jaguar, a man in his 60s also from the Luton area, is still being treated for his injuries in hospital.
The cars were travelling in the opposite directions when they collided.
Police have appealed for witnesses, saying they're particularly keen to speak to the driver of a vehicle that was travelling in front of the Corsa before the crash.
