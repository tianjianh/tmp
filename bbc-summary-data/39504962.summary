A Â£282m relief road at junction 6, by the National Exhibition Centre, could be the end for Pairc na hEireann, home to Warwickshire Gaelic Athletic Association.
The site was built up with money raised by the Irish community which bought the land in the 1950s.
Treasurer Martin Grogan said Highways England was "taking memories away".
Mr Morgan, who has also played at the club during his 30-year association, said: "This is home to Gaelic sport in Britain. Full stop.

"There's no other complex as big as this outside Ireland. It's prime location and we're not going to move from here."

Option one:
Option two:

Highways England said the junction has almost reached capacity and the upgrade is needed to ease the severe congestion and prepare for the arrival of a new HS2 station, which will also see traffic grow.
A spokesman said it was considering responses to a public consultation and decision had been made yet.
"We are in touch with the club and will keep them fully informed.
"As with all of our schemes, we would do everything we can to minimise its impact on the environment, local communities, local businesses, road users and residents."
