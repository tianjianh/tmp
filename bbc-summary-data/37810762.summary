Apology after A55 Conwy tunnel speed camera blunder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Speed camera bosses have apologised to drivers after a blunder meant prosecutions were issued by mistake.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Motorists had been accused of speeding on the A55 through the Conwy tunnel.
But overnight roadworks had finished on 21 October and the 40mph (64km/h) limit on speed cameras had not been altered.
Road safety organisation GoSafe said "regrettably the speed cameras were not deactivated and speed data was still processed by the average speed cameras for several hours afterwards".
This resulted in notices of intended prosecutions being sent out to an unknown number of people.
Police will send out a second letter to affected drivers, explaining the mistake.
