Kingston Crown Court heard Runa Khan, 34, of Maple Road West, Luton, sent messages about the route from Turkey to Syria to an undercover police officer.
She pleaded guilty to four charges of disseminating terrorist publications between July and September 2013.
She is due to be sentenced on 9 September.
The court heard the mother of six posted a picture on Facebook of a suicide vest with the words "sacrifice your life to be in Islam" in July last year.
The court was told that in September she posted: "Sisters, if you love your sons, husbands and brothers, prove it by sending them to fight for Allah.
"Don't you want them to enter Jannah. Don't you want them to prepare for you a palace in Jannah."
The next day she posted: "Sisters' role in jihad off the battlefield", the court heard.
The hearing was also told that on 13 September Khan sent messages to an undercover officer describing a path into war-torn Syria and the name of a group in the country to join.
It heard she received details of the route from Mohammed Nahin Ahmed, who has admitted spending eight months in Syria fighting alongside an al Qaeda-linked terrorist group.
Ahmed and childhood friend Yusuf Zubair Sarwar, both 22, from Birmingham, went to the country last May after contacting Islamic extremists.
They each pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court to one count of engaging in preparation of terrorism acts, earlier this month.
Prosecutor Christopher Hehir said Khan had previously been of good character, but last week accepted a police caution for common assault.
She was granted bail with conditions including not to use Facebook "in any shape or form".
