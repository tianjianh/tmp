Myles Weston: Wycombe Wanderers sign former Southend United winger

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers have signed winger Myles Weston on a two-year deal after his release by Southend United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old Antigua and Barbuda international helped Southend win promotion to League One in 2015, but has started once since November 2015.
Much of his absence has been because of plantar fasciitis, an injury affecting the heel and foot.
Weston has made more than 300 league appearances for clubs including Notts County, Brentford and Gillingham.
