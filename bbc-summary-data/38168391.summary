Strike begins over Glasgow City Council 'IT privatisation' fears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dozens of specialist IT staff who serve Scotland's largest council have begun three weeks of strike action over fears the service may be privatised.

Up to 40 staff at Access, an arms-length Glasgow City Council body, are taking action from 1-22 December.
It comes as the council considers whether to award the contract for its IT services to CGI Group.
The council said any deal would depend on the Canadian firm protecting staff terms and conditions for seven years.
In a message sent to staff about the dispute, council chief executive Annemarie O'Donnell said the union, Unison, was "targeting 40 staff who hold key posts in critical areas".
"They work in highly technical fields that support the council's business critical applications," she said.
"Because of the specialist roles they perform, there is very limited ability to move other members of staff to cover for them.
"We are exploring additional measures that could be put in place, but if these critically important systems and applications start to experience difficulties the impact will be significant."
Ms O'Donnell said that the union's grounds for the strike action were to protect terms and conditions, including pensions, to have no compulsory redundancies and no compulsory relocation from Glasgow.
She added: "The council has confirmed these are essential factors in any new contract and will be provided for the full seven-year term of the contract. No contract will be entered into without these protections.
"Given the severe financial situation facing local government, this assurance is unprecedented anywhere in the country.
"However, despite this guarantee, Unison has chosen to continue to strike and cause severe disruption to the people of Glasgow."
CGI Group signed a Â£92m deal with Scottish Borders Council in March to take over its digital services for 13 years.
The firm signed a similar deal with Edinburgh City Council, worth Â£186m over seven years, in August.
Glasgow is now considering a similar deal, potentially worth hundreds of millions of pounds, for CGI to provide IT services for areas such as payroll, schools and social work.
Any deal could potentially see hundreds of staff employed at Access transferred to CGI.
Unison officials, however, believe that this amounts to privatisation of the service and are concerned for their members.
The union has warned that the dispute could become long-running and says that if a settlement is not reached, strike action will resume after Christmas.
