The Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) sees it join foods such as Arbroath smokies and Stornoway black pudding in the assurance that consumers are buying a genuine product.
The company said it was "delighted".
Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "It's superb news that Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar now holds this protected status."
General manager Tim Deakin said Orkney Cheddar was produced with locally-sourced milk, and using a traditional recipe and process.
He said the techniques of those who created the cheese in 1946 had been passed down through the generations.
"The accreditation communicates to our consumers the uniqueness and heritage of Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar, which differs from other traditional cheddars," he said.
The Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, said: "Orkney's cheese making industry has a long history and is regarded as a symbol of excellence.  This news provides valuable protection for one of the island's most loved products."
