A convicted robber has gone on the run from an open prison that was at the centre of a recent high-profile fugitive case.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam White left HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent on Sunday.
Kent Police, who were called to the Category D prison just before 14:00 BST, said the 23-year-old should not be approached by members of the public.
Armed robber Michael Wheatley absconded from the same jail in May and went on to raid a building society in Surrey.
His case sparked a political row over the day release of dangerous inmates amid criticism that arrangements were too lax.
Wheatley, 55, dubbed the "Skull Cracker" for pistol-whipping bystanders, was later caught and sentenced at Guildford Crown Court to life behind bars and told he would serve at least 10 years before being eligible for parole.
Police said White was wearing a dark green poncho-style coat and carrying a black shoulder bag when he absconded.
