Clashes erupted in the capital, Kinshasa, and the eastern city of Goma, where a policewoman and a protester were killed, the UN says.
President Joseph Kabila is constitutionally bound to step down in December, the end of his second term.
But opponents are concerned that he will not relinquish power.
A presidential election is due in November, but this could be delayed.
Earlier this month the Constitutional Court ruled that the president could stay in power if no election took place.
The BBC's Maud Jullien says that some says this is part of a ploy to allow Mr Kabila to extend his presidency.
Oppositions groups had called for the protests after the Constitutional Court's ruling.
