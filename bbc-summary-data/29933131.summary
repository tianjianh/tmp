Man City: Vincent Kompany still believes in Blues' Euro potential

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vincent Kompany says he still believes Manchester City can succeed in Europe - despite the club being in danger of another early Champions League exit.

City are bottom of Group E after a 2-1 home defeat by CSKA Moscow.
But captain Kompany insists the side, who had two players sent off against CSKA on Wednesday, is still learning.
"Everyone will jump on the bandwagon," he said. "I go the other way. I believe in my team. I back everyone at this club 100% to turn it around."
Now in their fourth Champions League campaign, City have twice failed to make it out of their group and have never gone beyond the last 16.
That form contrasts sharply with their domestic achievements, with two Premier League titles and the League Cup won in the same period.
"Let's put things into perspective," said Kompany. "We are not a club who has been there for 20 years and you don't just go from never playing in the Champions League to winning it.
"We are trying to put milestones down every year and so far we have been quite successful."
The second-half dismissals of Fernandinho and Yaya Toure compounded a miserable night at the Etihad Stadium. And the fact that Greek referee Tasos Sidiropolous booked the wrong man when he should have sent off CSKA's Pontus Wernbloom added to Kompany's frustrations.
"Getting the wrong man is laughable," he said. "I do believe a bit in karma so we are being unlucky now [and] at some point in the season it has to go our way."
