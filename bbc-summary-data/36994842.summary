Fleetwood Town 2-2 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kevin van Veen's stunning strike kept up Scunthorpe's unbeaten run, which stretches back to April, as they secured a 2-2 draw at Fleetwood Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lincolnshire club had lost just one previous fixture under former Fleetwood boss Graham Alexander but found themselves in unfamiliar territory eight minutes before the break, when Eggert Jonsson headed home at the back post.
David Ball doubled Fleetwood's advantage but Scunthorpe's comeback started with Tom Hopper on 63 minutes and ended with Van Veen's effort moments later.
Jordan Clarke's foul on Bobby Grant handed Fleetwood the chance to open the scoring as Jonsson applied a powerful header at the back post to hand Uwe Rosler's men a hard-fought half-time lead.
And it did not take long for Fleetwood to double their advantage via a fine solo-effort from Ball, who showed quick feet to find shooting room 25 yards out and drive the ball low past Luke Daniels.
Van Veen came close to pulling one back when his 25-yard drive was tipped over by Chris Neal.
But from the resulting corner the visitors did score as Jordan Clarke's effort was cleared off the line before substitute Hopper bundled the ball in at the second time of asking.
It was the break Scunthorpe needed, with the equaliser coming just minutes later in spectacular fashion from Van Veen's 30-yard curling shot, which left keeper Neal as a spectator.
Both sides had chances to win it in a frantic final 20-minute scrap. Jonsson came closest for Fleetwood with another bullet header beaten off the line while Hopper won a goalmouth scramble at the other end only to nod into Neal's arms.
