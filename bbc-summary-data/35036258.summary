Water levels are receding from most parts of Tamil Nadu state, where at least 280 people are now known to have died in floods since last month.
Garbage and sludge have collected on the streets and sewage has entered homes, damaging properties.
The rains, the heaviest in 100 years, are being blamed on climate change.
BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi in Chennai says people have begun cleaning up their houses, offices, shops and showrooms, all of which had been submerged.
"Floodwaters damaged three TV sets, two refrigerators, washing machine, beds and a sofa in our three-bedroom house," Shobana, a resident, said.
"Worse, we lost all our important papers that were kept in our almirah [cupboard]."
Soldiers and emergency workers are now rushing food, clean drinking water and medical supplies to flood-hit residents, reports say.
