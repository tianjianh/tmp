County Championship: Record for Ervine and Adams as Hampshire make Bears suffer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Ervine and Jimmy Adams set a new county fourth-wicket partnership record of 367 as Hampshire were finally bowled out for 515 against Warwickshire.

Resuming on 294-3, the pair added a further 104 before both became victims for Bears spinner Sunny Singh.
Adams, 104 overnight, went for 166, while Ervine followed for 203, his second double century, having added 43.
Singh took 6-144 in only his second Championship game before the Bears then buckled in reply, closing on 49-6.
After the needless run-out of opener Ian Westwood by Michael Carberry, spinner Mason Crane and debutant paceman Matt Salisbury both claimed two wickets, while fellow debutant Ian Holland also claimed his first scalp.
Missing the absent Jonathan Trott, only Rikki Clarke (20) and opener Andy Umeed (14) made double figures.
With Jeetan Patel frustratingly away on drinks waiter duty for New Zealand in the Champions Trophy, Singh's maiden first-class 'five-for', in only his third match, was the Bears' only bright spot.
After a third successive wicket-less session for the Bears, it was just after lunch when he got his first wicket, when Adams attempted to flick him over mid-wicket and offered a simple catch.
Within three overs, Ervine had brought up his double century, his best score for Hampshire in seven summers, before Singh then bowled him attempting to reverse paddle.
Singh then took wickets at regular intervals as Hampshire batted through before the hosts then did untold damage in the 30 overs they had at the wobbling Bears in the day's final session.
Hampshire's record-breaking 367-run stand, the highest partnership in all Championship cricket this season, comfortably broke Adams' own existing Hampshire fourth-wicket record, 278, set in partnership with James Vince against Yorkshire, at Scarborough, in 2010.
Hampshire double centurion Sean Ervine told BBC Solent:
"I am more pleased with the partnership after being 31-3. Myself and Jimmy had to dig in. To then top it off, the boys came out and performed with the ball.
"It took a special piece of fielder from Carbs to get the ball rolling, then the two debutants were magical and Mason towards the end got some purchases.
"We could hear on the tannoy all the milestones we got to. It wasn't easy to bat out there.
"There was a little bit of invariable bounce and a couple kept low. As the ball got older and soft it was harder to pierce the field."
Warwickshire captain Ian Bell told BBC WM:
"Jonathan Trott has had a family emergency today. Nothing we can control. Everything seems to be happening to us at one time but he will be back tomorrow.
"It has been a tough day and a tough season for us in red-ball cricket. We shouldn't have let them get 500 but we also shouldn't be six down for 50.
"We have shown glimpses of some fight in previous Championship matches but this was again massively disappointing and not up to standard.
"Momentum in this sort of cricket is huge. Westy has been batting well for us so his run out was disappointing and gave them a little more momentum. But we have to believe that this is savable."
