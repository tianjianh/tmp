[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pocklington £3m flood defence scheme consultation starts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A consultation has begun on plans for a new £3m defence scheme to protect an East Yorkshire town from flooding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Homes and businesses in Pocklington were flooded in April 2012 after heavy rain caused a beck to burst its banks.
A reservoir to store river water upstream of the town would "greatly reduce the risk" of potential future flooding, the local authority has said.
The proposals are yet to be submitted but if approved, work could start in the spring of 2017.
Drawings of the initiative are going on display at Burnby Hall.
