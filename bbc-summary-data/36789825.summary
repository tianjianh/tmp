County Championship: Adam Lyth scores 202 in Yorkshire's draw with Surrey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adam Lyth scored the fourth double century of his career as champions Yorkshire drew with Surrey at The Oval.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old left-hander resumed on 116 not out on day four and reached 200 with a six off Stuart Meaker, before being caught behind next ball for 202.
His 291-ball knock helped Yorkshire to maximum batting bonus points and 407 all out, a first-innings lead of 140.
Surrey got to 106-1 in their second innings, opener Dominic Sibley making 54 not out, before a draw was agreed.
Lyth and Steve Patterson (51) pushed Yorkshire ahead with a fourth-wicket stand of 91, while Liam Plunkett's 37 off only 20 balls accelerated the score as the visitors went in search of 400 within the 110-over cut-off for bonus points.
However, their bowlers were left with little time to push for victory because of the amount of time lost to bad weather on the first two days.
Eight bowlers were used in Surrey's second innings, including wicketkeeper Andy Hodd for a solitary over, as the game petered towards a stalemate.
Surrey are off the bottom of Division One thanks to their 10 points, while Yorkshire's 13 points were enough for them to climb one place to fourth, above Durham.
