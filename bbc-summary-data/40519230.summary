The BBC's Frank Kandu in Malawi said gates at the 40,000-capacity stadium were supposed to open at 06:30 local time (04:30GMT) to allow free entry of people - but there was a delay of about three hours.
However, thousands had already turned up, and some tried to force their way in, prompting the police to fire tear gas.
Inspector General of Police Lexan Kachama told Reuters news agency he expected the number of casualties to rise.
The football match was being held as part of events to mark the 53rd anniversary of Malawi's independence from British colonial rule.
When the match did go ahead, Nyasa Big Bullets won 2-1.
