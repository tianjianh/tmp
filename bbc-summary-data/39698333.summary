The 26-year-old stopped Alexandra Vlajk to win the WBC international bantamweight title in Ebbw Vale.
Brace could now fight on the Barry McGuigan bill in Cardiff on 26 May when Welshman Craig Kennedy and England's Matty Askin for the Commonwealth title.
"We're just waiting for confirmation but I think we're looking at the European title," she said.
"It's down to my managers really and trusting them to make the matches."
However, Brace says any fight with double Olympic champion Nicola Adams is some way off.
But she added: "I'd love to fight Nicola Adams. It would be an honour to share the ring with her."
Brace admitted she was troubled by nerves in the build-up to her meeting with Vlajk, but felt in control from early in the fight.
"I knew I had too much strength for her, I was beating her to the jab and in the fourth round I nearly stopped her," added Brace.
"But she was very crafty, you could tell she's had some really good fights and she's been in world title fights before. Fair play she was a tough girl and she lasted until the ninth."
