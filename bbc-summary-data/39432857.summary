The inquests into the deaths of two teenagers found at the bottom of cliffs have been opened and adjourned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Yeoman and Harry Watson, both 17, were found dead at Huntcliff in Saltburn on Friday evening.
No family members were present at the hearings at Middlesbrough Town Hall.
Teesside assistant coroner Jo Wharton told the inquests Mr Watson was a student living in Liverton Mines and Mr Yeoman was an apprentice joiner who lived in Loftus.
Their bodies were identified by their parents, she said.
The inquests will resume after more evidence concerning the teenagers' deaths is collected.
Cleveland Police are continuing to investigate what happened but said they were not treating it as suspicious.
On Tuesday, Mr Yeoman's step-sister Pauline Walker said friends and family were "completely lost".
"No-one knows what's actually gone on and why they were up there or anything and it really is a big hole in everyone's heart."
