Poppi Worthington death: CPS review confirms no charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has upheld a decision not to bring charges over the death of Poppi Worthington.

The 13-month-old was found with serious injuries at her home in Barrow, Cumbria, in December 2012.
A family judge later ruled she had been sexually assaulted by her father, Paul Worthington. He denies any wrongdoing.
In September the CPS said it would be carrying out a fresh review of the case, and it has now announced that the decision not to charge was correct.
A second inquest will be held on a date yet to be confirmed after the first, in October 2014, lasted just seven minutes and concluded Poppi's cause of death was "unascertained".
Key dates in the Poppi Worthington case.
A CPS spokesperson said: "Following a review of the original charging decision in this case, the CPS announced that there was not a realistic prospect of conviction in July 2016.
"The CPS subsequently received an application under the Victims' Right to Review Scheme in September.
"In accordance with the scheme, a CPS lawyer with no prior involvement in the case has completed a full review of the evidence and has concluded that the decision not to charge was correct."
Fiona McGhie, the lawyer representing Poppi's mother - who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: "Poppi's mother is understandably both distressed and disappointed by the CPS's decision not to bring a prosecution regarding her death.
"She has always been anxious to know exactly what happened to Poppi on the day of her death as well as to secure justice for her little girl.
"She hopes that an inquest, which was delayed while the CPS examined its decision, will shed some light on Poppi's injuries and create a path to justice so her daughter can finally be at peace."
