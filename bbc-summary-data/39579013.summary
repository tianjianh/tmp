[SN]TITLE[SN]
British Rwanda 'plot' woman Violette Uwamahoro back in UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pregnant British woman from Leeds who was arrested in Rwanda on suspicion of plotting to undermine President Paul Kagame is back in the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Violette Uwamahoro was granted bail last month by a court which ruled that her detention over charges of spreading state secrets was not warranted.
Her arrest while in Rwanda for a family funeral caused an uproar, with rights groups calling for her release.
Her family wanted the UK to intervene, saying she faced an "unfair" trial.
It is unclear whether her return to Britain was facilitated by the British.
A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said last month that consular staff in Kigali were in touch with local authorities over Mrs Uwamahoro's detention.
On 27 March, the Leeds youth worker appeared in court in Rwanda's capital Kigali, where her lawyers argued for her release.
The judge decided there was no evidence which suggested the expectant mother should remain in detention, ordering her release on bail.
Mrs Uwamahoro's husband Faustin Rukundo, who lives in exile in the UK, was adamant she was being victimised for his role as an opposition activist.
