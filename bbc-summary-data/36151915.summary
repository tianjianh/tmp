The number of reports of suspected brothels in Swindon has nearly doubled in a year, the BBC has learnt.

Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that in 2014 Wiltshire Police received 60 reports, however this rose to 112 in 2015.
The force said the rise is partly due to increased public awareness, and the internet "assisted this type of crime".
Officers also found many of the women arrested are being trafficked from Poland and Romania.
Detective sergeant Chris Hitchcock said: "We are seeing an increase in the girls brought across. The Eastern European crime groups are involved.
"Not every girl that we come across has been trafficked, but they are largely vulnerable.
"The girls are often subject to assault and put in financial debt as well. With that comes quite a degree of control over them."
Wiltshire Police said tackling the issue of "pop-up brothels" is a priority for the force.
