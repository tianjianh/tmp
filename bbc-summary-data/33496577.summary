The Prime Minister said she had been Mr Clarke's "rock" in his long political career, which saw him rise to be Chancellor of the Exchequer.
She died on Thursday aged 74 and had been battling cancer.
The couple, who have two children, met while they were students at Cambridge University and married in 1964.
The prime minister and his wife Samantha sent their condolences to the Clarke family, and described her death as "incredibly sad news".
Mr Cameron added: "I know that Gillian was Ken's rock, supporting him through his many years of frontline politics.
"They were always there for each other through thick and thin, so it is with enormous sadness that we think of Ken and his family today.
"We're holding them all in our thoughts and prayers."
Fellow Tory MPs also described Mrs Clarke - who lived in Nottinghamshire, in her husband's Rushcliffe constituency - as "brilliant" and "wonderful".
Tory MP Robert Jenrick, who represents Newark in Nottinghamshire, said: "All our thoughts in Nottinghamshire are with Ken Clarke and his family following the death of the brilliant and much-loved Gillian."
Solicitor General Robert Buckland, the MP for Swindon South, said: "Very sad to hear about the death of the wonderful Gillian Clarke - my thoughts are with Ken and his family."
The daughter of two teachers, from Sidcup, Kent, the then Gillian Edwards gained a first in history at Newnham College from the University of Cambridge.
