"Nodular sclerosing is the most common of all types of Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK. Nearly six out of 10 of all diagnosed cases are this type and it is the most common type in young adults. It is usually found at an early stage when lymph glands in the neck become enlarged."

The 28-year-old overcame nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma in 2014, while at Tranmere, after a six-month course of chemotherapy.
He returned to Rochdale, where he began his career in their youth system, from Carlisle at the start of the season.
"I will fight this life hurdle with the same belief, courage and desire as my previous battle," said Thompson.
"The support shown to me since I discovered my illness has returned has been immense.
"I came back from a goal down before, not only to equalise, but to take the lead. This illness may have found an equaliser, but the quest for me to get the winner starts today and I can assure you I will get the most important win of all time."

Rochdale-born Thompson made over 100 appearances for his hometown club at the start of his career, and has also had spells at Bury and Southport.
"We will support Joe through this difficult time and will be with him every step of the way," added chairman Chris Dunphy.
"He has the full support of everyone at the club and we will do everything we can to help him beat this horrible disease for a second time."
