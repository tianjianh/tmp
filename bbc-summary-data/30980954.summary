Greek elections: What austerity, deficit and troika mean

The bars, clubs and water parks aren't bad either.
But the country's been making the headlines for a different reason.
It's just elected a new party into government and after years of fighting a financial crisis, it's promising big change putting it on a possible collision course with the EU.
The far-left Syriza party has formed an anti-austerity governing coalition with the right-wing party, Greek Independents.
Here's our jargon-busting guide to some of the words and phrases being used to cover the Greek election story.
As you'll know if you've booked a holiday, Greece uses the euro.
It's the official currency of the eurozone.
The 19 countries that share the euro.
They are; Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.
Ever since the financial crisis in 2008, where there was a big build-up of debts, many European countries have been trying to fix the problem.
Austerity is a policy aimed at reducing a government's borrowing, or deficit.
It can be successful through things like raising taxes and/or a reduction in government spending.
Don't confuse this with debt.
A government's debt is entirely different from a government's deficit.
The deficit is the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends.
It cannot be paid off but it can be reduced.
This is the term given to a potential withdrawal of Greece from the eurozone.
The country's outgoing government has spent the last few years carrying out deep budget cuts in return for a 240 billion euro bailout.
The leader of the newly-elected party wants to write off most of the debt to end what he calls Greece's "humiliation and pain".
Seems like a good point to mention these guys.
They are a far-left party formed in 2004 and young people began to identify with them after a series of riots in Greece.
This is the term given to a party which aims to support those who cannot support themselves.
They believe in equality and want to use taxation to redistribute opportunity and wealth.
Syriza has harnessed the sense of anger and alienation felt by many Greeks towards their government's policies and the body known as the troika.
The term used to refer to the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
They are the three organisations in charge of checking that Greece keeps to its promises for the bailout loans it received.
This is when a struggling borrower is helped out.
A bailout can be achieved in several ways - from providing loans to a country or bank which markets will no longer lend to, to guaranteeing the value of a borrower's risky assets.
Couldn't Europe just print more money? Ah, that's got it's own phrase...
Ooh, sounds painful.
This phrase refers to the process where central banks increase the supply of money by "printing" more.
Rather than actually printing more notes, the new money is typically issued in the form of a deposit at banks.
The idea is designed to add more money into the system and encourage more borrowing and investment.
Some economists fear that quantitative easing can lead to high inflation in the long term.
