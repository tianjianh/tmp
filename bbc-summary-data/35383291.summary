The 24-year-old former Chelsea youngster had a spell with Notts County in 2013-14, scoring one goal in eight appearances in all competitions.
Coombes will be eligible to make his debut for the Ravens against Tranmere Rovers on Saturday.
"We needed to fill the gap out wide with the departure of Anthony Cook and injuries," said manager Mark Goldberg.
