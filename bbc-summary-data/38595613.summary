A phone call to the NSPCC from a woman who alleges she was indecently assaulted by TV presenter Rolf Harris has been played at his trial.

The July 2014 call was made the day before Mr Harris was sentenced for indecently assaulting four victims.
In the call, the woman said the alleged indecent assault was "horrendous".
Mr Harris, 86, denies seven charges of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. He is appearing at court via video link from Stafford Prison.
The woman - who gave evidence via video link - alleges she was assaulted at the Lyceum Theatre in London in 1971 aged 14.
In the phone call, she told the NSPCC: "To be honest with you, this is something that's been on my mind for absolutely years and years, but I haven't had the courage to come forward.
"But seeing this in the news, it's just run thoughts through my head and I've been pushed by friends for years to say something and I haven't said anything."
The alleged victim told the NSPCC she suspected Mr Harris would be arrested after the Jimmy Savile scandal.
"I've told friends for years, 'You know, I know who's coming next,'" she said.
During cross-examination, the alleged victim was asked whether money played a part in her complaint.
"No, I work full time," she replied.
She was also asked whether she had bought a Rolf Harris autograph online, in order to support her story.
"No," she said.
The alleged victim said she didn't follow Mr Harris's trial in 2014 intently.
The trial at Southwark Crown Court continues.
