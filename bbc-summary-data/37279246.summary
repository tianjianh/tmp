In scenes reminiscent of Tour de France champion Chris Froome running up Mont Ventoux, Wiggins pushed his way up The Struggle in the Lake District.
"Taking things very seriously, took my mind off being in a world of pain," said Wiggins, who finished fifth last.
Cavendish was seen chatting with a fan, who appeared to have a selfie stick.
Incidents of fans trying to take 'selfies' of themselves as the riders rode past were a concern during the Tour de France's Grand Depart from Yorkshire in 2014.
Television pictures did not pick up what led to Cavendish stopping, also on The Struggle - a 4.5km long climb, with an 8% average gradient which has a maximum of 20%.
Vermote out-sprinted Britain's Steve Cummings in an uphill finish in Kendal to win stage two and take the leader's yellow jersey.
Cummings, 35, looked well set for the stage win but could not match Etixx Quick Step rider Vermote's sprint with 150 metres to go.
Vermote takes the leader's jersey from Germany's Andre Greipel who won stage one on Sunday.
Team Dimension Data's Cummings sits second in general classification, six seconds behind Vermote.
Irishman Dan Martin was third while Cavendish and Wiggins were 13 and 22 minutes behind respectively.
Wiggins, in his Instagram post used "#onetoomanyginandtonics" as a potential reason for his struggles.
