The Chiefs vice-captain becomes the fourth All Black to win the prize.
Retallick, 23, beat team-mate Julian Savea, Ireland's Jonathan Sexton, and South Africa pair Willie le Roux and Duane Vermeulen to the award.
It seals a hat-trick of honours for New Zealand, who were named team of the year, with Steve Hansen named coach of the year.
The second row follows in the footsteps of team mates Kieran Read, Dan Carter and Richie McCaw in receiving the honour.
World Rugby chairman Bernard Lapasset said: "Brodie Retallick has been at the heart of another hugely successful year for the All Blacks with his superb line-out skills, ball carrying ability and work at the breakdown playing a huge role in a June series win against England, the Rugby Championship title and a strong November series."
