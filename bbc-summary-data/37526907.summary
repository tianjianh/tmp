[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rob Dickie scored a last-minute equaliser for 10-man Cheltenham as they rescued a point at Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Robins had been reduced to 10 men in the 66th minute when Daniel O'Shaughnessy was sent off for a second yellow card.
Terry Gornell headed home for Stanley in the 74th minute but they could not hold on.
There were not a lot of chances in the game, with the Robins having to shuffle their line-up after five minutes when new signing Alex Cooper hobbled off.
The major talking point of the first half was a late tackle by Cheltenham's Harry Pell on Matty Pearson in front of the dug-outs which saw management and players involved in the aftermath - Pell and team-mate Dickie were booked.
The first real save of the match did not come until the 37th minute with Cheltenham goalkeeper Russell Griffiths keeping out a Romy Boco header.
O'Shaughnessy saw red and then ex-Cheltenham striker Gornell capitalised, heading home Boco's cross for his fourth goal of the campaign.
Stanley looked like they would hold on but then, in the final minute, Danny Wright's header was saved superbly by Aaron Chapman but he could not stop Dickie's follow-up.
