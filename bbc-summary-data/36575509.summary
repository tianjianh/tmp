He joined another former Welsh Secretary, Lord Hain, and past and present First Ministers Rhodri Morgan and Carwyn Jones, on a visit to Pontypridd to boost the pro-EU cause in the south Wales valleys.
Lord Murphy said there had been support for Brexit in the region, but claimed there had been a definite change in mood.
However, UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said: "In recent weeks we have seen a growing trend towards a vote to leave the EU, and that doesn't appear to have changed in light of the tragic events of last week," referring to the killing of Labour MP Jo Cox.
