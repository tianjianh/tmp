Prince George photographed at first day of nursery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two photographs have been released to mark Prince George's first day at nursery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two-year-old prince has started at Westacre Montessori School, near King's Lynn, in Norfolk.
He was captured by his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, standing in front of the mural on the outside of the nursery building.
The nursery is close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's home at Anmer Hall on the Queen's Sandringham Estate.
The young prince will attend the nursery while the couple are staying at their Norfolk home but not when they are in residence at Kensington Palace in London.

The early learning at the Westacre Montessori School was rated good by Ofsted after an inspection in June 2015. It costs Â£5.50 an hour or Â£33 a day to attend the nursery.
The school follows the principles of Italian doctor Maria Montessori who developed a new approach to teaching in the early 20th Century, in which children take responsibility for their own learning.
Prince George's father William was the first senior royal to go to nursery and not start his education in a palace.
