Croatian Cilic, 27, has worked with compatriot Ivanisevic since September 2013 and won the 2014 US Open by beating Kei Nishikori in the final.
He reached the semi-finals the following year and has three Wimbledon quarter-final appearances to his name.
"I enjoyed our work all this time and Goran helped me to reach many goals," Cilic said on Facebook.
