[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 1-1 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kaiyne Woolery scored on his Swindon debut as they drew with Exeter at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Woolery struck 10 minutes into the second half to cancel out Liam McAlinden's first-half opener as the points were shared.
Exeter started quickly and almost went ahead 22 minutes in when Troy Brown's effort was blocked on the line.
The visitors deservedly took the lead in the 28th minute. Lawrence Vigouroux parried Reuben Reid's strike onto the post, but McAlinden was on hand to volley in the rebound.
Four minutes later Swindon had the ball in the net, but Harry Smith's effort was disallowed for handball.
Swindon boss David Flitcroft brought on Luke Norris and new signing Woolery at half-time, and the two linked up to bring the hosts level on 56 minutes.
Norris' pass sent the former Wigan striker through on goal and he calmly slotted the ball under Christy Pym.
Substitute Jack Sparkes nearly won it for Exeter 10 minutes from time when his long-range shot smacked against the post.
