The 26-year-old has not made a first-team appearance for the Championship leaders since August because of a knee injury and suspension.
LuaLua joined Brighton in November 2011 after three separate loan spells with the Seagulls.
"I'm looking forward to helping QPR push on in the second half of the season," he said.
Meanwhile, Rangers striker Sebastian Polter is close to joining German second tier side Union Berlin in a permanent deal.
The 25-year-old, who has not featured since mid-December, has scored 11 goals in 56 appearances since moving to Loftus Road in the summer of 2015.
Brazilian midfielder Sandro and Dutch forward Tjaronn Chery are also set to leave the west London club this month.
