Dozens of staff are at risk of redundancy at one of the South West's biggest further education colleges, the BBC has learned.

City College Plymouth, which takes in about 15,000 students each year, faces a Â£2m cut in government funding from its annual budget of Â£30m.
Unions said they were working with management to limit the number of compulsory redundancies.
The college employs about 790 members of staff.
Philippa Davey, from the University and College Union, said a consultation process currently involving more than 90 jobs at another college in the region - Cornwall College - was something she was "very concerned" about.
The college confirmed the consultation was underway but said it was "too early to tell what sort of impacts that could have".
For many colleges there have been redundancies every year for the past seven years and it has accelerated as cuts have deepened.
This is the time of year when job cuts begin to loom with painful clarity. Funding gets announced between February and April and these cuts will begin to be implemented over the summer months.
In addition, there has been some financial pain caused simply by loss of student numbers. New free schools or studio schools have helped to reduce numbers and in rural areas particularly, loss of Educational Maintenance Allowance has meant students are often not able to go to college.
Since June 2014, about 200 posts have been reviewed at City College Plymouth as a result of the budget cuts.
Ms Davey said: "The college's funding has been cut to a level where it has to cut courses.
"For the economy and people of Plymouth it is a very big concern."
Ms Davey said that if the cuts continued "it will come a time when colleges will close".
The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "Further education colleges play an important role in providing people with the skills they need.
"We are committed to delivering three million apprenticeships in this parliament, working closely with colleges, businesses and other learning providers to create lasting careers for young people."
