Firefighters tackled the blaze, which started just before 21:00 on Monday in Carron Valley.
The home owners and their dog escaped from the building after being alerted by a smoke alarm.
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has launched an investigation into the cause of the blaze, although it is not believed to be suspicious.
Station manager Dave Wishart said: "Firefighters were deployed in strategic positions surrounding the building with high-pressure jets and worked through the night to bring the incident to a safe conclusion.
"Unfortunately the intensity of the fire meant the house was completely destroyed."
"The home owners became aware of the fire quickly and had a working smoke alarm.
"This helped them to get themselves and their dog out safely."
