[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kent v Northamptonshire: Batsmen continue to dominate at Beckenham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northamptonshire batsmen dominated on the third day of their Championship match against Kent at Beckenham to leave the match heading for a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Replying to 701-7, the visitors resumed on 180-1 but looked in trouble as they slipped to 255-4 as Ben Duckett (105) added only four to his overnight score.
Max Holden (153) and Adam Rossington put on 239 before Matt Hunn (3-90) broke their fifth-wicket partnership.
Rossington fell for 112 as Northants closed on 528-7, trailing by 173 runs.
David Ripley's side still require another 23 runs to avoid the follow-on on the final day, but Kent's hopes of victory appear slim, requiring 13 wickets on a track which has offered little for the bowlers.
