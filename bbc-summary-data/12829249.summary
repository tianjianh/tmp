Stephen Cameron's mother relieved after Noye loses case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of Stephen Cameron, the man murdered by Kent road rage killer Kenneth Noye, has spoken of her relief after Noye lost his latest appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Noye, 63, was jailed for life in 2000 for stabbing the 21-year-old on an M25 slip road at Swanley in 1996.
His lawyers claimed two key witnesses at his trial were now discredited, but on Tuesday, High Court judges dismissed his appeal against his conviction.
Toni Cameron said the family were happy that they had "justice for Stephen".
However, she told BBC Radio Kent that it did not take away the fact that she had lost her son.
"Every day I think of Stephen," she said.
"It hurts because of the life that we've lost. No grandchildren, no wedding. And he was starting his own business that week.
"All this has gone from us and we didn't realise how happy we were until it was taken away."
Mrs Cameron added: "We always had a happy family life with Stephen... it's such a great loss to all of us."
Noye fled to Spain after stabbing Mr Cameron but was extradited in 1998 and jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2000. He denied murder, on the grounds of self-defence.
Two previous appeals by Noye, in 2001 and 2004, were unsuccessful.
Mr Cameron was stabbed in front of his fiance, Danielle Cable, who is now in a witness protection scheme.
Giving judgement on Tuesday, Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Henriques and Mr Justice Davis, said there was no doubt that Mr Cameron was "deliberately stabbed" by Noye, and that it "was not self-defence".
Lord Judge said: "Rather it was a gross over-reaction in the context of a fight with an unarmed man, almost certainly consequent on the fact that the appellant was losing it."
Mrs Cameron added that the appeal should "never have come about, because it was all in the court what he [Noye] did the first time".
"At the end of the day he left my son to die in the gutter," she said.
