More licence fee funding for BBC Scotland could generate economic benefits for the country as a whole, the culture secretary has said.

Fiona Hyslop said the BBC could "transform" broadcasting in Scotland by transferring budgets north of the border.
The BBC is currently holding consultations on its future.
Speaking at an event in Edinburgh, Ms Hyslop said the charter renewal process should be "truly radical".
The culture secretary said transferring a greater proportion of licence fee funds to BBC Scotland would allow independent decision-making and editorial choices and greater investment in local creative industries.
She said: "The BBC as a public sector broadcaster has the power to transform the industry in Scotland.
"I am calling for BBC Scotland to have a much more representative share of the licence fee, which could see an additional £100m available for production in Scotland, supporting an estimated 1,500 jobs and contributing around £60m to the Scottish economy.
"Even small changes to the way the BBC Scotland budget is currently spent could generate economic benefits to Scotland."
Ms Hyslop said the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport had received about 200,000 responses to consultations on the future of the BBC so far.
She has previously met the corporation's director general Tony Hall, and argued for a federal structure and new TV and radio channels for Scotland.
At that time, a BBC spokesman said: "We already spend around £200m per year directly in Scotland, and on top of that audiences get access to UK-wide TV, radio and online programmes and services which accounts for the great majority of use of the BBC by Scottish licence fee payers."
