Tadcaster bridge: Brewery objection dismissed by council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council has dismissed an objection from a brewery over plans to widen a Grade II listed bridge damaged by winter flooding in North Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The road bridge over the River Wharfe at Tadcaster partially collapsed in December.
Plans to widen it were agreed at a council meeting, but in a letter the Samuel Smith's Brewery said the proposal contradicted planning policy.
Repairs to the bridge are set to finish by December.
In response to a seven-page objection letter, which cited "important nature conservation interests" and the effect it would have "on the behaviour of flood waters", Selby District Council dismissed the claims.
The letter claimed the decision to approve the plans "was legally or procedurally flawed".
However, Selby council replied: "Having considered your letter against the information that was before the local planning committee we do not agree the decision reached was legally or procedurally flawed."
The authority also said some of the points raised by the brewery were not applicable as changes had been made to the proposals, including its appearance.
The government pledged £3m for repair work within days of the bridge collapse, and £1.4m was given by the region's Local Enterprise Partnership to widen and strengthen the bridge.
Currently the river can only be crossed using a temporary footbridge.
The brewery has so far declined to comment on the council's decision.
