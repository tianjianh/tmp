Gateshead 2-2 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead fought back from 2-0 down to salvage a 2-2 National League draw with Eastleigh at Gateshead International Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danny Johnson went close for the hosts by hitting a post with a speculative strike from 20 yards early on, before Eastleigh - who beat League One side Swindon 3-1 in midweek to reach the second round of the FA Cup - took control.
Scott Wilson got the Spitfires up and running by rising highest to head home a corner after 25 minutes, before Mikael Mandron gave them breathing room from the spot in first-half stoppage time.
Sam Jones gave Gateshead hope with his seventh goal in as many games with 19 minutes to go and Johnson equalised from the spot in the 79th minute to earn a point for the hosts.
