[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United's 100% winning start to the season ended as Newcastle United produced a battling display to secure their second point of the campaign.

Wayne Rooney had a goal ruled out for offside as Louis van Gaal's United made a blistering start before Newcastle responded through Aleksandar Mitrovic.
The Serbia striker headed against the United bar before Newcastle's Tim Krul denied Javier Hernandez.
Chris Smalling headed against the Newcastle post in the closing moments.
Louis van Gaal's side started and finished well but were left frustrated as Newcastle survived the home side's early attacks and came close to taking the lead themselves.
Newcastle boss Steve McClaren, the former Manchester United assistant manager, could have been celebrating the perfect return to Old Trafford but new signing Florian Thauvin narrowly failed to connect with Papiss Cisse's ball across the six-yard area in added time.
Van Gaal saw his side put heavy pressure on Newcastle's goal with 20 shots. Inside the first 20 minutes alone, the hosts had more shots on target - four - than they managed in their opening two league games.
Seven points from three games is a satisfactory return, while Manchester United have yet to concede in 270 minutes of Premier League action.
But it is at the other end of the pitch where their problems lie, two goals in three games against Tottenham, Aston Villa and Newcastle highlighting a lack of cutting edge.
Juan Mata, Rooney, Morgan Schneiderlin, and even defender Luke Shaw, all had great chances but were denied by a combination of great goalkeeping from Krul and poor finishing.
Rooney was narrowly offside when he beat Krul with a fine finish in the fourth minute.
Yet the England man's performance mirrored that of his team - hungry and bright at the start before fading.
He is without a goal for his club since 4 April but Rooney has not been helped by a lack of pace around him.
McClaren has endured an unspectacular start to his reign at Newcastle, the Magpies arriving at Old Trafford on the back of a home draw against Southampton and an away defeat by Swansea.

Yet they produced enough evidence over the 90 minutes to show they will be no soft touches this season.
Having survived the home side's early barrage, Newcastle looked the most likely to score, with Mitrovic so close with his header.
When the hosts were at their most dangerous, Newcastle defended bravely with Fabricio Coloccini leading by example with some vital challenges.
Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal: "We can be satisfied with the performance but not with the result - we were unlucky.

"We did not make the right choices in the final third but we played fantastic as a team. I like these kind of games when we work like this, but not this result.
"The performance was one of the best in my period but we don't reward ourselves and there was only one club that wanted to win and that was us."
Newcastle United manager Steve McClaren: "We're disappointed. We knew the first 20 minutes would be theirs but we grew in belief and we should have scored.
"The defending and discipline was superb but we really could have nicked it - we had the chances but didn't take them.
"We're far from where we want to be and there a lot of areas we need to improve on but we'll get better as the weeks go on."
