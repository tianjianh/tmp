Multiple world champion Dougie Lampkin will need to navigate more than 200 corners and climb 1,385 ft (422 m) above sea level on his back wheel.
"It will be one of my toughest ever challenges," the 40-year-old said.
The Red Bull athlete hopes to complete the challenge in under two hours with an average speed of around 20 mph on 24 September.
The mountain course is a road-racing street circuit used for the Isle of Man TT since 1911.
Lampkin, who has won five consecutive World Indoor and seven consecutive World Outdoor Championships, said he has been training for six months and that it will "push him and his machine to the absolute limit".
The rider, who is world famous for his bike skills, said: "I have taken on some big tasks before, but this one is absolutely massive as there are so many unknowns.
"Over the last six months it has given me a lot of sleepless nights, and although we have made good progress I am under no illusion just how tough it is going to be on the day.
"Like everything I do, I will be giving it 110% to do my best to succeed."
He will attempt the challenge on a highly modified Vertigo Combat two-stroke fuel injected trial machine.
