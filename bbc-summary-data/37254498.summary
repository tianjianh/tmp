[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charities and voluntary groups are being urged to apply for funds from a new council lottery in Portsmouth.

The weekly £25,000 prize draw, aimed at raising money for good causes, is due to start in November.
The lottery will be run by an external company, Gatherwell, which runs a similar scheme for Aylesbury Vale District Council.
Portsmouth City Council leader Donna Jones said the lottery was a "great opportunity" for community groups.
Tickets will cost £1 and 60% of the funds raised will go to local causes, with the remaining allowance divided between the prize fund and running costs.
Groups including Portsmouth Hospitals Charity Action and Portsmouth Alexander Bowls Club have already signed up to potentially benefit from the funding.
Ms Jones said the Aylesbury Vale had produced a £70,000 pot of funds within three months.
"With the austerity programme continuing, we wanted to come up with an innovative way of making sure those small organisations continue to thrive with the income they require, but not necessarily direct from the council as we know that may not be sustainable in the future," she said.
She insisted the project was "absolutely risk free" for the council.
Tickets will go on sale later this month, with the first draw scheduled for 5 November.
