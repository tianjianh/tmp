Republic boss Martin O'Neill has a major selection headache with first-choice central defensive pairing, Shane Duffy and Ciaran Clark, both already ruled out.
Midfielders Harry Arter and Wes Hoolahan are both out injured too.
Burnley wide player Robbie Brady is suspended.
As he took Monday's training session, O'Neill had his fingers crossed crossed over a series of other concerns.
His captain, Everton right-back Seamus Coleman, and Aberdeen midfielder Jonny Hayes were both nursing ankle problems, but are expected to be fit.
News of Daryl Murphy was not so encouraging for the Irish. The Newcastle striker was due to have a scan on a calf problem in Dublin.
Everton midfielder James McCarthy, who has missed his club's last two games with a hamstring injury, was due to meet up later on Monday, as was Colorado Rapids striker Kevin Doyle.
Ireland are unbeaten and top Group D with 10 points from their opening four qualifiers, while Chris Coleman's Wales are four points behind in third.
