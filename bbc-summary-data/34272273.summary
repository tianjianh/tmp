Crown details charges against ex-Rangers chiefs Craig Whyte and Charles Green

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Crown Office has announced details of charges against former Rangers owner Craig Whyte, ex-chief executive Charles Green and five other men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Indictments have been served alleging charges they will face when the case comes to the High Court next month.
They include fraud, conspiracy to defraud, attempting to pervert the course of justice and being involved in organised crime.
The men are due to appear for a preliminary hearing on 16 October.
Craig Whyte and  Charles Green first appeared in court last month after an investigation into the alleged fraudulent acquisition of the club in 2012.
Mr Whyte bought Rangers from Sir David Murray in 2011 for a nominal sum of Â£1 but it went into administration the following year.
A consortium led by Charles Green later bought Rangers' assets.
Indictments have been served against David Whitehouse, Paul Clark and David Grier, who were all working for administrators Duff and Phelps at the time.
Also facing charges are Gary Withey, who worked for a law firm involved in the purchase of Rangers by Craig Whyte, and Imran Ahmad, a former Rangers commercial director.
