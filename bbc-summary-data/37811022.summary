A 15-year-old boy, from the Perth area, is seriously ill in Ninewells Hospital following an incident at about 22:00.
Three of his friends received treatment at Perth Royal Infirmary but were later discharged.
Police said one line of inquiry was that all four boys may have taken "a type of ecstasy tablet".
Ch Insp Gary Ogilvie said: "Officers are currently investigating the circumstances of this incident but in the meantime I would urge the public, especially those planning on going out socialising tonight, to be aware of this incident and think twice of taking any unknown substance.
"There is always a risk when taking substances and the only way of staying safe is to avoid drugs altogether."
Police have asked anyone who may have information about the incident to contact them.
