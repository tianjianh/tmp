Championship side Leeds United have signed centre-back Kyle Bartley on a season-long deal from Swansea City.

Bartley, who played under Leeds boss Garry Monk while he was in charge at Swansea, made eight appearances in all competitions last season.
The 25-year-old joined the Swans from Arsenal in 2012, and has since played in 26 games for the club.
"He's at a stage of his career where he wants to prove himself and try and fight for a place," Monk said.
"He's big, he's strong and he's a very good defender.  He's a good leader, he talks very well, he's a good organiser and a good communicator."
