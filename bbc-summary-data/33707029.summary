The cascade - or weeping window - section will be shown at St George's Hall in Liverpool and Woodhorn Museum, Northumberland.
Yorkshire Sculpture Park will host the arch segment, also known as the wave.
The installation, which marked 100 years since the start of World War One, drew more than five million visitors.
Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said: "This is art at its most powerful and it is only right that everyone should have the chance to see them."
The installation included 888,246 ceramic poppies, with each representing each death in the British and Colonial forces between 1914 and 1918.
It was created by Derbyshire artist Paul Cummins and theatre designer Tom Piper, and was named Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red after a line written by a soldier who died in Belgium.
A total of £9m was raised for six military service charities after most of the poppies, which were handmade in Derby, were sold to members of the public for £25 each.
Wave and the Weeping Window, which together have more than 10,000 ceramic poppies, were bought for the nation last year by the charities Backstage Trust and the Clore Duffield Foundation.
Other locations can bid next year to host the ceramic poppies in 2017 and 2018, before they are permanently homed at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester.
