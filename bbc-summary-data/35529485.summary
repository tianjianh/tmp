The striker picked up Michael Coulson's pass and fired in a low shot from close range to give the Minstermen the lead.
Jayden Stockley came close to equalising for the visitors minutes later but his header hit the cross bar.
Fewster won a scramble on the edge of the box to double York's lead after the break, as the home side registered back-to-back victories.

"I thought it was a hard work performance. They caused us problems. They're a good side.
"But I'm delighted with all three points, the two goals and the clean sheet. It gives the defence a lot of confidence.
"We can play a lot better but credit to the way Exeter played the game."
