[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fernando Forestieri scored his second goal in as many games to help Sheffield Wednesday spoil Paul Lambert's home debut as Wolves manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forestieri put the Owls ahead from the penalty spot after he was was brought down by Matt Doherty in the box.
The striker then played provider, finding Lucas Joao with a cross before he set up Kieran Lee from 10 yards.
Substitute Ivan Cavaleiro put Wolves' best chance wide as they suffered a fourth successive home defeat.
The home side's miserable form, which led to former Italian international Walter Zenga being sacked as boss last month, has seen them collect just three points from a possible 27 in a nine-game winless run. They are now one place above the relegation zone.
Meanwhile for Wednesday, it was the first time in nine Championship games they had managed to score more than once.
It was also their their first win at Molineux in seven attempts, having lost on their past five visits. They have moved up to the top six in the Championship.
Wolves manager Paul Lambert: "We are in a fight along with a few others and in a dangerous position, but that is why we are here - to try and get out of it. There are a lot of games to go but we have to defend better.
"If you can get this right it is a cracking place to be but you have to handle the occasion. It is up to us to find lads who can do it. The ones who can will go with you and the ones who can't will struggle.
"Individual errors have cost us and we are going to have to be more streetwise than that.
"Sheffield Wednesday are a really good side and they punished us. We were a lot better in the second half but by then the horse had bolted."

Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal: "I told Fernando that he is back again. He performed very well against Fulham in the last game and (against Wolves) he again did very well and it is the Fernando we know and recognise and that the coaches and fans like.
"We are better than last season and the big difference is the efficiency. We have found a way to score goals and the level of the football is very high. I hope we can keep this going for all of the season.
"Wolves ran and fought a lot during the 97 minutes we played. They had new energy because they had changed the coach and it was the first home game and that made them tougher to play against.
"But I think we were ready for this environment and we did well. We got the first goal and deserved it and we had more chances."
