Ciara Breen was 17 when she was last seen in the early hours of 13 February 1997.
An extensive police investigation at the time failed to locate her.
Officers have now started searching land in Dundalk in County Louth.
They have been searching an area called Balmer's Bog, a marshland just off the Ardee Road.
The search has concluded for the day and is expected to resume on Wednesday.
Last year, two witnesses came forward with potential sightings of Ms Breen.
Police also received two anonymous letters with information about the case.
A man in his 50s was arrested in April and later released without charge in connection with Ms Breen's disappearance.
On Tuesday, police said they were acting on information they had received following recent appeals for information.
It is thought the search will go on for a number of weeks and is focused in a specific part of the site.
Det Ins Pat Marry thanked those who had come forward with information to date and appealed to anyone with more details about Ciara's disappearance to come forward and "do the right thing".
