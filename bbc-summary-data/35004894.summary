HMP North Wales, which is due to open in February 2017, will house 2,000 inmates, making it the UK's largest.
The initial salary, which is dependant on the weekly number of hours worked, ranges from £20,545 to £22,823.
Newly appointed prison officers will initially be given work at a nearby jail to gain experience.
More officers and support staff will be taken on in the coming year.
The National Offender Management Service application form says: "Working in a prison isn't for everyone.
"But if you're one of the few with the right blend of qualities, it's a secure and very rewarding career."
