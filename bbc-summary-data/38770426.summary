His manager Tshepo Nzimande explained what made Mr Tyamara so popular:  "He had energy on stage and he was very powerful."
Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said there was "a deep sense of grief for losing such a young life. He is a success story that South African youth have a significant contribution to make in our society."
Popular evangelist pastor Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng who had visited the musician in hospital also described to local newspaper how shocked he was when he heard the news.
"It was a massive shock to me. I could not believe it at first but I was grateful that I could pray for him and bring him closer to the Lord."
The singer had been receiving treatment since being diagnosed in December.
A family statement, released on Friday, said that Lundi has passed away peacefully just after midnight.
Tyamara is the third young artist to die within the last six months, after the deaths of another gospel star Sifiso Ncwane and musician Mduduzi "Mandoza" Tshabalala, both also aged 38.
