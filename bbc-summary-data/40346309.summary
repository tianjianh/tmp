[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton Albion have broken their club record to sign Ross County striker Liam Boyce on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.

The Northern Ireland international, 26, was the Scottish Premiership's top scorer with 23 goals last season.
The deal beats Burton's previous record signing of about Â£300,000, also paid to Ross County, for Jackson Irvine.
"Liam's the right kind of character and is desperate to prove himself in England," said boss Nigel Clough.
"He's a good player who can get goals. Some people say he's not easy on the eye at times but he's a good all-round player. He's not blessed with pace but holds the ball up well and gets in the box."
The Brewers narrowly avoided relegation from the Championship last season, their first in the second tier of English football.
