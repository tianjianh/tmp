It will be the third time the singer, who on Sunday performed at the Super Bowl 50 half-time show, has appeared in the north east of England.
Sunderland commercial director Gary Hutchinson said the Formation show on 28 June will be the "biggest concert" held at the stadium.
Previous performers include Take That, Bruce Springsteen and Oasis.
Mr Hutchinson said: "We can't wait to welcome her to the city and the stadium."
Beyonce previously performed in the North East when she visited Newcastle for her I Am tour in 2009 and her Dangerously in Love Tour in 2003.
Stadium of Light 49,000-seat home of Sunderland FC since 1997, has also hosted Pink, One Direction and the Foo Fighters
National Glass Centre Built in 1998 for Â£17m on the site of a former shipyard, courage needed for glass roof walk
Penshaw Monument Half-sized replica of Athens' Temple of Hephasteus built in 1844, can go to top on summer weekends
Winter Gardens Established in 1846, the first publicly-funded museum outside of London
Rob Jewitt, a senior lecturer in media and culture at the University of Sunderland, said a Beyonce show will be a huge boost to the city.
He said: "She is one the world's biggest acts right now, the queen of pop. She is more than just a singer, she is iconic and one of the most relevant performers in the world who galvanises people's opinions.
"Her concert is causing a lot of excitement, I'm sure it will be a sell out, we will be the first city in the UK to see her new show.
"The Stadium of Light has proven it can host big acts before so Beyonce should enjoy her time there.
"Hopefully she will put a smile on the faces of the people in the stadium - with the city's football going the way it is, we could all use a lift."
