Worcester Warriors have revealed that centre Alex Grove will leave Sixways at the end of the 2015-16 season.

Warriors' longest-serving player came through the club's academy, signing after he left Rugby School in 2006.
He has scored 29 tries in 152 games during his 10 years at Sixways.
Grove, 28, who won three Scotland caps in 2009, has failed to make Dean Ryan's Premiership team this season and was loaned out in January to play alongside younger brother Oli at London Scottish.
Despite playing a part in helping Warriors to their British & Irish Cup/promotion double last season, Grove has largely been limited to European Challenge Cup appearances this season.
Director of rugby Dean Ryan added: "I'd like to thank Alex for his fantastic contribution to this club over the last decade. He has been a tremendous athlete with the utmost professionalism."
Grove will be followed out of Sixways by fellow centre Heath Stevens, who has been announced as one of three new signings by rebuilding Championship side London Welsh, along with former Ospreys and Scarlets winger Kristian Phillips and Moseley stand-off Glyn Hughes.
Stevens, 23, signed from Plymouth Albion for the 2014-15 season but was kept sidelined by injury for much of the campaign and has been limited to two Warriors appearances, spending the majority of this season on loan at Nottingham.
"Heath had an unfortunate start at Sixways," said Ryan. "With competition for places in the centre, we haven't been able to offer him much game time."
