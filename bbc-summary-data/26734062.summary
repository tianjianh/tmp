A mobile phone app allowing people to find out where Guernsey's public buses are on their routes could be in place this summer.

It is the first project being undertaken by the Dandelion Project, a non-profit community group.
Developers have donated their free time to create the app, which will show if buses are on time or running late.
Frank Villeneuve-Smith, from bus operator CT Plus, said: "Anything that helps bus users is good for us."
The company plans to share timetable and GPS data with the group once its summer timetable, due to start on 5 May, has been confirmed.
A public consultation on the timetable closed on Friday.
Philip Smith, from the Dandelion Project, said once the group had the data the app could be ready to roll out in three to four weeks.
The group encourages people with certain skills to get together to improve life for everyone.
It is currently working on 12 other projects involving volunteers from the health sector, horticulture, technology design and architecture.
