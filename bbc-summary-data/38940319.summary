[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 1-3 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul Mullin scored twice as Morecambe climbed above hosts Crawley with a convincing win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhys Turner put Morecambe on their way with the opener in a flying start to consign Town to just their third home league defeat of the season.
The defence was caught napping in the third minute when the recalled Turner rose unchallenged to head in a cross from Michael Rose.
Mullin then raced through to double the advantage inside seven minutes by slipping the ball under keeper Glenn Morris following a pass by Antony Evans.
Crawley threatened for the first time when leading marksman James Collins forced keeper Barry Roche to parry his goal-bound shot.
But Mullin, after forcing keeper Morris to save well from his attempted chip, made it 3-0 five minutes before the break with a lob from eight yards which Morris got a touch to but could not keep out.
Crawley had a let-off on the hour when a surging run by Evans set up Lee Molyneux and his low shot flew inches wide.
A Collins penalty got the home side on the scoresheet after Liam Wakefield felled Rhys Murphy.
Molyneux then went close when his low drive was cleared off the line by Mark Connolly, but Morecambe stood firm to take all three points.
