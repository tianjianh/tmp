England, Scotland, New Zealand and Australia will contest the tournament, which will be broadcast by the BBC.
It begins on Friday, 28 October, with the final on Sunday, 20 November.
The Olympic Stadium in London has also been chosen as a venue, with England taking on Australia there in the final group match on Sunday, 13 November.
Full details of the BBC's broadcast plans will follow later in the year but there will be live coverage across TV, radio and online.
Rugby league has been played at Anfield three times: the 1989 Charity Shield match between Widnes and Wigan, the 1991 World Club Challenge game between Wigan and Australian champions Penrith, and St Helens against Castleford in Super League in 1997.
New Zealand beat England at the Olympic Stadium last November, the first rugby league match to be played at the venue.
"Playing at iconic venues such as Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and Anfield is one of the reasons we play the game," said England captain Sean O'Loughlin.
"Walking out in front of 45,000 fans in London was one of the highlights of 2015 for me and I am sure that playing in front of big home crowds will push the team on to what will hopefully be a successful campaign."
England, coached by Australian Wayne Bennett, have never won the Four Nations, having twice lost to Australia in the final.
Holders New Zealand and Australia have won two titles apiece in the four stagings of the tournament since 2009.
Scotland coach Steve McCormack is comfortable with the decision to stage all of his team's games in England.
"We were fully aware there were no guarantees and we're delighted what they've come up with," said McCormack.
