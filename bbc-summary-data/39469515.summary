Rotherham United caretaker boss Paul Warne admitted that avoiding relegation from the Championship was as likely as him "growing his hair back".

A 1-0 defeat by Fulham condemned the Millers to the drop into League One.
It was the 30th defeat of the season for a side that has spent more than six months at the bottom of the table.
"If I was truly honest, prior to the game I knew we were down. I never let that out to the lads, but they're not stupid," Warne said.
For Rotherham to have any remote hope of prolonging their Championship stay only a victory over Fulham was enough, having started the game 24 points adrift of safety with 24 points still available to them.
"We won very few games this season in a very tough league," Warne told BBC Radio Sheffield. "For us to win win eight on the spin was as likely as my hair growing back.
"The lads are licking their wounds. They know they are relegated now, so it is a sad day for the players, staff and everyone at the club."
Warne oversaw relegation after taking charge of the club in November after Kenny Jackett -  who succeeded Alan Stubbs - resigned after just 39 days at the helm.
In total, the Millers have spent just 26 days of the 239 this season outside the relegation places.
However, former midfielder Warne, who made 292 appearances for the club as a player, apologised to fans for a "season of poor results".
He continued: "Everyone who works at the club, loves the club, breathes the club.
"I'm the manager that takes them down, it is not exactly great for my ego or self-esteem."
Rotherham are set to name their new manager on Wednesday, and Warne is hopeful they can give fans "something to cheer" in the remaining seven games.
"I would like to think that with seven games we can go gung ho, give young lads a chance," he said.
"I'm also aware of the fact that we don't want to go crazy and get 5-0 and 6-0 drubbings.
"We want to go toe-to-toe, be competitive.
"It is still a good motivated group - some have something to prove, other will want to win fans over, others will want to win contacts."
