Suffolk police has recovered the original case files relating to Kesgrave Hall and is contacting people who claimed to have been abused.
No charges were brought as a result of the investigation in 1992.
Kesgrave Hall, a privately-owned school near Ipswich for pupils with behavioural problems, closed in 1993.
Children were placed there by local education authorities.
An allegation of mistreatment at the school was made to police earlier this month.
"Suffolk Police have now begun an investigation into other complaints of abuse," a police spokesperson said.
"We are now in the process of contacting those who alleged abuse as part of the original investigation to ensure that we have captured all relevant complaints and a full and thorough investigation can be carried out."
The allegations dated back to the 1980s and 1990s.
