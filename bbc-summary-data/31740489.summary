The 176.5m-long suspension bridge, which links Anglesey to mainland Wales, was completed in 1826 to Thomas Telford's design.
Royal Mail said the stamps demonstrate "leaps in engineering" by progressive architects.
Others featured include Pulteney Bridge in Bath and Middlesbrough's Tees Transporter Bridge.
Royal Mail will also issue a special postmark to mark the stamps release.
