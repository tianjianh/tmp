Tommy Roome, of Rams Grove, Romford, has been accused of murdering Mr Hayden, 27, who was stabbed outside his home in Chadwell Heath on 13 September.
Mr Roome was also charged with the attempted murder of Mr Hayden's father, Paul, 46, who was also injured.
He is due to appear at Barkingside Magistrates' Court on Friday.
Mr Hayden died from a stab wound to the thigh a day after he was attacked in Gibbfield Close at about 01:25 BST.
Both he and his father were assaulted when they confronted a group of men outside their home following the attempted theft of a moped.
The bodyguard had worked in security at ITV and at high-profile events including the marriage between footballer Peter Crouch and model Abbey Clancy. He was also employed by Havering Council.
Two other teenagers, aged 16 and 19, were previously arrested over the attack and bailed.
