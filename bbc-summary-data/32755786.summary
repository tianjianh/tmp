Terngu Agera, 22, and Stephen Lansana, 22, were each sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 30 years for the murder of Zydrunas Laurinavicius.
Mr Laurinavicius, from Lithuania, was stabbed on Parson Street, in Hendon, on 3 July while walking with his father.
At the Old Bailey, Agera, of Sophia Road, Canning Town, and Lansana, of no fixed address, were also convicted of robbery and conspiracy to burgle.
Bruno Guimaraes, Marlon O'Brien and Terae Eusebe were also jailed for conspiracy to burgle.
Guimaraes, 23, of Carnarvon Road, West Ham, was jailed for three years for conspiracy to burgle and Eusebe, 21, of Hatherley Gardens, Barking, was sentenced to 28 months in prison for conspiracy to burgle.
O'Brien, 22, of Woodcocks, Canning Town, was jailed for two years for conspiracy to burgle.
Mr Laurinavicius was returning home from work with his father at about 16:45 BST when the group targeted them and stole the victim's bag and watch, police said.
A post-mortem examination found Mr Laurinavicius died from stab wounds to the chest.
All five men were convicted at the Old Bailey on 14 May.
Det Insp Jamie Stevenson said: "This was a horrific, unprovoked attack on an honest hardworking man returning home from work in the middle of the day.
"He was singled out and set upon by the group who were armed and used a knife to inflict fatal injuries for no other reason than to steal his possessions."
