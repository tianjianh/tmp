Ex-University of Leeds dentistry lecturer 'had sex in office'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dentistry lecturer was overheard having sex in his office by a colleague who was trying to comfort a grieving student, a hearing was told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Alec High "repeatedly" engaged in sexual activity despite being warned not to while working at the University of Leeds' School of Dentistry, the General Dental Council committee heard.
The panel was told at least four colleagues said they overheard.
The allegations relate to the period between 2013 and 2015.
Dr High qualified as a dentist in 1966 and worked for the NHS in the North-East before moving to the University of Leeds in 1981.
He was a senior lecturer and consultant specialising in the head and neck, but left the University of Leeds in 2014.
The panel heard a woman was "often" spotted entering or leaving his office.
It was told Dr High continued to have sex in the room, despite being told by a senior colleague that the behaviour was unacceptable.
It is alleged that when the university investigated, he tried to convince staff he was working in hospital.
However, his computer was logged on and connected.
Dr High was charged with repeatedly engaging in sexual activity between 1 January 2013 and 12 March 2015.
He is also accused of "inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour" and giving a false account of his whereabouts on 12 March 12 2015 - said to have amounted to "misleading and dishonest behaviour".
The hearing continues.
