Phoenix owns the has gas pipe network around Greater Belfast and Larne.
It intends to extend it to Annahilt, Ballygowan, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Crossgar, Downpatrick, Dromore, Drumaness, Dundrum, Hillsborough, Newcastle, Saintfield and Spa.
The expansion represents around 25,000 additional homes and businesses that could have access to the network.
Phoenix has made an application to the Utility Regulator which will have to approve the expansion.
The company already has over 3,000 km of pipeline which makes gas available to over 300,000 homes and businesses.
Chief Executive of Phoenix Natural Gas, Michael McKinstry, said the expansion would deliver 'economic, social and environmental benefits.'
There are three gas network owners in Northern Ireland.
Firmus owns a network outside Belfast which stretches in an arc from Londonderry through Antrim and on to Newry.
The third network, serving the west of Northern Ireland is under development by Mutual Energy and Scotia Gas Networks.
