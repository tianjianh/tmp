The ex-Great Britain and England international died at the age of 68 on 2 May.
A service was held at St Mary's Church in Kippax, near Leeds, at 11:45 BST before his cremation in Pontefract.
Rugby league star Johnny Whiteley MBE was among former teammates and fans who attended his funeral.
Speaking ahead of the service, the ex-Hull FC player and coach described Millward as "the best rugby league all round player I've ever seen in my life".
"I've played with the best and coached the best and, like I've always said, if I had a son Roger Millward would've been that man," Whiteley said.
Hull KR's chairman Neil Hudgell said: "Sleep tight Roger the Dodger, the greatest Robin ever."
The club said his family had asked for donations to be made to three charities - Yorkshire Cancer Research, the Danny Jones Defibrillator Fund and the Rugby League Benevolent Fund.
Speaking after his death, Mr Hudgell said: "There is no doubt Roger will go down in history as Hull KR's greatest ever player, coach and captain and an all-time legend of the game.
"At his peak, he was a player blessed with exceptional skills, outstanding leadership qualities and genuine bravery. He was also a true gentlemen of the game who remained very close to the club in his later years."
Millward made 406 appearances for Hull KR, scoring a club record 207 tries and kicking 607 goals.
He was awarded the MBE for his services to the sport in 1983 and inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame in 2000.
After his retirement from playing, he coached the Robins for 11 seasons, winning six trophies.
