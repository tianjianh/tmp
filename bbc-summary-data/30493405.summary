[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review of paediatric first aid training for nursery staff across England is to take place following the death of a baby in Greater Manchester.

Nine-month-old Millie Thompson, of Stockport, fatally choked on her lunch at Ramillies Hall School and Nursery in Cheadle Hulme in October 2012.
The review follows an e-petition set up by Millie's mother Joanne Thompson and a debate at Westminster Hall on Monday.
The government said it would consider making paediatric first aid mandatory.
Childcare and Education Minister Sam Gyimah said Millie's tragic death was "a wake-up call" and an independent review of early years educators was of "utmost importance".
He said: "We will produce guidance and, in due course, a national review which will include the question of mandatory training."
Mrs Thompson received more than 102,000 signatures in her online campaign to change the law and make it compulsory for all nursery staff to be trained in paediatric first aid.
Mr Gyimah praised Mrs Thompson and her husband Dan for setting up Millie's Trust, which provides paediatric first aid courses.
He said he would work with the couple to "ensure that there will not be another awful tragedy" like Millie's.
At the inquest into her death, South Manchester coroner John Pollard returned a verdict of misadventure and said no-one was to blame.
He said paediatric first aid training for all nursery staff was "matter of national importance".
The jury at Oldham Magistrates' Court heard that Millie started coughing and crying in a high chair while being fed shepherd's pie from a supervisor whose basic first aid certificate had expired.
The supervisor passed Millie to a colleague who had paediatric first aid training and gave the baby back slaps.
She was taken in an ambulance to hospital but was pronounced dead.
