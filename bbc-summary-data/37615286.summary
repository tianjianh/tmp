The man, an EU national who has not been named, was spotted by divers off the coast of Dover at dawn on Sunday.
A Home Office spokesman said the man had become disorientated on his paddleboard.
He said: "The man was a German tourist in distress, but who was in the country legally."
He added: "He was not an illegal immigrant.
"He had been on the water for some time, having gone out on his paddleboard, and was picked up by HMC Valiant."
