The Championship strugglers met at Ashton Gate on Tuesday.
Before the game Johnson, 34, told the Bristol Post: "We have to make sure we win it, whether through aggression, good football or intimidation."
Warnock told BBC Radio Sheffield: "I didn't have to do a team talk, Johnson did it for me yesterday."
The 67-year-old added: "What he said in the local paper was an absolute disgrace. I know he is only a young manager, but I don't think he should be saying things like 'we have to make sure we win, whether we do it by aggression or intimidation'.
"That is almost inciting the crowd and I think that is out of order, personally. Like father, like son."
Johnson's father Gary was manager at Bristol City in August 2009 when Warnock's Crystal Palace were denied a goal when a Freddie Sears shot hit the stanchion behind the goal and bounced back into play, with the referee erroneously awarding a goal kick.
Warnock was angered at the time that Johnson did not allow his team to score an uncontested goal.
The Robins, for whom Lee Johnson was an unused substitute, went on to win the game 1-0 with an 89th-minute goal from Nicky Maynard.
Tuesday's point for his current side lifted Rotherham six points clear of the Championship's relegation zone.
