Brierley, 25, is in line to make his debut for the Wolfpack in Sunday's Challenge Cup fifth-round tie with Salford Red Devils.
The move reunites the Scotland international with Wolfpack boss Paul Rowley, who coached him at Leigh.
He scored 15 tries in 25 appearances after moving from Leigh in March 2016.
"It was clear that the move would be appealing to Ryan and, from our side of things, once the fee met our value of the player the deal was quickly signed," Giants managing director Richard Thewlis said.
"It's a sad day in some respects for us but the reality is that the move to Huddersfield and into Super League didn't really work out as either we nor Ryan would have wished."
Brierley will drop two divisions to link up with Toronto, who have won all five league games and are still in the Challenge Cup.
"Like all players, I wanted to be playing every week and that's the main reason for taking the new challenge at Toronto with a coach who obviously I know very well," he said.
"The initial aim of course is promotion and then the desire and ambition of the club is ultimately Super League and I hope to be able to play a big part in that and get back to level that I am leaving."
