England hit record 408-9 to thrash New Zealand in ODI

England made a sensational start to their new era of one-day internationals by striking their highest ever score in a 210-run thrashing of New Zealand.

Eoin Morgan's side hammered 408-9 at Edgbaston, surpassing the 391-4 made against Bangladesh in 2005.
Jos Buttler hit the second-fastest ODI hundred by an England batsman off 66 balls, while Joe Root completed the fourth quickest.
They then bowled New Zealand out for 198 to claim a stunning win.
Adil Rashid, who made 69 from 50 balls, took 4-55 and Steven Finn 4-35.
England's performance was an extraordinary statement of intent in their first home ODI since a dismal World Cup campaign.
Morgan's men were beaten by Bangladesh in that tournament as they suffered a first-round exit.
With Paul Farbrace now in temporary charge of England following the sacking of Peter Moores, England included only six members of their World Cup squad against the Black Caps.
On a pitch full of runs, they took advantage of some poor New Zealand bowling and fielding but also displayed an aggression that has long been absent from their limited-overs cricket.
The batting display was made all the more impressive by the fact that England lost Jason Roy to the first ball of the match.
Root's hundred came from 71 balls, while wicketkeeper Buttler, who holds the record for the fastest England ODI century, brought up three figures in five fewer balls.
Buttler went on to score 129 off 77 balls.
New Zealand lost captain Brendon McCullum in the first over and never really looked like threatening England's score.
The World Cup finalists lost their last six wickets for just 13 runs.
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: "It is remarkable for those of us who saw that performance at the World Cup. It wasn't that long ago. That is a really emphatic win. What is most important is that they have convinced themselves they can play this way."

Former England captain Alec Stewart: "A couple of months ago, England were being laughed at for playing archaic one-day cricket. It's roles reversed from the World Cup. The public needed this, the England dressing-room needed this. If this is how they are going to play for the next four years, it's a great start."
Former England captain Michael Vaughan: "What you've seen today is that you can change mindset quickly with players and a coach who want it. I can't remember seeing an England one-day performance as good as that."
Root, promoted to number three after James Taylor was left out, arrived at the crease when opener Roy sliced his first ball in ODI cricket to point.
He played eye-catching drives off the back foot in a stand of 121 with captain Morgan, although he edged between keeper and slip to reach 50 and was dropped at long-on by Ross Taylor when on 61.
After Morgan was lbw to Trent Boult for a 46-ball 50, Root was caught behind off the same bowler for 104 in an England slide of four wickets for 31 runs to 202-6.
Buttler, though, rebuilt with Rashid in a seventh-wicket stand of 177 - an ODI record - in only 17.3 overs.
As Rashid initially took the initiative, Buttler's first 50 came in a relatively calm 42 balls, with the Lancashire man then needing just 24 more to reach 100.
Dropped on the boundary by Taylor on 90, Buttler showed power down the ground, hitting four straight sixes to add to another maximum over the leg side in addition to 13 fours.
When he top-edged Mitchell McClenaghan to depart in the 48th over, England were still 21 runs short of reaching 400 for the first time.
But in front of a delirious Birmingham crowd, number 10 Liam Plunkett hit two maximums in the final over to complete an England total of 14 sixes.
If New Zealand were to make any impression on an unlikely chase, it seemed that the destructive McCullum would have to do most of the work.
However, he was bowled swiping at the impressive Finn, a measure of revenge for the England seamer, who was hit for four successive sixes in a World Cup defeat in Wellington.
Though Ross Taylor made 57 and Kane Williamson 45, the Black Caps were never in it, and the end was accelerated when Sam Billings ran out Grant Elliott from the deep.
Rashid removed Mitchell Santner and Luke Ronchi in successive balls, Finn pinned Taylor lbw and Chris Jordan sealed it by having McClenaghan caught at deep square leg.
