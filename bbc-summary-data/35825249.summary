[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
NHS Highland said its "roadshow" would visit every ward at Raigmore Hospital.
Four wards at the hospital in Inverness were affected by the virus at various times between the end of February and the start of March.
NHS Highland said it hoped to "re-educate" patients and visitors on how to keep their hands clean.
During the demonstrations, people will be offered the chance to be shown how clean their hands are.
Ann Chalmers, infection prevention and control nurse at Raigmore, said: "Keeping hands clean is one of the most important ways of preventing the spread of infection and illness.
"Our aim is to remind and re-educate on the importance of hand hygiene and when you should be washing your hands."
