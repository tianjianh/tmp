[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tuesday Nathan, 29, had an "inappropriate relationship" with a girl at the Leventhorpe Business and Enterprise Academy in Hertfordshire.
A professional misconduct panel found their relationship from 2012-15 developed in a "secretive manner".
English teacher Ms Nathan was banned from the profession indefinitely.
The panel was told Ms Nathan admitted hugging the pupil in a darkened classroom at the school in Sawbridgeworth in December 2014.
She also admitted giving the girl her personal mobile number and having "regular communication" with her outside of school, as well as giving her a lift in her car without parental permission.
Ms Nathan denied that her conduct had been sexually motivated, but the panel found the allegation "proven on the balance of probabilities".
Writing on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, Jayne Millions said the panel had found "conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute".
But she said, "the panel considered that Ms Nathan's behaviour, on the whole, was at the less serious end of the possible spectrum."
Ms Nathan will be able to apply for the prohibition order to be lifted in five years' time, she added.
