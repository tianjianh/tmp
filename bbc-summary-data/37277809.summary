Artists have created an image of a giant electric car in a field of wind turbines.

The car, which appears to be connected to one of the turbines, was designed by Carlo Roberts and Stefan Fulcher in a field in Eye, Suffolk.
Mr Roberts admitted to being "obsessed with aerial views" and said "the idea of a turbine powering a car seemed very interesting".
It was created with the landowner's permission, using a tractor.

The geography teacher, who has an art degree and a background in community art, said: "After a trip to London, I was amazed at the amount of electric cars there.
"It got me thinking about electric cars and how few there seem to be in the countryside."
The 200m (656ft) etching took him and farm worker Mr Fulcher five hours to mark out and a further 90 minutes to plough.
A member of a local radio-controlled model aircraft club monitored the design from the air using a drone to ensure its accuracy.
The electric car is the latest in a line of collaborative "land art" projects completed by the pair, which included a B-17 bomber, Olympic rings to celebrate London 2012 and a giant poppy to commemorate US servicemen who lost their lives while based at the nearby eye airfield.
"The thing we are always up against is fitting it in with the agricultural calendar and when the tractors are free," Mr Roberts said.
