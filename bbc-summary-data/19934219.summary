Black voters urged to take part in election by church

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Black church leaders are launching a campaign which they say could inspire a million more black voters to go to the polls in the next general election.

Non-party lobby group Operation Black Vote has recruited church leaders to persuade people to register and vote.
It says having more black voters making their voice heard will end discrimination against the community.
And it says it is confident of meeting the target in time to affect the outcome of marginal constituencies.
The BBC's religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said community leaders had long struggled to persuade black people to vote.
Significant numbers of people among some sections of the community - such as black Africans - had never registered to vote and a lack of confidence in the democratic process meant turnout was often very low, he added.
Operation Black Vote claims black people face discrimination which is built into the social and economic system - illustrated by poor housing, poverty and a 55% unemployment rate among young black men.
But in communities which often suffer high rates of deprivation, black-led churches have been a success story.
Their leaders say they can harness the churches' energy and organisation to create a powerful new electorate that politicians cannot ignore.
Operation Black Vote, which focuses on voter registration, lobbying politicians and mentoring schemes says it seeks "to inspire black and minority ethnic communities to engage with our public institutions in order to address the persistent race inequalities we face in areas such as education, health and employment".
