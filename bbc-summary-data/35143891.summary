It happened shortly after 02:00 GMT on Sunday in Poleglass not far from where Christopher Meli was beaten to death.
One of the teenagers, a 16-year-old boy, was treated for facial injuries, including a suspected fractured nose.
It is understood they were attacked by a number of people who got out of a car.
Police have said they are investigating a motive.
Ch Insp Anthony McNally said there has been a significantly increased police presence in west Belfast in recent days, as local community and political leaders have already been advised.
"We are committed to keeping people safe. There is, though a wider social responsibility for all in the area, including civic and community leaders, to assist in reducing tensions and deterring offenders," he said.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann said it was a "vicious attack".
"The youths were savagely beaten when they were attacked by a gang last night as they were walking back to their home in the Poleglass area," she said.
