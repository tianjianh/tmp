President Kuczynski (top right), who is 77, was seen in sports clothing working out to loud electronic music alongside his younger ministers with the help of two instructors.
"We want to promote health, a healthy mind and a healthy body," Mr Kuczynski told reporters.
Minister of Health Patricia Garcia said the session would happen every week and was designed to encourage Peruvians to exercise for health and to reduce obesity.
Two ministers were missing, including Education Minister Jaime Saavedra, who arrived in a suit and tie and joked that he would indeed encourage physical education during his administration.
Absent also was Minister of Agriculture Jose Manuel Hernandez Calderon, who arrived on crutches after damaging his leg.
