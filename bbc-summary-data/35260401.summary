Playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, whose The Mother with the Hat was staged last year in London, is adapting the film, which tells of a bank heist gone awry.
Al Pacino took the leading role for Sidney Lumet's film, which won an Oscar for Frank Pierson's screenplay.
The film was inspired by a real-life robbery that took place in Brooklyn, New York in 1972.
It is best-known for "Attica! Attica!" - the chant Pacino's character uses to incite the onlookers who gather outside the bank after he and his fellow robber take its employees hostage.
The chant refers to the excessive police force that was allegedly used to quell a riot at a New York prison in 1971.
No date has been set for the production, though it is expected to premiere on Broadway.
Warner Bros Theatre Ventures is behind a number of stage and screen ventures, among them the current Broadway production of Misery starring Bruce Willis.
It also co-produced the West End musical adaptation of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, currently in its third year at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane.
