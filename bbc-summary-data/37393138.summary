[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 3-1 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Stead struck his seventh goal of the season as 10-man Notts County defeated Leyton Orient 3-1 after a lively second half at Meadow Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Magpies edged a forgettable first half, with Stead denied twice in the box on 20 minutes, first by a block from Nicky Hunt and then by Alex Cisak's near-post save.
But the home side stepped up a level after the break, scoring twice in quick succession early in the half to take control of the game.
They went ahead when Jonathan Forte met a fine right-sided cross from Matt Tootle with a downward header which Cisak appeared to have saved, but the referee's assistant indicated that the ball had crossed the line before the Orient keeper had reached it.
The impressive Stead doubled the advantage moments later with an excellent 25-yard strike into the bottom corner.
Louis Laing's dismissal for a second booking on 69 minutes and Paul McCallum's close-range header four minutes from time set up a nervy finish.
But substitute Aaron Collins' superb counter-attacking goal in stoppage time put the result beyond doubt.
