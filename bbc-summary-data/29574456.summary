The host of the Radio 1 Breakfast Show will front the event, which is on Wednesday 29 October at The Hospital Club in London.
"It's a real honour to host the Mercury Prize awards show, which celebrates the best British talent that we have to offer," said Grimmy.
"I think it's a really interesting, exciting and pretty perfect shortlist."
He has appeared as part of Channel 4's coverage of the event before, hosting backstage interviews with the nominated artists.
Previously the role of presenter has gone to Lauren Laverne, who has now stepped down.
Nominees for this year's prize include Damon Albarn, FKA Twigs and Royal Blood.

Radio 1's Alice Levine revealed the shortlist, which features 10 artists, last month.
Previous winners of the prize, which recognises the best album by an artist from the United Kingdom and Ireland, include Arctic Monkeys, Dizzee Rascal and Alt-J.
Last year, when introducing award-winner James Blake, Laverne accidentally called him James Blunt.
