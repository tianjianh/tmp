Bay TV will be transmitted from studios in Toxteth and will broadcast each day from 06:00 to 23:00, reaching more than 930,000 homes across Merseyside.
The station, which launches at 17:30 GMT, was awarded the local digital television licence in February 2013 and can be viewed on Freeview and Virgin.
It has BBC support as part of the 2010 Licence Fee Settlement.
The BBC made a commitment as part of that deal to provide some funding for the government's local television policy.
In addition to news, sport and music, the station also promises coverage for arts, culture and religion.
Director of Programmes Chris Kerr said the station was keen to promote community involvement, adding: "We really want people to get involved and to make contributions to our programmes."
Bay TV, which has had an online presence since 2011, will also provide content for the BBC in the North West as part of the corporation's 2010 licence fee settlement.
A BBC spokeswoman said: "This is very different to the BBC's regional news service and will complement it rather than competing with, replicating or replacing it.
"Working with the local TV stations in this way will enable us to reach even further into local communities, enriching our local content and adding value for the licence fee payer."
