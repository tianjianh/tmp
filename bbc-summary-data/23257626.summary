Super fast shopping trolley man claims record speeds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Imagine a shopping trolley that moves as fast as a car - well here it is!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt McKeown from Plymouth, south-west England, has created a super trolley with a motor and special wheels.
And he's got it racing at 44 mph.
The current speed record is 42 mph, so Matt reckons his trolley could have set a new world record.
He says he'll contact Guinness World Records to see if it can be officially recognised.
But he's not content with that - Matt says he wants to improve his trolley to try and reach a speed of 60mph instead!
Check out the clip of it in action!
