[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors went into an early lead as Danny Hylton converted a penalty after Sid Nelson brought him down.
Sean Rigg hit back but the hosts finished with 10 men after Mark O'Brien's second yellow card.
Luton remain fifth, a point behind Stevenage while, Newport are six points behind Cheltenham, who are 22nd.
Newport boss Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales: "When we went down to 10 men I'd have bitten your hand off for a point.
"They're a good team. They've got pace and are strong with good forwards and I was glad Danny Hylton went off at half time.
"But apart from the first 15 minutes of the second half we were right in the game."
