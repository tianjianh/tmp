[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Frenchman Pierre Rolland ended a two-year wait for victory by winning the 17th stage of the Giro d'Italia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was the 30-year-old's first triumph since a stage win on the 2015 Vuelta a Castilla y Leon and his team's first grand tour stage for two years.
Race leader Tom Dumoulin, who lost time following an unexpected toilet stop on Tuesday, had no such problems again and retained a 31-second overall lead.
Britain's Adam Yates was 30th and is 11th overall with four stages left.

Rolland prevailed from an 18-man group who broke away 7.8km from the finish of the 219km stage from Tirano to Canazei.
Dumoulin crossed the finish line nearly eight minutes behind Rolland with the main peloton but retains possession of the pink jersey ahead of Colombian rival Nairo Quintana.
