[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A yellow "be aware" warning for ice has been issued for parts of Wales, with drivers urged to take care on the roads overnight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Met Office said wintery showers on Friday night could lead to ice forming as temperatures fall.
Up to 3cm (1.1in) of snow may fall on high ground and travel conditions could be "tricky", it added.
The warning is in place until 10:00 GMT on Saturday.
It covers Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Powys, Wrexham, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Neath Port Talbot, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Swansea.
