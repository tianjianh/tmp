[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reanne Evans will face former world champion Ken Doherty in the first round of qualifying as she bids to become the first woman to appear in the main stages of the World Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Englishwoman Evans, 29, is a 10-time ladies' champion.
Doherty, 45, won the tournament in 1997, but the world number 43 has not reached the third round since 2006.
The winner must make it through two more qualifying rounds to reach the main draw, which starts on 18 April.
The tournament has increased this year from 128 to 144 players. The top 16 seeds automatically qualify for the first round, with all non-seeded players starting in the first of three qualifying rounds which run from 8-15 April.
Evans received an invitation to the qualifying draw from snooker's governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).
Six-time world champion Steve Davis is also attempting to qualify. He faces Jamie Cope in the first round of qualifying.
Jimmy White, six times a runner-up at the Crucible, meets Thailand's James Wattana, while 2006 world champion Graeme Dott has been drawn against Mark Owens.
Defending champion Mark Selby is the top seed, with five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan seeded second - the two met in last year's final.
