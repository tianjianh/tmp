That result allowed Alloa to leapfrog Airdrie into second courtesy of their 2-0 triumph at Queen's Park, while East Fife moved into fourth spot with a 3-2 home victory against Brechin.
Stranraer and Peterhead served up a 3-3 cracker at Stair Park but they remain ninth and eighth respectively.
Stenhousemuir are still bottom of the pile despite a 1-1 draw at Albion.
The battle of the top two at the start of the day proved to be a mismatch as Sean Crighton sent Livi into a 34th-minute lead before Joe Gorman's own goal made it 2-0.
Danny Mullen added a third and former Airdrie kid Nicky Cadden finished off the scoring before Ryan Conroy was red-carded for the home side late on.
Greig Spence scored early for Alloa against Queen's Park and Jordan Kirkpatrick doubled their tally with five minutes remaining.
Kevin Smith's cracker gave East Fife the lead against Brechin and Chris Kane made it 2-0 before Andy Jackson replied. Willie Dyer squared it but a Chris Duggan spot-kick won it for the home side.
Brechin had Alan Trouten sent off before Nicki Paterson also saw red for East Fife.
Peterhead took the lead at Stranraer through Rory McAllister but goals from Ryan Thomson and William Gibson gave the Blues a 2-1 lead. McAllister nodded the leveller and Grant Anderson made it 3-2 but Stranraer earned a point thanks to Gibson's second of the match.
Michael Dunlop fired Albion Rovers ahead at home to Stenhousemuir but Mason Robertson earned the bottom side a point.
