German Shepherd Finn was injured early one October morning while protecting his handler from a suspected armed robber.
The seven-year-old fought for survival, helped every step of the way by his handler PC Dave Wardell.
BBC News looks back at how his recovery captured the hearts of thousands and inspired a petition calling on the government to re-think the laws surrounding injured police support animals.
