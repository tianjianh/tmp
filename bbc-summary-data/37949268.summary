AMs 'should not undermine' museum merger study, says Lord Elis-Thomas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AMs should not "undermine" work that could recommend a part merger of Cadw and National Museum Wales, independent AM Lord Elis-Thomas has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four options for the "Historic Wales" plan to join the services' commercial functions are being examined by a steering group.
The proposal has been criticised by some opposition AMs, including the peer's former party Plaid Cymru.
Plaid's Dai Lloyd said AMs were not undermining the group.
Industry figures have warned a merged body would affect the independence of the museum.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates has said fears over the Welsh Government's proposal were unfounded.
A report by business consultancy PWC suggested four possibilities. As well as a merger, a new charity, an executive agency and joint working were proposed.
Speaking to BBC Wales, Lord Elis-Thomas said the options had to be "properly discussed", with a working party having been appointed to look at the issue.
"My understanding is all the national institutions are now participating and I don't think it's for assembly members to try to undermine a process which is trying to prepare the ground for a more effective use of public resources," he added.
He said museums, galleries, national libraries and other national institutions were facing a reduction in public resource.
"If it makes sense to combine back offices and combine activity in a way appropriate and as agreed between the participating institutions, then that is something should be allowed to happen," he added.
The steering group is considering which commercial functions of the National Museum could be merged with Cadw, an arm of the Welsh Government responsible for historic monuments.
It may also consider merging some functions from the National Library and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales.
The group is made up of representatives from all the bodies and the Welsh Government. Whatever is picked would be part of a public consultation.
Dr Dai Lloyd, Plaid Cymru's spokesman for culture, has previously called the Historic Wales proposals "rushed and ill-thought".
The AM for South Wales West said his comments have been "reflecting what people were saying about this proposal".
He said he did not think AMs were "undermining the working group at all".
"These are people who are experts in the field. They will have very firm opinions themselves. They certainly are not going to be swayed by what assembly members are saying," he said.
Bethan Jenkins, chairwoman of the assembly culture committee which has taken evidence on Historic Wales, said: "I think its perfectly acceptable for assembly members to question and scrutinise this."
In a Senedd debate last Tuesday, Economy Secretary Mr Skates said that it was "wrong" to think he had a preferred option for the sector, having said in an interview: "We need to do more with our institutions to make them relevant on a daily basis to people's lives."
But UKIP's David Rowlands told the same session at the Senedd of his concerns over "yet another body" which may be viewed as a "quango".
The Welsh Conservatives' Suzy Davies has called for the merger plan to be "off the table", saying it had to be up to the individual institution to make the call over "when the integrity of heritage conservation and interpretation will rub up against commercial opportunities".
