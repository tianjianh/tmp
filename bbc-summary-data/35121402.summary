The 24-year-old, from Cardiff, became the first Welsh boxer to win a silver medal by reaching the welterweight final at London 2012.
Evans also won gold at the 2011 European Amateur Boxing Championships in Ankara.
"I reached the top as an amateur and I'm looking forward to doing the same as a pro," he said.
Evans' move into the professional ranks comes three months after Wales' most decorated amateur boxer, Andrew Selby, also gave up his unpaid status.
Both have signed with Bristol-based manager Chris Sanigar, who also represents IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby, and will be trained by Tony Borg.
"Signing Fred Evans was something I have wanted to do for a long time," said Sanigar.
"I've followed Fred throughout his amateur career and he always stood out. He has a style that suits the pro game and I believe that he can go a long way."
Evans is currently serving a two-year suspended prison sentence for unlawfully wounding friend Michael Wilson after they had been drinking at a Gloucestershire pub for "several hours".
He was refused accreditation to compete for Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games following checks by the Home Office and Games officials.
Evans added: "Signing with Chris and training with Tony [Borg] was always my first choice seeing the success of Lee Selby and other Welsh boxers."
