Time is running out for Bristol Rovers striker Matty Taylor to sign a new contract with the club, says chairman Steve Hamer.

The 26-year-old was Rovers' top scorer last season with 28 goals in all competitions, including two hat-tricks, as they won promotion to League One.
Of the first-team squad, 12 have signed new deals ahead of the 2016-17 season.
"I presume we will hear sooner rather than later. We've still not heard," Hamer told BBC Radio Bristol.
"The sands of time are running out for both him and us. We're getting close, wherever he's going to be.
"Hopefully he's with us but, if not, good luck to him and we wish him well for next season, wherever he is."
Speaking in May, Hamer said Rovers would have the chance to match any offers made by other clubs to Taylor, with the former Forest Green Rovers striker out of contract this summer.
