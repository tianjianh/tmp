David Cornell: Northampton Town sign former Oldham Athletic goalkeeper

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton Town have signed goalkeeper David Cornell on a two-year contract following his release by League One rivals Oldham Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old former Wales Under-21 international joined the Latics last summer after leaving Swansea.
He played 17 times for Oldham, but will now fight for the goalkeeper spot with Adam Smith, who helped the Cobblers finish top of League Two last term.
"It should be good competition," Cornell told BBC Radio Northampton.
"He had a fantastic season last year, but I'm happy enough to challenge anyone in these leagues."
As Cornell joins the Cobblers, goalkeeper Ryan Clarke has left for AFC Wimbledon after failing to make a league appearance last season.
