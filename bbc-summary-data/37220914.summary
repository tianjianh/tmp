Macheda, 25, joined Cardiff from Manchester United in May 2014 and scored six goals in 27 league games for the Bluebirds.
Cardiff head coach Paul Trollope had said Macheda was not part of his plans.
"We would like to thank Federico for his contribution and wish him the very best for his future," Cardiff said in a statement.
Macheda's departure comes after midfielder Kagisho Dikgacoi's contract with the club was also terminated by mutual agreement.
