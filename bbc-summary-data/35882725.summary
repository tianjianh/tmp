[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Bell found some form ahead of the new domestic season as his 66 helped the MCC to a four-wicket win over Yorkshire in the Champion County match.

The new Warwickshire captain, who has said he wants his place back in England's Test side, struck 10 fours in his 134-ball innings as the MCC chased down a target of 256 in Abu Dhabi.
Earlier, Yorkshire, who resumed on 239-7, were bowled out for 299.
Essex batsman Tom Westley also made 58 as the MCC reached 257-6.
Bell, who has 118 Test caps, was dropped by England for their winter tour of South Africa before being named Warwickshire skipper in January.
The 33-year-old, captaining the MCC side, looked in fine touch before he was dismissed by teenage spinner Karl Carver for the second time in the match when he skied him to Alex Lees at mid-off.
Bell's wicket left the MCC 199-5, still needing 57 for victory, but Warwickshire team-mate Rikki Clarke (33) and Ben Foakes (32 not out) helped them home.
The 2016 County Championship campaign gets under way on Sunday, 10 April, with Yorkshire's first game against Hampshire at Headingley starting on 17 April.
