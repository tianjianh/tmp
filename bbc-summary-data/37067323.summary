The visitors went ahead when Paul Gallagher shot on goal and Jermaine Beckford was on hand to poke it home.
Preston doubled their lead when Nedum Onuoha put the ball into his own net, while Anders Lindegaard blocked Conor Washington's shot at the other end.
Massimo Luongo fired just wide late on for the hosts as North End held on for their first points of 2016-17.
The defeat, QPR's first at home this season, was the first time they have lost against Preston North End since May 2009.
Prior to the match, Scottish Premiership side Rangers announced the signing of Joe Garner from North End, with the club saying they expect the deal to be completed over the weekend.
Preston, who lost their opening three league games for the first time since 1989-90, controlled much of the opening 60 minutes to seal their first points.
QPR head coach Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: "We looked second best and couldn't get going.
"You have to give Preston credit. They did well, put us on the back foot and we looked flat.
"As as a group, we expected more and wanted more but couldn't deliver. We didn't look like us. Individual errors cost us."
Preston manager Simon Grayson: "We've answered one or two critics from during the last few weeks. That will keep a few people quiet for a while.
"People do tend to get a bit jittery when you lose the first three games. The critics have been answered.
"I said before that I didn't think we were a million miles away. We were off the pace in the last three games but that was more like us."
