A university has withdrawn a poster which appeared to ridicule Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence after her nude pictures were leaked on the internet.

In a bid to promote password security, Strathclyde University produced a poster saying: "Bet Jennifer Lawrence wishes she'd used a StR0nG_Pas5w0Rd%."
The image attracted criticism on social media, with the Glasgow-based university accused of "victim blaming".
The university said the poster had been removed and should not have been made.
An image of the poster was tweeted on Monday by Billy McCauley who said: "Pretty shocking victim blaming here. Will you take it down?"
A short time later, Strathclyde University tweeted: "The posters are being removed now. They should not have produced and we are looking into how this happened."
A spokesman for the university later said: "The posters are in bad taste and have now been removed from campus. The sentiment expressed is not consistent with the values of this university."
Dozens of private pictures of Hunger Games actress Lawrence were released on the internet in September.
Other celebrities targeted in the leaks included Rihanna, Kate Upton, Selena Gomez and Kim Kardashian.
It is thought the photos were taken off the stars' iCloud accounts and were shared on other websites.
