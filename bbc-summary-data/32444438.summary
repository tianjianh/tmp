Computer equipment was seized from the 18-year-old's home address in Stourbridge for forensic examination.
He was held on suspicion of preparing for terrorist acts after West Midlands counter terrorism officers arrested him at an address in Lye.
The man, who was arrested on Thursday, was bailed until a date in July when he will return for further questioning.
West Midlands Police said they were "keen to stress there was no immediate threat to public safety".
