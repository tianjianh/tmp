[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hafsa Mossi was an MP in the East African parliament and a former BBC Swahili service journalist.
President Pierre Nkurunziza called it an assassination, and a vile and cowardly act.
There has been an increase in violence in Burundi since Mr Nkurunziza declared last year that he would run for a controversial third term.
The killing comes as the latest talks aimed at resolving the Burundi conflict hit a snag in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
Government officials rejected the presence of members of the opposition effectively stopping the resumption of the negotiations
