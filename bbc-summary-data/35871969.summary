Darren Sammy: Hampshire sign West Indies all-rounder for T20 Blast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Indies limited-overs captain Darren Sammy will join Hampshire for a large proportion of the T20 Blast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sammy, 32, who is currently playing in the World T20 in India, has previously played for Nottinghamshire and Glamorgan in the competition.
The St Lucian will be available for the south coast county from 2 June until his Caribbean Premier League commitments at the start of July.
"I'm really excited to have signed with Hampshire," Sammy said.
"Hampshire have had strong T20 results in the past which I'm hoping will continue this coming summer.
"They also have a rich West Indian history which I'm looking forward to adding to the best I can."
