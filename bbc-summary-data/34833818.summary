Rebecca May Cressey thought they were just going diving for her birthday, but Steven Purdiew had enlisted Skegness Aquarium staff to help him propose.
Miss Cressey saw a board asking "Will you marry me?" then put her thumbs up to say she would.
The couple, from Somercotes in Derbyshire, now plan to get married in a year or two.
Miss Cressey, who turned 23 on Monday, said: "I suspected something when I saw that my mum and dad were there because I knew they weren't supposed to be there and then I saw them through the glass window.
"I just wanted to cry but I thought I'd best not cry because I was concentrating too much on breathing you see, it's quite difficult."
Mr Purdiew, 30, thanked the aquarium staff for helping him propose on Saturday.
"The staff had a board made for us with a question on it because obviously you can't talk very well under the water," he said.
"I thought Rebecca would have said yes because I think she's been hinting for a long enough time."
Neither had scuba dived before, although Mr Purdiew previously rescued a 15-year-old boy from the River Derwent in Derby when he was 18.
Stacy Adams from Skegness Aquarium said: "We were all very excited for them and wish them 'best fishes' for the future."
