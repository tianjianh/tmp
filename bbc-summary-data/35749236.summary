Borussia Dortmund moved within five points of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich as Marco Reus and Shinji Kagawa saw off Mainz.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reus scored from Gonzalo Castro's fine pass on the half-hour and Kagawa added the second on 73 minutes.
Mainz goalkeeper Loris Karius made a string of impressive second-half saves to prevent more Dortmund goals.
Dortmund are unbeaten in 12 games, including nine in the league, since their defeat at Cologne in December.
But Bayern remain clear favourites for a fourth successive title after their 5-0 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday.
Dortmund's win was marred by the death of a supporter attending the match. Another fan had to be resuscitated following two separate incidents.
