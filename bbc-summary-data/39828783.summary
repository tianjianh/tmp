It definitely is baking with a difference!
The team at the Cherry Tree Bakery have been working with a choreographer for a special show at the Blackburn Festival of Making.
The moves of the dance are based around the actual moves they make when they are doing their work.
So the dance celebrates their work but also stops them getting bored on the job!
Watch this...
