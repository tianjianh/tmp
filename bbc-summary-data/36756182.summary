The 25-year-old from Glasgow took control after the interval when the players were tied at 2-2, resuming with a break of 96.
A tight final frame was settled when McGill cleared up after potting the last red.
The win lifts him from 29th to 18th in the world rankings.
Having never been beyond the last eight in a ranking event, McGill is Scotland's first new winner at this level in a decade.
He defeated former world champions Stuart Bingham and Shaun Murphy en route to the final.
