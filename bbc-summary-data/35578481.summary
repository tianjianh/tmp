While the new signing takes over limited-over captaincy, Cosgrove continues as championship skipper.
Director of cricket Andrew McDonald told BBC Radio Leicester: "Paul Horton [Championship] and Clint McKay [one-day] will support them in their respective roles of vice-captain.
"But I am looking for leadership throughout the playing group."
He added: "We had some fantastic candidates in the ranks and the most important thing we are stressing is that you don't need a title after your name to be a leader."

"While promotion from Division Two has to be the priority, this is an indication of the importance Leicestershire are attaching to the one-day competitions this season.
"In the last few months overseas players Clint McKay and Umar Akmal have shown they're right up there with the very best in the world in limited-overs cricket, and Mark Pettini captained Essex to success in the Friends Provident Trophy in 2008.
"Leicestershire will also be hoping that by taking some of the pressure off Mark Cosgrove in the shorter forms of the game, the South Australian will rediscover the sort of form that has seen him take attacks apart in the past. Last season he scored just 54 runs in five innings in the One-Day Cup, at an average of 10.80."
