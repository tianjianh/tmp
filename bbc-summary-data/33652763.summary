[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver died on an icy Norfolk road that had not been gritted because of a "mix-up" over changed routes, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The county council failed to grit a 4.33 mile (7km) stretch of the A1066 at Riddlesworth near Thetford for weeks.
Caroline Wooler, 27, from Thetford, swerved on the road early on 14 December and her car hit a tree stump.
Assistant coroner Johanna Thompson said in a narrative verdict she died of head injuries following a road accident.
Tracy Jessop, assistant director of highways at Norfolk County Council, said for efficiency reasons a section of the A1066 was moved from one gritting route to another.
This was to allow operations to be completed in three hours.
However the section failed to be put on the intended alternative route and was missed.
The last time it was gritted was on 29 October.
The inquest was told the road was white with ice on 14 December.
Evidence from the police said Ms Wooler's Peugeot 206 had skidded and turned 180 degrees, hitting several trees.
The driver's side was "considerably damaged" and Ms Wooler suffered a fatal head injury, dying a short time later.
Ms Jessop said after the inquest the county council apologised to Ms Wooler's family "unreservedly" and said the staff team was devastated.
"We will have to live with that. We have taken every step we can to prevent further loss of life," she said.
Ms Wooler's family declined to speak during or after the inquest.
