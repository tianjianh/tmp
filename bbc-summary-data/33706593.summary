Margaret Matthews gave evidence as the hearings looked at the final movements of Brian Matthews, who was 38.
The inquests also heard how Anthony Kelly, a former soldier, was left unattended for two minutes after being pulled from the terraces.
Ninety-six Liverpool fans died after crushing at the 1989 FA Cup match.
Mr Matthews was described by his sisters as "a big brother, a mentor and an inspiration".
He was a self-employed financial consultant and had been married to Mrs Matthews for more than 11 years.
At the hearing, Mrs Matthews was shown a photograph of the Leppings Lane terraces timed at 15:02 BST. Mr Matthews' head was visible among the other fans.
She said: "He looks as though he is suffering some kind of pain. If he's being squashed, he would be - you'd panic wouldn't you."
Mr Matthews, who had gone to the 15 April match in Sheffield with friends, was carried off the terraces at around 15:18.
A group of volunteer medics and police officers tried to resuscitate him on the pitch.
Anthony Kelly had joined the army at 18.
His mother, Betty Almond, said: "I miss him so much. Anthony was our only child. Hillsborough should never have happened."
Mr Kelly went to the match with friends on a coach that left Ellesmere Port. Michael Sullivan walked into the terraces with him.
In a statement, he said: "When we got to the end of the tunnel, that was when we came up against a wall of people.
"I think we moved slightly to the right at the end of the tunnel and pushed our way into the crowd."
Mr Sullivan said they made it on to the terracing by around 14:50.
He said that five minutes later he "became aware of the fact that the crowd was getting worse".
He added: "The pressure was building up on my chest and I began to get very short of breath.
"I looked at Anthony and I saw that he looked as if he had collapsed and passed out. My left arm was out but I could only move my fingers."
Mr Kelly was seen in footage timed at 15:31 lying on the pitch. Matthew Hill, a barrister representing the coroner, said the video showed he was unattended for the next two minutes.
At 15:33, a group of police officers, including Ian Cox, lifted Mr Kelly onto an advertising hoarding and carried him to the stadium's gymnasium.
Asked why he thought Mr Kelly was dead, Mr Cox said: "I would assume that I made a visual and possibly a physical assessment, but I can't say for certain."
He said that the officers left Mr Kelly outside the gymnasium, along with other casualties with their faces covered.
The inquests, held in Warrington, Cheshire, continue.
