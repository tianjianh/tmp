Both were expected to have played their final game for the club in the defeat at Crawley on 2 January.
But Glovers boss Darren Way has come to a further agreement with the Premier League club.
"Bournemouth are very happy and impressed with their development for such young players," said Way.
"They've played a massive role in our season so far. I've been very impressed with some of their outstanding performances. Both of them have shown unbelievable desire and enthusiasm to make this successful."
The re-signing of Whitfield, 20, and 19-year-old Butcher follows the New Year's arrival of young striker Jack Storer from Birmingham City.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old striker Tahvon Campbell's loan spell has ended and he has returned to his parent club West Bromwich Albion.
