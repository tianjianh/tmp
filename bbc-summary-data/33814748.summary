Persistent eruptions from Indonesia's Mount Raung continue to bring bad news for Bali-bound travellers.

Virgin Australia and Jetstar grounded flights again on Friday as forecasters warned westerly winds would send dangerous ash clouds over Denpasar.
The ash is expected to hang over the holiday island for the next couple of days.
Both airlines said passengers should not go to airports but instead monitor the situation online.
Flights in and out of Bali have been irregular since early July because of continued explosions from Mount Raung.
Virgin said in a statement the latest advice from its team of meteorologists and the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre "is that conditions remain unsuitable for operations into and out of Denpasar Airport today".
It has warned travellers currently in Bali not to travel to Denpasar Airport without a confirmed rebooked flight.
Virgin has grounded flights on Saturday too, while Jetstar has done the same on Saturday morning but will make a decision on the afternoon once there is more information.
