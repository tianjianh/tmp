Leicestershire are not looking to make any more new signings, despite securing a five-year naming rights sponsorship contract for the first time.

The deal with local firm Fischer Future Heat means the club's home will now be the Fischer County Ground, Grace Road.
But chief executive Wasim Khan told BBC Radio Leicester: "We will certainly not be in the market to sign more players.
"If there is the opportunity to look at any loan bowler signings during the summer then we would look to do that."
Leicestershire have signed experienced opener Paul Horton, Middlesex all-rounder Neil Dexter and Essex batsman Mark Pettini for the 2016 season.
Khan said the new sponsorship deal was "ground-breaking" for the county and a "great moment".
He added: "Not only does it bring in much-needed investment but we can really build something meaningful with a credible brand.
"It is very exciting times. We are heading in the right direction."
