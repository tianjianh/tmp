The last three winners are all English - Nick Abendanon, Steffon Armitage and Jonny Wilkinson.
Northampton's Wales wing George North, Toulon's Armitage, winner in 2014, and Racing 92's Dan Carter also feature.
Australia great George Smith and fellow Wasp Charles Piatau, Exeter number eight Thomas Waldrom and Leicester's Vereniki Goneva are the other nominees from the English Premiership.
Armitage's Toulon team-mate Guilhem Guirado and Racing 92's Argentine winger Juan Imhoff complete the list.
The winner will be announced during May's European finals weekend in Lyon.
Clermont Auvergne's Abendanon, who scored a try in a losing cause in the the 2015 European Champions Cup final, is the current holder of the award.
