Women's Super League One: Chelsea Ladies 1-1 Birmingham City Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea Ladies were denied the top spot in the WSL 1 table as they were held to a draw by Birmingham City Ladies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Freda Ayisi put the visitors in front just after half-time when she sent a low cross inside the far post.
The hosts were level just five minutes later as former Blues striker Eniola Aluko restored parity from close range.
Chelsea finished the game with 10 players after Katie Chapman was sent off for a second booking when she fouled Ayisi with three minutes left.
The result puts Chelsea one point behind leaders Manchester City in second in the WSL 1 table, while Birmingham City lie in fourth place.
Chelsea forward Eniola Aluko:
"We weren't ourselves in the first half going forward, and then we gave away a sloppy goal just after half-time.
"At the end of the day though, we got a point out of a game that we could have lost against a very difficult Birmingham side.
"Whenever we've gone behind this season we've always come back, and in the end we could have won today because we had a couple of good chances late on. "
Birmingham defender Kerys Harrop:
"We'd surprised them with our goal, but the way it came about was something we'd worked on and Freda took it really well.
"Unfortunately we then gave away a soft goal and that's unlike us; it was the first goal we've conceded in seven matches and we've given hardly any away all season.
"That's what we're good at; having the concentration and organisation at the back, so it was disappointing to concede the way we did."
