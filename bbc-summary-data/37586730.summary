Dan Jones: Grimsby defender joins Gateshead for a month

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grimsby Town have loaned defender Dan Jones to Gateshead for an initial month-long spell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Left-back Jones, 21, will provide cover in the absence of George Smith who was injured in the 1-0 win at Tranmere Rovers in midweek.
The ex-Hartlepool player almost joined the Tynesiders in the summer before agreeing a one-year deal with Grimsby.
He could make his debut for Gateshead against Dover Athletic in Saturday's National League game.
