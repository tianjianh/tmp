Adam Voges - Sir Donald Bradman comparisons are uncomfortable

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adam Voges said he was uncomfortable with comparisons to legendary Australia batsman Sir Donald Bradman, despite both having a Test average in the 90s.

His Australian team-mates called him "Sir Voges" after he took his average above Bradman's 99.94 before it settled on 97.46 when he was out for 239 in the first Test in New Zealand on Sunday.
"I'm happy it's back under 100, it was never going to stay there," said Voges.
New Zealand ended day three on 178-4 in their second innings, 201 runs behind.
Voges' second Test double century, which propelled Australia to 562 in their first innings, should have ended when he was bowled for seven by Doug Bracewell.
However, he was reprieved by a no-ball call, that was later shown to be a legitimate delivery by television replays.
"I thought I was out," said Voges. "But to have that bit of luck and then capitalise on the second opportunity, I'm very happy.
"It was a bad leave and I turned around and looked at the stumps, went to walk off and saw the umpire's arm out. It was a little bit of luck."
Voges' 364-ball knock, which featured three sixes and 30 boundaries, was finally ended when he was caught and bowled by Mark Craig, a record 614 runs since he was last out.
He has now scored 1,267 runs since making his debut last year at the age of 35 against the West Indies.
New Zealand openers Tom Latham and Martin Guptill put on 81 for the first wicket but both were deceived by well-flighted deliveries from off-spinner Nathan Lyon.
Guptill (45) was the first to fall, top-edging a delivery that was well caught by Mitchell Marsh, while Latham (63) hit a poor shot to Usman Khawaja at mid-off.
In between, Kane Williamson was restricted by Josh Hazlewood's disciplined bowling and he edged the Australian seamer to wicketkeeper Peter Nevill to depart for 22.
Captain Brendon McCullum was then given out leg before wicket to Marsh in the final over, a call that was upheld by the decision review system, to leave the Black Caps perilously placed.
