United Utilities lifted the boil water notice at about 21:00 on Tuesday.
The firm said the problem had been fixed and testing of the water had been completed.
Thousands of bottles of water were distributed to schools and nursing homes.
United Utilities released a statement to customers on its website which said: "We're very sorry for the time it has taken to get your water back to normal and we appreciate the frustration and inconvenience this will have caused."
Compensation of Â£20 would automatically be sent out to those affected, it added.
