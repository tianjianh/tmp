On 1 October, the woman reported a sexual assault which she said happened near Ashbourne Road in Derby.
Following an extensive investigation, police confirmed the attack had never taken place.
Det Ch Insp Sam Slack from Derbyshire Police said all reports of rape or assault were thoroughly investigated by the force.
"It is always disappointing when a large amount of police time is wasted on reports such as this," said Det Ch Insp Slack.
"But this case should not deter anyone from reporting any type of offence immediately so that full inquiries can be made."
