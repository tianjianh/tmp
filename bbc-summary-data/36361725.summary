Reality Check verdict: In the financial years 2009-16, 7,436 people were extradited from the UK to another EU country. Of these, 292 were UK nationals. Meanwhile, 897 people were extradited to the UK. Of these, 352 were EU nationals.
If the suspect is identified, they can then be arrested by a local police force.
In the financial years 2009-16, 10,532 people wanted by another EU state were arrested in the UK.
Of these, 479 were UK nationals, although more may have been permanent UK residents.
