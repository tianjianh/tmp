Salford led by 16 points at half-time after tries from Niall Evalds, Kris Welham and Ben Murdoch-Masila.
Evalds latched on to Michael Dobson's grubber kick for his second try, before Greg Johnson crossed for the visitors.
Wigan hit back with tries from Tom Davies, Ryan Sutton and Lewis Tierney, but Salford's defence held firm in the final ten minutes to secure the win.
Gareth O'Brien kicked a drop-goal and Dobson added another penalty late on as the hosts secured only their sixth victory over the Cherry and Whites in 41 Super League meetings.
The hosts had beaten Salford in the past four meetings, but they were unable to call on a number of senior players due to injury, while captain Sean O'Loughlin was absent on international duty with England.
The result takes Ian Watson's side up to second in the table after 13 games, only two points behind leaders Castleford.
Shaun Wane's Wigan stay fifth, having lost their last two games by a combined total of 85 points.
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane told BBC Radio Manchester:
"I'm very happy with some of things we did today. In the second half I thought we gave ourselves a chance to win the game.
"There were a couple of things that happened to us where if we had just got a try at a crucial time and not come up with a poor decision it would have been tough on Salford to win that game.
"We're doing it tough at the minute, but the spirit's really good and the players understand we're not far off."
Salford head coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It's great for our group as a squad, because to be fair we were down to the bare bones as well and we don't have the biggest of squads.
"It just goes to show that the guys who were in there prepared the right way and trained the right way, and they got the rewards for what they've done today.
"We speak as a club about taking it every week and knowing that we can beat teams like this, so it's about us turning up with the right attitude, training the right way for the games in front of us.
"So it's not a big surprise for us that we can do it, it's just making sure we're consistent."
