Swansea took the lead as John Terry turned a low cross into his own net but Costa equalised just before half-time.

Chelsea's dominance was rewarded when Costa converted a Cesc Fabregas pass.
The Spain striker guided a low Ramires shot past Lukasz Fabianski and Loic Remy scored his first Blues goal before Jonjo Shelvey's late consolation.
As Chelsea opened up a three-point gap at the top of the table, summer signings Costa and Fabregas offered further evidence of the extra edge they have added to a team that finished third last season.
Costa, who passed a late fitness test on a hamstring injury suffered on international duty with Spain, departed to a standing ovation after scoring his seventh goal in four games for the Blues.
Fabregas now has six assists, a tally only Eden Hazard exceeded in the whole of Chelsea's 2013-14 campaign.
Swansea had started the match as the only other team in the league with an unblemished record and for much of the first half they were the better side.
They carved out an early opening as Wayne Routledge found space in the area but could not control his volley.
The Welsh team took a surprise lead via a slick passing move. Ki Sung-Yeung opened up the Chelsea defence with a slide-rule pass and left-back Neil Taylor's low cross was diverted by Terry into his own net.
Far from awakening Chelsea, the goal only served to increase Swansea's hunger.
Bafetimbi Gomis, making his first start for the club in attack, twice blasted wide before Routledge curled a shot from the corner of the penalty area narrowly wide.
Chelsea improved as the half wore on and an equaliser arrived on the stroke of half-time when Costa fought off his marker to meet a Fabregas corner and power home his header.
The Blues began the second period on the front foot and it was no surprise to see their dominance rewarded with a second goal.
Fabregas was again the provider, exchanging passes with Branislav Ivanovic on the left before cutting back for Costa to calmly slot in.

Swansea missed a clear chance to equalise when Gomis - clean through on goal - fluffed his attempted chip over Thibault Courtois.
Grateful for the let-off, Chelsea soon made sure of the points.
Costa showed his goalscoring instincts to pounce on Ramires's scuffed effort, before his replacement Remy swept home a square pass from Oscar.
Shelvey's late strike from the edge of the area reduced the deficit, but by then the Swans were well beaten.
Swansea manager Garry Monk: "It was a very good first half hour. Some of the football was the best we've played this season. I think it just showed the world-class quality they have and in the second-half it took its toll a bit. Their power and strength was too much.
"When you play the top teams you gauge where you are at and what you need to work on. But in terms of effort and commitment we were very good."
