Llyn Maelog lake on Anglesey given village green status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 50-acre lake at Llanfaelog on Anglesey has been given the unusual status of a 'village green'.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Llanfaelog Community Council said it believed Llyn Maelog near Rhosneigr was the first lake to attain the status.
Anglesey Council's legal experts decided there was no legal problem with the new designation at the lake, which is already a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).
County councillors backed the move in a meeting on Wednesday.
Richard Dew, the community council clerk, said it had taken a number of years to reach this stage.
"It goes back a few years when the council looked at improving facilities, for locals and visitors, popular for sailing, boating, fishing as well as wildlife," he said.
"We found there was no registered owner, so the way forward was to register it as a village green."
Mr Dew said he understood that Llyn Maelog was the first lake in Wales to attain village green status.
"But it is a very important lake, it has triple SI status, and we are  aware of the importance from a wildlife view as well," he added.
Last year, Sherwood Lake in Tunbridge Wells, Kent was registered as a village green.
Kate Ashbrook, general secretary of the open spaces society said: "Green spaces and open water are of immense importance to the public, as places of recreation and refreshment, where we can enjoy nature in peace and quiet."
