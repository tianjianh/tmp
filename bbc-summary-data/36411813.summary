Auctioned Ming dynasty £2m cup dismissed as 'dusty old pot'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rare Chinese cup from the Ming dynasty valued at £2m was dismissed as one of many "dusty old pots" kept in an unlocked university cabinet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cup, thought to have been made for an emperor in 1425, was among a collection of antiques discovered by chance at Staffordshire University.
The collection of more than 270 pieces was donated to the university during World War Two and then forgotten.
The cup will be auctioned in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
Little is known about the collector of the rare Chinese artefacts other than his name was Ernest Thornhill and he was a chemist in London.
He donated his collection to protect it from being bombed during the war.
Prof Flavia Swann said the antiques were rediscovered last year after a chance conversation with the head of the Ceramic Technology Department.
It was after they said: "I've got some dusty old pots cluttering up my corridor, would you like to have a look?"
She said: "They were just in unlocked cabinets - sliding doors that when you slide them back they literally fell out to the floor.
"Nothing broke fortunately," she added.
The cup is being auctioned in Hong Kong and is billed to fetch at least £2m. The proceeds will be used to fund a new national ceramics centre based in Staffordshire.
The remaining collection is stored at a secret location in Wolverhampton.
