Oxford United: Chairman Darryl Eales hopes for 'quick' Kassam Stadium sale deal

Oxford United chairman Darryl Eales has urged former owner Firoz Kassam to push through a deal "within weeks" to sell the League One club's Kassam Stadium.

Supporters' Group OxVox confirmed on Saturday talks had begun with Mr Kassam to buy the 12,500-seater stadium.
"If you want to do a deal and there's a willing buyer and willing seller, it shouldn't take more than 10 to 12 weeks," Eales told BBC Radio Oxford.
OxVox want the stadium to become a community-owned asset.
Kassam still owns the stadium which bears his name, despite selling the football club for Â£2m in 2006.
Eales has made three bids of his own to buy the ground, which has been Oxford United's home ground since 2001, with two of them rejected by Kassam and the third "still on the table".
"Firoz made it clear he didn't want to sell to an individual and that's his prerogative," Eales added.
"I've said consistently since I've owned the club that this isn't a property play for me.
"This is about building sustainable success for Oxford United both on and off the pitch for the community."
