Towell, 25, suffered a fifth-round loss to Dale Evans in a St Andrews Sporting Club fight and was rushed to the city's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
Club officials and the boxer's family are at his bedside.
"All of our thoughts and prayers are with Mike and the Towell family at this very difficult time," said a spokesman.
Towell was knocked down in the first round and took a standing count of eight before recovering to dominate in the next two rounds.
However, Evans put the previously unbeaten Scot on the canvas again in the fifth round and he was given another standing count by referee Victor Loughlin, who was also in charge of the British middleweight title fight in March between Chris Eubank and Nick Blackwell, which ended the latter's career after he suffered a bleed on the skull when he was stopped in 10 rounds.
Towell continued briefly before Loughlin stopped the fight. He received treatment in the ring from the medical team and was given oxygen before being taken to the ambulance on a stretcher.
Both fighters made the pre-fight weight limit.
The St Andrews Sporting Club statement continued: "Mike Towell is in a critical condition in Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth hospital after his fifth-round defeat in the British welterweight title eliminator with Dale Evans at the club last night.
"Club director Iain Wilson and Mike's manager, Tommy Gilmour, travelled with him in the ambulance after the fight and have been at his bedside through the night with his family.
"We took the immediate decision to suspend last night's show in the wake of Mike's contest."
Evans, from Carmarthen, wrote on his Twitter account on Thursday night that his "celebrations were on hold".
In a statement released through the St Andrews Sporting Club on Friday, Evans said he was "devastated".
"The ingredients were there for an entertaining fight and it was that. We are both punchers and so sadly for Mike he came out the wrong side.
"He is such a fantastic fighter, you are happy to win but all I wanted to do was get the victory. Not this.
"I never wanted to see my opponent being stretchered out of the ring. Who would ever want that sight? That was so hard for his family and my heart goes out to them.
"It was a fantastic atmosphere and I got applauded out after all that happened, and that sums up the knowledge of the fans at the St Andrews Sporting Club and the Scottish people.
"The aftermath of the fight is so hard to take in but I just want people to know that every thought I have today is with Mike Towell's family.
"He is a true warrior who has brought such excitement to Scottish boxing."
