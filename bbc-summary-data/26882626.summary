The Care Inspectorate gave Nithsdale House in Pollokshields, Glasgow, a score of one - the lowest possible - across three areas examined.
Weaknesses at Drumpellier Lodge in the city's Bargeddie area were also found. The home received the second lowest rating in three areas examined.
The inspections took place in February.
An unannounced inspection visit was carried out at Nithsdale House, in Shields Road, Pollokshields, on 21 February.
The care home, which is run by Lotus Senior Living Ltd, was given a score of one (unsatisfactory) for its quality of care and support; its quality of environment and its quality of staffing.
The home's quality of management and leadership received the second lowest score of two (weak).
Inspectors also noted that there had been "very little progress" following an earlier inspection which had already highlighted concerns.
A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said: "We continue to have serious concerns about the quality of care being provided to residents at this service.
"Whilst we noted some improvement in some areas following a previous inspection, significant concerns remain over the service's performance in relation to ensuring the health and wellbeing of residents."
The spokesman said inspectors had "observed poor practice in relation to administering medication".
He added: "We have informed the service of the improvements which it must make to ensure that residents' needs are met and their rights respected.
"We will continue to work with them to ensure they improve, but unless we see evidence of significant improvement, we will not hesitate to take further action."
An unannounced inspection visit was carried out at Drumpellier Lodge, Coatbridge Road, Bargeddie, on 6 February.
The care home, which is run by Clancare Ltd, was given a score of two (weak) for its quality of care and support; its quality of management and leadership and its quality of staffing.Inspectors found that 10 requirements for improvement, made at a previous inspection, were not met.
A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said: "We continue to have concerns about the quality of care and support being provided at this service and are working closely with them to ensure they meet the standards we expect.
"We have told the service the areas it must take urgent action on to improve.
"If we are not satisfied that improvement is being made we will not hesitate to take further action."
