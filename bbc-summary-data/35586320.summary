[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cost impact of storms on Scottish Borders outlined

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Borders councillors have been told the financial impact of a succession of severe winter storms on the region.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Storms Desmond, Eva, Frank and Gertrude all caused major issues in the area, as did a severe but unnamed storm on 27 January.
Hawick, Jedburgh, Newcastleton and Peebles were hit by severe flooding.
The full cost of repairing all the damage has yet to be calculated but the council will get support under the Bellwin Scheme to deal with it.
However, the local authority will have to come up with 0.2% of their net revenue budget as a contribution - which translates to Â£508,000.
A report to members of the council's executive committee outlined the 240 pieces of work - 114 classed as major - which will have to be undertaken to put things right.
It does not include further works which might be necessary once bridges are examined below the water level.
