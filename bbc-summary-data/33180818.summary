[SN]TITLE[SN]
Results of Commons committee chairmen elections due

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Results of the elections for House of Commons select committee chairmen are to be announced shortly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twelve of the 27 committee chairmen have already been elected unopposed.
But MPs standing for the remaining positions faced a secret ballot of colleagues on Wednesday, with the outcome to be announced on the floor of the Commons at 10:30 BST.
The roles have been divided up between the political parties based on the results of the general election.
Chairmen are elected using an "alternative vote" system, under which MPs rank their favourites in order of preference, with the first to get more than 50% of votes going through.
Some, like Public Accounts and Backbench Business, are reserved to the Opposition, but the rest are parcelled out in proportion to the parties' strength.
With the Conservatives now running a majority government, they take on the chairmanship of the Justice Committee, previously held by Lib Dem veteran Sir Alan Beith.
Meanwhile, the SNP - which is now the third largest party in the Commons - has been handed the Scottish Affairs and Energy and Climate Change.
Committee chairmen receive extra pay on top of their MP's salaries for doing the job.
Here is the list of the committee chairmen who have been re-elected unopposed:
