[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lancelot Neen jailed for Workington ear-bite attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who carried out a "shocking and deliberate" attack on a teenager in which part of his ear was bitten off, has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lancelot Neen was said to have been "very drunk" when he launched himself at the 16-year-old in Workington's Vinnies bar on 29 December.
Carlisle Crown Court was shown CCTV  of the moment Neen, 40, leapt at the youth and bit his ear.
Neen, of Greymouth, near Cockermouth, was jailed for five-and-a-half years.
The court heard a combination of the bite and the innocent intervention of a bystander who pulled Neen away, resulted in part of the ear being completely severed.
The teenager is now awaiting plastic surgery, the court was told.
He told the jury Neen threatened initially to bite his nose off during an animated exchange.
In evidence Neen admitted having little recollection of the incident and conceded his conduct was "disgraceful".
Neen admitted causing the victim grievous bodily harm, but denied a more serious charge of grievous bodily harm with intent.
The jury found him unanimously guilty.
Judge Barbara Forrester said the victim's life had been "significantly affected" by the attack.
