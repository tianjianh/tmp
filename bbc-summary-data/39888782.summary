If elected, it says it would introduce an environmental act to safeguard thousands of EU laws that will disappear when Britain leaves the bloc.
Co-leader Caroline Lucas said the party would also introduce locally owned energy firms and end plastic waste.
Launching its manifesto, she said the Green Party was the only one to put the environment at the heart of policies.
Stressing that the Greens were "different", she said: "We know that our prosperity depends on the natural world - it's the ultimate source of everything we make and use from food and materials to the sinks for our waste.
"Even a digital economy is hugely dependent on raw earth materials and huge amounts of energy.
"Building a successful economy is not at odds with protecting our environment - it's absolutely impossible to build a thriving economy without protecting our environment."

Ms Lucas added: "The environment has been wilfully ignored by the political mainstream and our climate and our countryside will pay the price of an environment-free election.
"With 2016 the hottest year on record, and a climate-denier in the White House, the need for bold and dynamic action on climate change has never been more urgent."
