The singer, famous for her hits "I'm Every Woman", "I Feel for You" and "Ain't Nobody", will be performing at the Kelvingrove Bandstand on Sunday 4 June.
She will be supported Soul II Soul frontman Jazzie B, who will play an exclusive DJ set.
Crazy P and Glasgow dance duo Harri & The Revenge are also on the bill.
Festival organiser Brian Traynor said: "Chaka Khan is a true legend, so we're delighted to have her open this year's West End Festival at one of the city's most iconic venues.
"I have no doubt this will be a sell-out event, so I'd encourage people to get in fast to ensure they don't miss out on what's going to be something quite special."
Chaka Khan has won 10 Grammys and sold millions of records over the past five decades.
