City failed to reach the last 16 after they lost 3-1 to Barcelona.
They are also six points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea.
"I think Pellegrini's time will be up," said Savage. "Would Diego Simeone leave Atletico Madrid or Carlo Ancelotti leave Real Madrid? That's the kind of manager I would look at for City."
Previous manager Roberto Mancini led City to their first league title in 44 years when they triumphed in the 2011-12 season, but the Italian was sacked at the end of the next season following a trophyless campaign, before Pellegrini's appointment.
However, goalkeeper Joe Hart defended his boss.
"We back our manager," said the England international. "He is a great manager and brought us two trophies last year."
Pellegrini won the Premier League and the League Cup last season, his first in charge at Etihad Stadium.
But after losing to Championship side Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and being beaten for a second successive season by Barcelona in the Champions League last 16, Savage thinks the Chilean is under threat.
He also believes the City squad is in need of a shake-up.
The former Premier League midfielder told BBC Radio 5 live: "I think City have got to make some drastic changes.
"Vincent Kompany has been the best defender for the last three years and needs a regular partner.
"Would you get rid of Kompany and have a completely fresh start? I don't know. He needs to get his head right. His performances have been so poor by his standards.
"Yaya Toure has been taken off in consecutive games. What's his future?"
Chris Waddle agreed with Savage that the squad needed an overhaul, claiming: "Sergio Aguero is a threat but City are a team of plodders."
The former England winger added that City should sign eight players and ditch everyone from the current squad bar Aguero, Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, David Silva and Yaya Toure if they wanted to be a "serious contender" in the Champions League.
Asked if he would make changes in the summer, Pellegrini said: "We will see about that in the right moment."
Despite being the best-paid team in football, City have not made it past the last-16 stage of the Champions League during the four years they have competed in the competition.
But Pellegrini said his side had been hampered by Financial Fair Play (FFP) restrictions as well as coming up against "the best team in the world" in Barcelona in each of the last two seasons.
City were fined £49m - £32m of which was suspended - and were only able name a 21-man Champions League squad this season for breaching FFP rules.
"Maybe it is not the moment to explain different things," Pellegrini added. "It's important that we win things every year.
"Last season was a very good season. This year, we have important restrictions, especially in bringing in important players. That's why maybe we didn't refresh our squad so good as the other English teams. At the end of season, we will see what the future is."
Of his side's Premier League challenge, Pellegrini said: "We must never give up. It's difficult because we are six points behind, but we have nine games left. I hope that we will recover and we will focus on the league."
