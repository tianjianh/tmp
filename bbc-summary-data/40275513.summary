Eusebio di Francesco, who won the Italian title with Roma as a midfielder, has been made head coach of the club on a two-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 47-year-old Italian replaces Luciano Spalletti, who resigned at the end of the season and has since been appointed Inter Milan boss.
"It was like coming home after many years," said Di Francesco, who helped Roma win Serie A in 2000-01.
"There's a desire to achieve something big and build a team that entertains."
Di Francesco led Sassuolo to promotion to Serie A in 2013 and steered them to 12th spot in 2016-17.
Roma, who have signed Mexico defender Hector Moreno from PSV Eindhoven, finished runners-up last season and will play in the Champions League in 2017-18.
