Marie-Ange Koutou, 42, is a paediatric nurse's assistant in the Medecins Sans Frontiers Hospital in Kabo, a remote rural village in the north of the Central African Republic.
Kabo is one of the worst three places in the world for child deaths. But the killing is not done by bombs and bullets, it's by malnutrition and malaria as a direct result of decades of civil war.
"People cannot walk around as they would like. When you walk you are afraid," she told the BBC.
