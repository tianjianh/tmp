The 28-year-old from County Louth can also be deployed in a midfield role.
"He is a talented player and a winner, with lots of experience from his time with Dundalk, Sligo Rovers and Cork City," said Blues manager David Healy.
"He's won the league and cup with Sligo, so he will bring a winning mentality to our squad and increase the competition levels," he added.
"I'm absolutely delighted to be joining Linfield. I only spoke to one club and that was Linfield and I'm delighted that we sorted a deal," Gaynor told the Linfield FC website.
"I met the manager a couple of weeks ago - I like the club and obviously the manager had a big influence on me coming here.
"I've signed for 18 months, it's a good commitment and hopefully we can get closer to the top of the table and push for honours again.
"I think 9 January is the first game I can play so hopefully I can get up to full fitness by then and be match sharp."
Linfield lie third in the Irish Premiership table, 11 points behind leaders Crusaders.
