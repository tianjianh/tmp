Chris Christie: No evidence linking governor to 'Bridgegate'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Jersey lawmakers have found no evidence linking Governor Chris Christie to politically-motivated lane closures on a busy bridge to New York.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Christie, a front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential ticket, has long maintained his own innocence.
The four-day traffic jam was caused when workers closed off two local lanes on to George Washington Bridge, ostensibly to conduct a traffic study.
Previously, an internal investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing.
The matter is still subject to a federal investigation.
Investigators for both reports did not have access to key witnesses who may have held crucial evidence.
The lawyer for the special joint legislative committee, Reid Schar, found no conclusive evidence that Christie was aware of the lane closures.
But he said two former Christie aides acted with "perceived impunity" and with little regard for public safety when they ordered the lanes closed.
It is not clear if or when lawmakers will have greater access to evidence and more findings.
