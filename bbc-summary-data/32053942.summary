The man, who was wearing a black motorcycle helmet, walked into Genting Casino, Luton, at about 01:20 GMT on 10 March.
He threatened a member of staff and ordered them to hand over a large amount of money.
Det Con Rachel Lydon said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the member of staff who was in genuine fear for their life."
The man put the undisclosed amount of money into a black rucksack which had white flecks of paint on it before escaping on a motorbike.
Bedfordshire Police said he was "slim" and was wearing dark clothing and black gloves with thick orange stripes across the knuckles.
