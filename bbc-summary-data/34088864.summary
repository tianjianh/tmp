Homes plan for Swansea City's former Vetch Field

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for up to 30 one-bedroom sheltered housing apartments have been drawn up for Swansea City FC's former Vetch Field home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwalia Housing is behind the plans which have been submitted to Swansea council and forms part of the Vetch Masterplan.
It would be built off William Street where the turnstiles and part of the old North Bank once stood.
If approved, the homes would replace Gwalia's homes in the city centre.
