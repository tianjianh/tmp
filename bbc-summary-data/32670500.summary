[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conal Corbett, from Flax Street, Belfast faces three charges.
He has been charged with collecting documents and possession of articles likely to be of use to terrorists.
A controlled explosion was carried out on the device at the Crumlin Road junction with Brompton Park last Friday, 1 May.
Appearing in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Saturday, it was alleged that on 27 April, Mr Corbett had a mobile phone and top up voucher "in circumstances which gave rise to the suspicion that the possession was for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism".
The teenager was also charged with possessing a hand written note about a rifle and ammunition.
A police officer told the court he believed Mr Corbett was a "violent man" who "posed a risk to the public".
The judge refused an application for bail and remanded the teenager to a young offenders centre.
