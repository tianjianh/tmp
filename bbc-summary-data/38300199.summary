Author Peter Seddon has written books about Steve Bloomer and said: "He was the first of a breed that we are now familiar with - that of the superstar footballer.
"He was the first to play for money and he became a celebrity.
"He was football's first superstar and England's first popular footballing hero and like Beckham or Rooney, he was always the guy that popped up with the winning goal.
"He was the best known footballer in the country and so in the world because the game hadn't developed in many other countries. So he was more like Ronaldo or Messi if you want a modern equivalent.
"He was a household name - mention Steve Bloomer to anybody in the 1890s and they would instantly recognise him."
