The mother of a girl who suffered 86% scald burns after falling into a hot bath when she was a baby says it is a "miracle" her daughter is still alive.

Tilly Sawford, 9, from Nottingham, has undergone about 500 operations and had a leg amputated following the accident when she was just 15 months old.
Emma Sawford said Tilly was given a 5% chance of survival after suffering extensive injuries.
The pair met the prime minister after Tilly received a bravery award.
Mrs Sawford said the day the accident happened there had been a fault with her home's boiler which meant the water was scalding hot within seconds.
She said while she was out of the room Tilly's brother turned the bath tap on, because he couldn't reach the sink tap, and left it running.
Not long after Tilly leaned over the bath and fell in.
"She was standing in the bath with no skin on," said Mrs Sawford.
"Her eyes rolled at the back of her head, I thought we'd lost her there and then."
Mrs Sawford and her partner were told to expect the worst but amazingly Tilly survived.
Ciaran O'Boyle, a consultant plastic surgeon from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, told the BBC: "She had burns to 86% of her total body surface.
"At the time no child of that age had survived so severe an injury."
Emma Sawford said: "It has been hard in the past few years seeing her go through so much pain.
"She will go into the anaesthetic room and she will be laughing with the surgeons - she loves the sleeping gas!"
Tilly won Child of Courage at the Pride of Britain Awards and on Tuesday went to Number 10 to meet Prime Minister Theresa May.
