Grimsby defender Danny Collins says the club have yet to offer him a deal for next season.

The former Wales international was told in January that he was part of manager Marcus Bignot's future plans but has not heard anything since.
"When I extended, the gaffer said he wanted me here next season as well," Collins, 36, told BBC Radio Humberside.
"But I've not signed anything as such. There's one or two others in the same boat."
Collins, whose career has included spells at Sunderland, Stoke, Ipswich, West Ham and Nottingham Forest, joined Grimsby last summer after leaving Rotherham.
He has played 30 times in League Two this season, scoring his only goal in a 3-0 win at Plymouth in November.
The veteran centre-back said he would discuss his future whenever the club were ready.
"I'll just play as many games as I can between now and the end of the season and take it from there," Collins said.
"I've enjoyed it. I've played week in, week out, which is what you want as a footballer."
