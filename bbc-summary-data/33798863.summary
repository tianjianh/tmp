[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The public could have to deal with "low level incidents" following potential police budget cuts, the chief constable of Thames Valley Police has said.

Francis Habgood expressed concern over reductions to the government grant to police forces, following mooted public sector cuts of up to 40%.
He pointed to success in dealing with rural crime through landowners carrying out their own patrols.
The chief constable insisted such measures were "not vigilantism".
In July chancellor George Osborne launched his spending review with a call for Â£20bn cuts to Whitehall budgets.
Each unprotected department has been asked to come up with savings plans of 25% and 40% of their budget.
Speaking on BBC Radio Oxford, Mr Habgood said: "Consumers of public services have become used to the public sector stepping in - that can no longer continue if we're talking about those levels of cuts.
"For policing, we'd encourage the public to actually take more responsibility for dealing with some of those lower level incidents.
"And I would get really worried if we do get to that situation where all we can provide is that emergency response and not deal with some of those local problems."
He said the force had already adopted the approach in dealing with rural crime through the Country Watch crime prevention campaign.
"What the rural community are doing is carrying out their own patrols in certain areas - they are sharing information with us and taking steps in terms of crime prevention.
"I'm not asking people to become heroes in difficult circumstances, but we all have a responsibility to do what we can which is reasonable within the circumstances."
Mr Habgood's interview follows comments from Manchester's chief constable about the cost of dealing with missing people and new Police Chiefs Council head Sara Thornton encouraging a public debate over police priorities.
