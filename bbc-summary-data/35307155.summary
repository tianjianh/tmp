"I think it was a missed opportunity for us as we had a lot of possession, missed some chances and conceded two poor goals.
"There were more chances to be had but that final pass, final bit of delivery we couldn't quite change advantage of.
"At 2-2 I still fancied us but I don't want to take anything away from Guiseley. I spoke well of them before and you can see they try and pass the ball."
