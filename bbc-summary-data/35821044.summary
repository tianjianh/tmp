Thirty-eight dogs have been rescued from a semi-detached house during a raid by police and the RSPCA.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The animals were seized from the house near Royston, Hertfordshire, on Tuesday morning.
Police said neighbours had contacted them with concerns for the welfare of the dogs. The RSPCA could not comment on the conditions inside the house as an investigation is under way.
Officers said the owners were co-operating with their enquiries.
Hertfordshire police, a police dog unit, RSPCA inspectors and a vet were all involved in the rescue operation.

There were a number of different breeds living at the Therfield property but the animal charity could not comment on the dogs' health until their investigation has been completed.
However, RSPCA inspector Jayne Bashford said they took "allegations of animal suffering and neglect very seriously".
All 38 dogs were checked by a vet and taken to boarding kennels.
The owners will meet the RSPCA for an interview later this week.
