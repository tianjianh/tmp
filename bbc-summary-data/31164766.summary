Government says 'no need' to ban all ticket re-sales

Ticket resale laws are not going to change despite pressure from Iron Maiden and Stewart Lee.

It's after the comedian put on extra shows during his tour to help fans avoid secondary ticketing websites.
"There is a small minority of people who set out to exploit the high demand for popular events," a government spokesman told Newsbeat.
But the official line is that while buyers must be protected, people should have a way of selling unwanted tickets.
The campaign Put Fans First is trying to get the government to change how sites like viagogo and StubHub work.
Tickets to sold-out gigs and sporting events are usually still available to buy on similar sites but often at a much higher price.
The campaign group doesn't want to ban them but says it wants to make the process more transparent.
For example, they want resellers to have a say about who they've bought the ticket from and what its face value is.
Put Fans First is being supported by metal band Iron Maiden and British comedian Stewart Lee.
Writing on his website earlier this week the stand-up claimed that tickets for some of his shows were 400% more expensive on re-sale sites.
He said: "I oppose [this practice] because I want my shows to be accessible to all, so that everyone can come and hate them as equals, and I cut corners to keep tickets as cheap as venues will allow me to make them.
"Artists shouldn't have to [see] their tickets sold at higher rates than they want them to be sold at. It is wrong.
"Incidentally, I am adding more dates to some of the sold-out shows so there should be no need to buy over the odds tickets."
In response to his comments viagogo said: "There are a handful of tickets on viagogo to each of Stewart Lee's shows, at a range of prices starting from Â£60.
"This will be good news to anyone who missed out at the box office and wants a guaranteed ticket, instead of taking their chances outside the venue."
A spokesperson for StubHub has told Newsbeat: "StubHub is an open marketplace and does not price tickets to any event."
"Surveys show that UK customers overwhelmingly support the right to resell spare tickets of their choice and theirs is the only voice that should matter."
The comedian also criticised Culture Secretary Sajid Javid who doesn't support the campaign to change the law.
"The government takes consumer protection very seriously," the spokesman said.
"We know that there is a small minority of people who set out to exploit the high demand for popular sporting and music events.
"However, the answer is not to ban all ticket re-sales.
"We want to strike the right balance between protecting consumers and allowing them to sell on tickets that they are no longer able to use."
