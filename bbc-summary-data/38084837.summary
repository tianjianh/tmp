Helsingborgs' 23-year stay in Allsvenskan came to an end on Sunday when they lost 2-1 to Halmstads.
Larsson's 19-year-old son Jordan, a striker for Helsingborgs, was assaulted by masked fans after the final whistle.
Fans also attempted to confront Henrik Larsson, 45.
The former Sweden forward, who also played for Feyenoord, Barcelona and Manchester United, had been head coach of the team since January 2015.
"Myself, the board, Henrik Larsson and the rest of the leadership team, together with the players, in solidarity bear the responsibility for this relegation," club director Mats-Ola Schulze said in a statement.
"I, together with the board, want to thank Henrik for the comprehensive restructuring that has been done in the football organisation during 2015 and 2016," he added.
