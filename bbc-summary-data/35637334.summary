[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 1-1 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two leaders Northampton Town were held to a second successive draw at home to AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cobblers, whose 10-game winning run came to an end with a 0-0 stalemate at Hartlepool on Saturday, still saw their advantage at the top extended to 11 points after Plymouth's loss at Barnet.
John-Joe O'Toole scrambled Joel Byrom's corner in at the far post to put the hosts ahead on the stroke of half-time.
But Lyle Taylor's fine right-footed curler rescued a point for the Dons.
Wimbledon remain eighth in the table, one point adrift of the final play-off place, while Northampton are still 19 points clear of fourth-placed Accrington Stanley.
Chris Wilder's side have lost only one of their last 21 league matches, a run that stretches back to 17 October.
AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told BBC Radio London:
"What a game of football. I thought it was two really, really good teams who went hammer-and-tong.
"I'm proud to be a part of that game and certainly we deserved at least a point from it.
"The energy, the commitment - I thought that was a really good advert for League Two. Two of the better teams in the league going toe-to-toe."
