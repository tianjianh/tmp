The 43-year-old man and 39-year-old woman who died were found by ambulance crews called to Laneside Gardens, Walsall, shortly after 01:30 BST.
A man, 23, and woman, 22, were arrested nearby and are being questioned by West Midlands Police. The arrested man is related to one of the deceased.
Police said the double murder case was an "isolated incident".
The two people who died sustained gunshot injuries.
Head of crime and operations for Walsall, Supt Keith Fraser, said: "I don't underestimate the impact this could have and will have on the local community.
"I do want to reassure the community that this is an isolated incident with the information that we have at the moment."
Neighbours told BBC reporters the victims were a mother of three sons and her long-term partner, but this has not been confirmed by police.
The force said it was not "100% sure on what the murder weapon is at this moment in time" and there had not been a post-mortem examination.
Asked if police had recovered a gun, Supt Fraser said: "(I) believe a firearm has been recovered in situ.
"Now whether or not that is the firearm concerned (in) this matter I don't know."
He said the arrests were made "very soon after" the incident, "possibly within about an hour, if that".
The two people died at the scene "despite the best efforts of medical staff", police said.
The property and cul-de-sac have been sealed off while forensic searches are carried out.
Det Insp Michaela Kerr, from West Midlands Police, said: "Both the man and woman... received emergency treatment at the scene, however they could not be saved and died a short time later.
"We are treating their deaths as suspicious and two people were arrested nearby in connection with the incident."
The force said officers would be speaking to residents who may have information or concerns following the incident.
Kenneth Lloyd, who lives nearby said: "It's terrible. We've been here 40, 42 years and we've never had anything like this on the estate before."
His wife Pamela said the incident had left her "shaking like a leaf".
Walsall councillor Harbans Sarohi said there was support available for residents.
"I think people are very shocked because these things never happen here," he said.
"So all I can say is that if they need any help from the council or from police - that will be provided."
