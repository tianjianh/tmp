They include some birds, mammals, insects and fish.
But the report also finds more positive trends for other species.
The State of Nature report 2016 assesses the health of Northern Ireland's habitats and species. It has been published to coincide with Environment Week.
A series of events is being held to raise awareness of environmental issues among politicians and the public.
Researchers use an all-island approach for some of their research findings.
The report said iconic species like barn owls, curlews and corncrakes are at serious risk.
Of the more than 1,400 species studied, 295 are at risk of being lost forever, including the Irish damselfly and marsh fritillary butterfly.
But the report said some conservation projects are helping to redress years of decline.
This includes work to boost the number of yellowhammers in County Down, and a species of butterfly in County Armagh.
And there is good news for some mammals, including bats and otters, numbers of which are on the up over the last 10 years.
More than 25 organisations contributed data to the report.
It found that habitats in Northern Ireland are still in decline.
It attributes that to intensification of farming, development, non-native invasive species and problems accessing funding for conservation.
