The investment will be overseen by rail operator Abellio East Anglia, which has been awarded a new franchise running from October 2016 to 2025.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who announced the contract during a visit to Bombardier in Derby, said: "We are making the biggest investment in the railways since the Victorian era.
"By awarding this franchise to Abellio East Anglia we will improve journeys for people in East Anglia.
"Abellio's decision [to use Bombardier as a supplier] will ensure our train-building industry in Derby remains strong."
The franchise will see 1,043 new carriages being used, with the rest being supplied by Swiss firm Stadler Rail.
The franchise will also include:
Bombardier is the only remaining company that both designs and manufactures trains in the UK.
Its trains are used on services throughout the UK, including on the London Underground.
The £1bn contract with Abellio is expected to secure 1,000 jobs into the next decade, the government said.
Des McKeon, UK commercial director at Bombardier Transportation, said the contract was a "great endorsement" of its trains.
"We look forward to working with our customer Abellio UK, to support them in transforming rail services throughout the region and delivering an enhanced customer experience through the provision of new trains," he said.
