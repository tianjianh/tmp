Lap dancing club's strippers 'touched and fondled' customers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lap dancing club where strippers "touched and fondled" customers has been refused a new licence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
CCTV footage taken from the Angels Club in Leicester showed dancers and some of the audience touching in an "intimate and sexual manner".
The city council's licensing committee, which also heard the club failed to provide adequate records, declined a renewed sexual entertainment licence.
Owner KN Leisure Ltd has 21 days to decide whether to appeal.
It can remain open in the meantime, but faces closure if it does not challenge the decision, or loses any appeal.

Police obtained the CCTV from the club in December, the hearing at the City Hall was told.
A solicitor for KN Leisure, argued the footage showed a "blip" rather than a persistent breach of regulations preventing physical contact, but licensing officer Bobby Smiljanic said he did not accept it was a one-off.
The committee also heard staffing checks and records left "much to be desired".
The hearing was told that when council officials visited the club in October, the firm failed to provide details of the 19 dancers working there, and had no records on the premises.
KN Leisure said the club had been burgled, and that it had since "thought more carefully" about storing documents.
It later sent the details of 10 dancers, but the committee was told information on the remaining nine had still not been received.
