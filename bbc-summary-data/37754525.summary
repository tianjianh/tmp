Former Eggheads star CJ de Mooi will "continue to co-operate with the Dutch authorities" after a failed attempt to extradite him to the Netherlands over an alleged killing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-quiz show panellist, 46, from Caldicot, Monmouthshire, is accused of manslaughter, murder, assault and battery in Amsterdam in 1988.
He was detained under a European arrest warrant at Heathrow Airport last month.
Dutch authorities reportedly abandoned a bid to bring him to the Netherlands.
Mr de Mooi, whose real name is Joseph Connagh, was said to be "very pleased".
His manager said in a statement: "CJ is obviously very pleased with the result of today's hearing and will continue to co-operate with the Dutch authorities until this matter is finally concluded.
"He would like to thank the tens of thousands of people who have contacted him via social media and in person, for their lovely words and support during this traumatic time for him."
Mr de Mooi's autobiography, published last year, described an incident in which he said he may have killed a man while he lived on the streets.
He said he punched a man who approached him with a knife before throwing him into a canal in 1988.
In his book, he wrote: "He caught me on the wrong day and I just snapped. I fully suspect I killed him. I've no idea what happened to him."
Mr de Mooi, originally from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, adopted the name de Mooi when modelling.
He became a panellist on Eggheads in 2003 after winning a series of game shows.
