BMA Scotland criticises NHS waiting times 'obsession'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "obsession" with waiting times statistics is diverting attention from the "real issues" in the Scottish NHS, a leading doctor has said.

Dr Peter Bennie, chair of the BMA's Scottish council, said publishing weekly performance figures for A&E wards "misses the point".
And he claimed the Scottish government had "bowed to pressure" on the issue.
The government said it agreed waiting times were not the only measures on which the NHS should be judged.
It has set an interim goal of treating 95% of accident and emergency patients within four hours, in advance of meeting the full target of 98%.
In March, it began publishing weekly figures showing whether each hospital A&E department was meeting the four-hour target.
Hospitals across the country have been struggling to achieve the interim target, with the latest figures showing 92.2% of patients were seen and subsequently admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours for the week ending 14 June.
Dr Bennie will tell the BMA's annual conference in Liverpool later ministers "bowed to pressure from opposition parties" when they began reporting weekly A&E activity.
He will say: "All this has served to do is feed an obsession amongst our media and politicians each week in the parliament. The publication of these weekly statistics completely misses the point and diverts attention from the real issues in our health service.
"The problems that exist within our hospitals extend far beyond the front door and we need to look at the whole patient journey. Are patients being admitted to the right wards, not boarded internally or miles away?
"Are they discharged when they're ready to go home and do they get the support they need to live at home and avoid unnecessary readmission?
"That is what is important. Not the weekly accusations flung across the parliament chamber as each party seeks to blame the other for the problems in the NHS."
He will add: "We need a rethink on targets in Scotland. If we are to continue with them, the targets must drive improved clinical outcomes for patients rather than an expensive obsession with reducing waiting times, irrespective of patients' best interests."
Dr Bennie is also to caution politicians against making "unfunded and unrealistic promises" about the health service in the run up to next May's Scottish Parliament elections.
In response to his comments Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "While the A&E target is clinically important and supported by clinicians, we completely agree with the BMA that it is far from the only measure on which our NHS should be judged.
"We are also in agreement that looking at the whole system of health and social care - not one part in isolation - is crucial.
"Indeed our plan for improving emergency and unscheduled care includes six essential actions that are focussed on preventing people who don't need to be in hospital ending up there, and then ensuring quick, efficient and effective services for patients arriving in hospital right through to their care on returning to the community.
"It is also why we are integrating health and social care - bringing the two services that care for people in Scotland closer together than ever before and investing Â£100m to tackle delayed discharge."
