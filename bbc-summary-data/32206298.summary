A breed of dolphin usually found in deeper waters has been seen off the Mid Wales coast, a sea life charity says.

Cardigan Bay has one of Europe's largest semi-resident populations of bottlenose dolphins.
But the Sea Watch Foundation says a short-beaked common dolphin has now been seen from New Quay, in Ceredigion.
It says the smaller breed, with its yellow and white markings, usually gathers in groups in waters deeper than 164ft (50m).
Sea Watch Foundation - a UK-wide charity which monitors dolphins, whales and porpoises - said there had also been several sightings of the more commonly spotted bottlenose dolphins in the bay in March.
These were "likely to increase" into the summer as dolphins return to the sheltered bay with their young, the foundation said.
The charity's sightings officer, Kathy James, said: "Now is a great time to come to New Quay to observe its wildlife.
"You might get to witness some really interesting interactions between the two species."
