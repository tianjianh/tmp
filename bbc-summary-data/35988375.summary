Old Aberystwyth street signs to be sold at auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A seaside town which replaced about 260 of its street signs with Edwardian-style versions will put the original signs up for sale, likely at public auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceredigion council's cabinet voted to sell the Aberystwyth signs, some dating back to the early 20th Century.
A spokesman said the timescale of the sale and value of the signs had not yet been confirmed.
It is part of an Â£800,000 scheme to improve the look of Aberystwyth.
A council spokesman said: "It is likely that sale will be by way of a public auction, but the sale method is also yet to be confirmed."
