[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police watchdog report into the deaths of a couple who lay undiscovered in their crashed car for three days has been handed to the Lord Advocate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lamara Bell was discovered critically ill in a crashed car on the M9, next to her dead partner John Yuill.
An investigation was ordered after it was revealed a witness had phoned police on the day of the crash to report it, but the call was not logged.
The probe looked at the circumstances surrounding the initial call.
It was carried out by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) after being ordered by Scotland's most senior prosecutor, Frank Mulholland.
A wider inquiry into police call handling was also carried out by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland.
Ms Bell, 25, died in hospital a week after the crash and four days after being found by police. She and her 28-year-old partner had been reported missing to police after last being seen in the company of friends near Lochearnhead.
A spokesman for Pirc said: "The Commissioner has submitted an interim report to the Lord Advocate on her independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of John Yuill, 28, and Lamara Bell, 25, following the recovery of a car close to the motorway at Bannockburn on 8 July 2015.
"The lord advocate will now consider the interim report and the commissioner will undertake further enquiries as required."
