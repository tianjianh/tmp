Bluestone National Park Resort wants to transform Blackpool Mill, near Narberth, into a Victorian-themed attraction as part of a £2.5m project.
Bluestone said it would create 60 jobs and inject £1.6m into the local economy ever year.
The plans were submitted last year and a series of road shows are taking place as part of a public consultation.
They will be held between 10:00 GMT and 14:00 at the following venues:
The plans include creating a Victorian tearoom, a milling experience, a crafts workshop and an exhibition and events barn.
Two ancillary buildings, including the miller's cottage, will also be brought back to life, with the riverside meadow hosting cultural events.
There are also plans for a narrow-gauge steam railway with its own station and platform.
Bluestone chief executive William McNamara said: "We hope residents and traders will share our vision to bring this historic landmark back to its former glory."
If the plans are approved, the mill is expected to open to the public in the autumn.
