The England seamer, 32, claimed six wickets in the second Test against West Indies to climb three places and sit alongside Australia's Ryan Harris, behind only South Africa's Dale Steyn.
Anderson last week surpassed Sir Ian Botham as England's highest Test wicket-taker with his 384th dismissal.
Team-mates Joe Root and Gary Ballance also moved up the ICC rankings.
Root, 24, is fifth in the batting standings - the highest he has been - after his unbeaten first-innings 182 in the second Test in Grenada.
Fellow Yorkshire batsman Ballance, 25, is in a career-high 17th after scores of 77 and 81 against West Indies.
