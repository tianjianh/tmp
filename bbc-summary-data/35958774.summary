[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new scheme aimed at getting prisoners into employment upon release has seen all of its participants find work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Employment charity - Shaw Trust Scotland - delivered the scheme at HMP Low Moss near Bishopbriggs.
Of the 11 participants taking part in the programme, six are now in employment with the other five securing jobs ahead of their release.
Shaw Trust said the scheme was designed to help tackle re-offending in Scotland.
Those taking part in the scheme were offered advice and training in CV writing and interview skills starting 12 weeks prior to their release.
The scheme took into consideration their own individual ambitions and skill sets, along with their employment history.
The charity also arranged for suitable employers to visit the prison to interview participants for roles upon their release.
Commenting on the success of the pilot, Ashley McCloy, Operations Manager for Shaw Trust in Scotland, said:
"Offenders are less likely to commit crime after release if they are given the tools to change their lives for the better and can see a clear route into employment.
"Given the success of the pilot, Shaw Trust Scotland is looking to offer the programme to more prisoners at HMP Low Moss, with a long-term view of integrating it into the core services offered at prisons across the country."
Shaw Trust Scotland is a national employment, disability, learning and skills charity which manages and delivers the Department for Work and Pensions' national disability employment programme, Work Choice.
