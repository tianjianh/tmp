Mancini, who played five times for the Foxes in 2001, led Manchester City to a first league title in 44 years in 2012.
Leicester are five points clear with eight games remaining, while Manchester City have reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time.
"If I could only choose one it would be Leicester," he told BBC Sport.
Mancini and Carlo Ancelotti are the only Italian managers to win the Premier League, and the Inter Milan boss hopes Claudio Ranieri can join the club.
"Ranieri is a good man," said Mancini. "He knows football very well. I hope he will be the third Italian to do it. For a team like Leicester to win the Premier League against the biggest teams like Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, it would be incredible."
In their fifth season in the Champions League, Manchester City have reached the quarter-finals for the first time and have been drawn against Paris St-Germain.
Mancini failed to get out of the group stage in his two attempts as City manager and is not surprised it has taken so long for them to reach the last eight.
"Manchester City have been the best team in the Premier League in the last four or five years but it takes time to be a top club in the Champions League," he said.
"Even if you have good players like City, you still can't win the Champions League after two years."
