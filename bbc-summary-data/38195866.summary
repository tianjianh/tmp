The duo are the first Robins players to agree to join Guernsey FC since the clubs agreed a partnership deal earlier this week.
They are in Guernsey's squad for the trip to Herne Bay in Isthmian League Division One South.
If the pair play they will become the first non-Guernsey players to feature for the Green Lions.
"We're delighted to help Guernsey by sending Jake and Kodi to them for a month," Bristol City director of youth recruitment Brian Tinnion told the Guernsey FC website.
"This forms part of our plans for a bigger partnership with Guernsey. Working with their manager Tony Vance, we're looking to only extend this over time.
"We're already looking at the possibility of a pre-season friendly in Guernsey, potentially with the first team, or a Select XI including our under-23s."
