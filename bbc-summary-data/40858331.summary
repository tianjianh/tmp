Hull City 2-3 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship-record signing Ruben Neves scored a stunning first goal for Wolves as Wanderers continued their 100% start to the season by winning at Hull City.

Neves, a £15.8m buy from Porto in July, found the top corner from 30 yards to give the visitors an early advantage.
Hull captain Michael Dawson nodded in from close range to equalise, but Diogo Jota turned in Bright Enobakhare's cross to restore Wolves' lead.
Nouha Dicko sent Hull to a first defeat, despite David Meyler's penalty.
Fraizer Campbell and Abel Hernandez had their best chances to equalise with the score at 2-1, but Campbell was denied by John Ruddy when one-on-one with the Wolves goalkeeper and the latter headed against a post from a corner.
Hull, who earlier on Tuesday rejected a £10m bid from Premier League side Burnley for midfielder Sam Clucas, won eight of their 19 home matches in the Premier League last season and hammered Burton 4-1 at home on Saturday,
But they were undone by two first-half goals of high quality from Wolves and a third on the counter attack from substitute Dicko.
Like fellow Portuguese 20-year-old Neves, on-loan Atletico Madrid forward Jota also scored in English football for the first time, his goal coming after excellent work on the right wing by teenager Enobakhare.
Wolves' defence was breached for the first time this season, having gone into the match as the only EFL club not to have let in a goal in a competitive game in 2017-18.
Despite the first-half concession to Dawson and Meyler's spot-kick in the ninth minute of stoppage time, they are one of three Championship teams to have won their first three league matches of the campaign.
Hull head coach Leonid Slutsky:
"It is very important to keep a player like Sam Clucas because he is a leader.
"We spoke with him about his situation but he's a really very professional guy and he has a long-term contract with the club.
"We built the team in a very difficult time. One more out can break the whole team, I'm very nervous about the situation."
Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC WM:
"It was a good result. Parts of the performance went well but other parts not so well. We conceded from set-pieces.
"John Ruddy made a very good save but we have to work hard on set-pieces and not concede a goal from set-pieces.
"The good start to the season shows the hard work that the boys did from day one, the way they prepared themselves for the challenge."
