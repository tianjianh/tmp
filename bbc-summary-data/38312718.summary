SWTChristmas campaign invites station name suggestions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rail company's appeal for customers to rename its stations with festive monikers has met with a mixed response.

South West Trains asked passengers to suggest a yuletide twist for departure boards on its network using the hashtag SWTChristmas.
Some got into the Christmas spirit with ideas like Dorchestnut and Brack-Noel.
But others were more Scrooge-like, and used the opportunity to criticise the firm for running no trains on Christmas Day or Boxing Day.
Richard Banks tweeted: "Here's one for Boxing Day: Havant-any-trains-running."
Another traveller tweeted: "Any chance you can quit the #SWTChristmas nonsense and just provide a good service?"
Debbos added: "Anyone replying to this doesn't actually regularly travel on @SW_Trains #SWTChristmas"
But many passengers welcomed the temporary sign change.
Chandlers Ford becoming "Christmas Ford", Bracknell "Brack-Noel" and Dorchester "Dorchestnut" were among the submissions.
Other suggestions include "GoodwillFord" for Guildford, "Eggnog-Ham" replacing Egham, Micheldever could change to "Mistletoe-dever" and Raynes Park could become "Raynes-deer Park".
A South West Trains spokesman said: "We want to help our customers get into the Christmas spirit and what better way than travelling to a station with a new festive name?
"We'll be picking the best ones to use on our network."
The station names will be changed temporarily on Saturday 17 December.
The rail firm has previously given passengers a romantic send-off on Valentine's Day in 2015, with romantic departure board messages.
South West Trains operates services in Hampshire, Surrey, Dorset, Wiltshire, Berkshire, Devon, Somerset, and Greater London.
