The 21-year-old has played in eight events since returning from a 17-month lay-off in June, and had to end her season early after suffering a relapse.
She played in an exhibition in Los Angeles last weekend and is planning to return to the WTA Tour in the new year.
"It's going to be a long way back. But if I didn't want to do it I would have quit a long time ago," she said.
"I'm very happy with the progress that's been made.
The former British number one - now ranked 553 in the world - decided not to use her protected ranking of 58 to gain direct entry into January's Australian Open.
She will miss the first Grand Slam of the year and instead is aiming to build up her ranking at smaller events in preparation for the French Open in May.
"I get two Slams with my protected ranking. One I used in New York (at the US Open). I figured I'd get as many matches behind me as possible and use the second one in Paris," she told WTA Insider.
"I could have asked for a wildcard but, at this point, I think it's better for me to get in as many matches as I can and get my ranking up to where I can get into tournaments by myself."
