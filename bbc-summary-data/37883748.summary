It happened on Saturday afternoon. There are no reports of any injuries.
Bedford Street is expected to stay closed until about 18:30 GMT.
By coincidence, the street had been closed since Saturday morning to allow filming to take place for a BBC drama series.
The popular crime thriller staring Adrian Dunbar and Vicky McClure is now in its third series.
