Watermark sells products including food, drink and artwork in shops around the Calder Valley with a percentage of the profits going into the fund.
The money is doubled by Community Foundation for Calderdale and can then be distributed in the area if a flood hits.
More than 3,000 properties were flooded in the region on Boxing Day 2015 with damage estimated to be £150m.
The initiative is one of several led by Community Foundation for Calderdale which has raised more than £3m since the December floods.
Chris Sands from Watermark hoped similar schemes could be started in other areas around the UK at risk from flooding.
He said: "Anyone can contribute, even if they have no chance of being flooded.
"Lots of people are doing that because they want the place where they live to be sustainable."
Euan Noble, producer of Watermark Gin, said: "The objective is to grow our business and to give money back into the watermark fund - it's a win for everybody."
Earlier in December, a council report setting out plans to invest more than £92m in flood prevention said the threat of loss of life from flooding was "ever present" in the area.
Calderdale Council said the total cost to the authority was not yet clear but it was estimated that it could exceed £50m.
Work was "well under way" on multi-million pound flood alleviation schemes for Mytholmroyd and Hebden Bridge, the council added.
