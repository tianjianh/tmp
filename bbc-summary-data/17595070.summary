The Best Possible Taste will focus on the performer's relationship with his wife, singer Lee Middleton.
It will also feature some of Everett's most famous characters including Sid Snot and US chatshow host Cupid Stunt.
Newcomer Oliver Lansley will play the funnyman, who died in 1995, while former Coronation Street actress Katherine Kelly will star as Middleton.
Everett married the singer in 1966 and separated in 1979.
Born Maurice Cole, the comic started his professional life as a pirate DJ for Radio London and Radio Luxemburg before joining Radio 1 in the mid 1960s.
His TV work included stints at Thames TV from 1978-1980 and his most famous BBC programme, The Kenny Everett Television Show which ran from 1981-1988.
"Kenny Everett was a genuine original: wild and unfocused maybe, but also deliciously anarchic and always entertaining," BBC Four controller Richard Klein said.
"In many ways Kenny was a very modern celebrity, wearing his heart on his sleeve while coping with a complex life.
"Re-evaluating this talented and exuberant personality, enabling audiences to reconsider Kenny's undoubted impact and legacy, makes this a very BBC4 drama."
Lansley co-starred and co-wrote the short lived BBC comedy Whites, starring Alan Davies.
