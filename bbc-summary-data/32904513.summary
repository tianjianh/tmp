The three-time Formula 1 champion rented the unassuming two-bed bungalow in the city suburb of Eaton in 1981.
Mark Bird, manager of William H Brown's Norwich branch, said they had not been told he had once lived there.
"We don't come across too many famous home-owners... and then they tend to have larger properties," he said.
Senna lived with his wife at the 1960s bungalow in Rugge Drive while driving for Ralph Firman's Van Diemen company, according to Tom Rubython's biography, The Life of Senna.
The Grand Prix racer, who died aged 34 in 1994, was competing in the Formula Ford racing season at the time and was based 18 miles away at Snetterton in Norfolk.
The bungalow was sold at the weekend by one of the first people to view it and went for its recommended guide price of between Â£210,000 and Â£215,000, Mr Bird said.
"I didn't even know Ayrton Senna had lived in Norwich," he said.
"It sold very quickly, it's been a popular bungalow, in a good location near the shops and schools.
"It might have pulled some more people in but it would have made no difference to the price.
"We don't come across too many famous home-owners - and they have got to be very well-known for it to enhance our marketing - and then they tend to have larger properties."
Mr Bird said the house sale would take about eight weeks to complete and he did not know if the new buyer was a motor-racing fan.
On his way to becoming a superstar, Senna also drove for Norfolk's F1 Team Lotus, based at Hethel, for three years before he moved to McLaren in 1988.
