[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 1-1 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton's 100 per cent start to the season came to an end as a 90th-minute stunner from Ademola Lookman earned Charlton a point.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old forward came off the bench to strike the ball past Trotters keeper Mark Howard from 20 yards.
And another Charlton sub Brandon Hanlan could have won it right at the death, but his header hit the side-netting.
Bolton had taken the lead through Gary Madine in the 53rd minute after good work from Liam Trotter on the wing.
The late equaliser will disappoint Bolton boss Phil Parkinson, who was making his first return to the Valley since being sacked by Charlton in 2011.
Both sides could have gone into the break a goal up with Charlton's Jason Pearce heading wide from a free-kick, and David Wheater seeing his effort cleared off the line and onto the crossbar.
There was a lengthy stoppage of play at the start of the second-half as Bolton's Mark Davies was stretchered off after landing awkwardly when making a tackle.
Despite the late setback, Bolton remain unbeaten in the league and stay top of League One.
