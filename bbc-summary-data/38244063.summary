Former Celtic defender Mark Wilson says the club's supporters are "letting the club down badly".

Uefa have charged Celtic in connection with crowd trouble during Tuesday's 1-1 draw at Manchester City in the Champions League.
"The supporters talk about being the best in the world and they travel very well," Wilson told BBC Scotland.
"But it's pointless saying that if you continually let the club down. And it's the club that will be punished."
The visiting supporters are alleged to have set off fireworks and caused other crowd disturbances at the Etihad Stadium.
It is the 10th time in the past five years the club have been charged by European football's governing body regarding their fans' behaviour.
Uefa's disciplinary body will examine the case on 23 February.
Wilson says players seldom notice trouble in the stands, but argues it's logistically challenging for Celtic to take action against the perpetrators.
"You're too focused, too wrapped up in the game to be aware of it," he said. "But it's got to be highlighted - now, what more can the club do?
"Banning the culprits is the only way of going about it but spotting them in a crowd is very difficult. There's no doubt it's ruining the occasion for Celtic."
