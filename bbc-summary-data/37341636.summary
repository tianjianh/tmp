Record scorer Helen Ward notched her 40th and 41st international goals to put Wales in command.
Substitute Charlie Estcourt added a third early in the second half for Jayne Ludlow's team who cemented their position in third place in Pool H, but cannot qualify for the finals.
Midfielder Jess Fishlock was outstanding, but had a penalty saved.
Wales conclude their qualifying campaign at the same venue against second-placed Austria on Tuesday.
With Seattle Reign's Fishlock pulling the strings and Reading's Ward a constant threat, Wales established an early dominance which they never relinquished.
After seeing their hopes of qualifying for next summer's finals in Poland ended by June's 2-0 home defeat by Norway, manager Ludlow already had an eye on World Cup 2019 qualifying campaign.
And the confident display by 18-year-old Estcourt, who replaced Kayleigh Green at half time, would have given her considerable encouragement.
Her turn and cool finish, after good work by Fishlock and Natasha Harding, ended the game as a contest.
But it was the experienced Ward - who has now scored seven goals during this qualifying campaign - settled any Welsh nerves with two cool finishes against bottom-placed Israel.
While Fishlock blotted an otherwise perfect copybook when Merav Shamir saved her penalty.
Wales manager Jayne Ludlow said: "It's a great result for us, but the performance even more so.
"Where we've been and where we are now is drastically different so the performance is what counts and to get the win at the end of it is fantastic as well.
"We have a nice mix, a nice blend of youth and experience and it's a great group to be working with and an exciting group for the future."
