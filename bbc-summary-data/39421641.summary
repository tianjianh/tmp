But rain restricted play at the SSE Swalec Stadium to 35.4 overs.
Nick Selman put on 83 with Rudolph before falling lbw to Jeremy Lawlor for 30.
Glamorgan are without Will Bragg, Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten through injury, ahead of the Championship season starting on 7 April.
All three are fitness concerns for the trip to Northampton, though Glamorgan will have South Africa batsman Colin Ingram back after his successful One-Day Cup campaign in his native country, and are still trying to complete the signing of fast bowler Marchant de Lange.
The teams observed a minute's silence before the start of play in memory of the late Glamorgan coach and player John Derrick, who died at the age of 54.
Rudolph's innings came off 103 balls and included 10 boundaries, following a knock of 60 against Gloucestershire the previous day.
He is aiming to recover form after a disappointing 2016 season, in which he made 659 Championship runs.
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport:
"It's a pity we couldn't get back on, but it was nice to get out in the middle. I feel I've been striking them quite nicely and my partnership with Nick Selman was good.
"My preparation for the last couple of months has been spot-on. I was fortunate to train outdoors in turf nets in South Africa with Craig Meschede for a month which really helped and I'm happy with where I am.
"I don't think one season should put me in a position where I have to prove myself. I think I've done that over 19 years but this year my ball-striking's been pretty clean so hopefully come Northants I can continue with that.
"At the moment it's a bit of a guessing game who'll be fit (for the Northants game).  As soon as Colin arrives and potentially Marchant, that will give us a better selection to choose from."
