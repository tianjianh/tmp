NI manufacturing: Sector struggles amid turmoil in global economy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland manufacturers are struggling at a time when the local private sector has just recorded its fastest growth in 16 months.

Businesses generally have had "a very encouraging start" to 2016, according to data compiled for Ulster Bank.
In January, the pace of job creation among the companies surveyed was above the UK average for the first time in almost two years.
The bank said manufacturing was a key area of concern.
Its chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said "doom and gloom" in the global economy will impact further on Northern Ireland manufacturing in the months ahead.
The bank produces a Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) each month which records things like new orders, employment and exports.
Mr Ramsey said job losses had been reported in the manufacturing sector for a fifth month running.
"Manufacturing orders have been flat or falling in four of the last five months.
"January's decline represented the sharpest fall since September 2012."
The services sector was "the star performer" last month.
