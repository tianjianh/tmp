One rambler said the islands on the loch were reminiscent of Fjordland, another cited the wide-ranging view of central Scotland while another said it is a good place to blow the cobwebs away.
The sight has been ranked the 10th most scenic view in the UK.
Glen Coe's Three Sisters came in second, behind Snowdonia in Wales, while Loch Ness, as seen from Dores, was sixth in the top 10 sights.
