Rodney Ah You: Ulster prop faces disciplinary panel after red card

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster prop Rodney Ah You will appear before a disciplinary panel on Wednesday after his red card in last Friday's Pro12 win over the Dragons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ah You was dismissed after he was adjudged to have made an illegal shoulder charge on Dragons full-back Carl Meyer at Rodney Parade.
The tight-head is automatically banned for Ulster's game against Cardiff Blues in Belfast on 7 April.
Ah You could face further punishment after the hearing in Edinburgh.
The 28-year-old, who joined Ulster from Connacht last summer, won the Junior World Championship with New Zealand in 2008.
Ah You signed for Connacht two years later, qualified to play for Ireland in 2013 and made his Irish debut the following year in Argentina.
