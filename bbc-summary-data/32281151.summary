The family of a seven-year-old boy who fell to his death on a skiing holiday in the French Alps on Friday have described him as a "daring, outgoing, determined little boy".

Carwyn Scott-Howell was on holiday with family when police say he fell 160ft (49m) after straying off piste.
In a statement his family said he was a "very competent skier and snowboarder".
His family said they were skiing together when Carwyn's sister "lost her ski on a jump" and Carwyn skied ahead.
The accident happened in Flaine, 38 miles north west of Chamonix.
In their statement released through the Foreign Office, the family described Carwyn as an "adorable, caring person" who learned to ski from the age of three.
The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day on Friday afternoon.
It said: "The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead.
"The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts.
"The family would like to thank all their friends and family for their support at this time and the vast help from the British Consulate."
Police chief Patrick Poirot, head of the mountain rescue division in the nearby town of Annecy, said yesterday that police believed the boy did not know where to go after losing his parents and skied in the wrong direction.
He said: "He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff.
"He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell."
The family have a farm in the small village of Talybont-on-Usk in the Brecon Beacons, where Carwyn's parents Ceri and Rhys run an award-winning produce business and rent holiday cottages.
Liam Fitzpatrick, an independent county councillor for the village, said the community was "in absolute shock".
"He was seven years old, it's horrendous. A tragic, tragic accident," he said.
"We just can't comprehend it.
"It's a small village and everyone knows each other, especially his parents who are well-known because of their business.
"There will be massive support here for them when they come back. The community will be ready to assist in any way it possible can.
"It's impossible to know what they are going through at the moment."
