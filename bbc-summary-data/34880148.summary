The DVD and video rental chain Xtra-vision has announced it will close eight stores across Northern Ireland in the new year.

Eighteen full-time jobs will be lost, as well as more part-time positions.
The stores closing are in Lurgan, Banbridge, Newcastle, Warrenpoint, Larne, Armagh, Cookstown and Limavady.
The chain has blamed a continued decline in rentals for the closures.
The company's stores in Strabane and Derry closed earlier this year after the chain was sold to Hilco Capital Ireland for an undisclosed sum in 2014.
In a statement, the company said it had taken the decision not to renew leases that were due to end in February 2016, because of the continued decline in rental DVDs.
It said: "Xtra-Vision is condensing its store portfolio to a smaller number of focused retail locations."
It said it remains dedicated to its investment in Xtra-Vision Express, its vending machines operation and its online channels.
