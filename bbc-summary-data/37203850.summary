The animal was discovered off Lannacombe Beach in north Devon in August before being taken to the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth.
Initially named Lionel, the lobster has since been renamed JJ in honour of British boxing Rio Olympics silver medalist, Joe Joyce, the aquarium said.
Vets are monitoring the animal to check time out of water has not harmed it.
James Wright, the curator at the National Marine Aquarium where JJ was weighed, said he appeared to be the heaviest lobster caught in the UK since 1931, when one weighing just over 9kg was caught off Fowey in Cornwall.
Mr Wright said it was "very hard to age a lobster" because they frequently moult and their growth is affected by different factors.
However, he estimated JJ was between 50 and 70 years old.
"He has spent some time with our husbandry team here at the National Marine Aquarium who have been monitoring his progress very closely, and we're happy to report he has been feeding well and is on the road to recovery," Mr Wright said.
He added the lobster would join "other native marine species" at the aquarium when he had made a full recovery.
