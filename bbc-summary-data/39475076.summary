The husband of a woman murdered on their honeymoon in Mauritius has met the country's prime minister, six years after Michaela McAreavey's death.

John McAreavey met PM Pravind Jugnauth after police told him an elite task force was now working on the investigation into his wife's murder.
Mrs McAreavey, 27, was found strangled to death in a bath at a luxury hotel 12 days after her wedding in January 2011.
Two hotel workers were tried for murder, but found not guilty in 2012.
Mauritian police launched a fresh investigation following the trial, but it came to nothing.
Mr McAreavey has travelled to Mauritius with his sister, Claire, and Mark Harte, Michaela's eldest brother, saying he was prepared "to go to the ends of the earth to ensure that justice is achieved for Michaela".
Mr McAreavey said he was encouraged by the response from authorities to his return to the Indian Ocean island after six years, and said he would be back in Mauritius "regularly".
"If we have to be back next week, we will be back, if we have to be back next month, next year, we will be here," he told BBC News NI.
"We will be back as long as it takes. If I'm still standing here in 20 years, so be it."
He thanked the prime minister for their meeting, which he described as "very significant for our families".
Earlier, Mr McAreavey said 45 minutes of talks with senior police officers were "short but positive".
Mrs McAreavey was the daughter of Tyrone Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte.
Mauritian director of public prosecutions Satyajit Boolell earlier insisted the police investigation into her murder at Legends Hotel had not been closed.
"We want to find out who the culprits are," said Mr Boolell ahead of his meeting with Mr McAreavey on Monday.
"Those who have taken the life of this young woman will have somehow to face justice.
"We are as determined, we are as concerned, as he is.
"Any crime on our territory is a blot on our peaceful reputation."
A confidential telephone line has been set up in Mauritius for people to give evidence about the murder, as well as an address where people can post potential new information.
Mr McAreavey remarried in September last year. His wife, Tara Brennan, is an accountant from County Kildare.
