The album, described as a love letter to New York and their home town of Manchester, pushed Pharrell Williams' GIRL down to third place.
Paloma Faith's latest album, A Perfect Contradiction, debuted at number two.
Dance anthem Tsunami (Jump) by Canadian duo DVBBS and Miami DJ and producer Borgeous topped the singles chart.
Tsunami, which features rapper Tinie Tempah, was first released in September last year and pushed My Love by Route 94 featuring Jess Glynne down to second place.
It is the fourth number one for Tempah and the first for DVBBS (pronounced Dubbs) and Borgeous.
