Striker Keane, 35, sustained a calf injury in training last Saturday and missed his side's final warm-up game - a 2-1 loss to Belarus on Tuesday night.
Everton midfielder James McCarthy makes Martin O'Neill's 23-man squad despite his ongoing thigh injury.
Bournemouth player Arter, 26, left the team's training camp in Cork on Monday.
Sheffield Wednesday's Keiren Westwood edges out Millwall's David Forde for one of the goalkeeper slots alongside Darren Randolph and Shay Given.
Forde started the qualifying campaign as first-choice keeper but a combination of 40-year-old Given's return to international football and losing his place at club level, has led to the Millwall keeper losing out.

LA Galaxy forward Keane, who has been capped 143 times by his country, was a major doubt after suffering a problem at the weekend, but is deemed fit enough for the tournament.
Winger Aiden McGeady makes the squad, despite playing on loan at Championship side Sheffield Wednesday for the second half of the season, and missing out on a place in the play-off final squad.
With Arter missing, Hull's David Meyler edges Bournemouth's Eunan O'Kane for the final midfield slot with Reading's Stephen Quinn also included.
Everton's Darron Gibson is not picked and neither is Colorado Rapids frontman Kevin Doyle.
The Republic of Ireland are in Group E, along with Belgium, Italy and Sweden.
