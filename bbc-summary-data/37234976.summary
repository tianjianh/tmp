Farm worker Glyn Jones found dead under silage pile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a missing farm worker who clawed through a pile of silage with their bare hands found him dead beneath it, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glyn Jones, 54, died on the farm at Brynsiencyn, Anglesey, last January.
A pathologist told the inquest at Llangefni that he did not die from the one tonne-weight of the bale but from noxious fumes when he was trapped.
The inquest jury returned a unanimous conclusion of accidental death.
The father-of-two was killed while he was in a shed removing bales to place on a trailer with a vehicle similar to a forklift, the inquest heard.
His younger brother, David Jones, said in evidence: "He was crouched down, silage was on top. He had a handful of silage in his right hand and a phone in his left."
Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones said it was a mystery how he came to be buried, adding: "The evidence is not clear."
