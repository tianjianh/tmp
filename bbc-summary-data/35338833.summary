RISE Scotland said Mr Trump - who has called for Muslims to be temporarily stopped from entering the US - is damaging Scotland's international reputation.
Officers were called to the Menie Estate at about 15:15.
Police Scotland said there was no criminality involved in the protest.
The actions comes the day before a Westminster debate on whether Mr Trump should be banned from the UK.
RISE Scotland said it was also targeting Mr Trump's Turnberry hotel and golf course in Ayrshire.
A spokesperson added: "Donald Trump needs to know that he is not welcome in Scotland."
The RISE Scotland alliance plan to contest regional list seats in May's Scottish Parlaiment election.
