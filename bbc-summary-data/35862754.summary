Widnes captain Kevin Brown welcomes comparisons with Premier League leaders Leicester City if it means they achieve success this season.

The Vikings finished outside the top eight in 2015, but last Friday's win at Wigan kept them at the top of the Super League table after seven games.
In football, Leicester are five points clear with seven games left.
"It's good, it's better being compared to someone at the top," Brown told the BBC Super League Show.
"I don't really listen to what people say about where we finish, as long as we're playing well and doing our thing you can compare us to whoever you want.
"If they're at the top of the league and going to win something, then I hope we can keep it up and they can keep comparing us to them."

The Vikings have scored 230 points so this season, the highest in Super League, and only Wigan and Warrington have conceded fewer.
Key to their improvement has been the acquisition of strong forwards and a toughness instilled by head coach Denis Betts and his coaching staff.
"Our attack has been pretty good for the last few years but the fact we've got real lads working their socks off in the middle coupled with some really good edge defenders," said Brown.
"The lads who have come in have helped our attack but Chris Houston, Corey Thompson, Chris Bridge, Charly Runciman - these lads are competent, experienced players who know how to defend.
"Above everything the defensive side of game has improved out of sight."

No team has scored more tries than the 42 by Widnes, an average of six per game.
And their six wins from seven is a record Brown says can be put down to the atmosphere within the club.
"I know it looks like we're just playing fancy-free, but there's a lot more structure and respect for the ball than that," he added.
"From Monday to Sunday it's fun all the way, the coaching staff make sure we're working hard and putting everything into it.
"But at the same time we're enjoying it, not just because we're winning, but the way we're playing is a good style and brand of footy."
