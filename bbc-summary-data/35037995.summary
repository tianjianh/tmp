Lee's film revisits Michael Jackson's life story in Journey from Motown to Off the Wall, while Herzog has made a documentary about online culture.
Festival organisers announced the dramatic and documentary premieres days after revealing the competition titles.
Kristen Stewart, Anna Kendrick and Danny DeVito are among the actors in the festival's line-up.
The festival kicks off on 21 January in Park City, Utah.
Stewart appears in Certain Women, alongside Laura Dern and Michelle Williams, who also stars in Manchester by the Sea with Casey Affleck.
Kendrick stars in The Hollars, about an aspiring New York City artist who returns to his Middle America hometown on the eve of his mother's brain surgery, while DeVito appears in the whimsical Wiener-Dog, about a dachshund who appears to be spreading comfort and joy.
Festival director John Cooper said: "We have seen an increase in younger audiences in recent years, showing that the next generation of independent film fans is culturally adventurous, and drawn to the diverse line-up we offer each year."
Trevor Groth, director of programming added that their selection of films revealed "that what resides at the core of captivating stories are fascinating, and at times heroic, characters".
He added: "In shining light on these people, independent filmmakers are doing what they've always done best: connecting the dots of human existence with a deeply charged emotional current."
