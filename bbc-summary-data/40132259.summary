The 8ft guitar statue has been erected in East Park, where he worked as an attendant before gaining musical fame working with David Bowie in the 1970s.
Ronson led Bowie's backing band, Spiders From Mars. He died in 1993, aged 46, after developing liver cancer.
His sister Maggie Ronson said: "He absolutely loved his gardening job so this couldn't be more perfect.
"We're very, very happy and I'm sure he'd be very proud."

Councillor Mary Glew, who unveiled the sculpture at a ceremony, said it was "a fitting tribute" to the musician who "left an enduring legacy to the world of contemporary music".
The sculpture was designed by 18-year-old Hull College student Janis Skodins, whose artwork was chosen in a competition.
It has been installed in the Michael Ronson Garden of Reflection, near the park's pavilion.
The sculpture is among 100 plaques and memorials honouring notable people across Hull for its City of Culture celebrations.
Fellow musician Trevor Bolder is also due to be honoured.
As well as working with Bowie, Ronson recorded several solo albums, the most successful of which was Slaughter on 10th Avenue, which reached number nine in the UK album chart.
He also played on, produced or arranged songs for artists including Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, and Morrissey.
