The Scotland fly-half, 23, has been out since suffering a severe head injury in Warriors' Pro12 semi-final loss away to Connacht in May.
"Finn's now trained two weeks full contact," said Townsend.
"He's worked really hard and can't wait to get back playing so he's playing for Ayr, his allocated club team."
Townsend also revealed Russell will wear a scrum cap this season as a precaution, with his rehabilitation being monitored closely by the Warriors medical staff.
"That'll be great for him playing down at Mansfield Park and it'll be good to see him back playing and see how he gets on," added Townsend.

"If he gets through that game then I see him being in the selection mix for the Ulster game [on 23 September], but that will depend on how he reacts on contact and his match fitness - and what his form is like.
"To have him going into round four of the season is a real boost."
