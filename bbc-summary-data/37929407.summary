83 Main Port Engineering jobs saved in Pembroke Dock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 80 jobs have been saved at a Pembrokeshire engineering company that went into administration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sixty-nine workers at Main Port Engineering Ltd (MPE) in Pembroke Dock  were made redundant in October, with a further 88 jobs at risk.
Administrators have now announced that 83 staff working at Valero oil refinery as MPE contractors will have their employment continued.
Their contracts will be taken over by Cape Engineering Services.
The transfer will take place on 14 November, and this includes the contracts of apprentices at the refinery.
Roger Hale, joint administrator and director at PwC, said: "MPE has had a long tradition of employing people in the local area, and I am delighted that 83 jobs have been safeguarded following the transfer of the Valero site contract to Cape."
Main Port Engineering provided services to the petrochemical industry but struggled to find customers after Milford Haven's Murco Oil Refinery closed.
