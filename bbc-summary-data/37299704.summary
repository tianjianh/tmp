Tom Lawrence: Ipswich forward hopes loan spell can boost Leicester hopes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town forward Tom Lawrence hopes his loan spell at the club can help him break into the Leicester City team.

Lawrence, 20, joined the club on a season-long loan in search of regular football after playing just four times for the Premier League champions.
"When they won the league you look elsewhere. They're buying players for stupid amounts of money," he said.
"They look abroad quite a lot and hopefully I get my chance next year or whenever the time comes."
The former Manchester United player joined the Foxes in 2014 but found opportunities limited at the club and has spent time on loan with Rotherham United, Blackburn Rovers and Cardiff City.
"This is what I've done now, I've come on loan and hopefully I can show everyone there what I can do," Lawrence told BBC Radio Suffolk.
"I've got this season and next season left [under contract at Leicester] so we will see what happens."
Lawrence made his debut for Wales in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Andorra in October 2015 and has played four games for the senior team.
"Another reason why I want to be playing regular football is to push on with Wales," he continued. "They had a great start [against Moldova] and hopefully there's more to come for me."
