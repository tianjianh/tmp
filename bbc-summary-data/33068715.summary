Louisiana delays release of US man in solitary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The release of a man who has spent more than four decades in solitary confinement will now be delayed after a request by Louisiana's top lawyer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It means Albert Woodfox's release has been moved from Tuesday evening to, at the earliest, Friday afternoon.
A judge had ordered the 68-year-old to walk free, after his murder conviction was twice overturned.
But the attorney general said prosecutors would appeal "to make sure this murderer stays in prison".
The state now has until Friday afternoon to explain why he should continue to be held in jail.
Woodfox has been in solitary confinement since April 1972, after he was blamed for the death of a guard during a prison riot.
He was tried twice for the guard's death, but both convictions were later overturned. He denies all the charges.
Confined for 23 hours a day, he had only one hour outside his cell to "walk alone along the tier on which his cell is located", according to court documents from a case challenging his prison conditions.
Exercise was permitted three times a week and there were restrictions on "personal property, reading materials, access to legal resources, work, and visitation rights".
