[SN]TITLE[SN]
Manslaughter plea over Gareth Pugh's golf lake death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company director has admitted causing the death of a golf club worker who was found dead in a resort lake.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Pugh, 29, of Glynneath, Neath Port Talbot, died on 11 February 2016 while collecting golf balls at Peterstone Golf Club, near Newport.
Dale Pike, 25, also of Glynneath, admitted manslaughter by gross negligence, in breach of a duty of care to Mr Pugh, at Cardiff Crown Court.
He was released on bail ahead of sentencing on 3 July.
His father Jonathan Pike, 47, of Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taff, previously pleaded not guilty to the same charge but prosecutor Philip Evans, QC said no evidence would be offered against him.
He said Jonathan Pike was not at the golf club on the day Mr Pugh died and, since his son had pleaded guilty, there had been a "shift in the public interest in prosecuting this defendant".
Mr Evans added the decision had been made after consultation with Mr Pugh's family.
