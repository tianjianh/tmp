Raids on 68 properties in Suffolk and 12 in Norfolk since November have been linked due to their similarities.
Houses in rural areas were hit, normally during the afternoon or early evening with jewellery the main target.
Police said several lines of inquiry were being pursued in relation to the burglaries.
Det Insp Nick Power, of Suffolk police, said: "This is an alarming amount of burglaries, causing misery and distress to a vast number of individuals and families across Suffolk and also into Norfolk.
"We gather forensic evidence at every crime scene and have several lines of enquiry that we are pursuing in relation to these burglaries."
