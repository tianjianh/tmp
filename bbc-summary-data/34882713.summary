They would be part of the second wave received in Wales under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme.
It follows the announcement that Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, could welcome refugees before Christmas.
The move forms part of David Cameron's pledge for the UK to take in 20,000 refugees by 2020.
Councillor Darren Mayor, cabinet member for housing and property, said: "We have identified Ystradgynlais and Newtown as communities that are well placed to receive Syrian refugees because of the availability of family housing and capacity in local schools."
The first families are expected to arrive before the end of March 2016, he added.
