Scottish League One play-off final first leg: Clyde 1-3 Queen's Park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queen's Park put one foot in Scottish League One with a play-off final first-leg win over Clyde that will be difficult to overturn on Saturday.

The Spiders were ahead after five minutes when Sean Burns converted from the penalty spot.
John Gemmell headed the Bully Wee level 10 minutes later, but Queen's Park took control after the break.
Vinnie Berry fired home from close range and David Galt stunned the home crowd from all of 30 yards.
Clyde had finished the League Two season one place above their visitors, had beaten second-top Elgin City to reach the final and were seeking a fourth straight victory.
But the side who finished in fourth spot had the upper hand in games against Barry Ferguson's team this season - winning three and drawing the other.
And the Spiders were quick into the ascendency.
When 40-year-old former Rangers centre-half Marvin Andrews fouled Galt inside the penalty box, defender Burns handed the Glasgow side the advantage at Broadwood.
Striker Gemmell's fourth goal for Clyde since joining from Albion Rovers in January levelled for the Cumbernauld side.
However, Berry found the bottom corner to re-establish the lead after an hour.
Fellow midfielder Galt gave them daylight when he struck a superb effort from distance with six minutes remaining.
It puts the Spiders, who lost in last season's final, in firm control as they look to go one better after the second leg at Hampden Park.
Clyde manager Barry Ferguson: "The first half, we did well, but we lost a bad second goal and the third you can't do anything about.
"We've still got a lot to play for, but I'm missing a few through suspension, so I'll have nobody on the bench and I am sitting here trying to work out a team.
"We'll need to go with what we've got, but it's not over - it's only half time and we'll go and have a blast at it.
"I've told them I've played in loads of games where we've come back from two goals down."
Queen's Park head coach Gus MacPherson: "We're delighted. We had to work extremely hard for it.
"They were certainly the stronger team in the first half and we were having to defend deep.
"But we stood up to it, rode our luck a bit, but once we settled we looked dangerous.
"David Galt's was a tremendous striker, but it hasn't decided anything."
