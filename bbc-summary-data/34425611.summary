Local government body Cosla said it welcomed trade unions' acceptance of the 2.5% rise over two years.
Cosla said councils would find it difficult to find the money to fund the increase, but added that local authorities wanted to help their staff.
Billy Hendry, human resources spokesman at Cosla, said the deal would put "much-needed additional money" into the wages of hardworking employees.
He said: "2.5% over two years is difficult for councils in a prolonged period of budget constraints, but we made every effort to show the workforce that they are doing a great job in very difficult times for local government and that we notice and appreciate this.
"Times are set to get even tougher with deeper cuts in public expenditure widely predicted and we will need to work closely with the trade unions to support our workforce and continue to deliver vital services to our communities."
