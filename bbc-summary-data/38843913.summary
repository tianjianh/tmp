Striker Eoin Doyle hopes to rekindle the form that saw him win trophies and promotion at previous clubs under manager Paul Cook.

Doyle, 28, was loaned to Pompey from Preston North End for the remainder of the season on deadline day.
The Irishman won cups at Sligo Rovers, and then promotion from League Two at Chesterfield under Pompey boss Cook.
"I've done well for him in the past, so hopefully there's more success to come," Doyle told BBC Radio Solent.
"We had some good times in Ireland and then did well in the league with Chesterfield.
"The size of the club and the passionate supporters were a big part in me wanting to come here, so I jumped at the opportunity."
Doyle, who moved to Preston permanently in July following an initial loan from Cardiff City, has played just 11 Championship games this season.
In December, he was sent off for fighting with team-mate Jermaine Beckford during their defeat by Sheffield Wednesday.
"I can't wait to get out there and help Pompey achieve," Doyle said. "I wish Saturday (away against Wycombe) was happening now.
"I won't be short of running around, I'm honest and will be in the box a lot. I'm just a hard grafter."
