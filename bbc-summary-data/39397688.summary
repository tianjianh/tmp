[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows an incident on Tuesday when a device exploded. It was a roadside bomb with a command wire attached.
The 31-year-old man was arrested in Strabane on Saturday.
Police have been given additional time to question a 20-year-old man who was arrested in Newtownstewart in connection with the bombing.
The PSNI said it was "incredibly lucky" that no-one was killed in the incident. Parts of the town were cordoned off as a result of the security alert, and there was no access to the town via Liskey Road.
