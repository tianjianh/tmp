A radiographer who "humiliated" her colleagues by posting sexually explicit comments on Facebook has been found guilty of professional misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Laura Turner sent a series of lewd messages to one of her co-workers while on duty, the Health and Care Professionals Council tribunal heard.
Staff at the University Hospital of North Durham said her comments had a "devastating" effect on the department.
Ms Turner said she was "disgusted" with her actions.
During the hearing in Kennington, South London, one of the victims said in a statement she was angry and in disbelief and "went to have a little cry" after the incident.
Ms Turner's line manager Judith Allen described the messages as humiliating and degrading and said the department was shocked at the content and her "unprofessional behaviour".
Ms Turner, who did not attend the hearing, was dismissed after the Facebook comments were shared in March 2014.
Panel chairman Philip Geering said: "The panel is of the view that the registrant's conduct fell well short of what would be proper in the circumstances and breached the standards of the HCPC."
He said sending messages that were sexually explicit and degrading to her colleagues while on duty in a clinical setting made her actions "even more unacceptable".
During the tribunal, Ms Turner was described as having a "cavalier" attitude to patient confidentiality, after it was revealed she shared photographs with X-rays and patient notes visible in the background.
Mr Geering said her "sufficiently serious" actions posed a "significant risk" in undermining public confidence in the trust and in the health care profession.
Ms Turner accepted writing and sending the comments during an interview as part of an internal investigation, the hearing was told, but claimed she was "easily led" and said her colleague "told me what to write".
Mr Geering said she had failed to show "meaningful remorse" and was "focused on the impact on her personally and the risk of losing her job".
