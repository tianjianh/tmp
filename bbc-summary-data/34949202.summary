Fraudsters, believed to be based in Africa, demanded Â£6,000 after he stripped in front of a webcam.
Speaking to the BBC anonymously, the man, from north Wales, said he thought he was talking to a local woman.
North Wales Police said so-called sextortion is a growing problem, with nine instances in the past month alone.
The woman contacted him through social media and they messaged each other while connected via webcam.
He told BBC's Cymru Fyw: "I could see her clearly. She looked like a woman from Wales - a white woman with dark hair. We never spoke to each other even though I could see her - she always messaged me."
Their conversation became sexual and he stripped in front of a webcam for her, before she did the same.
He said he was contacted the next day, with the woman threatening to post the video on Facebook saying he had stripped in front of an eight-year-old girl unless he paid them Â£6,000.
When he refused her demand, she posted the video on the internet, so he called the police.
North Wales Police set up a cybercrime unit 12 months ago to deal with sextortion and other online crimes.
Det Sgt Peter Jarvis said: "We will investigate it as far as we can but they are resolving back to countries similar to the Ivory Coast, to China, to Russia, so that's proving very difficult."
Wayne May, who runs a website called Scam Survivors, said criminals used sophisticated but cheap software to create 'virtual women'.
"So if I was the scammer and you were talking to me and you said to me 'prove that you're real - hold up three fingers', that would be possible, using the right version of this software, to hold up one, two, three fingers, smile," he explained.
"So there's that interaction that you could have that makes it appear very genuine."
The victim said he was embarrassed but hoped others would now avoid getting duped.
