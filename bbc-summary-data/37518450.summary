[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A court prosecutor who repeatedly stabbed his wife in the head during a bout of work-induced depression has been jailed for six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iain Farrimond attacked his wife with a kitchen knife and an ornamental cat on the eve of their wedding anniversary before turning the knife on himself.
Nottingham Crown Court heard Farrimond, of Worcester, meant to kill his wife of 28 years in her sleep but she woke up.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer, 54, admitted attempted murder.
Prosecuting, Bill Emlyn Jones said Farrimond, of Battenhall Road, had enjoyed a 23-year career with Birmingham CPS but had been suffering recent stress at work.
The court heard the senior crown prosecutor had written a suicide note at the scene and in the immediate aftermath of the attack on 26 May told police he had intended it to be a "day of death".
Nothing had seemed amiss on the night of the attack, Mr Emlyn Jones said.
But Farrimond's wife, Tina, woke up to find he "had armed himself with a large knife, and was stabbing her in the face and head".
She wrestled the knife from him but he resumed the attack with a large wooden ornamental cat, the jury heard.
Mrs Farrimond escaped to the bathroom, while her husband called 999 and stabbed himself with a large knife.
Mr Emlyn Jones said the motive had been a feeling of helplessness at work and fear he would have to leave.
"His increased workload and the introduction of the digital case system, which he was struggling to cope with, led him to desperation," he said.
His wife, who suffered five stab wounds in the attack, has recovered.
In sentencing, Judge Gregory Dickinson described it as a sad case of a "loving and devoted husband" committing a crime while "in the grip of severe depressive illness".
The CPS said the well-being of its staff was off the utmost importance and it had made stress management a priority.
Farrimond has been dismissed from the CPS.
