[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Urgent repairs on the Forth Road Bridge should be completed on time and the structure re-opened to all traffic, Scotland's transport minister has said.

Derek Mackay told the BBC that "as it stands" the work should be finished in early January.
The bridge was completely closed on Friday and alternative travel plans have been put in place.
Extra trains between Fife and Edinburgh have been laid on and 11,000 park and ride spaces made available.

The trains were very busy on Monday morning with increased queuing at Inverkeithing station but there was plenty of room at the park and ride facilities.
Mr Mackay told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "As it stands right now, we believe that if we remedy and repair the fault, strengthen that, the bridge should be operational and open to all traffic on completion of the repair as per the timetable that I had outlined over the weekend."
The Scottish government believes that the urgent work should be completed by the end of the festive season.
It is estimated that about 70,000 vehicles use the Forth Road Bridge each day and Friday saw 11-mile rush hour tailbacks on the first full day of its closure.
A plan has been put in place to help ease travel problems:
Mr Mackay insisted that the fault was not linked to a drop in finance because of the ending of bridge tolls in 2008.
He said: "This is a fault, that we believe on expert advice, only happened in the last few weeks.
"So on routine inspection, it was identified on Tuesday, expert engineering analysis studied that and inspected it fully, information went to ministers on Thursday evening, within minutes a decision was taken on advice on recommendation to close the bridge that evening."
Mr Mackay added that the two reasons for closure were one, not to compromise safety, and second not further damage the structure of the bridge.
Businesses are already feeling the impact of the repair work, including road hauliers.
Martin Reid, the Scottish director of the Road Haulage Association, explained how relatively short journeys have doubled in length.
He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "What we have established is that even the most basic journeys where you are moving from West Lothian into Central Fife - journeys that would normally take 40 to 50 minutes are now taking two to three hours.
"There is on going costs to that, there are delays to service, additional costs attached to running idle when you are in traffic jams. It is having a massive effect there is no doubt about that - to be fair it is affecting everyone in the east of Scotland."
