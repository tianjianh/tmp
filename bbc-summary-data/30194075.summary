[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland pharmaceutical firm Norbrook has appointed Liam Nagle as its new chief executive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Newry firm had been run by its founder Lord Ballyedmond, until his death in a helicopter crash in March.
Mr Nagle is currently the chairman of the Dublin-based Sisk Group, one of the largest privately owned companies in Ireland.
Sisk is primarily a construction business but also has a significant manufacturing division.
Mr Nagle is an experienced corporate manager, having held senior roles at firms like Intel and Nortel.
He joined Sisk in 2005 as head of its non-construction trading activities and led the development of a strategy to diversify the business.
Sisk entered the healthcare sector and initially acquired a number of businesses in Ireland and the UK.
Norbrook chairman Sir Roy McNulty said Mr Nagle "brings a wide range of skills and experience which will be of great benefit to the team in Norbrook".
