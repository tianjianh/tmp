The batsman, 23, from Cardiff, played for his county in the t20 game against Kent on Sunday.
Monday's incident involved a District Line train at Wimbledon Park station.
Police said a man matching Maynard's description ran away after a car being driven "erratically" was stopped shortly before. The police watchdog IPCC is investigating.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "At approximately 04:15 BST on Monday, 18 June, officers stopped a vehicle after it was seen being driven erratically in Arthur Road, SW19.
"The male driver of the vehicle - a black Mercedes C250 - made off on foot. Officers were unable to locate the man.
"At approximately 05:10 BST the body of a man fitting the same description was found on tracks near Wimbledon Park station."
London Ambulance Service medics were called but Maynard was pronounced dead at the scene.
British Transport Police (BTP) said the death was not being treated as suspicious.
The BTP said: "The incident was reported to BTP at 05:03 BST and is currently being treated as non-suspicious.
"A file will be prepared for the coroner."
A statement from the IPCC: "The IPCC was notified of an incident near to Wimbledon Park station in which the body of a man was found on the tracks.
"Prior to the incident, officers from the Metropolitan Police Service stopped a vehicle being driven by a man matching the same description as the deceased.
"Once a formal referral has been received from the MPS an assessment will take place regarding the level of IPCC involvement."
In a statement, Surrey described Maynard as "an incredibly talented young batsman".
Maynard, who came through the ranks at Glamorgan, was considered a rising star in the game and earned himself a place on the England Lions tour to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at the start of this year.
He moved to The Oval at the start of last season following his father Matthew's departure from the Welsh county in 2010 after claiming his position had become "untenable".
Surrey added: "His future potential was unlimited, with experts both inside and outside the club predicting he would soon follow in the footsteps of his father Matthew by graduating to full England honours."
Chairman Richard Thompson said: "Our thoughts at this awful time are with Tom's family and friends and all those that were close to him.
"Tom Maynard was a prodigiously talented young batsman who had made an incredible start to his career and was clearly destined for far greater things.
"The impact Tom made in such a short period of time for Surrey CCC spoke for itself. There is a profound sense of loss at the passing of Tom. To lose anybody at such a young age is an utterly senseless tragedy."
ECB chairman Giles Clarke said: "This is a very sad day for everyone connected with Surrey County Cricket club and for Glamorgan County Cricket club where Tom spent the early part of his career.
"Tom was a player of enormous potential who had already represented England Lions and had an exciting future ahead of him. Our hearts go out to the Maynard family for their tragic loss and we send them and all Tom's many friends and colleagues within the game our deepest sympathies."
Surrey's Friends Life t20 game against the Hampshire Royals at the Kia Oval on Wednesday has been postponed.
England cancelled their press conference at Surrey's home, the Oval, ahead of the one-day international with the West Indies on Tuesday.
Former club Glamorgan said they are "deeply saddened" to hear of Maynard's death.
A statement added: "The club's thoughts are with Matt, Sue and their family at this difficult time.
"Most of our playing and coaching staff were close friends of Tom and understandably are still trying to come to terms with this sad news."
Tributes have begun coming from leading figures in the cricketing world.
Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff said on Twitter: "Tragic news that a great lad, Tom Maynard is no longer with us. All my thoughts are with his family at this awful time x x."
Former England captain Michael Vaughan Tweeted: "Thoughts are with Matt Maynard and his family.. Words can't describe the Terribly sad news that Tom Maynard has died aged 23... #RIPTOM."
"Can't believe the news about Tom Maynard !!!! Life can be so cruel ! Thoughts go out to his family !! Top bloke much talent ! R.I.P" tweeted former England bowler Matthew Hoggard.
Surrey teammate and former England batsman Mark Ramprakash tweeted that Maynard was "a really nice guy who was a pleasure to play with".
