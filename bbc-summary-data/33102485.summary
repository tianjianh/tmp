Swansea soprano Celine Forrest will represent Wales in the competition, which takes place every two years at St David's Hall and is broadcast on BBC TV and radio.
Singers from the USA, South Korea and Belarus are among the finalists.
The week-long contest begins on Sunday.
There will be first appearances for contestants from Democratic Republic of Congo, Malta and Mongolia.
The winner of the main prize will win the coveted a trophy, as well as a Â£15,000 prize and will perform a newly commissioned piece by composer John Lunn at the BBC Proms 2016.
Devised in 1983, the competition is designed to find the talented classical singers of the future.
In 2013 the main prize was won by the American Jamie Barton - and her diary is now full of engagements.
A separate Song Prize runs alongside the main competition, while the Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize is voted for by the public.
The singers taking part in this year's competition will be welcomed to Wales at an official reception at the Senedd on Friday evening.
"It's a question of who we heard and who were the best singers who put themselves forward," said artistic director David Jackson of the line-up.
"Most are arriving in Cardiff for the first time, they're all really excited and understandably nervous.
"It really is a unique opportunity in terms of the exposure they get and the audiences listening to them in the hall and at home.
"They get a Rolls-Royce ride to world class orchestras and pianists and whether they win or not, it's still a great experience for them in their careers."
