[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thomas 'Slab' Murphy trial told his brother was the farmer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prominent republican Thomas "Slab" Murphy's brother managed his cattle herd and farming activities, his lawyer has told his trial for tax evasion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 66-year-old from Ballybinaby, County Louth, denies nine charges.
The prosecution's case is that he had significant dealings in relation to cattle and land and received farming grants, but failed to make tax returns.
The defence lawyer said there was "reasonable doubt" as to whether Mr Murphy was involved in farming.
Mr Murphy is being prosecuted on foot of an investigation by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in the Republic of Ireland.
Thursday was the second day of closing speeches at the trial at Dublin's Special Criminal Court.
Mr Murphy's defence lawyer asked: "Who was the chargeable person [the person chargeable to tax on income]?"
"Was it Thomas Murphy?" he asked. "Or is there a reasonable possibility, which cannot be excluded, or a reasonable doubt, that it could have been Patrick Murphy [the accused brother], who was in fact the chargeable person, and was in fact the farmer?"
The lawyer also brought up the question of the accused's residence.
"Where is the evidence Thomas Murphy was living in Ballybinaby or even in the state?" he said.
He told the judges that Thomas Murphy was the only member of the Murphy family not arrested, detained and interviewed in March 2006, when the CAB searched properties at Ballybinaby.
"Because he wasn't there," the lawyer said.
The trial is due to resume on Tuesday, when the defence lawyer is expected to conclude his closing speech.
