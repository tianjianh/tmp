S&R Electrics, which built a profile around the advertising slogan 'Sam's your man for a bargain', went into administration in May.
The administrator's report states that the firm had started legal action "in respect of an alleged fraud committed by a former employee."
The company indicated the fraud had cost it more than £250,000.
It said that had affected its cashflow, and combined with trading losses forced it to close with the loss of 20 jobs.
The report shows that the business owed its creditors more than £2m.
Ulster Bank, which hold mortgages over the firm's properties, is owed £820,000.
The largest unsecured creditor is an electrical goods wholesaler that is owed £223,000.
