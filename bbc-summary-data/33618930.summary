Profits rise for Danske Bank in NI

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danske Bank in Northern Ireland has reported pre-tax profits of £65m for the first half of 2015.

This is up from about £35m for the same period last year.
The bank said a number of factors were behind the rise, including an increase in business lending and an improvement in the housing market.
Danske Bank UK CEO Gerry Mallon said: "We can confidently say Northern Ireland continues to experience economic growth."
He added: "It is clear that businesses are starting to look at new plans for the future, while Danske Bank's own survey forecasts that overall local economic growth should reach 2% in 2015 and 2.3% in 2016."
From next year, Danske Bank in Northern Ireland will become a standalone business unit as part of the wider Danske Group.
The Copenhagen-headquartered banking group said a review of its business had "concluded that synergies between the Northern Irish market and the Nordic markets are limited".
"We are confident that the change will better enable us to create value for our customers in Northern Ireland, to develop our market position and to improve profitability," it said.
