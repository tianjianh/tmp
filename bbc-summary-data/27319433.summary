Police said that Rashid Rehman was sitting in his office when he was shot. Two of his assistants were injured.
Allegations of blasphemy against Islam are taken very seriously in Pakistan.
Critics argue that blasphemy laws are frequently misused to settle personal scores and that members of minority groups are often unfairly targeted.

Senior police official Zulfiqar Ali told AFP news agency that Mr Rehman died amid "indiscriminate firing" in his office on Wednesday evening.
He said he and his two injured colleagues were rushed to hospital where doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival.
Mr Rehman was defending Junaid Hafeez, a lecturer at Bahauddin Zakariya University accused by hardline student groups of making derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad in March last year.
An official at the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) told AFP that for a year no lawyer was prepared to take up the case because of fear of reprisals from extremist religious groups.
Mr Rehman, a rights activist and co-ordinator of the HRCP,  decided to defend Mr Hafeez despite reportedly receiving death threats.
