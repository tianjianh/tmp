Dementia patients at a new care home in North East Lincolnshire can visit their own street scene created to help trigger memories from the past.

Reminiscence therapy is often used to help people with dementia who have trouble with short-term memory but whose long-term memory is unaffected.
Lindsey Hall Care Home, on Clee Road, Cleethorpes, is equipped with a bowling green, shopping arcade and hair salon.
The shop windows display original products from the 1960s.
This will help the residents to reminisce with staff and family, while visiting the working cafe, hairdresser, charity shop, mini cinema and pub.
The 78-bedroom home has been created on the former Lindsey Lower School site.
Operations director Jonathan Garton said of the street area: "It is not only for reminiscence, but the residents feel they are able to go out into the community in a way that they wouldn't normally be able to.
"It's the same for families, they can take their loved ones out in a way that they may have used to do.
"Now, rather than sit with them in the lounge, they can take them to the tea room, the pub or even the cinema."
