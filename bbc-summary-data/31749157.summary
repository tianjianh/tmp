Jamshed Javeed, from Manchester, was "determined to fight jihad" despite pleas from his family not to, Woolwich Crown Court heard.
Javeed, 30, who admitted terror offences, claimed in court he wanted to go to support ordinary Syrians.
He was arrested in December 2013 hours before he was set to leave the UK.
Javeed, who taught at Sharples School in Bolton, had been preparing to leave his home on Cringle Road, Levenshulme, after helping his younger brother Mohammed make the trip to Syria.
The teacher's relatives initially foiled his plans by hiding his passport but he persisted even after learning his wife was pregnant.
Police found Â£1,490 in cash, thermal gloves and combat-style trousers in a rucksack during a search at his home.
At an earlier hearing, Javeed admitted two counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terror acts but insisted he was travelling only to support the people of Syria, not to join Islamic State.
But in sentencing him, Judge Michael Topolski said he was "not satisfied" Javeed had rejected "Isis's ultimate aims" and believed he remained "adherent to a violent jihadist mindset" and considered him "dangerous".
He said by autumn 2013 he had "become sufficiently radicalised and committed to a violent jihadist ideology that you were part of a group of young men determined to travel to Syria to join Isis and to fight and die for them".
Judge Topolski said: "I find that you were not planning to return to this country... but rather to die, if you could, as a martyr."
He said Javeed played an "important role" in enabling his younger brother and three other men to travel to Syria to fight.
"One of those young men is now dead. The other three are effectively missing."
During his trial Simon Denison QC, prosecuting, said evidence indicated Javeed was "intent on fighting with the terrorist group".
He said: "It follows that the action he was intent on committing inevitably included acts of murder, using firearms and/or explosives."
The jury was played recordings made secretly by Javeed's family, in which he can be heard telling an unidentified female: "I don't care about the police. They can arrest me.
"I've not done anything wrong. I'm not bothered about police. Lock me up. Am I bothered, if they lock me up?"
He told his family in a second recording: "You don't want me to go... But I want to. And I am going to go, regardless."
When later asked by his sister where he was going he replied: "Wherever I want."
Judge Topolski imposed an extended sentence of nine years, comprising a custodial term of six years and an extended licence period of three years.
Speaking after sentencing, Det Ch Supt Tony Mole from Greater Manchester Police said: "Javeed was an otherwise law-abiding man who had a responsible job, a child and another one on the way.
"However, from August last year both his appearance and behaviour started to change and in a short space of time he started to support the Isis cause and those planning to travel to Syria.
"He had bought equipment to take with him and had given money to help others travel there."
Judge Topolski praised the "resolve and courage" of Javeed's family in attempting to scupper his plans.
His family was also commended by Det Ch Supt Mole for taking "brave steps" to try to prevent him flying out to Syria before his arrest.
