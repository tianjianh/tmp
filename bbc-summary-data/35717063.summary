Zip wires could replace Brighton Wheel

Two 300 yard-long zip wires could replace the Brighton Wheel when it is removed from the seafront this summer.

The wheel's operator Paramount Entertainment has applied to replace it with the zip wires running from a 65ft tower to a landing area on the beach.
Planning permission for the wheel, which opened in 2011, runs out at the end of May ahead of the opening of the i360 tower further along the promenade.
The zip wire is recommended for approval by the city council next week.
The council said the Â£1.7m Brighton Zip would be the largest such ride in Sussex. Operators hope to open in time for this summer.
The would also be a jump zone to a safe landing area and a new cafe.
Paramount applied last year for permission to keep the Brighton Wheel open for another six years but councillors decided the attraction was "detrimental" to the nearby historic buildings.
"We always remained interested in the idea of another attraction to replace the wheel," said council leader Warren Morgan.
"Now we have a proposal with much less visual impact for the neighbours.
"An attraction on that site is desirable because it brings life to the area - and one of our ambitions is to regenerate the seafront between the pier and the marina."
