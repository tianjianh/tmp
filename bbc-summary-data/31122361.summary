[SN]TITLE[SN]
St Peter Port compensated over Guernsey binmen scam

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Compensation of Â£180,000 will be paid to a Guernsey parish after four former States binmen were convicted of carrying out private waste collections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The binmen made the private collections while carrying out collections in St Peter Port, leading to the parish being overcharged for waste being dumped.
The binmen were ordered to carry out community service last year.
The money from the States has been paid to the parish, but will be passed on to residents through reduced refuse rates.
Senior Constable Dennis Le Moignan said: "I am pleased that we have been able to settle this by negotiation and I am content that we have negotiated a fair and reasonable settlement for St Peter Port ratepayers."
The level of the compensation was calculated by looking at the difference between the amount of waste collected before and after the fraudulent collections were discovered.
Colette Falla, public services deputy chief officer, said: "All our staff are aware of their responsibilities, which is the main guard against something like this ever happening again.
"However, we also acknowledge the historic record-keeping was not what we consider sufficient now, so we have also made some procedural changes in recent years.
"Those changes, such as installing trackers on all our vehicles, were not all directly a response to this case. However, they provide additional reassurance, should it be needed."
