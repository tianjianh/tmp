Get Inspired: BBC presenters back This Girl Can campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
You may be more used to watching them sweating it out in the confines of a television or radio studio but now some of the BBC's best-known female presenters have got off their backsides to get active.

Very active.
Gabby Logan, Suzi Perry, Jo Whiley, Helen Skelton and Louise Minchin are just a few of the 21 familiar faces featured in our version of This Girl Can - a national campaign to inspire women of all ages to exercise.
This Girl Can is a Sport England initiative to inspire women of all ages to participate in physical activity and exercise.
Who else is sweating it out in our verison of This Girl Can?
You can watch Kirsty Wark on a chest press machine, Arlene Phillips in a spin class and Anna Foster braving it in her swimming costume. Our video proves that women of all ages can participate in sport and exercise, sweat as much as they like and still be confident about their appearance.
Women are less likely than men to become active because of body image and competency fears, according to Sport England research, so the This Girl Can campaign uses slogans such as "Sweating like a pig, feeling like a fox" and images of normal women enjoying sport.
And this tribute film was created to support the message that we as a society need to acknowledge and then break down the emotional barriers that stop a lot of British females from getting active.
The celebrities all volunteered their time for the filming of the video, jumping (sometimes literally) at the chance to be involved. In fact, we had to turn some of the presenters away!
Filming took place in Manchester, Glasgow and London over a three-week period, which saw our presenters taking part in 17 different physical activities including walking, running, numerous exercise classes, gym activities and sports such as netball, football, wall climbing and squash.
