Neath-born Lloyd played 147 first-class and 95 limited-overs games for the county between 1972 and 1984, later playing Minor Counties cricket for Wales.
He claimed a total of 311 wickets with his off-spin, with a career-best performance of 8-70.
Lloyd shared captaincy duties with Javed Miandad during the 1982 season.
He was on the Lord's ground staff and went to Bangor Normal College before becoming a regular in the Glamorgan side between 1978 and 1982, taking his best haul of 55 first-class wickets in 1982.
His daughter Hannah represented England in five one-day internationals.
"Barry was hugely supportive of the young Welsh players in the squad and always wore the daffodil with pride," said Glamorgan chief executive Hugh Morris, who played under Lloyd's captaincy.
"His passing is very sad news for us here at Glamorgan as well as for the wider cricket community in Wales, especially Pontarddulais.
"We send our thoughts and prayers to his family and wide circle of friends at this most difficult time."
Lloyd continued to play club cricket with Pontarddulais' first XI until 2010.
Pontarddulais chairman Keith Griffiths said: "It is a very sad day for Welsh cricket and for us all at the club, not only players, but officials and spectators who were very fond of Barry.
"His death has touched everyone here within the club and the local community."
