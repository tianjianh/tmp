The bodies of two dogs were also found at the address, following what police are treating as an "isolated incident".
A spokesman said: "[We] would like to reassure the community that there is no wider risk.
"Formal identification procedures are ongoing and we will not be in a position to confirm the names of the deceased until these are complete."
Specialist support is being provided for the family and officers will remain at the crime scene overnight, the force said.
