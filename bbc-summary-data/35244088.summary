[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Parsons and Andrew Cox, both 26 and from Bristol, targeted branches in Treforest, Rhondda Cynon Taff, and Bridgend, Cardiff Crown Court heard.
Parsons admitted burglary and conspiracy to cause an explosion and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years.
Cox pleaded guilty to burglary, attempted burglary and conspiracy to cause an explosion and was jailed for eight years on Tuesday.
Previously, two other men were jailed for taking part in the same burglaries.
The gang smashed their way into banks using sledgehammers, causing £182,000 worth of damage.
The court heard the blasts sent the safes flying out of the cash machines in the bank walls and across the floor.
Parsons and Cox targeted banks on Treforest Industrial Estate and Bridgend Industrial Estate in 2014.
Recorder of Cardiff, Eleri Rees, said: "If you make good use of your time in prison you could resolve to come out and live a different kind of life, if not for you but for others."
