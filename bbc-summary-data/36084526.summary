[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stirling farmer Martyn Steedman bought the Sea King helicopter in an online MoD auction for Â£7,000 and decided turn it into accommodation.
It will cater for a family of five and will have a dining area in the cockpit, a mini kitchen and an en-suite shower.
The helicopter retired from active service in 1994 and was used in naval training until 2002.
The idea for the conversion came to Mr Steedman during the Sea Kings' final fly past over Stirling earlier this year, which marked the end of active service for the entire fleet.
He said: "We couldn't bear to see these much-loved helicopters go on the scrapheap and thought 'why not give one a new life in the country?'
The 17m (56ft) long Sea King ZA127 aircraft was driven 320 miles by road from Grantham, Lincolnshire, to Mains Farm Wigwams, Thornhill, Stirlingshire, on Tuesday before a crane lifted it into position at the campsite.
