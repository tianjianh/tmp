Tipperary reach first All-Ireland SFC semi-final since 1935 as they stun Galway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tipperary produced a remarkable display of attacking football to reach their first All-Ireland semi-final since 1935 as they beat Galway 3-13 to 1-10.

Galway led 0-4 to 0-1 after 15 minutes but Tipp then hit 1-6 without reply with Michael Quinlivan netting.
Damien Comer's goal cut Tipp's lead to 1-8 to 1-5 at half-time but two second-half goals from Conor Sweeney helped seal the Premier County's deserved win.
Tipperary will face either Tyrone or Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-finals.
On the evidence of Sunday's game, neither Tyrone boss Mickey Harte or Mayo manager Stephen Rochford will underestimate Liam Kearns' side in the semi-final.
In Sunday's other quarter-final, Kerry eased to a 2-16 to 0-11 victory over Clare.
The sides were level at 0-3 to 0-3 after 20 minutes but Donnchadh Walsh's goal started a Kerry scoring burst of 1-4 which helped the Kingdom lead 1-8 to 0-4 at half-time.
Darran O'Sullivan's second goal put further daylight between the teams as Kerry progressed to a semi-final meeting with either holders Dublin or Donegal.
