The festival at Whitby Pavilion featured fire breathing, cabaret and martial arts for Victorian gentlemen.
Organisers said the aim of the event - called Beyond The Sea - was "to welcome splendid people", and have fun.
Steampunk has been described as "nostalgia for what never was" and draws on a wide variety of influences from HG Wells to comics.
