C&C Group says trading hit by drink-drive law and bad weather

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stricter drink-drive legislation in Scotland is continuing to have an impact on sales for Irish drinks firm C&C Group, the company has said.

C&C warned rural and community pubs seemed to have been "disproportionately affected" by the lower limit, which came into force in December.
Its comments came as C&C reported a "weak trading environment" in the three months to the end of May.
Its brands include Tennent's lager, Bulmers and Magners cider.
In an interim management statement, C&C said trading conditions in the first quarter were mixed, with the group's core markets of Ireland and Scotland "impacted by unseasonably cold and wet weather, particularly in May".
It added: "The recent tightening of 'drink-driving' regulation in Scotland adds to the challenges already faced by the on-premise channel and rural/community pubs appear to have been disproportionately affected."
However, C&C said its business in England and Wales had had a positive first quarter, and was trading in line with expectations.
It added: "Following weaker than expected trading conditions in the first quarter, we anticipate a gradual improvement in core market performance as the year progresses.
"In the US and other export markets, a return to growth is the target."
