Ireland is hoping to get its own tall ship, thanks to a Â£12m (16m euro) cross-border project.

Chair of Belfast's Tall Ships board, Dr Gerard O'Hare, said the Irish government would part-fund the project.
"We have a project under way, it's a cross-border project, for a new sail training tall ship for Ireland," he told the Good Morning Ulster programme.
"We hope at least part of the ship will be built at Harland and Wolff in Belfast."
Mr O'Hare added: "Since the loss of the Asgard and the Lord Rank, in theory Ireland doesn't have a sail training ship for young people.
"A new project is under way and we hope that over the next few years, Ireland will have its own sail training tall ship.
"It's being funded partly by the Irish government and we are hoping for public and private sector investment."
Mr O'Hare said the project would need a Â£12m (16m euro) budget.
"We hope to take part of the ship - maybe the finishing out of the ship - back to Belfast, to make sure it's a Belfast-built tall ship," he added.
Meanwhile, the Tall Ships festival is in its second day in Belfast.
The organisers estimate 500,000 people will attend the four-day festival.
Belfast is the home port for the start of the Tall Ships Races this year.
About 50 vessels will be on show from 15 different countries until Sunday.
BBC Northern Ireland is bringing you full coverage of the tall ships across TV, radio and online.
