Denny Solomona: Castleford Tigers to take legal action against absent winger

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford Tigers are to take legal action against winger Denny Solomona after he failed to return to the club for pre-season training.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Solomona scored 40 tries in the 2016 season, including a record total of 40 in Super League.
Tigers chairman Steve Gill said in October that the 23-year-old Samoan was not for sale and would be returning to the club on 7 November.
BBC Sport understands Solomona has held talks with rugby union side Sale.
The Premiership club declined to comment on the story.
