George Robinson, a pupil at Stamford School in Lincolnshire, was injured playing against DF Malan in Cape Town on 27 July.
The 17-year-old, who has been on a ventilator since the incident happened, has undergone reconstructive surgery on broken vertebrae.
His family said he had showed immense courage to come through his ordeal.
George's father, Simon, said: "It has been a life-changing experience and injury for George and our family.
"George has responded positively to therapy after such a significant injury and there has been daily improvement in his condition; he is very close to being fully weaned off the ventilator that has been assisting his breathing for the past 37 days."
He added: "We know that we have a long journey ahead... and we will move into this next chapter with positivity, determination and hopefulness."
Mr Robinson will be flown home by air ambulance on Wednesday.
