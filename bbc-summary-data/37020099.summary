Six people have been injured when a house exploded and collapsed in Greater Manchester.

The blast caused the terraced house in Ashton-under-Lyne to collapse at both the front and back, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said.
One person suffered serious burns and five others suffered minor injuries, North West Ambulance Service said. They have been taken to hospital.
Emergency services were called to the scene in Curzon Road at 05:00 BST.
It is still the scene of a major operation here.
There is smoke billowing out of what used to be a mid-terraced house - the front and back wall completely destroyed and most of the roof as well.
It has also damaged properties either side - bricks have fallen out of the right-hand side property. There is a big hole in the roof and the glass has been blown out of the windows of the adjacent properties as well.
The air is thick with the smell of smoke.
Gas and electricity supplies have been turned off at the house and four neighbouring properties. The roof of the house next door has been badly damaged.
Fire service incident commander Alan Ashworth said: "When crews arrived there were a number of people injured on the floor and it was obvious there had been an explosion in the house.
"We haven't been able to go inside the house as both the front back walls have completely collapsed."
The cause of the explosion is not yet known.
The North West Ambulance service said one patient was taken to the Manchester Royal Infirmary, another to Wythenshawe Hospital and others to Tameside General Hospital.
Curzon Road, Whiteacre Road and Clinton Street are all closed and people have been asked to avoid the area if possible.
