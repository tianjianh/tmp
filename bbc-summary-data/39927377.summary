The 36-year-old left Manchester City last summer and joined Espanyol, before starting his second spell at Malaga in January.
His final game - if selected - will be Sunday's home match against Real Madrid, who could win La Liga.
Demichelis, who can also play in midfield, won 51 caps for Argentina and also played for River Plate and Bayern Munich.
"Unfortunately this day comes to us all," said the veteran. "I've been deliberating it for some time, as I have always been very worried about the end of a professional football career.
"I am grateful to the profession, and in this case Malaga in particular, because they extended my career as a professional footballer."
