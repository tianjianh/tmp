West Brom boss Tony Pulis says "life is too short" to worry about what has gone on in the past with Saido Berahino.

The former Baggies striker said the club offered him no support during an eight-week drugs ban, which came after "his drink was spiked" in a nightclub.
But Pulis said there were no hard feelings towards the 23-year-old, who joined Stoke in January.
"He left the club with me on good terms and I hope he does well," he told BBC Radio 5 live's Pat Murphy.
"He's at a club that I've got a lot of good feeling for and a lot of passion for, and I hope they have a great time together.
"West Brom have done fantastically well and we should spend more time talking about what we're doing at the moment, rather than about someone who has left," added Pulis.
Stoke City manager Mark Hughes says Berahino's interview with BBC's Football Focus adds "a little bit more meat on the bone".
"That's always been Saido's stance on how the drug was in his system and he's never wavered from that," added the 53-year-old.
"A lot of people have been victim to that and that's always been his stance so there's no reason to disbelieve him."
Berahino was sent to a conditioning camp in France in a bid to get him fit while at West Brom.
Pulis stands by his claim that the striker was unfit and overweight.
"When he was here we thought his fitness levels weren't what was required at that time," he said.
"The great thing about it was Stoke wanted him, we were happy with the deal and Saido was delighted. As long as they don't finish above West Brom and beat us in the league, of course I want Stoke to do well."
West Brom are eighth in the Premier League, seven points above Stoke who are 10th. On Saturday, the Baggies play at Manchester United, while the Potters have an away game at Leicester City.
