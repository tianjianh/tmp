World number one Jason Day, Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry are among those to have pulled out of the competition due to concerns about the Zika virus.
Garcia, 36, said he knew of the dangers but representing Spain and being an Olympian was "too important".
Zimbabwe's Brendon de Jonge has also withdrawn, but cited business reasons.
Masters winner Danny Willett said earlier this week he is willing to "risk" a trip to Brazil to compete in August.
The Zika virus is mosquito-borne and has been linked to defects in newborn babies, prompting those looking to start a family to take extra precautions.
Olympic chiefs and the World Health Organisation have issued guidance for athletes and visitors to Rio and say the risk of catching Zika is low.
Meanwhile, De Jonge's decision to withdraw comes as competing in Rio would mean missing two PGA Tour events.
De Jonge is 160th on the FedEx Cup points list and needs to finish in the top 125 at the end of the season to keep full playing rights.
