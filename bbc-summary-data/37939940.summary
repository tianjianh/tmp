A £6.6m plan to improve Llandrindod Wells War Memorial Hospital in Powys has won Welsh Government backing.

The cash will see improvements to outpatient facilities, and enhanced accommodation for day case, endoscopy and dental departments.
The hospital's new birthing unit will also benefit from extra investment.
The additional money is part of a pledge to continue spending on the hospital as part of the 2015-16 draft budget deal with the Liberal Democrats.
Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said the investment would "make a real difference to patients in mid Wales".
The outline agreement on spending follows £2.3m funding for work on the hospital roof and the birthing unit.
Improvements will also be made to the hospital's entrance and reception, while dental services will be relocated and improved.
Powys Teaching Health Board is now expected to finalise the full business case for the redevelopment in the new year, with work getting under way later in 2017.
