Two areas near Liverpool FC's stadium have been renamed in memory of the 96 Hillsborough victims and former Reds manager Bob Paisley.

The public spaces in Anfield are now called 96 Avenue and Paisley Square, the club said.
Ninety-six fans died in the UK's worst sporting disaster in April 1989 and an inquest jury earlier this year concluded they were unlawfully killed.
Liverpool won three European Cups in five years under Paisley.
96 Avenue is a tree-lined path in front of the main stand linking Walton Breck Road with Stanley Park and will house the permanent Hillsborough Memorial.
Paisley Square is at the corner of the Kop where it meets the main stand.
Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, said: "We are delighted that this beautiful area in front of the main stand will be named in memory of the 96."
Robert and Graham Paisley, Bob Paisley's sons, said: "It is truly an honour for our father to be recognised in this way."
They added that their father, who was manager from 1974 to 1983, "didn't like any fuss or being in the limelight but having the Paisley Gates and now the Paisley Square is true testament to the success that he had as manager".
