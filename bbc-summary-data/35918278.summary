[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cannabis, heroin, amphetamines, scales and gloves were recovered from the secluded campsite in Priddy in a police operation last July.
Richard and Ann Miles, of Brislington, Bristol were jailed for 11 and 12 years respectively. Three other men were jailed over the operation.
Police said they had "struck at the heart" of an organised crime group.
More than 40kg of amphetamines were found in the caravans, as well as heroin and cannabis. Arrests followed across London, Hertfordshire and Essex.
Mendip neighbourhood officer Inspector Mark Nicholson said those involved were "career criminals who chose to ply their trade in a quiet unassuming and idyllic part of Somerset, where they thought they were safe from prying eyes".
Police said they had seized drugs "worth £1.5m originally destined for the streets of the South West".
Richard and Ann Miles were both convicted of possession with intent to supply Class A and Class B drugs at Bristol Crown Court. Ann Miles was also convicted of conspiracy to supply class B drugs.
Their accomplice James Sanderson, from Lawrence Hill, Bristol, was jailed for three and a half years for possession and conspiracy to supply Class B drugs.
Bekir Arif, from Lewisham, south London, was jailed for 10 years for conspiracy to supply class B drugs - amphetamines with a street value of £1.5m. He had previously admitted breaching a serious crime prevention order.
Manny Carpel, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, was jailed for three years and four months for conspiracy to supply Class B drugs.
