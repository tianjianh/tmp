The world number one also beat Anderson, the world number two, in the PDC World Darts Championship final this month.
Dutchman Van Gerwen, 27, overcame England's Adrian Lewis 11-5 in the semi-finals earlier on Sunday.
Anderson had beaten 16-time world champion Phil Taylor 11-9 for a spot in the final in Milton Keynes.
Taylor, 56, has announced that 2017 will be his final year on the Professional Darts Corporation tour circuit.
However, he says he may still play in the Premier League and the World Series.
