The woman, who lived alone, was found dead inside the property in Broyle Lane, Ringmer, by fire crews called to the scene just before 05:00 on Friday.
Paddy Graffin said neighbours were unable to get into the detached house.
"Because of the heat and the flames and the smoke you couldn't do anything and we had to come away," he said.
"There was nothing else we could do. We just stood and waited for the fire brigade to turn up. We are all devastated."
Neighbour Anita Batchelor said she was appalled.
"It was all so tragic that it had to happen to somebody in her physical condition when she was completely incapacitated to take any action," she said.
Neighbours had previously helped care for the housebound woman who they said had lived in the property for decades.
She used to run a sweetshop and newsagent's there, they said.
Sussex Police said the woman's family have been informed of her death and the coroner has been informed.
The cause of the fire is being investigated and is being treated as unexplained.
