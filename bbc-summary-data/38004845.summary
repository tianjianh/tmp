Next year they will compete in the Toulon Tournament for the first time against the elite of youth football.
But who are the new generation hoping to bring more success to Wales and echo the success of Chris Coleman's senior side? BBC Wales Sport looks at Wales' hopes for the future.
The U19s missed out on qualification for the elite round of next summer's Uefa U19 Championship in a peculiar way on Tuesday night, even though they thrashed Luxembourg 6-2.
Despite finishing level on six points with Group 6 rivals England and Greece, Wales will not travel to Georgia for next year's tournament.
The top two qualifying places were decided on a head-to-head record between England, Greece and Wales, meaning Williams' side missed out as they had an inferior goal difference, despite beating England 3-2 in Bangor on 12 November.
"Unfortunately we came one goal short. I said to the lads, if we left something out there or we hadn't prepared properly, then we would have been annoyed," Williams told BBC Wales Sport.
"I'm very proud and I'm devastated for these young men because they couldn't have done any more."
Manchester United's 18-year-old midfielder Regan Poole has been tipped to be one of Wales' future stars and believes the current crop of youngsters can go far.
Poole, who was signed from Newport County on deadline day in the summer of 2015, has made one senior appearance for United, in last season's Europa League.
Speaking to BBC Wales Sport, Poole said: "We have a very good side here. We scored six goals against Luxembourg and we beat England who are a very good side. It shows that the players coming through the young Welsh system are all good.
"There's huge competition in any age group. That's a huge compliment to Wales football and how far it's come and I'm very proud of it."
Norwich City goalkeeper Fergal Hale-Brown was part of the 18-man U19s squad for qualifying but has been called up by England U15s in the past and has trained with the Republic of Ireland.
Goalkeeper Adam Przybek received a call-up to the Wales U19 side but has previously played for England U16s and is also eligible to play for Poland.
Chelsea's Cole DaSilva, who played against his brother Jay when Wales U19s beat England U19s, was also part of the squad but has featured for England U16s along with Exeter City prospect Ethan Ampadu.
Eastbourne-born Watford player Rhyle Ovenden qualifies to play for Wales through his grandfather and Wolves' Ryan Leak, who is from Burton-upon-Trent, is eligible for Wales through his grandmother.
Manchester City's Matt Smith hails from the West Midlands, but has played for Wales at various youth levels and West Bromwich Albion's Tyler Roberts, currently on loan with Oxford United, was selected for England at schoolboy level but qualifies for Wales through his grandparents.
Meanwhile, Liverpool's Chester-born Ben Woodburn wants to emulate fellow Welsh players Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale, who both came through the Wales youth ranks and are now key players in the senior side.
In addition to Poole, Wales have plenty of young talent to draw upon when they travel to France next year and Coleman has much to be excited about for talent coming through to the senior side.
Everton's Ryan Harrington and Nathan Broadhead have both made an impression, while U18s keeper Aaron Jones is also a prospect.
Cardiff City pair Cameron Coxe and Mark Harris are highly thought of, while Jack Evans, Liam Cullen and Kieran Evans, all of Swansea City, have been earmarked to shine.
