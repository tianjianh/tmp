He was speaking at a meeting in south Belfast that he organised to discuss the political way forward.
The debate was held at Belfast's Lyric Theatre on Tuesday.
Party activists will vote later this month at the annual SDLP conference in Armagh. Mr McDonnell said he would win.
Among the speakers at the Lyric were Prof Deirdre Heenan, Ulster University; political commentators Ryan Feeney and David McCann and lobbyist Brendan Mulgrew.
Last week, former SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon endorsed Mr Eastwood.
Earlier this year, Mr Mallon called on Dr McDonnell to step down.
He replied that he was "entitled to his opinion".
