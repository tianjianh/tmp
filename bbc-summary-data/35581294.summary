[SN]TITLE[SN]
Borders General Hospital bed 'high demand' continues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Borders has said it expects continued "high demand" for beds at the Borders General Hospital after a weekend of "exceptional pressure".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It said the public response to an appeal only to use its A&E department for genuine emergencies had been "extremely supportive".
However, it stressed demand was likely to remain high.
A sickness bug has shut one ward while icy conditions were likely to increase the number of slip and fall injuries.
The public is being discouraged from visiting ward 12 during the bug outbreak.
They have also been reminded that community pharmacists can provide "expert advice and treatment" for a range of common illnesses and ailments.
