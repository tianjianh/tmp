[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Under-fire Valencia coach Gary Neville was sent to the stands as his team were knocked out of the Europa League on away goals by Athletic Bilbao.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts levelled the aggregate score at 1-1 through Santi Mina and went ahead through a superb Santos header.
But Aritz Aduriz scored a crucial late goal following a Raul Garcia flick.
An incensed Neville was punished for protesting against an apparent handball in the build-up to the goal and replays suggest his claims were legitimate.
The ball did appear to make contact with Oscar de Marcos' arm before it fell to Garcia, whose brilliant touch found Aduriz to score his 31st goal of the season.
The former Manchester United defender, 41, was already under intense scrutiny after a run of three straight defeats which included a 1-0 league loss to bottom-of-the-table Levante on Sunday.
But Valencia were the better side against a team who are six places above them in the league and were on a five-game winning streak in all competitions prior to the match.
Paco Alcacer had a chance to rescue his team in the dying minute only for Iago Herrerin to save from point-blank range, while a Parejo free-kick in added time was a fraction wide.
Sevilla, winners for the past two years, became the first team to reach the Europa League last eight in three consecutive seasons.
The Spaniards extended their unbeaten home run to 17 in all competitions with a 3-0 defeat of a Basel team who had earned a 0-0 draw in the first leg.
Elsewhere, Villarreal - enjoying a 2-0 first-leg lead - reached the last eight after holding Bayer Leverkusen to a goalless draw in Germany.
Sparta Prague beat Lazio 3-0 in Rome with goals from Borek Dockal, Ladislav Krejci and Lukas Julis boosting the aggregate score to 4-1.
Sporting Braga (agg 4-2) and Shakhtar Donetsk (agg 4-1) also progressed, knocking out Fenerbache and Anderlecht respectively.
