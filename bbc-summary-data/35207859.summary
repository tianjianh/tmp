In a new year message, the PM says he is determined to "secure our future" with the EU referendum, which could be held in 2016.
Jeremy Corbyn says 2016 will mark the "start of the journey" towards a Labour government.
In his new year's message, the Labour leader pledges to fight austerity.
Mr Corbyn, who has faced criticism from some MPs since winning the leadership election in September, says he was elected "on a mandate for change".
With his first major electoral tests looming in May's local and devolved administration elections, he says his party will "offer a real alternative: a politics that gives people a say in the decisions that affect them, and an economy based on long-term investment, instead of self-defeating austerity".
The Labour leader says he will tackle David Cameron's government "much more" on cuts to local councils and lack of investment.
Mr Cameron says some people choose to "shout into megaphones, wave banners and sign petitions".
He adds: "But we're the ones who are able to make the arguments and take the difficult decisions in order to defeat these social scourges and deliver real security. So while others are on protest marches, we remain on the long walk to a greater Britain."
He promises "real social renewal" in tackling poverty and improving social mobility, repeats pledges on house-building and says the government will "respond with vigour" to an extremism review later in the year.
Tim Farron uses his first New Year's message as Lib Dem leader to criticise Labour and the Tories for being divided.
He criticises government cuts to Universal Credit and policing and says more should be done to support refugees fleeing Syria.
