Baba, 20, a contemporary dancer from London, was crowned at Sadler's Wells theatre in the capital by ex-Royal Ballet star Darcey Bussell.
Baba - who started ballet aged three - is a company member with post-graduate dance company Chrysalis London.
The competition, shown on BBC2, saw non-professional dancers aged 16 to 21 receive coaching and mentoring.
Entrants were chosen last year after submitting a video of two solo pieces. A range of dance styles were represented, from South Asian to ballet.
The mentors included former Royal Ballet principal ballerina Viviana Durante and dancer DJ Renegade.
Baba received a trophy and Â£3,000 to help support her dance studies.
The final and each performance from the category final are available to watch online.
