Tring School, in Hertfordshire, said it had "explicitly and repeatedly" made clear its dress code to pupils and parents.
Head teacher Sue Collings said the school was "very proud" of its "values, achievements and aspirations".
Parents criticised the move on social media, and one said her daughter felt "humiliated".
"She's now at the point at which she says she feels humiliated in front of all her friends, she doesn't want to go in on Monday," she told BBC Three Counties Radio.
Another parent said: "My daughter has been sent home again because of the length of her skirt. "
In a statement, Ms Collings said: "In our communications we stated that students who were incorrectly dressed will be told to improve their uniform to the necessary standard before attending lessons.
"If students were able to immediately go home and then return in the correct uniform they would be welcomed into lessons today.
"If students could not go home, or didn't have the correct clothes, then they would be supervised in school and they would be expected to acquire the correct uniform over the weekend before going to lessons on Monday.
"The school has stated our expectations and consequences explicitly and repeatedly."
The school's dress code on the website states: "Skirts must be black, knee length and be of a pleated design."
