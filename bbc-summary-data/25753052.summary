The NBA star's commitment will be subject to his contract situation in the United States.
"I had a really good discussion around Christmas and some good feedback from the players," he said in a statement released by British Basketball.
The forward  from the Chicago Bulls earlier this month.
He added: "I'm really excited about playing with Great Britain again and hope to get my free agency sorted so I can make this happen.
"I'm eager to get back in that GB jersey and on the road to Rio 2016."
Deng has won 42 caps for his country.
He becomes a free agent in the summer and would need to sort out his next move before he can fully commit to Great Britain coach Joe Prunty's team.
Prunty is also assistant coach of the Brooklyn Nets, who play the Atlanta Hawks at London's O2 Arena on Thursday.
Great Britain will find out who they will play in the EuroBasket Qualifiers when the draw is made in Barcelona on 3 February.
