[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 4-1 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One leaders Scunthorpe were in rampant mood as they put four past strugglers Swindon Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Irons striker Paddy Madden opened the scoring with a close-range finish after meeting a cross from left-back Conor Townsend
Duane Holmes made it 2-0 soon after, sweeping his shot under the body of goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux after a flowing move down the right had opened up the Swindon defence.
Any hopes the visitors might have had of getting themselves back into the game disappeared as Scunthorpe struck twice more just before the interval.
In the 43rd minute striker Kevin Van Veen capitalised on a poor back pass by lifting the ball over the advancing Vigouroux before crashing a confident left-foot shot into the net for his eighth goal of the season.
And on the stroke of half-time Madden struck again with his second of the game, netting the rebound after a great run into the box by Van Veen produced an angled shot that crashed back off the woodwork.
Swindon made a double substitution at the start of the second half, bringing on Lloyd Jones and Michael Doughty.
They reduced the arrears in the 52nd minute when skipper Nathan Thompson headed home from a left-wing corner from Sean Murray - their first threat of the match.
Scunthorpe continued to look dangerous going forward, often having Swindon at full stretch.
But they could not find the same finishing touch of the opening half.
The nearest they came to another goal was a flashed header from Madden, which Vigouroux did well to keep out at full stretch.
