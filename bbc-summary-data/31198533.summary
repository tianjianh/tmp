Jeremy Meeks, the man known as the 'hot criminal', has been sentenced to more than two years in prison on a gun charge.

The 30-year-old, whose mugshot went viral when it was released, was arrested last June in a gang crackdown.
He pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm and has been jailed for 27 months and ordered to take part in a substance abuse programme.
Meeks became an online sensation when his photo generated 95,000 likes.
"Hottttttt," wrote Melissa Stiles on the Stockton Police Department's Facebook page.
"OMG come to mama," Nicole Seba Lorena Elena commented.
"Holy [heck] I would arrest him too... hottest bad boy I've seen," wrote Ellie Abbey.
"Why is he breaking the law when he should be making millions modelling! Wowzas," said Tanya H. Thomas.
His photo shows off his light blue eyes and teardrop tattoo - which is often thought to represent being linked to a gang.
The picture was trending on Twitter as #hotfelonfriday and #stillpretty.
His mugshot inspired memes like "The only crime he's guilty of is stealing your heart" and "I'm too sexy for shackles."
A Facebook community set up for Meeks also posted pictures under the nickname "Dreamy McMugshot."
It turns out his rap sheet is not so pretty though, in the last 10 years he's been arrested for theft, fraud and forgery.
Officer Joseph Silva, a spokesman for the Stockton Police Department, called him "One of the most violent criminals in the area."
They also claim he's an active gang member, something Meeks has denied in the past telling ABC News in the States he was, "not some kingpin."
