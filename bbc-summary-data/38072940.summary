Former United States boss Bob Bradley hopes President-elect Donald Trump will put his "ugly" campaign tactics aside as the country aims to stage the Olympics and World Cup.

Trump has said he would ban Muslims from entering the US and that a wall would be built on the Mexican border.
The US hopes to stage the 2024 Olympics in Los Angeles, and the 2026 World Cup either alone or with Mexico.
"I didn't like any part of the Trump campaign," said Bradley.
"Everything the President does in terms of domestic policy and international relations determines how you are received in all different areas, including sports.
"If you want to be optimistic you just have to hope that the responsibilities of the job make a big difference in the way Trump handles himself. Because if you just go by the campaign, for me it was divisive and ugly."
The Swansea City manager, who has also managed the Egypt national team as well as Stabaek in Norway and Le Havre in France, has not worked in his home country since his five-year spell as USA boss ended in 2011.
Trump's comments during his campaign had raised concerns the United States may miss out on staging the Olympics and World Cup.
Bradley said: "I can't put up with the type of values that don't include an understanding of people that come from different backgrounds. And I can't put up with values that don't take into account that people sometimes don't have everything that you have.
"I think our country was built upon caring about people who came from different places."
Swansea City are bottom of the Premier League and have not won since Bradley replaced Francesco Guidolin on 3 October.
