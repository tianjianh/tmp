A union representing Tube staff has suspended talks aimed at averting another strike after raising an "emergency" safety issue.

The RMT said Transport for London (TfL) was "winging it" by allowing untrained staff to direct trains out of depots.
The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) is investigating the claims, but said its meeting with the RMT could have been deferred to make way for talks at Acas.
TfL said the safety issues raised had already been cleared by the ORR.
The RMT (Rail, Maritime and Transport union) reported that managers without a Safety Critical License had been allowed to direct Tubes out of the depot and on to the tracks at Upminster and Stonebridge Park.
It said the situation illustrated TfL was operating with a shortage of staff.
Geoff Martin from the union said: "Seeing the trains out of the depot is an incredibly skilled job. They have an air traffic control system to get them out and it requires years and years of training and certification. They were winging it.
"The strike talks have had to be suspended until we have a satisfactory conclusion on this safety issue.
"The strike action goes ahead regardless," he added.
But Steve Griffiths from London Underground said: "We have already met the ORR and our agreed processes... have been fully risk assessed and approved."
The ORR said it was looking into the allegations and was meeting the RMT on Tuesday to take statements, but said the meeting could have been deferred to make way for talks at conciliatory service Acas, aimed at averting the next planned Tube strike on 5 August.
The RMT was set to meet TfL and three other unions - Aslef, Unite and the TSSA - which are also planning to strike for 24 hours over the proposed pay and conditions of the new Night Tube service.
Acas said: "We are currently in touch with all parties to try and arrange talks to resume later in the week."
The four unions previously walked out on 9 July causing the entire Tube network to shut down.
