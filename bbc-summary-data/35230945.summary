[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ferry damaged during severe weather will stay out of service until the end of February, its operator has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Condor Liberation was damaged when the vessel was blown against its berth in Poole Harbour in December.
Condor said the repairs were scheduled for the quietest point of the year and services were unlikely to be affected.
The Â£50m vessel has offered the only fast ferry between Guernsey, Jersey and the UK, since March.
The belting above the water line, designed to protect the ship's hull, was damaged in the Dorset port by Storm Frank.
The firm had originally planned to put the older Condor Rapide into dry dock in January for planned maintenance, which is a legal requirement.
However, since the Liberation was damaged maintenance on the two vessels has been switched.
Condor said both ferries would be in service for the February half-term school holiday, with the Rapide returning to the dry dock at the end of the month.
