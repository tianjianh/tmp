The 25-year old had trailed the world number three 7-4, but fought back and levelled the match with a clearance of 142 - the tournament's highest break - to earn himself £5,000.
Trump took the next three frames to land himself the title and an additional £100,000.
It is his first title since winning the Australian Open in July.
"It's a great feeling to beat Ronnie in a big final for the first time," Trump told World Snooker.
"You don't want to lose too many times in a row against the same player. Two times is already a lot, and going behind 7-4, I thought it was just going to be the same thing.
"I felt comfortable out there. I took confidence from making the 142 to go 7-7, and after that I didn't really miss a lot. I missed the blue in the last frame, but other than that I felt I dominated."
