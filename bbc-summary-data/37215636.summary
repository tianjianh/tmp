[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Froome moved back into third in the Vuelta as Nairo Quintana won stage 10 to regain the overall lead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colombian Quintana attacked early on Monday's long final climb and regularly shed competitors to win by 24 seconds.
Froome was dropped from the leading group by the initial attack, but set his own pace up the mountain and relentlessly reeled in all bar two of the other riders to finish third.
Team Sky rider Froome, 31, is 58 seconds behind Quintana overall.
The Colombian's team-mate Alejandro Valverde lies a second ahead of the Briton in second place in the overall standings, while overnight leader David de la Cruz fell back to seventh overall.
Froome is aiming to become the first man in 38 years to win the Vuelta and Tour de France in the same season.
