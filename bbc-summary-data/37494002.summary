Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 21, was killed in Home Hill, near Townsville, last month while working for a second visa.
Rosie Ayliffe, believes her daughter was aware of "dangers" and avoided one farm "because they only took young girls."
Visitors must complete three months of "specified work" to get another visa.
Smail Ayad, 29, has been charged with Mia's murder and that of fellow backpacker Thomas Jackson.
Ms Ayliffe is now campaigning for regulation of Australian farm work.
"They've (girls like Mia) gone into the farm work knowing the dangers," she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.
"She chose not to go to one farm because they only took young girls.
"She was [aware and] worried about sexual exploitation and that is another thing that is an issue."

Stefan Wathan, chief executive of the Year Out Group, said the majority of farms would want to appeal to travellers.
"I don't think it is in the best interests of farmers to have bad practice on their farm.
"Having people getting injured earns them a bad reputation and the Australian economy relies on working holiday visas.
"My advice would be to live by your instincts, if something doesn't feel right, act."
Ms Ayliffe says the Australian authorities are aware of her campaign but have yet to contact her.
She also understands Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will be "watching the media" for any developments in the case.
