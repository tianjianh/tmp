The images were all taken from midday-to-midday on 16 and 17 April and the contest was  open to anyone with a camera or a mobile phone.
The overall winner was Paolo Ferla who took "Electric Bristol" - a picture of the Clifton Suspension Bridge.
Megan Witty, from 24 Hours In Bristol, said the judges had had "an incredibly tough job" picking a winner.
The competition involves entrants being "randomly allocated" one hour of the day or night in which they must take at least one photograph.
Mr Ferla, from Bath, said he was "delighted" to have won.
He said he used a 10 second self-timer and then ran into the shot.
"Ten seconds is not very long so it took quite a few attempts - when we got there the sky was still quite bright, so we sat there for nearly 20 minutes waiting for the sky to get darker.
"It's a beautiful bridge and as soon as the sun sets on it and the sky gets darker and the electric lights come on - it just comes to life. "
Ms Witty said the six judges "didn't always agree" and one said it had been "heartbreaking" for some not to win. She said about 75% were taken on cameras and about 25% on mobile phones.
The exhibition is at the Harbourside Arts Centre near Millennium Square and runs until the middle of June.
