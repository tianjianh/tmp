Eifion Gwynne, 41, died last month and previously expressed his wish to be buried at Plascrug Cemetery, Aberystwyth.
The only plots left are for people with an exclusive right of burial.
But Ceredigion council confirmed a plot has now been transferred to the family.
It means Mr Gwynne can be buried in the cemetery when the funeral for the father-of-three and former Aberystwyth and Llandovery rugby player takes place on Saturday.
Family friend Wayne Thomas told BBC Wales  Mr Gwynne had discussed his wishes with his wife Nia.
"He always said he wanted to be buried in this cemetery, it's close to the rugby club and it's close to his home," he said.
A memorial fund set up in Mr Gwynne's memory has raised almost Â£12,000 in donations.
Confirming a plot had been made available, Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn said: "A family who had reserved a plot came forward and offered it to Nia and family.
"We were very pleased that the council was able to help with ensuring this. We offer our deepest sympathy to the family at this very difficult time."
