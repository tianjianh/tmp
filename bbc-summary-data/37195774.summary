A campaign has been launched to erect a statue of rock 'n' roller Eddie Cochran in the Wiltshire town where he died.

The 21-year-old American musician was killed in a car crash in Chippenham in April 1960, following a gig in Bristol.
The singer was returning to London at the end of a UK tour when the taxi he was in span into a lamp post. The spot is marked with a memorial plaque.
Campaigners are now hoping to raise £10,000 to repair the memorial plaque and to create a "significant statue".
Gareth Inker, who set up the fundraising campaign, said the town's memorial plaque had been there a long time and was in a "bit of a state".
"It's visited by thousands every year - people come from all over the world to pay tribute," he said.
"But it's been damaged by grass cutting machines and the concrete base is crumbling and falling apart.
"So we're basically trying to raise money to repair the plaque and protect it and to also buy a statue - of the great man - for people to actually come and pay their respects to."
Described as "James Dean with a guitar", Eddie Cochran's two biggest songs were Summertime Blues and C'mon Everybody.
