Election 2015: More than four million Scots on voting roll

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than four million people in Scotland have registered to vote ahead of the UK general election, almost 106,000 more than in 2010.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Just over 4.2 million people registered to vote in last year's independence referendum, the largest electorate ever recorded in Scotland.
But this figure included 16 and 17-year-olds who are not eligible to vote on 7 May.
The deadline for registering to vote in the general election is 20 April.
With the exception of 2009, Scottish electorates have increased each year since 2003.
Figures from the National Records of Scotland show that by 2 March a total of 4.04 million people in Scotland had registered to vote in the 2015 general election.
