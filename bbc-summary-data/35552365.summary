Shrewsbury midfielder James Wesolowski has his hopes set on an early return to first team action despite initial fears that he was out for the season.

The Australian missed the second half of last season after rupturing medial and anterior ligaments in January.
The 28-year-old suffered a fresh injury in the same knee in September, in just the third game of his comeback.
But Town boss Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire: "I'm pretty sure he an eye on playing again this season."
Having worked hard on a concentrated fitness programme, Mellon says that his hard work looks like paying off.
"I don't want to put a time on him as that's not fair," he said. "But, with the progress he's making and the determination he's showing, he'll be playing some part and that would be massive for us.
"He's a big player for us. He's one of the best players at the club, so to lose him him was a massive blow not just for him but for the club."
The more optimistic news about Wesolowski comes on top of the loss of one of his replacements, on-loan James Wallace, who is to miss the FA Cup fifth-round tie with Manchester United, also with a knee injury.
