The files are a series of daily reports by the Dublin Metropolitan Police.
Those from 1 June 1915 until 5 June 1915 were released on Monday.
They include details of intelligence gathered at a number of locations in Dublin, including the Parnell Street shop of Thomas J Clarke, one of the key republicans behind the rising.
The report for 5 June 1915 states: "I beg to report that on the 4th inst. the undermentioned extremists were observed moving about and associating with each other as follows.
"Visited Thomas J Clarke, 75 Parnell Street: George Irvine for ten minutes between 11 and 12am; Thomas Byrne, Major John McBride, P Beasley, P Tobin, C Colbert and Miss Bolger, Enniscorthy, all in conversation with Clarke for close on an hour from 12.40pm."
There are several references to marches by Sinn Féin members.
A report from 4 June 1915 states: "Thirty members of the Sinn Féin Volunteers without rifles assembled at 25 Parnell Square at 6.30pm and afterwards in charge of P Beasley went route marching towards Fairview.
"They returned at 10.30pm. About the same hour 44 Sinn Féin members without rifles and in charge of Frank Fahy  marched from 21 Parnell Square towards Glasnevin.
"They returned at 10pm and dismissed without further parade."
Announcing the release of the documents, the Irish Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys, said they give a fascinating insight into the events leading up to the 1916 Rising.
Last year, military pension records of those who fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and Irish War of Independence were made available to the public online.
