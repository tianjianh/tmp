Deanna Lynn Greer, 37, and John David Cain, 26 were arrested after allegedly handing their baby to an undercover officer in return for the money.
They appeared in court on Monday and are being held on charges of aggravated child abuse.
The Greene County Sherriff's Office had been alerted to the advert on the online marketplace by another couple.
Sheriff Pat Hankins said the undercover officer then contacted the couple and arranged to meet them outside a discount supermarket, where the exchange was made.
"Can you believe this? We bought a baby. It makes my heart drop," the shocked officer told the Greenville Sun newspaper.
Mr Hankins says the child is in state custody.
