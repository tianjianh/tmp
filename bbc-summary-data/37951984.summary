[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieran Kiely, 24, had absconded from Castle Huntly prison four days earlier when he attacked Christopher Smith, 37, in Bellshill, on 17 July.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that the victim was repeatedly hit on the head with a half brick and kicked before police arrived.
Kiely admitted charges of assault, theft and attempted theft.
Jailing Kiely, judge Lord Boyd told him: "This was a vicious and unprovoked attack on a man who was unknown to you and going about his lawful business.
"It must have been a terrifying ordeal."
The court heard that Kiely started talking to Mr Smith about his Renault Clio 172 sport car as he tinkered under the bonnet.
Minutes later Kiely said he was going to steal the car before punching Mr Smith and then smashing a half brick into his face.
During the attack, Kiely managed to grab the car keys, house keys and mobile phone from Mr Smith's pockets and got into the Clio.
But Mr Smith, who was bleeding heavily from a head wound, managed to reach under the bonnet and pull out leads which immobilised the car.
He then ran off and shouted for help but was chased by Kiely who continued to kick and hit him with the brick.
Kiely then returned to the car and repeatedly tried to start it but ran off and threw away the keys when he saw police arriving.
Kiely was arrested and his clothes were later found to have Mr Smith's blood on them.
The victim suffered bruising to his face and three wounds on his head, which will leave permanent scarring.
The court heard that Kiely has a number of previous convictions which include car theft and assault and robbery.
