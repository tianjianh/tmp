Cruz, 35, will become the first openly gay boxing world champion if he wins, having lost a WBO world featherweight title bout with Orlando Salido in 2013.
Manchester fighter Flanagan is making the fourth defence of his title since becoming world champion in July 2015.
"I'm out to prove a point and show everyone I'm world class," he said.
The 27-year-old southpaw is also targeting a fight against Venezuela's WBA world lightweight holder Jorge Linares, who beat Anthony Crolla by a unanimous points decision in September.
"Linares in seen as number one in the division after beating Crolla and it would be good to get that fight and do something that Crolla couldn't do to prove I'm the best around," added Flanagan.
