At about 02:20 BST on Sunday, it was reported that shots had been fired at the windows of an unoccupied house in the Fort View area.
Police said a red Honda Accord car, believed to have been involved in the incident, was found burnt out on the Lisnevenagh Road, a short time later.
PSNI chief Inspector Natalie Wilson said the attack was "unacceptable".
"I know that the vast majority of people in Ballymena do not support those responsible," she said.
"I want to reassure the Ballymena community that we are determined to tackle these criminal elements and as such we are committing additional resources over the next few nights.
"We will not accept this type of behaviour and I would ask for community support and information as we work to identify those responsible."
