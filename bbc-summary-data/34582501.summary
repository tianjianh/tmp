Politicians have warned that the losses could have a devastating impact and unions have said as many as one in six steelworkers faces redundancy.
Where will the axe fall?
On 12 October 2015, the Insolvency Service confirmed the Redcar steelworks near Middlesbrough would close with the loss of 2,200 jobs.
Official receiver Ken Beasley said there was no "realistic" prospect of a sale - marking the end of the 98-year-old works.
Local Labour MP Anna Turley accused the government of throwing the towel in.
The government has said it will provide up to Â£80m to "support people who have lost their jobs as a result of SSI's liquidation, and mitigate the impacts on the local economy".
PwC administrators were appointed to parts of Caparo Industries' steel operations on 19 October.
PwC said it had taken over 16 out of 20 units within the group, which has plants across the UK, but mainly in the West Midlands.
The firm said 1,700 employees across the group would be briefed on the impact of administration, but would be paid as normal.
It is unclear how many jobs are at risk, but BBC sources said initial reports of 1,800 redundancies were wide of the mark.
Tata Steel announced on 20 October that nearly 1,200 jobs would go at its plants.
Some 900 jobs losses will come at its steel plant in Scunthorpe, which employs 4,000 people and is one of the largest in the UK.
The company also said 225 jobs would go at the Dalzell plate rolling works in Motherwell and 45 posts at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang.
Business Secretary Sajid Javid said the government had set up a task force to look at how to help the UK steel industry and its workers.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government would establish a Scottish Steel Task Force "to fight for a future for our steel industry".
The TUC has warned that one in six of the UK's 30,000 steelworkers now faces the prospect of losing their job.
General secretary Frances O'Grady has said: "At this rate there won't be a British steel industry in a year's time."
