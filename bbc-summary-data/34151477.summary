Pop singer Justin Bieber has scored his first UK number one track with What Do You Mean, his fastest-selling single in the UK to date.

It is only the third time the Canadian has had a solo Top 10 song in the UK, and his first since 2012's Boyfriend.
That number two hit notched up sales of 55,000, a total well beaten by his new song's combined sales total of 84,000.
What Do You Mean has had more than 21 million streams worldwide on Spotify, setting a new record for the service.
In the UK alone it has racked up 3.2 million plays on streaming services, the most any single has recorded in the UK in its first week.
The previous record was set last month by One Direction, whose Drag Me Down had 2.03 million plays in its first week on release.
Bieber's chart triumph comes at the expense of last week's number one, Rachel Platten's Fight Song, which drops one place to two.
The Weeknd - who, like Bieber, hails from the Canadian province of Ontario - follows at three with Can't Feel My Face.
Demi Lovato is the week's biggest climber, jumping 105 places to seven with Cool for the Summer, her fourth Top 10 single.
The Weeknd - real name Abel Tesfaye - tops the UK album chart with his latest release, Beauty Behind the Madness.
The record is one of three new entries in this week's top five, which also includes new records from Foals and Ella Eyre.
What Went Down, indie rockers Foals' fourth studio album is at three, while Eyre's debut album Feline follows at four.
Additional new entries, at nine and 10, from Halsey and Motorhead result in a Top 10 with half its slots occupied by new releases.
Bad Magic, Motorhead's 22nd album, is the veteran rockers' fourth Top 10 record and their first record in the Top 40 since 1991.
