Dumfries and Galloway festival funding fates revealed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Levels of proposed council funding for a string of festivals across Dumfries and Galloway have been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority will give out a total of £275,000 towards a variety of events in 2017/18.
The biggest single grants go to the Wigtown Book Festival and the Big Burns Supper in Dumfries.
However, they both face a reduction in their funding along with two other "signature events" - Spring Fling and Dumfries and Galloway Arts Festival.
A package of £94,000 has been recommended for four major events to be shared as follows:
A council panel agreed they could all see a reduction in funding after previous support had helped them to reach "much greater self-sufficiency".
It said backing should be directed at supporting a "new portfolio of growth events".
Funding for a further 12 events has been recommended with the full breakdown:
Both the Scottish Rally and the Galloway Hills Rally are to receive funding under the proposals.
The former will maintain its £21,000 support but the latter will have its financial backing cut from £9,000 to £6,000.
A total of £14,000 has also been allocated towards developing the overall festivals sector.
However, four events appear to have failed in their bids for council support.
No contribution has been recommended to the Challenger Series curling at Dumfries Ice Bowl, the Nithraid River Festival, the Sanctuary public art event in the Galloway Forest Park and the Ukulele Festival of Scotland.
