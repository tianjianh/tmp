Italian Turi Calafato's phone snapshot of two people sunbathing on the beach secured more than half the online public vote, with 6,700 votes.
The winners of the open and youth categories were also revealed, including three British photographers.
The overall winners will be announced at a ceremony on 23 April.
The mobile phone category was introduced this year to recognise how technology now allows us to capture everyday moments in our daily lives "which would otherwise go unnoticed".
Judges narrowed down 10,200 entries to a shortlist of 20 for the public vote, which saw Janos M Schmidt from Hungary take second place with this image of a train station.
Iran's Ako Salemi took third place in the mobile category, with this image of a child going head to head with a goat.
The winning photographers were chosen from more than 96,000 entries and include three British photographers.
Stephanie Anjo, 14, from Guildford in Surrey was the youngest British winner and one of three in the youth competition, winning the portraits category.
In the open competition, Antony Crossfield, who is based in Hackney in London, won the enhanced category.
Norman Quinn, who is based in Belfast, won the panoramic category in the open competition.
This image by Hector Munoz Huerta from Mexico won the arts and culture category.
Spain's Jaime Massieu won the "split second" category with this basketball image.
Antonie Weis - who has joint nationality from Switzerland and Luxemberg - won the nature and wildlife category with this image.
This photo by Wilson Lee of Hong Kong won the category entitled "smile". The thirteen category winners will now compete for the overall open photographer of the year and youth photographer of the year titles.
The images will be shown at Somerset House in London as part of the 2015 Sony World Photography Awards exhibition, which runs from 24 April - 10 May,
