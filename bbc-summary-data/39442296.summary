Saving Banksy explores attempts to preserve and profit from the anonymous Bristol artist's work.
The premiere is being held on Saturday 15 April at the Belmont Filmhouse, as part of the NuArt Aberdeen festival.
Belmont manager Colin Farquhar explained: "Banksy is a cultural phenomenon and we are sure the showing will be popular."
Banksy's images are daubed on walls around the world, and are worth vast sums of money.
James Finucane, general manager of the NuArt Festival, said: "Saving Banksy has received widespread critical acclaim since its release in the US earlier this year.
"It's a great coup for Aberdeen and a fascinating insight into current debates about street art practice and the traditional art establishment's efforts to remove the 'street' from 'street art'."
NuArt Aberdeen has been brought to the city by Aberdeen Inspired and Aberdeen City Council.
Adrian Watson, chief executive of business-led initiative Aberdeen Inspired, said: "Banksy symbolises the debate that goes on around street art and this film is a brilliant platform for discussion.
"We want to get people talking about art and bring it to a new audience in the city and are hugely looking forward to the premiere."
