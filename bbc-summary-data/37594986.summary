The 25-year-old took the first set after a tie-break before American eighth seed Keys fought back in a semi-final lasting two hours, 35 minutes.
The 11th seed will now face Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska in the final on Sunday.
The last British woman to make the world's top 10 was Jo Durie in 1984.
"It's really special, I feel very blessed to be coming back for the final," said Konta after a hard-earned victory in Beijing on Saturday.
Britain also has a finalist in the men's event, after world number two Andy Murray beat Spain's David Ferrer in straight sets.
Konta was ranked 146th in the world as recently as June 2015.
She is only the fourth British woman to make the top 10 since the WTA rankings began in 1975 - after Durie, Virginia Wade and Sue Barker.
Konta led 4-2 in the first set before losing three games in a row. She rallied to take the opening set on a tie-break before unravelling in the second as Keys took the tie into a third set.
Keys broke in the first game but Konta immediately responded before going on to secure a place in Sunday's final.

It really is a terrific accomplishment. To get into the top 10 you need to be consistent week after week on the tour.
It will give Konta better seeding at Grand Slams and other players will be very wary of her. She has been proving she can beat those in the top 10, that she belongs there and she is a player to watch out for.
You have a greater aura and take it onto the court. The only thing, which can sometimes be a negative, is the lower-ranked players are now gunning for you and seem to play their best against you.
It has all happened in last 15 months for Jo Konta. She has gone from 150 to the top 10. It is amazing. Next year she goes straight into the Australian Open where she got to the semi-final. She is very good at keeping in the moment, focussing on herself and it is literally point by point with her.
