Accrington Stanley 0-1 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Godden scored the winning goal as Stevenage overcame Accrington Stanley 1-0 to make it three League Two away wins on the bounce.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In conditions made tricky by persistent rain, Stanley dominated the first half but could not take their chances.
Jordan Clark's early shot was punched away by keeper Jamie Jones, while Stanley defender Zac Vyner came close with a 20-yard effort and Shay McCartan's mazy run into the area ended with his shot being deflected onto the roof of the net.
On the stroke of half-time Omar Beckles then raced onto the end of a Sean McConville corner but his powerful header went just over the bar.
But the visitors controlled the second half and there were several goalmouth scrambles before the Boro pressure finally told.
On  71 minutes, Godden collected the ball on the edge of the area from a long pass forward and his shot squirmed under goalkeeper Elliot Parish.
But Stevenage keeper Jones had to pull off a superb save to deny John O'Sullivan an equaliser three minutes from time.
