[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mary Bowers, 31, suffered a severe brain injury and multiple fractures in the crash that left her trapped underneath a four-tonne lorry, in east London in November 2011.
Driver Petre Beiu was found guilty of careless driving in 2012.
Mr Justice Supperstone approved the settlement at a High Court hearing.
Journalist Ms Bowers' father, Peter, of East Malling in Kent, said he was "relieved that she will have access to vital funds which will help go toward specialist treatment."
He described the impact of his daughter's injuries as "devastating" and called on the government to do more to reduce accidents involving cyclists.
The undisclosed compensation amount will be paid for by Beiu's insurers.
The lorry driver was fined Â£2,700 and disqualified for eight months, after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court.
