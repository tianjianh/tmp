[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gateshead 0-0 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead were unable to get back to winning ways after being held to a draw by Solihull Moors at Gateshead International Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Solihull goalkeeper Nathan Vaughan almost gifted Gateshead, who lost to lowly North Ferriby last time out, an early goal.
He slipped in the second minute, with striker Danny Johnson lurking, but managed to recover in time.
From there both keepers had to be on fine form during a tense first 45 minutes, with Johnson continuing to cause problems while Jack Byrne forced a great save out of Gateshead's Dan Hanford in the 43rd minute.
Johnson missed a great chance to clinch it with 10 minutes to go, racing clear from substitute Sam Jones' flick-on only to fire straight at Vaughan from a tight angle.
