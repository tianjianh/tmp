[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side appeared to be heading for only their second win in nine games when Marley Watkins put them in front.
He rolled the ball home from Barnsley man of the match Matty James' pass after a break out of defence.
Adam Hammill should have added a second for Barnsley, but Lawrence converted Brett Pitman's cross to level before being booked for over-celebrating.
The result extended Ipswich's unbeaten run under former Barnsley centre-back Mick McCarthy to eight matches, but they remain 16th in the Championship table having drawn their past six games.
Barnsley stay 11th and 11 points adrift of the play-offs.
Christophe Berra glanced an early header just wide for the Tractor Boys, and home keeper Adam Davies made a double save to foil David McGoldrick and Cole Skuse.
Barnsley saw a number of chances before Watkins produced a controlled finish into the corner under pressure from the Ipswich defence to finally gave them the lead.
The last word went to Lawrence, though, as Lawrence arrived late and escaped his marker at the far post to net his 11th goal of the season.
Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom: "I always say it, you only get what you deserve and we didn't kill them off, simple as that.
"Ipswich showed what they're all about, why they've not been beaten in so long because they're resolute and keep going to the very end, which I think we like to think we do.
"Our disappointment today is we didn't put the game to bed earlier. We prepared as well as we could for this game and in terms of what we wanted from a performance, we delivered it."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "It's the first thing I've stolen from here, actually. I was here a long time and never took a paper-clip, pen, piece of paper or anything else, but we burgled a point today.
"It's part of the game, the game goes for as long as the referee adds time on. We were poor today, they were much better.
"Did we deserve it? Did we hell, but I'll take it."
Tom Lawrence (Ipswich Town) is shown the yellow card for excessive celebration.
