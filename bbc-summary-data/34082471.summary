Hundreds of thousands of people in Lancashire should no longer need to boil their tap water to make it safe within the coming week, United Utilities has said.

More than 200,000 homes are still affected after the discovery of a parasite at a treatment works left residents boiling water since 6 August.
Tap water in 80,000 homes was declared safe to drink on Thursday.
Parts of Blackpool, Chorley and Preston have been given the all-clear.
Gary Dixon, customer services director for United Utilities, said: "We hope to get the warning lifted for the rest of our customers by the end of the coming week."
If people have been using their water supply regularly there was no need to flush their system, he added.
Water was treated with ultraviolet light to kill the microbial parasite cryptosporidium, and United Utilities said it had assessed hundreds of test results after discussions with Public Health England.
The water company has faced criticism about the length of time it has taken to lift the restrictions.
It has promised automatic compensation for those affected, although it has not said how much.
Public Health England said there had been no confirmed cases of sickness linked to the water supply.
Former Director of Public Health in the North West, Prof John Ashton, told BBC Radio Lancashire: "When this started, United Utilities said it would be all sorted within a few days.
"One of the concerns that I have is that the duty to the shareholders is of more concern to them than the duty to the public, so there are questions to be asked about how they've handled this incident.
"We need a proper picture of where the problems are and we have a right to know.
"It's a fundamental public health necessity to have safe drinking water in your house."
A statement on the United Utilities website said: "We are now able to lift the boil water advice in [several] postcode areas.
"For those still subject to the boil water advice, please continue to boil your water for drinking, brushing teeth and food preparation until we let you know you can stop."
It also advised people to check for their postcode on the website or ring the company helpline on 0800 9127241.
