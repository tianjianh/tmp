Peterborough murder case: Rikki Neave's movements to be laser-mapped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Officers investigating the murder of a boy two decades ago are to use laser imaging to create a three-dimensional map of his last-known movements.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six-year-old Rikki Neave's naked body was found in woods near Peterborough's Welland Estate on 29 November 1994. He had been strangled.
His mother, Ruth Neave, was cleared of his murder at a trial. The cold case inquiry was reopened this month.
Detectives hope new technology will help jog people's memories.
Rikki was last seen leaving his home in Redmile Walk, Welland, for school at about 09:00 GMT on Monday, 28 November, 1994.
He is believed to have been wearing grey trousers, a white shirt, black shoes and a blue coat.
The following day Rikki's body was found in a wooded area off Eye Road, close to Willoughby Court, about five minutes' walk from his house.
His mother was cleared of murder but admitted child neglect and cruelty and was jailed for seven years.
The investigation was reopened by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.
Its scientific services unit will be working with technology firm Advanced Laser Imaging to build up a virtual 3D image of the area and plot Rikki's journey leading up to his death.
After the case was reopened a mobile police station was set up on the Welland estate and detectives spent the following weekend talking to people in the area.
They said they were following up new lines of inquiry.
