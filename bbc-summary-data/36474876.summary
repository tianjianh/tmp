Irish Premiership: Play-off dates set as Warrenpoint await Arbitration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrenpoint Town's Arbitration hearing to contest their relegation from the Irish Premiership takes place on Thursday 9 June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An IFA Disciplinary Committee opted not to punish Carrick Rangers over a touchline ban irregularity, which resulted in Carrick staying up.
The Northern Ireland Football League have now fixed provisional dates for the promotion play-off.
Warrenpoint may face Institute on June 14 and 17 if they win their appeal.
If 'Town fail to be reinstated to the top flight, Ballinamallard and Institute will play the second leg of their play-off on Wednesday 15 June.
Ballinamallard won the first leg 2-1 at Institute on 6 May before off-field events led to the postponement of the second leg.
The IFA granted NIFL an extension to the season due to the uncertainty of the various appeals and Arbitration processes.
However only players eligible to participate in the first leg of the play-off are eligible to play in the second leg.
Proposed play-off games have a 19:45 kick-off.
