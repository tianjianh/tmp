Eva Carneiro: Ex-Chelsea doctor attends tribunal hearing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro has appeared at a tribunal hearing for her constructive dismissal case against the Premier League champions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 42-year-old left London South Employment Tribunal in Croydon after six hours on Monday without comment.
Her lawyer, Mary O'Rourke QC, did not confirm if there had been any settlement and said the proceedings were "confidential".
Carneiro is suing Chelsea for breach of contract and constructive dismissal.
Chelsea also refused to comment.
The Premier League club filed their defence in the tribunal hearing in December.
There is a separate but connected legal claim against former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho for alleged discrimination.
Carneiro was dropped from first-team duties after then boss Mourinho criticised her and first-team physio Jon Fearn for going on to the pitch to treat Eden Hazard  during the 2-2 draw with Swansea on the opening day of the season.
Chelsea were temporarily down to nine men as a result, and afterwards Mourinho called Carneiro and Fearn "impulsive and naive".
Carneiro did not appear on the bench again for first-team duties and later parted company with the club.
