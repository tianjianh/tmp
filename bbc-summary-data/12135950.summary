Bookmakers Ladbrokes said it was its highest ever pay-out on a multiple bet placed online for the stake size.
The Berkshire punter, who declined to be identified, predicted results in nine games on Wednesday, including Wolves' shock win over Chelsea.
The mystery gambler said he was "over the moon" and intended to use the money to start his own firm.
"It's a life changing sum of money for me," he added.
"Everything changes from here on in and one of my first moves will be to start my own business."
Alex Donohue, from Ladbrokes, said the punter had achieved one of the "hardest feats in the industry".
He added: "It was his first bet of 2011 so it's been a perfect start to the year for him.
"We have had bigger pay-outs for other bets but not with just one small stake of £2.50.
"We expect the champagne corks are popping in Berkshire as he celebrates one of the biggest football wins of all time."
The nine bets also included predicting Arsenal would draw with Manchester City and Blackburn Rovers would beat Liverpool.
His final game rested on a draw in the Spanish cup match between Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao with the equalising goal being scored by Bilbao five minutes from time.
Ladbrokes said the majority of the money would be transferred into the man's bank account.
But the punter said he also wants to collect a substantial amount of the winnings from branches.
