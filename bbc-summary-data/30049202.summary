Christian Perera, 31 from Samphire Road, Oxford, raped his 19-year-old victim on a track in Stoney Lane, Watlington, on 29 April.
Perera met the woman after contacting her under the guise of a female au pair on the social network site, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
He was sentenced to 13 years and six months for two counts of rape.
He was also given a four year term for sexual assault to be served concurrently and put on the sex offenders register indefinitely at Oxford Crown Court.
Adrian Foster, from the CPS, described Perera as "an extremely ruthless, predatory and dangerous man".
He said their investigations had revealed Perera was currently wanted by the Brazilian authorities for an offence of rape, for which he had been convicted and sentenced in his absence in Brazil.
Following the sentence, the rape victim said she hoped to encourage others to contact police.
She said: "Stay strong, don't give up, it will get better again. Life is worth living."
