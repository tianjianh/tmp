[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Welsh youth movement must do more to widen its appeal, its new chief executive has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Urdd Gobaith Cymru, a Welsh-speaking organisation, needs to attract more interest from those who do not speak the language, according to Sioned Hughes.
She thinks the Urdd is "very good" at connecting with the people who know about it.
But, she added, a "better connection" is needed with non-Welsh speakers.
This includes parents, Welsh learners and English language media.
The organisation, which has 55,000 members, was established in 1922 to help children and young people socialise using Welsh.
Ms Hughes has just started her role and said she hopes to "strengthen the Urdd, increase membership, raise awareness and ensure that we understand our members' aspirations, needs and requirements to go from strength to strength".
