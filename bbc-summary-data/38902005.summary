Raith Rovers have sacked manager Gary Locke and assistant Darren Jackson after a run of 14 games without a win.

Tuesday's 1-0 home defeat to Morton leaves the Kirkcaldy side eighth in the Championship, four points above the relegation play-off place.
Locke, 41, took over at Stark's Park last May following Ray MacKinnon's departure to Dundee United.
The former Hearts manager resigned as Kilmarnock boss in January 2016 after less than a year in the post.
Rovers started their league campaign with three consecutive victories but have only won three more games in the Championship since, their last success coming in late October.
Jackson, 50, had been on the coaching staff at Dundee United, leaving in September 2015, along with manager Jackie McNamara.
Capped 28 times for Scotland, he joined Rovers immediately after Locke's appointment.
Locke's dismissal drew sympathy from Morton manager Jim Duffy, whose side moved back up to third in the Championship with victory at Stark's Park.
"You always feel for every manager; we all know how difficult a job it is, how hard every manager works - it is a 24/7 job," Duffy told BBC Scotland.
"It totally takes over you and consumes you.  Gary is a terrific boy and I absolutely feel for him.  It is very difficult if it is ultimately your team [Morton] that tips the balance against him.
"For any manager time is the key element, and if you get a bit of time, there is a chance you can turn things around.
"But patience is generally not a virtue in football.  Normally if it is not going your way, the inevitability is you are going to lose your job."
