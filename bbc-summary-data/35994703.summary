[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £285,000 library and gallery is set to be built in Haverfordwest.

The development is part of a £3.4m scheme to regenerate the Pembrokeshire town.
It will be located on the site of the current Riverside Market and will replace the original building, which closed in 2012.
The Welsh Government-funded facility will also house a coffee shop, tourism information office and gallery.
Traders at the indoor market will be relocated to other premises in the town centre, which have yet to be decided.
Reg and Sandra Davies have run their engraving business in the Riverside Market for 33 years.
Mr Davies said being relocated was "not something they initially wanted," but following a "downturn in the market" they were looking forward to moving.
Of the 15 indoor market traders, 10 will be moved and five will be entitled to statutory compensation.
"There's not much resistance with the market traders anymore, there's only a few of us left," he added.
The council called it a "flagship" development and said the new venue could generate close to £1m of spending in the local economy and create eight to 15 additional jobs.
Keith Lewis, Pembrokeshire cabinet member for economy and communities, said the award was "great news."
It is hoped work will start in autumn, with an opening date some 12 months later.
The funding announcement coincided with the unveiling of a "draft masterplan" for the town centre.
