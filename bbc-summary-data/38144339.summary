[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three incidents have happened near to the Hillhead Halls of Residence between September and November.
The man is described as white, aged between 17 and 20, about 5ft 8in tall, with short light brown or blond hair.
He was wearing dark sportswear including a hooded top and jogging bottoms.
Det Con Kirsty Munro said: "I would like to reassure the community that officers are taking these reports very seriously.
"Although none of the females involved were hurt or injured in any way, they were left feeling understandably concerned and uncomfortable.
"Uniformed officers have been giving particular attention to the area and I would urge people using the park to be on their guard."
She added: "These type of incidents are extremely rare in the area - and the city generally - however by no means should that make anyone complacent.
"I would urge anyone who recognises the description of this male or the e-fit image to make contact with the police."
