The current world record holder qualified for the six-man team in September after winning silver at the Shotgun World Championships in Italy.
"It is such a proud feeling to be representing GB at the pinnacle of international sport," he said.
"It would be fantastic to bring a medal home to the Isle of Man."
It will be the Manx shooter's first appearance at the Olympics.
