The DJ's latest single Feels, which features Katy Perry, Pharrell and Big Sean, knocked Despacito off the top spot on this week's singles chart.
It means he's now level with The Rolling Stones, Oasis and Eminem - who also have eight number ones each.
Cliff Richard is now the only British male solo artists ahead of Calvin - with 14 chart toppers to his name.
The rest of this week's top five is taken up by French Montana, DJ Khaled, Luis Fonsi and Dua Lipa, whose single New Rules has climbed to number five - her highest chart placing to date.
Over on the album chart - Ed Sheeran returned to number one with his third album Divide.
Glen Campbell's album Adios re-entered the chart at number two after his death earlier this week.
