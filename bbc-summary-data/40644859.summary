Super League: Wakefield Trinity 16-41 St Helens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield missed out on a top-four finish to the regular season on points difference after defeat by St Helens.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 14-point loss would have been enough for fourth place, but they trailed 24-6 at half-time after four Saints tries, including one from James Roby.
Scott Grix and Mason Caton-Brown went over to make it 28-16 and put Trinity above Salford on points difference.
But Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook and Zeb Taia scored and a late Danny Richardson drop goal extended Saints' margin.
Their victory in the final Super League game before the Super 8s/Qualifiers split was only their second away from home this season, but their fifth in a row at Wakefield.
The result also confirmed Salford Red Devils in fourth, their highest regular-season finish since 1976, despite a 25-0 loss to struggling Leigh Centurions on Friday.
Richardson had earlier begun the scoring with the first try of the match, and that was followed by further Saints tries from Roby, Tommy Makinson and Regan Grace - with Matty Ashurst replying for the hosts.
And despite a brief fightback from Wakefield, Justin Holbrook's side pulled further away to firm up their position in sixth.
Wakefield boss Chris Chester:  "We didn't get off to great start. They came out of the blocks a lot quicker and got some momentum.
"We couldn't contain their pack and we got taught a few lessons from a red-hot team.
"It hurts that we've thrown away third spot and thrown away fourth spot but I'm also proud of this group of players because we've achieved what people thought we couldn't, the top six.
"We've made it a little bit tougher for ourselves with only three home games (in the Super 8s) but we've been written off all season and we'll use that to motivate us."
St Helens coach Justin Holbrook:  "We're showing we're right in the mix, which is exciting. We're heading in the right direction for sure.
"I would have liked to carry on but unfortunately we're not in the Challenge Cup semis so we'll have a week off.
"It was a really good performance from us today. The first half was really pleasing.
"We knew how big a game it was for both teams and we really turned up. We lost our way a bit in the second half but found it again at the back end."
