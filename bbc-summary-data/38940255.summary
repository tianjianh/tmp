Walsall 2-0 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall left it late as they moved to within four points of the League One play-off zone with a dramatic victory over Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Injury-time goals from Erhun Oztumer and Kieron Morris secured the Saddlers' fourth home win in a row.
With Posh furiously appealing for a foul on keeper Luke McGee, Oztumer scored direct from a controversial corner in the 92nd minute.
Posh captain Chris Forrester was sent off for leading the protests before Morris then sealed the points with Walsall's second in the seventh minute of stoppage time.
Morris, only playing because of an injury to Florent Cuvelier, found the bottom left corner with a left-foot shot which squeezed under McGee's body.
McGee had been the star of the first half for Posh, making a fine near-post reaction save on 25 minutes to keep out Simeon Jackson's close-range flick from Jason McCarthy's low cross.
But the game seemed set to peter out into a goalless draw before McGee fumbled Oztumer's corner over the line under pressure from Amadou Bakayoko in injury time.
