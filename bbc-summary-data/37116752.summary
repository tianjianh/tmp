City of Edinburgh Council leader Andrew Burns is to stand down at next year's local elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 52-year-old said he wanted to "focus on a different phase" in his life not involving "front-line politics, in any shape or form - whatsoever".
Mr Burns became Labour group leader in 2008 and has headed the city's Labour SNP coalition since 2012.
He will stay in office up until the elections next May.
Mr Burns, who has been a councillor for almost 18 years, said: "Nothing I've done in my life beforehand, and I'm sure nothing that I'll do with my life in the future; will match the hugely enriching local experiences I've had over those two decades.
"But today, I'm confirming that I won't be putting my name forward for a fifth consecutive occasion, and thus will not be standing for potential re-election in 2017.
"I want to now move on; to focus on a different phase in my life. A phase that once again will not involve front-line politics, in any shape or form - whatsoever."
Tom Connolly, Unison Edinburgh lead negotiator, said: "Andrew has always made himself available to Unison and the other trade unions and has engaged with us on regular basis throughout his time as leader.
"He has always done this in a respectful, positive and constructive manner."
