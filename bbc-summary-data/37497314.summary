Cheshire police and fire HQ sell-off plan is shelved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service has shelved plans to sell off its base in Winsford and move into the county's police headquarters.

An official report says the cost of rebuilding fire training facilities was "prohibitive".
Cheshire's Deputy Chief Fire Officer Mark Cashin said the decision was made "following an in-depth review".
A programme to share administrative staff between the two services will still go ahead.
Staff in the fire service's HR, ICT, finance, payroll and procurement departments will still move to the police headquarters, and become employees of Cheshire Constabulary.
But workers in other fire service departments will now remain at the fire HQ on Sadler Road.
A report to the county's fire authority said the benefits of moving training facilities to the police HQ were "significantly outweighed by cost and a number of risks", including a lack of space, noise affecting neighbours and trees that would be difficult to remove.
Officials favour refurbishing the existing fire training facilities, claiming it could cost Â£1.3m less than moving.
