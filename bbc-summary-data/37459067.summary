[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 1-1 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marcus Maddison's injury-time equaliser handed Peterborough United a draw at Southend United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Wordsworth fired the Shrimpers in front 12 minutes from time having earlier missed a penalty.
But Maddison cancelled out the midfielder's effort with a low, left-footed shot which flew into the bottom right-hand corner of the net from 20 yards.
The home side had earlier come close to opening the scoring in the 41st minute when Jermaine McGlashan's right-wing cross was headed against the crossbar by Stephen McLaughlin, but Peterborough were also denied by the woodwork before the break when Maddison also smashed an effort against the frame of the goal.
The Shrimpers wasted a clearer chance to score when Maddison handled Ben Coker's left-wing cross inside the penalty area but Wordsworth's weak resulting spot-kick was saved low down to his left-hand side by Luke McGee.
Wordsworth made amends in the 78th minute when he slammed home a left-footed shot from close range.
However, Posh secured a share of the spoils right at the death with Morrison netting from long range.
