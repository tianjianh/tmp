Sherlock creator Steven Moffat has praised the BBC for not paying a reported £25m to keep the Great British Bake Off.

Moffat said the BBC was "right not to reward greed" after the corporation lost the rights to Channel 4.
The writer and producer said he had rejected offers from other broadcasters who wanted to air Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch.
Moffat picked up an Emmy on Sunday for Sherlock The Abominable Bride.
He told the audience at the ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday: "Thank you to the BBC who we love above all bakery. British people will get that."
Last Monday, Love Productions, which makes Bake Off for the BBC, announced it had signed a new deal with Channel 4.
The following day, presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins stated they would leave the programme after the current series, which airs on BBC One.
Judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry have not yet said if they are moving to Channel 4 with the show, fuelling much press speculation about its future and who might present it.
Moffat, who is a board director at Hartswood Films which produces Sherlock, said after the Emmys ceremony: "We have had offers, that's not what it's about. It should never be about that. I think the BBC was quite right not to reward greed. It's wrong."
Hartswood Films, which was also behind series including Jekyll and Coupling, is run by his mother-in-law Beryl Vertue and his wife, Sue, is also a producer and board director.
During negotiations over Bake Off, the BBC fell £10m short of the amount of money required to keep it, BBC News understands. The corporation is thought to have offered £15m per year to keep the show.
That would have been double the amount the BBC currently pays for it and its sister programmes such as An Extra Slice and the Sport Relief specials.
But it is understood Love Productions refused to entertain any offers below £25m per year.
On Monday, Grand Designs star Kevin McCloud defended the show's move to Channel 4.
"I'm excited to see how they make it their own. It will be different, it will be its own creative thing," he said.
"I can't imagine Grand Designs going anywhere. I was listening to the radio this morning when they were talking about Bake Off and I felt good to be associated with Channel 4.
"It's a very big stable. I think what is interesting for Channel 4 is the way they remake themselves and revitalise themselves.
