The 30-year-old most recently played for Bath, who released him after he pleaded guilty to an assault charge.
He is the fifth forward among the Warriors' seven close-season signings, but the first since Dean Ryan left to become the Rugby Football Union's head of international player development.
"Everything is in place for you to succeed at Sixways," said Faosiliva.
"Warriors are an ambitious club with a clear vision, which is something that really appealed to me."
Worcester have already signed South Africa-born Northampton hooker Matt Williams, Bath lock Will Spencer, Bristol flanker Marco Mama and prop Biyi Alo from Saracens.
They have also signed two new backs, rugby league convert Ben Te'o and fellow centre Jackson Willison.
Warriors, now under the command of head coach Carl Hogg, are scheduled to kick off the new Premiership season against defending champions Saracens at Twickenham on 3 September (14:00 BST).
