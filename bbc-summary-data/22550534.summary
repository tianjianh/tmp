The company said like-for-like sales grew by 4% in the year to April, although trading in southern Europe continued to perform badly.
It said it expected underlying profits before tax to be at the top end of market expectations of Â£75-85m.
Sales fell 8% in Italy, Greece and Turkey, where economic growth has been relatively weak.
Dixons also said trading at its online electric retail site, PIXmania, "continues to be very challenging".
Sales at the website were down 24% for the year.
In contrast, sales at UK and Ireland operations, which consist of Currys, Currys Digital, PC World and Dixons.co.uk, grew 7%.
Dixons.co.uk closed in October last year, though PC World and Currys continue to trade online, alongside PIXmania.
Chief executive Sebastian James said he believed the company had "a clear business model that allows us to flourish in an internet world".
"We remain steadfastly focused on sorting out our businesses in more challenged markets and, in particular, PIXmania," he said.
"Above all, we are enjoying the feeling of a little wind in our sails and we want to make sure that, in spite of continued economic uncertainty, this carries on into next year and beyond."
