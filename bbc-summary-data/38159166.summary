[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A millionaire businessman was being blackmailed by the girlfriend he killed, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Morgan, 54, of Llanellen, Monmouthshire, is accused of strangling Georgina Symonds, 25, in January.
The father-of-two denies murder at Newport Crown Court.
On Wednesday, her mother Deborah told jurors Georgina Symonds - who was paid up to £10,000-a-month to be his personal escort - knew everything about him and "thought she could ruin him".
The court has previously heard how Mr Morgan lavished Georgina Symonds, from the Allt-yr-yn area of Newport, with expensive gifts including helicopter rides and spa days.
He planted a listening device disguised as a white plug socket in a bungalow he owned in Llanmartin, Newport, where he allowed the mother-of-one to live rent-free.
He overheard Georgina Symonds tell her new boyfriend Tom Ballinger she planned to leave married Mr Morgan and blackmail him.
On Wednesday, her mother told the court she threatened to tell his family how she had met him and had a photograph with him and another escort in his marital home, Beech Hill Farm in Usk.
Deborah Symonds said: "She threatened to tell everyone about them and thought she could ruin him.
"She said, 'I know Peter Morgan keeps about £50,000 at home and I'm going to do this warts and all.
"'He is hiding from the taxman and he has also built property that hasn't met building regulations'."
Mr Morgan had promised to sign over the bungalow Georgina Symonds was living in at Pencoed Castle, the court heard, and he had taken out a life insurance policy for £1m which she would receive if he died.
Deborah Symonds, a residential services officer, also said her daughter wanted to hurt Mr Morgan following the death of her ex-boyfriend in November 2015, so he would feel pain like she did.
The court heard she was left "heartbroken" but Mr Morgan "didn't seem to care".
"She was trying to do things to upset him, to make him feel hurt," Deborah Symonds said.
Married Mr Ballinger told the court he met Georgina Symonds at a wake at the bungalow.
"Whilst we were outside George said to me 'my heart's racing' and I said 'so is mine'," he said.
"She said 'did you feel that? It feels like love to me'."
They began texting and had sex days later.
Mr Ballinger said: "She said she was going to finish with Peter Morgan.
"She was going to go back to work as an escort. She said quite clearly she was going to leave him after he gave her the bungalow."
But he told the court he could not remember what was said during the conversation with Miss Symonds on January 10 that was overheard by Mr Morgan.
Miss Symonds' best friend Alexy Butcher told the court Mr Morgan - known as Rich Pete - was "smitten" with Georgina Symonds but she was "only with him for the money".
She turned to alcohol and drugs and was "very depressed" over the death of her ex-boyfriend and "tried to take her own life", Ms Butcher said.
"Peter Morgan was helping her with her grief as much as he could but she blamed him. She wasn't very nice to him," she added.
The trial continues.
