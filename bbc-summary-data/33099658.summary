Peak District lamb 'deliberately beheaded'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lamb has been deliberately beheaded at a farm in the Peak District, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The animal's body was found near a farmhouse in Edale on Tuesday by the farmer, who contacted police.
Officers and the farmer believe the injury had not been inflicted by another animal as it appeared to have been "cleanly removed".
Derbyshire Police have warned farmers about the attack and asked anyone with information to contact the force.
