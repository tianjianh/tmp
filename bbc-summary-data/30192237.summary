Luke Quinn, 33, from Busby, East Renfrewshire, knocked Simon Richardson to the ground and stamped on him in Wellington Street, on 8 December 2013.
The 45-year-old, from Paisley in Renfrewshire, later died in hospital.
Quinn claimed diminished responsibility due to Aspergers Syndrome but a jury convicted him of murder. He was told to serve a minimum of 14 years in jail.
Sentencing Quinn at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Bill Dunlop told him: "No value can be put on the life that was lost and that you took. Nothing can do that."
During Quinn's trial, the court heard Mr Richardson, who was the main carer for his mother, had earlier been on a night out with friends in Glasgow before the attack.
He was looking for a taxi when he encountered Quinn in Wellington Street.
CCTV images showed the two men chatting before Quinn suddenly lashed out with a punch.
Mr Richardson fell to the ground and Quinn could be seen stamping on him and rifling his pockets before stamping on him again and punching him.
The victim later died in the city's Royal Infirmary from internal bleeding caused by a blow to the abdomen.
When Quinn was detained and charged with murder he became upset and agitated and told police: "Why is God doing this to me?"
Quinn did not give evidence during his trial but he told a psychologist that he snapped because he did not like being touched and Mr Richardson had been patting him on the back when he spoke to him.
The court heard that Mr Richardson's mother died six weeks after him on Christmas Day in 2013.
The victim's brother Ferrier Richardson spoke after the trial of the death of a "wonderful human being".
Ferrier Richardson, who now lives in West Africa, said: "I don't care what my brother said or did that night, nobody on earth deserves anything like that.
"Simon was a wonderful human being, who everyone loved. I could not have asked for a better brother.
"What this excuse for a human being has done to all of us, I would not wish on your or any other person's family.
"He should be locked away for a very long time so that no other family has to suffer in the way we have."
