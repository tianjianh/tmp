The footage of her water birth in Orange County, California has stunned social media users because the baby seemingly pops out after only a few contractions.
The clip, uploaded to Instagram and Facebook, has had more than 16 million views since it was posted on September 3.
Midwife Lisa Marie Sanchez Oxenham filmed the birth and said it was "an incredible moment".
"It's an amazing, uneventful delivery," Lisa Marie said.
"What you cannot quite see in the video is that the head is already out. So I tell Audra to wait for the next contraction, and that's when the baby flies out.
"The mother's joy is so moving. When she says 'my baby son', it makes many people cry.  It is such an incredible moment."
The footage has been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook and attracted 23,000 comments, like these:

Shene McCoy posts: "She was kinda calm, I hope I can be that tough."
In another post Philip L. King Sr writes: "Wow I've never seen it done in real life only in movies. That's real life right there."
Lisa Marie says she's not surprised the video has been so popular.
"I believe the video has gone viral because it's such a beautiful moment, in an intimate, private and relaxed atmosphere," she said.
"That is something we just don't associate with childbirth anymore and certainly don't see enough of."
