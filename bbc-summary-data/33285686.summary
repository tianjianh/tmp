Paul Tonner said his petition, which gathered 1,800 signatures, was a "social media experiment", and said he found the pies "pretty disgusting".
The pies were discussed at First Minister's Questions on Thursday.
Mr Tonner said campaign supporters should "reassess their priorities" and instead champion foodbanks.
In a video posted on his change.org page, Mr Tonner said he had just wanted to "see how far a silly wee petition" could get.
He said: "As you know, there are people in this country who don't have macaroni pies, who don't have anything. And they're relying on foodbanks to give them food every day.
"I'd also like to call on politicians, celebrities and newspapers who jumped on the macaroni pie bandwagon to reassess their priorities.
"There are far more important things in the world than macaroni pies, which to be honest are pretty disgusting."
The issue gained traction in national newspapers, and was discussed at First Ministers Questions on Thursday, when Nicola Sturgeon admitted she was "not a lover of the macaroni pie", but said she had been lobbied by her father to join the campaign.
High street baker Greggs insisted it was sticking by its decision to stop stocking the pies, saying they were "the smallest selling line" in their shops.
