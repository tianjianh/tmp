Ben Nevis Race runners face ban if they cross Grassy bank

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Runners taking part in the Ben Nevis Race have been asked to stay off an area of the mountain known as the Grassy Bank to help halt erosion.

The gruelling hill run traditionally crossed this part of the peak, but runners will get a lifetime ban from the race if they cross it on Saturday.
Race organisers have notified the 600 entrants of the restriction.
It could make breaking record times for the course more challenging as the alternative route is slightly longer.
Both the men's and women's records were set 32 years ago by members of Keswick AC.
Kenny Stuart completed the run up and down Britain's highest mountain in one hour 25 minutes and 34 seconds, and Pauline Haworth in one hour 43 minutes and 25 seconds.
Scottish Natural Heritage asked the race organisers to stop runners crossing the Grassy Bank, which is about half way up the mountain, because of concerns about erosion of the area.
