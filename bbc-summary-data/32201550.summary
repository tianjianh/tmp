Follow all the reaction, key points and analysis of the debate on our rolling live coverage.
Hustings, ballot boxes, election broadcasts, the leaders of two mighty parties battling it out for the "keys to Number 10". Why does so much about the general election seem to belong to a bygone era? Brian Wheeler has been taking a look.
The election campaign might have slowed down a bit over the weekend, but Twitter users who needed their political fix found a light-hearted way to fill the void. The hashtag #constituencysongs took off on social media over the weekend. We've collated some of the best suggestions.
"Do we really think this is the time in which to put into play our very membership of the European Union, the largest commercial market and most developed political union in the world? And the one on our doorstep?" - Former Prime Minister Tony Blair.
"The election isn't just a choice between parties; it's a choice between two different types of United Kingdom. One that lives within its means, or one that heaps more debt on our children. We've got just one month to make sure people choose the right path" - Prime Minister David Cameron.
"We will give whatever they need - it might be more than Â£8bn, it might be less"- Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt on funding for the NHS in England.
"The Citizens' Income, the commitment to that, is in this manifesto - but we've seen the difficulties that Iain Duncan Smith has got into in introducing Universal Credit, so we're saying it would take more than the term of one parliament to actually introduce this" - Green leader Natalie Bennett.
"Gone are the days of compassionate conservatism. Now they promise to cut and cut and cut. Not because they have to, but because they want to" - Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg
