In November 2015, a man contacted BBC Radio Norfolk saying he had hacked into Norwich Airport's website.
Identifying himself only as "His Royal Gingerness", the man claimed he wanted to expose how vulnerable the airport was.
A police investigation was then launched.
Mr Devereux is facing two charges under Section 1 of the Computer Misuse Act, which relates to unauthorised access to computer material.
