Jacob Jenkins was airlifted to hospital after he stopped breathing at Pizza Hut in Hartlepool on 9 October.
The two-year-old was put into an induced coma but five days later his parents turned off his life support.
Abigail Wilson and David Jenkins presented a fundraising cheque to the Great North Air Ambulance.
David Jenkins said: "If it wasn't for the air ambulance we wouldn't have been able to spend the last five days with Jacob.
"Abigail and I are both so grateful and even though our little boy sadly didn't make it, we would not have been able to say goodbye without them."
The Â£1,100 was raised during a charity night at Hartlepool Working Men's Club.
