The tide, which is expected to reach 26ft (7.9m), is due from 17:00 BST on Sunday, bringing with it photographers and bird lovers to watch.
Nigel Williams of Wildfowl and Wetland Trust in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said the tide will bring thousands of migratory birds closer to shore.
He added: "It really is a magical sight watching the whole landscape flooded with birds."
