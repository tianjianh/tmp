[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 0-0 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon's Lyle Taylor saw a first-half penalty saved as Swindon Town earned a goalless League One draw at Kingsmeadow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Off the back of three wins in nine days, the atmosphere was one of huge excitement as in-form Wimbledon took on the struggling Robins.
And while they stretched their unbeaten run in all competitions to seven games, the Dons were unable to get all three points, with Taylor's missed penalty the best chance of a tame game.
The contest came to life on the half-hour mark when Swindon's Conor Thomas was adjudged to have tripped Tom Elliott in the box.
The visitors were incensed by the decision as it looked as though Elliott had deceived referee John Busby and his assistant with a dive - Yaser Kasim receiving a caution for his protests.
But the Robins felt as though justice was done when Taylor's low spot-kick was brilliantly saved by Swindon goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux.
The best chance of a quiet second half fell to Thomas in the 74th minute as the centre-back poked a shot narrowly wide following a free-kick that was not properly cleared.
