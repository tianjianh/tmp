The Jack Russell was put down after suffering from a prostate tumour.
Uggie played Jean Dujardin's dog in The Artist and also appeared with Robert Pattinson in 2011's Water for Elephants.
Uggie's owner Omar Von Muller wrote on Facebook: "We regret to inform to all our friends, family and Uggie's fans that our beloved boy has passed away."
He added: "Uggie had a cancerous tumour in the prostate and is now in a better place not feeling pain."
The talented terrier "retired" in 2012 but went on to make sporadic TV appearances.
The dog's most recent credit, according to movie site IMDB, was 2013 TV movie Holiday Road Trip, in which he played a dog called Scoots.
Uggie won the tongue-in-cheek Palm Dog award for best canine actor at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, and was the first dog to leave his paw prints on cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.
The organisers of the Palm Dog prize have paid tribute to the much-loved mutt, calling him "a special little Jack Russell who gave pleasure to millions".
Uggie also published an autobiography, ghost-written by Wendy Holden.
