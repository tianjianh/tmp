It proved to be a frustrating afternoon for the Dutchman who saw his side fail to make the most of their opportunities.
Ahly are hunting a record-extending ninth Champions League title under the guidance of the 60-year-old former Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham boss.
African Champions League fixtures and results
The return match is set for Alexandria next Saturday with record eight-time winners Ahly favourites to reach the final qualifying round for the group stage.
Elsewhere, goals just before and after half-time gave Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa a 2-0 home victory over AC Leopards of Congo Brazzaville.
It could have been a wider winning margin after Anthony Laffor had a late penalty saved by substitute keeper Tresor Elenga. He had replaced Herve Lomboto who was sent off for the foul which led to the penalty.
Keagan Dolly had put Sundowns ahead with Colombian Leonardo Castro doubling the lead.
The other South African challengers, Kaizer Chiefs, suffered a shock 1-0 home loss to ASEC Mimosas of Ivory Coast at Soccer City stadium in Soweto.
Adama Bakayoko nodded the winner on 51 minutes for ASEC as Chiefs suffered a third loss in all competitions within eight days.
Last Saturday they were bundled out of the South African FA Cup by arch rivals Orlando Pirates and a midweek league loss virtually ended any hopes of retaining the league title.
Zesco United of Zambia were impressive 4-1 home winners over Horoya of Guinea in Ndola thanks to goals from Idriss Mbombo, Jesse Were, Cletus Chota and Maybin Mwaba.
Young Africans of Tanzania look set to secure a last-16 slot after winning 2-1 away to APR of Rwanda in an East African derby.  Goals from Juma Abdul Jaffar and Thaban Kamusoko put the Dar es Salaam outfit in control before Patrick Sibomana halved the deficit in stoppage time.
Stade Malien of Mali overcome Coton Sport of Cameroon 2-0 in Bamako and there was a 1-0 home win for Club Africain of Tunisia over Mouloudia Bejaia.
