Geoffrey Boycott: Yorkshire would beat the England team

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Geoffrey Boycott has criticised England skipper Alastair Cook for "having a go at Yorkies" and claims Yorkshire would beat the current national team.

Boycott rounded on Cook following his comments about incoming England and Wales Cricket Board boss Colin Graves.
Cook was critical of Graves for calling West Indies a "mediocre" side before the drawn Test series in the Caribbean.
Boycott, a Yorkshireman like Graves, said Cook was "out of order", adding: "If he attacks us, I care."
Boycott added on Twitter that there was "no reason to slag off Yorkshire folk" and said Cook would have been sacked in any other business for "publicly criticising his boss".
To add spice to the row, Boycott, 74, also claimed that Yorkshire, the current county champions, had produced more England cricketers than any other county and would beat the current England team.

Cook has come in for renewed criticism after England lost the third and final Test against West Indies in Barbados to draw the series 1-1.
But it is his comments about Graves that have really infuriated Boycott.
Cook said Graves had inspired West Indies with his "mediocre" remark, adding: "That's a Yorkshireman for you... they're quite happy to talk a good game,"
In his Daily Telegraph column on Tuesday, Boycott wrote: "Every time Cook opens his mouth, he sticks his foot in it.
"Cook acts as if he is the best captain England have ever had.
"He is living in cloud-cuckoo land about his captaincy ability. He thinks he is untouchable."
Boycott's comments, in turn, drew a fierce response from Steve Harmison, a former England team-mate of Cook's.
The former Durham fast bowler told BBC Radio 5 live: "Geoffrey makes some valid points about the team, but I can't agree with what he says about Alastair Cook. That's a disgrace.
"He is having a personal crusade on a man who is trying to do his best."
