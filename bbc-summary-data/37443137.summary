Newcastle Falcons have re-signed prop David Wilson from Bath on undisclosed terms, seven years after the England international left Kingston Park.

Wilson, 31, has 44 Test caps for England - the last of which came against Uruguay in the 2015 World Cup.
He played 101 Premiership games for Bath following his 2009 move to the Rec, following 55 Falcons outings.
"This is a signing which underlines our ambitious plans," director of rugby Dean Richards said.
The front-rower arrives at Newcastle having not made an appearance for Bath this season.
"They are doing good things under Richards," Wilson said. "The set-up seems much more professional and the quality of the squad is outstanding."
