Harris Tweed Hebrides has teamed up with the Scottish FA and Edinburgh fashion house Walker Slater to produce the range.
The tweed was woven at Harris Tweed Hebrides' mill in Shawbost in the Isle of Lewis.
The range uses the blues of the Scotland football team and the Saltire.
National coach Gordon Strachan said: "The Scotland fans arrive at games dressed for the occasion and now we will be able to do the same, through Harris Tweed.
"It is really smart and it will help bring us all together, players and fans alike."
