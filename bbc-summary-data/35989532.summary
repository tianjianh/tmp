Police said the driver of a Seat Leon, who received minor injuries, was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
A passenger in the other vehicle involved in the crash was seriously injured and has been taken to hospital.
The driver of the second vehicle received minor injuries.
The crash closed the M20 in both directions between junctions 10 and 11.
Traffic was diverted via the A20 but delays of several hours were reported in the Ashford area.
Driver Clare Bray, who was stuck in traffic, said: "There are container lorries trying to get through narrow country lanes and even the diversion routes are completely blocked."
Kent Police have appealed to drivers who may have dashboard camera footage of the crash to come forward.
"There will be a number of people who would have seen this incident," said PC Simon Masterson.
"I would appeal for anyone who has any information that they think could be relevant to call us as soon as possible."
