The 24-year-old Australian agreed to join the Bulls in October but became a free agent after the club's demise.
He played in the NRL with Canterbury Bulldogs and Gold Coast Titans.
"I have no doubt at all he will have a big contribution in helping us achieve our goals this year," head coach Neil Jukes told the club website.
The deal also includes a two-year option at the end of the 2017 season.
