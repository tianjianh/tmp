West Brom striker Saido Berahino has returned to training after suggesting that he would never play for the club again - and could feature against Southampton on Saturday.

Berahino, 22, made the outburst on transfer deadline day after a move to Tottenham Hotspur was blocked.
But West Brom manager Tony Pulis says Berahino has since "trained well".
"We're keen to draw a line under it all and concentrate on playing football again," Pulis told the Telegraph.
The England Under-21 international was given extra time off and was due to meet Baggies officials on Monday.
Berahino was the subject of four bids from Spurs over the summer and has been left out of the team for the last three matches.
West Brom are 15th in the Premier League table after winning just once in their opening four matches.
