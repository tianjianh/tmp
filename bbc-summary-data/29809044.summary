[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted rapist has been found guilty of attempting to rape a 64-year-old woman in her Glasgow home while out on licence from his previous jail term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Haran, 48, attacked the frail widow at a house in the Drumchapel area on 7 April after chatting to her.
A jury rejected his claim that any contact had been consensual.
At the High Court in Glasgow, temporary judge Kenneth MacIver QC described Haran as a "menacing predator" and deferred sentence for reports
Judge MacIver told Haran: "This was an appalling and despicable attack on a hospitable and infirm lady in her own home.
"I have no doubt you are a danger to women and a menacing predator. You should expect a very long sentence."
The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court that Haran suddenly demanded sex with her and when she said no he tried to rape her.
The woman sobbed as she told how he removed her clothing and dragged her into her bedroom.
She told advocate depute Mark McGuire, prosecuting: "I kept saying no, but he took no notice."
Neighbours told the court that after the sex attack the woman was hysterical and shaking and could hardly speak.
Haran's DNA was found on her body and her DNA was found under his fingernails.
Haran was jailed for eight years in 2002 for raping one woman and attempting to rape another.
He was ordered to be monitored in the community for four years after his release.
The court was told that Haran was on licence when he committed the attempted rape in Drumchapel.
