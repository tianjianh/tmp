The 35-year-old ended the season as caretaker boss, stepping up from his assistant coach role following the sacking of James Fowler.
The Dumfries side finished seventh in the Championship, 20 points off the play-off places.
"As a club we will strive to compete for a place in the play-offs in a very strong league," said the former Gretna and Kilmarnock midfielder.
"The club have re-signed a number of players in the last few weeks and I will be looking to add a few new faces to the squad.
"Having been at the club last year I know there is a good mix of experienced players alongside some exciting young players who I expect to play a big part this season.
"I will be working extremely hard to ensure I produce a committed, passionate and talented team that all Queen of the South supporters will enjoy watching and most importantly be proud to support."
Skelton has managerial experience with Workington, steering the club to a second place finish in the Northern Premier League in his one season in charge, having been a player-coach there in the previous campaign.
He moved to Palmerston Park last summer to assist Fowler and oversaw the final two matches of the season.
Queen of the South also announced that Jim Thomson is taking on a new position as football development manager.
