Burton Albion players will support boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink if he leaves to take the vacant Queens Park Rangers job, says defender Damien McCrory.

QPR have made an official approach for the Dutchman, with League One leaders Burton now in negotiations with the Championship side.
"We are hopeful that we can keep hold of him," McCrory told BBC Radio Derby.
"But none of the lads will hold grudges against him if he does decide to move on because it is great opportunity."
In the 12 months since taking over at Burton, Hasselbaink has guided the club to promotion to England's third tier for the first time in its history, where they now sit top after 20 games following Tuesday's 2-1 win over Millwall.
McCrory said former Chelsea and Leeds United striker has been candid about QPR's interest, but admits players do not know if he will remain in charge of Saturday's trip to Gillingham,
"Everyone knows what is going on with the speculation about the gaffer," McCrory said.
"He is saying how it is to us and let us know that something may happen or may not happen. He will be in on Thursday either way.
"All the players want him to be in charge of the Gillingham game. But I couldn't really say. You never know in football."
Midfielder Mark Duffy said he would be "gutted" if Hasselbaink was lured away from the Pirelli Stadium.
"He has done a great job here and we have something good going, we are sitting nicely top of the league," he said.
