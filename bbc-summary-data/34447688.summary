Kirkcudbright Viking treasure bid seeks council backing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are being asked to pledge £100,000 to a public appeal to secure a major Viking hoard for the Kirkcudbright gallery project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been acknowledged that inclusion of the treasure in the new facility would boost visitor numbers.
The items were discovered in Galloway last year by a metal detectorist.
The Treasure Trove Panel will decide where the artefacts end up but Dumfries and Galloway Council is being asked to back a bid to bring them to the region.
A report to the Kirkcudbright common good sub committee states that the acquisition of the hoard would be a considerable draw for visitors to the town and the new gallery, with benefits for the local economy.
However, finance is a major issue with the plans with the collection thought to be worth between £500,000 and £1m.
All accredited museums in Scotland can bid for ownership.
The local authority has been advised that £100,000 should be allocated from the common good fund to kick-start a public appeal.
If the bid to bring the Viking hoard to Kirkcudbright was to prove unsuccessful, the council's pledge would not be called upon.
