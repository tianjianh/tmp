[SN]TITLE[SN]
Juventus 2-0 Lazio

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Italian champions Juventus reasserted their control over the Serie A title race thanks to a comfortable victory over top-four rivals Lazio in Turin.

Juve led within five minutes thanks to Paulo Dybala's brilliant first-time strike from 20 yards.
It was 2-0 after 16 minutes when top scorer Gonzalo Higuain prodded in Juan Cuadrado's right-wing cross.
Higuain also had a goal ruled out for offside but it mattered little as Juve exerted their authority.
Massimiliano Allegri's side remain one point above second-placed Roma, who beat Cagliari 1-0, but Juve have a game in hand over their title rivals.
Edin Dzeko scored the only goal in Rome as he held off Nicola Murru to steer in Antonio Rudiger's cross, with Luciano Spalletti's side equalling a club record of 13 consecutive home league wins.
Yet the ease with which Juventus brushed aside Lazio, who have ambitions of Champions League qualification for only the second time in a decade, was a major statement as they bounced back from defeat against Fiorentina last week.
Failure to beat the capital side would have left the Old Lady vulnerable to losing top spot for the first time since August.
But Allegri's decision to name a bold attacking line-up - including Higuain, Dybala and Mario Mandzukic - in his 300th Serie A game as a manager brought dividends.
Juve rarely looked troubled as they continued their bid for a record sixth successive Scudetto.
Inter Milan moved above neighbours AC Milan into fifth place after beating second-bottom Palermo to earn their sixth successive league win.
Inter earned a narrow 1-0 victory at their relegation-threatened hosts when Portugal midfielder Joao Mario came off the bench to score the winner.
Switzerland midfielder Blerim Dzemaili scored twice as Bologna moved into the top half by winning 2-0 against Joe Hart's fading Torino.
Alessandro Matri also scored twice as Sassuolo won 3-1 at bottom club Pescara, while Genoa were twice pegged back in a 2-2 draw against third-bottom Crotone, despite Giovanni Simeone - son of Atletico Madrid coach Diego - netting.
Relegation already appears a foregone conclusion for the bottom three, with Crotone and Palermo both 11 points off safety and Pescara a further point behind.
