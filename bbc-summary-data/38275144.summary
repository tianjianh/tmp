The 18-year-old mum-of-one went missing while walking across wasteland near her parents' house in Coventry on 14 December, 1991.
Two men were cleared of her murder last year.
Her body has never been found but West Midlands Police said they are continuing to search for her.
A new search of land around Coombe Abbey began last month after new information came to light.
Timeline: Nicola Payne disappearance
John and Marilyn Payne, both 71, said they will "never give up hope" of finding their daughter and "putting an end to our suffering".
They said: "She was our little girl and our hearts break when we look back at family photos.
"We want closure and to be able to lay our daughter to rest before we leave this life ourselves."
West Midlands Police said a Â£10,000 reward for any information that helps to find Ms Payne is still active.
Det Insp Martin Slevin, leading the investigation into her disappearance, said: "We remain as committed as ever to achieving justice for Nicola, her family and the wider community and vow to pursue those responsible for Nicola's death."
