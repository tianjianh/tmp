Conrad Logan will drop out of the Hibernian team for Wednesday's Championship clash with Rangers despite the goalkeeper's Hampden heroics.

The Irishman deputised for suspended Mark Oxley in Saturday's Scottish Cup semi-final win over Dundee United.
Making his first appearance for 16 months, Logan kept a clean sheet and stopped two penalties in a shootout.
But manager Alan Stubbs confirmed that Oxley will return at Easter Road, saying: "Ox is my number one."
Logan, 30 on Monday, thwarted United in three one-on-one situations and made a smart save from a John Rankin shot in a game short on thrills.
He saved his best for the shootout, stopping efforts from Blair Spittal and Billy McKay as Hibs went through 4-2 on penalties.
"Conrad has come in and done magnificently and was rightly named man-of-the-match," Stubbs told BBC Scotland.
"He's done himself no harm whatsoever, pushing for a place. Every manager wants competition for places and he has raised the bar.
"We're delighted to have him. He's been great since he's come here and he needs to keep putting Mark under pressure."
Wednesday's match at Easter Road is a rehearsal for the Scottish Cup final on 21 May.
While Rangers have already wrapped up the Championship title, Hibs are in need of points as they bid to overhaul Falkirk - who are six points ahead, having played two games more - in second place.
"It's three huge points for us," said Stubbs. "It's a game that we must be looking to win.
"But I don't think there will be much relevance in terms of the cup final. Will the winners have an edge in the final? I don't see that one."
Rangers have had the best of the head-to-heads this season, with three victories, while Hibs won 2-1 at Easter Road in November.
Should Hibs finish behind Falkirk and then progress to the play-off final, it would mean a gruelling schedule of 11 games in 36 days for a side that looked exhausted during extra-time against Dundee United.
"When you have a goal that you've worked towards all season and a cup final, as a player, it doesn't get any better," said Stubbs.
"And then they can go away after being successful, if that's the case, and have a long rest. I'll give them extra time off in the summer.
"Yes, it's a lot of games but success is the thing everyone strives for in football and, when you've got something so close, tiredness isn't an issue."
