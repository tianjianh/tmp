'Cannabis' smell at Ely primary school traced to wild flower

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police called to investigate a strong smell of "cannabis" at a primary school have traced it to a wild flower.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rackham Primary in Ely in Cambridgeshire called police after teachers and parents noticed the aroma wafting across the car park.
It was identified as coming from a wild flower called Phlox growing nearby which has an "almost identical smell".
"We can happily reassure the community there isn't cannabis production going on in that area," police said.

A Cambridgeshire Police spokesman said: "Although the plant looks entirely different to cannabis in appearance (quite a pretty little flower) - it would certainly give a 'false positive' to the most sensitive of noses!"
