Audiences face seat-swap drama at Anne-Marie Duff play

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Theatre is asking audience members to swap seats half-way through its mining drama Husbands and Sons.

Those with ground-level tickets for the play will find themselves sitting on opposite side of the stage after the interval.
Starring Anne-Marie Duff, the work is based on three DH Lawrence dramas which evoke "a now-vanished world of manual labour and working class pride".
It begins previews at the Dorfman Theatre on 19 October.
Staged in the round, Ben Power's adaptation portrays three households in the mining village of Eastwood, on the Derbyshire-Nottinghamshire border.
But with three interiors on stage simultaneously,  director Marianne Elliott and set designer Bunny Christie realised that some of the audience would be very close to one and distant from the others.
"We thought the interval would be a chance to move seats to give the audience a different aspect," Christie told the BBC.
"The second seat will be the same in terms of the quality of the view - but you get to be involved with a different family.
"It's as if you're close to one of the houses and hear what's going on in there - and then you walk through the village and stand up close to a different household."
Christie, who worked with Elliott on the hit play The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time, said those in theatre pit would find two seat numbers printed on their ticket - one for each act.
"It's been quite a challenge at the box office," she said. "They had to do a tricky thing to circumvent the system. It's going to be interesting to see how it works."
A note on the National Theatre website says: "All audience members seated in the Pit will need to check coats and bags into the free cloakroom before the performance begins.
"If you do not want to swap seats you should book seats in the Circle or Gallery."
Husbands and Sons interweaves three DH Lawrence dramas - The Daughter-in-Law, A Collier's Friday Night and The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd - into a single work.
Duff, who plays Lizzie Holroyd, is joined by a cast that includes Joe Armstrong and Louise Brealey.
The play will run at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, in February and March 2016.
