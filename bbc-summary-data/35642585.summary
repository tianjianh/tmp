[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors to play on same day at DW Stadium

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Football League side Wigan Athletic and Super League's Wigan Warriors will both play at the DW Stadium on the same day for the first time in their history.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will occur on Monday, 28 March when the Latics take on Rochdale in League One at 13:30 BST and then the Warriors will face Hull KR in Super League, starting at 20:00 BST.
Warriors had requested the Rugby Football League move their game.
Both sides have shared the ground since it was built in 1999.
"We apologise to Wigan fans for this change of timing which is completely outside of our control," said Warriors chairman Ian Lenagan.
"We thank Wigan Athletic, Hull KR and Rochdale AFC for their cooperation and positive assistance in allowing the match at least to take place on Easter Monday, rather than at another venue or being postponed.
"The solution is an endorsement of the growing relationship between the two Wigan clubs."
