Kieran Dixon's hat-trick helped Hull KR beat Wakefield Trinity, who have now lost consecutive Super League games.

Rovers led 26-10 at half-time on the back of five tries, although Trinity, who had won nine of the past 11, kept in it with two tries of their own.
Wakefield reduced arrears but five more Rovers scores, which saw Dixon complete his hat-trick, took them beyond 50.
It was an unhappy reunion for home coach Chris Chester, who was sacked by Rovers in February.
However for his opposite number James Webster it was a sweet return following his departure as Trinity boss last season.
This success keeps ninth-placed Rovers' eyes fixed on a place in the top eight, something that Wakefield are desperate to hang on to after their own fine run lifted them into the reckoning.
The Robins have struggled to get their key personnel on the field in 2016 but a fit Kelly and halves partner Terry Campese were hugely influential, causing Wakefield problems with their dangerous kicking games.
Their deft kicks and perfectly timed passes were involved in scores for Dixon, James Greenwood who scored twice, Shaun Lunt, James Green and Maurice Blair, while Kelly himself scored a double.
Ex-Rovers full-back Craig Hall was among the Trinity try-scorers, along with Bill Tupou and Mikey Sio.
Dixon has been playing for Newcastle Thunder two divisions below and was only considered after teenage winger Joe Wardill was ruled out through illness.
The former London Broncos flier has been limited to seven appearances for James Webster's side, with his last outing in the Challenge Cup defeat by Oldham in April.
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We looked tired, things didn't change,. Hull KR were too good for us that first 40 minutes and put us under some real pressure but defensively we were very poor all night.
"You can't give players like Albert Kelly and Terry Campese time on the ball but because we were losing ruck after ruck - it killed us.
"We showed some desire and character to get within 10 points but it's what we did without the ball that disappointed me and that's two poor performances on the bounce."
Hull KR head coach James Webster told BC Radio Humberside:
"After backing up from Catalans we struggled with energy, our scores during the week with energy were low all week, and we did a good job of finding motivation and to produce a great performance.
"We built it up all week about starting well and playing a bit but we made our own luck tonight.
"Having the best players playing helps, it's the second time this year that Campese and Kelly have played together, we think we're a good team when we have everyone playing."
