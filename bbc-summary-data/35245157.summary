Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last time out, Lawro got seven correct results, with no perfect scores. That gave him a tally of 70 points, which was enough to beat Match of the Day commentator Steve Wilson, who managed three correct results with no perfect scores for 30 points.
Lawro was also up against a state-of-the-art sports-forecasting super-computer called SAM (Sports Analytics Machine) - which scored an impressive 110 points for the third week running to stay top of the guest leaderboard.
We are also keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct.
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week 19 v Guy Mowbray)
Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week one v Graeme Swann)
