[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tributes paid to Bishop David Thomas after sudden death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tributes have been paid to the retired Welsh bishop, the Right Reverend David Thomas, who has died suddenly at the age of 74.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bishop Thomas served as the Provincial Assistant Bishop for 12 years, providing care for those opposed to Church in Wales women priests.
He stepped-down in 2008 when the post ceased.
The Bishop of Swansea and Brecon John Davies paid tribute to his colleague's "long and distinguished ministry".
"At heart David was, I believe, a parish priest with great love and care for the people committed to his care and oversight," said Bishop Davies.
The retired priest had only just returned from a holiday to mark his 50th wedding anniversary to his wife Rosemary.
He had celebrated the 20th anniversary of his ordination as a bishop in December at a service in St Mary's Priory Abergavenny,  Monmouthshire.
Canon Mark Soady, Area Dean of Abergavenny, said: "He shall be sorely missed by the people of Abergavenny who had a great fondness for him.
"Our prayers are with Rosemary and the family at this time."
