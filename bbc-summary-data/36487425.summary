Delport, who was born in South Africa but qualifies as a non-overseas player, has scored 2,045 T20 runs at an average of 25.56 with a strike rate of 135.70.
The 27-year-old left-hander played with elite performance director Andrew McDonald at Sydney Thunder in 2015.
McDonald said: "Cameron has experience in most of the world's top T20 competitions and his knowledge and skill will be valuable assets."
Delport shared the highest-ever one-day first-wicket stand with Morne van Wyk - an unbroken 367 set in a South African one-day game for Dolphins against Knights in Bloemfontein in October 2014.
Leicestershire's next match in the competition is against Lancashire at Old Trafford on Friday.
