The Owl and Falconry Centre, at Gardenlands Garden Centre in Shipley, Wolverhampton, was broken into overnight on 24 September.
Gyr Saker Falcons, Barn Owls, and Burrowing Owls are among the seven birds stolen.
Gemma Wigley, from the falconry, said the those responsible were not caught on CCTV.
"The Gyr Saker's are our main attractions, those two birds alone are worth Â£7,000 each," she said.
The falconry, which houses about 50 birds and other mammals, is run by volunteers and tours nursing homes and primary schools on educational visits.
Ms Wigley said aviaries had been badly damaged in the break-in, but they would remain open.
