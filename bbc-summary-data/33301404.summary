[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey's Ben Foakes struck a century before Tom Curran ripped through Gloucestershire's top order as the hosts dominated day two at The Oval.

Foakes, whose last Championship hundred came for Essex at Bristol in April 2014, made 118 as the hosts moved from their overnight 279-5 to 448 all out.
Surrey captain Gareth Batty also hit 50 while Liam Norwell finished with 5-112.
Curran reduced the visitors to 36-4 and then picked up a fifth wicket before Gloucestershire closed on 102-7.
Foakes' measured fourth first-class ton, which came off 188 balls and included 12 fours, was in contrast to Batty's 41-ball half-century as the pair shared an eighth-wicket stand of 80 to take Surrey past 400.
It was a different story when Gloucestershire batted, as fast bowler Curran dismissed Chris Dent for nought with his third ball and then bowled Will Tavare and Michael Klinger in successive overs.
When Curran removed Ian Cockbain, he had incredible figures of 4-9 from six overs.
The 20-year-old then ended the day by sending Jack Taylor's stumps flying with the final ball to finish with figures of 5-17, while Hamish Marshall remained unbeaten on 30.
Surrey batsman Ben Foakes told BBC London 94.9:
"Hundreds are amazing to get but especially getting one at The Oval, my first one for Surrey, is a great feeling.
"I didn't give the spectators much for their money but it was tough, it nipped around all day, and as you can see we've been able to go through them quite cheaply.
"I don't think I've seen a spell better than that (Tom Curran's 5-17). It was unbelievable. He bowled a couple of jaffas and then was on the money every ball."
