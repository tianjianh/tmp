Bale had not played since Wales beat Cyprus 2-1 in October, but came off the bench for Real in Tuesday's Champions League win against Liverpool.
Wales manager Chris Coleman hopes Bale, 25, gets more game time for Madrid against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday.
"It will be nice if he gets an hour," said Coleman.
"He'll probably play 90 minutes knowing Gareth and it will do him good just to get that little bit of rhythm back in his play before he joins up with us.
"He looked good coming on against Liverpool, looked quick looked sharp so that's positive."
Coleman's side top Group B going into the match with the World Cup quarter-finalists in Brussels.
Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen return to the squad following injuries.
Both players missed October's qualifiers against Bosnia-Hercegovina and Cyprus through injury, but have returned to action for their clubs since then.
Allen played 90 minutes for Liverpool against Real Madrid in the Champions League while Arsenal's Ramsey featured against Anderlecht in the same competition.
Three other players who also missed Wales' last two qualifiers, West Ham defender James Collins, Celtic full-back Adam Matthews and Wolves captain Sam Ricketts, return to Coleman's squad.
Wolves midfielder Lee Evans and Newcastle United defender Paul Dummett, who pulled out of the last squad because of injuries, are also included.
Evans is one of four uncapped players in the squad along with goalkeepers Owain Fon Williams of Tranmere and Liverpool's Danny Ward and Leicester City striker Tom Lawrence.
Wales will be without Leicester midfielder Andy King who is suspended and Reading striker Simon Church (damaged collarbone) and Wolves midfielder Dave Edwards (knee ligament damage).
Wales squad: Wayne Hennessey (Crystal Palace), Owain FÃ´n Williams (Tranmere Rovers ), Danny Ward (Liverpool), Ashley Williams (Swansea City), James Chester (Hull City), James Collins (West Ham United), Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur), Paul Dummett (Newcastle United), Neil Taylor (Swansea City), Sam Ricketts (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Chris Gunter (Reading), Adam Matthews (Celtic), Danny Gabbidon (Cardiff City), Emyr Huws (Wigan Athletic), Joe Ledley (Crystal Palace), Joe Allen (Liverpool), Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal), Lee Evans (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Hal Robson-Kanu (Reading), David Cotterill (Birmingham City), George Williams (Fulham), Tom Lawrence (Leicester City), Jake Taylor (Reading), Gareth Bale (Real Madrid)
