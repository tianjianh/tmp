Scotland's top bulls go on sale in Stirling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pedigree bulls from around the country have been going up for auction at the Stirling Bull Sales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The auction, which runs on several days through the start of February, stems from the world-famous Perth Bull Sales, which were established in 1865.
It now takes place at the new United Auctions headquarters in Stirling and was renamed in 2012.
Among the breeds on sale are Aberdeen-Angus, Beef Shorthorn, Charolais, Simmental and Limousin.
Auctioneer David Brown said: "The spring sales offers no less than 342 vendors of high-quality bulls and females.
"Entries come from the four corners of the UK - from Shetland and Orkney to Somerset, Southampton, Portsmouth and from Northern Ireland, Swansea and Wold in Wales, to Oxfordshire and Lincolnshire - highlighting the national importance of this event."
