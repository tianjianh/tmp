[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The founder of Latinos For Trump has been widely mocked for warning of a future with "taco trucks on every corner" in the US if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election.

Marco Gutierrez was explaining why he supports Donald Trump, a day after the presidential candidate's visit to Mexico.
"My culture is a very dominant culture and it's imposing and it's causing problems," he told MSNBC.
"If you don't do something about it, you're going to have taco trucks on every corner."
His warning led to ridicule on social media as people suggested the prediction sounded like a utopian vision of the US.
On Twitter, #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner became the top trend worldwide with almost 60,000 tweets using the hashtag since Gutierrez made his prediction.
"Hey, what's wrong with #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner?!", tweeted Mexican-American actress Eva Longoria while Democrat politician Eric Swalwell posted a map by depicting tacos all over the area he represents.
Comedian Akilah Hughes tweeted a gif of raining tacos and pledged: "I will vote for whoever promises #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner."
And journalist Marcus Baram played on the Trump campaign phrase "Make America Great Again" by suggesting more tacos could help towards that aim.
Others shared images of Donald Trump enjoying the traditional Mexican dish - an image he originally posted to mark Cinco de Mayo, which celebrates Mexican heritage.
