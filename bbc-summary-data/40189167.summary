The British Red Cross has launched a campaign calling for people to come together, a week on from the London Bridge and Borough Market attack.
Restaurants will donate money from a chosen dish, and pubs and bars will ask for donations of the price of a drink.
All money raised will go to the British Red Cross UK Solidarity Fund.
It helps victims of terror attacks and their families anywhere in the UK.
The fund, set up in the wake of the terror attacks in London and Manchester, raised nearly Â£400,000 in its first 48 hours.
Taxi app firm Uber will give a pound for every journey taken between 8pm and midnight on Saturday night, a British Red Cross spokesman said.
Collections will be held at the production of Don Juan, starring David Tennant, at Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End.
Eight people were killed on Saturday 3 June when three attackers drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and launched a knife attack in Borough Market. The attackers were shot dead by officers.
Comedian Amy Lame, who was appointed the London "night czar" by mayor Sadiq Khan last year, said London's nightlife was "its heart and soul".
"A Saturday night for London, a week after the terrible attacks at London Bridge, is a chance for people to show the unity and resilience of this great city and the generosity of Londoners in getting out and raising money to help the survivors, the victims and their families," she said.
Donald Hyslop, Borough Market chairman of trustees, said: "Borough Market is not just a collection of stalls, restaurants and pubs; it is a community of people.
"Never has that been more apparent than it is now, in this darkest of hours."
