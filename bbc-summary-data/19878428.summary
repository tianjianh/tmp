Dominic Green, 23, from Rhyl, and Alexandra Hewitt, 24, from Broughton, were bailed until November.
The former Sheffield United striker was jailed for five years in April after raping the 19-year-old.
At least 17 people have been arrested as part of the investigation.
Jim Brisbane, chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales said: "We have completed reviews in relation to a number of the suspects under investigation".
He said there was sufficient evidence to charge Dominic Green, 23, from Rhyl and Alexandra Hewitt, 24, from Broughton, Flintshire, with the offence of publishing a matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape case.
"Both have been charged by North Wales Police and bailed to appear before Prestatyn Magistrates' Court on 5 November," said Mr Brisbane.
He said a further suspect under the age of 18 has been issued with a final warning by police.
"Evidence relating to a number of other suspects has been presented to us as part of this investigation and our evidential reviews are continuing," Mr Brisbane added.
