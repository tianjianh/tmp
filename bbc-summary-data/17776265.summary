Romania country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The largest of the Balkan countries, Romania has dramatic mountain scenery and a coastline on the Black Sea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has seen numerous empires come and go from the Roman and Ottoman to the Austro-Hungarian.
After World War II the country fell under Communist rule, although the leadership pursued a foreign policy independent of that of the Soviet Union.
The legacy of Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu lingered long after the uprising which brought about his downfall on Christmas Day 1989.
A slower developer than other former communist countries of eastern Europe, Romania took a major step away from its past when it was one of seven countries to join Nato in late March 2004.
In April 2005 Bucharest signed an EU accession treaty, paving the way for Romania eventually to join the union in January 2007.

President: Klaus Iohannis
Provincial mayor Klaus Iohannis inflicted a shock defeat on Prime Minister Victor Ponta in a presidential election run-off in November 2014.
Mr Ponta was leading in the opinion polls and had beaten Mr Iohannis, the centre-right mayor of the city of Sibiu in Transylvania, in the first round of voting.
But Mr Iohannis, who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, won a decisive victory on a record turn-out.
Prime Minister: Sorin Grindeanu
Former communications minister Sorin Grindeanu took office as prime minister in January 2017, paving the way for the return to power of a Social Democrat-led coalition government.
The centre-left Social Democrats were ousted from power in November 2015 after a deadly fire in a Bucharest nightclub sparked anti-government riots.
Concerns that safety was compromised because of corruption - a long-standing issue in Romania - fuelled public anger against the political elite. A non-party government of technocrats took over until the December 2016 elections.
But only weeks into Mr Grindeanu's term in office, more than 200,000 people came out onto the streets to protest against his government's plan to decriminalise certain forms of corruption.
Romania has one of the most dynamic media markets in southeastern Europe. A handful of conglomerates dominates the industry.
TV is the medium of choice, with commercial stations Pro TV and Antena 1 being the leading outlets. TVR is the public broadcaster.
There is a competitive pay TV sector, via cable and satellite. Romania is yet to complete the switch to digital terrestrial TV (DTT).
There are more than 100 private radios. Public Radio Romania operates national, regional and local stations.
