The England and Wales Cricket Board created the role leading the England team in a restructure after managing director Paul Downton left in April.
Strauss's fellow former England captains Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart had also expressed an interest in the position.
But it is understood Vaughan is no longer in the running for the role.
Job descriptions were sent to a number of candidates last month and Stewart said the ECB "needs to decide what the job is going to look like".
Strauss, 38, captained England in 50 of his 100 Tests, scoring 7,037 runs at an average of 40.91.
Confirming his interest in the role last month, he said it was "very important" for England to "move on" after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves suggested the door remained open to Surrey batsman Kevin Pietersen if he was scoring runs in county cricket.
Pietersen, 34, was dropped in 2012 for sending derogatory text messages about Strauss - then England captain - to members of the South Africa team.
Last July, Strauss apologised to Pietersen after making an offensive remark about him during a live television broadcast when he thought he was off-air.
Speaking after England lost the third Test in the West Indies to draw the series 1-1, Geoffrey Boycott told BBC Sport "things won't change" if Strauss is appointed.
The former England opener and Test Match Special pundit said captain Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores were "cautious" and "don't have any imagination".
He added: "If Andrew Strauss is the new ECB director of cricket, it'll stay the same."
Ex-England pace bowler Angus Fraser said Strauss is an "excellent man" whose work with former England head coach Andy Flower showed his strengths.
The Middlesex director of cricket and England selector told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "They put a plan in place and worked to it. They won Ashes series and became the number one Test side in the world.
"Thinking things through, getting the organisation right and putting the right people in the right positions is something he'll do very well.
"If you've produced a Test side that got to number one in the world, you must have taken ideas on board."
