[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A BBC documentary featuring 10 British Muslims with different views living together has received a mixed reception from critics and viewers.

The group included Abdul Haqq, who did not agree with men and women mixing, and gay housemate Fehran Khan.
The Daily Mail gave the programme zero stars and described the show as a "squalid, cheap game".
But the Telegraph gave it four stars and said it was a "wake-up call for Islamophobes everywhere."
The two-part show had come in for criticism even before the first episode aired because of the inclusion of Haqq, a former boxer who told filmmakers that if his passport - which had been confiscated by the British authorities - was returned to him, he would want to go to Syria.
The Mail said the programme was "an exercise in stoking up rows and controversy... the BBC launched this calculated attempt to set 10 Muslims at each other's throats".
The Times gave the programme four stars, noting that "including Abdul Haqq was a risky move for the BBC, but what's the point of showcasing a conversation if you don't hear all sides of it?".
It described the programme as "intelligent and sharply illuminating".
There was a varied reaction to the documentary on social media.
Khalad Hussein wrote that he had mixed feelings on the participants and there were not enough "characters" in the show.
Sarah tweeted it "just seems they wanted to add more confusion and conflict, they never make a show like this about any other religion."
Matt Tassel tweeted it was "brilliant television programming. Essential viewing that pulls no punches and opens new doors."
The BBC made no comment about the show, which concludes on Tuesday evening on BBC Two.
