[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former New Zealand centre Regan King has left Jersey for personal reasons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old has returned to his homeland just seven months after joining the island side from Scarlets.
King, who won his only All Blacks cap against Wales in 2002, made eight appearances for Jersey, but did not score a try in his time at St Peter
"Regan is without doubt a huge talent, and his all-round rugby experience and influence was unquestionable," head coach Harvey Biljon said.
"He could just get in the zone, and other members of the squad were able to learn a great deal from that."
King's departure is the latest blow for the island side who have had a troubled season.
Samoan international centre Fautua Otto was jailed after admitting driving while disqualified in September, while the club had to sell their ground and assets last month after financial problems.
