Gorka Marquez needed dental surgery after two of his lower jaw front teeth were badly chipped in Blackpool.
The BBC said he was attacked by a gang of youths while reportedly walking to a nightclub with colleagues on Saturday.
A Strictly spokesman said Mr Marquez "doesn't wish to make a formal complaint" and "just wants to move on".
The 26-year-old Spaniard was in the Lancashire resort for a live edition of the show from Blackpool Tower Ballroom when he was the victim of an "unprovoked incident".
Mr Marquez was getting out of a car when a "random group of lads" ran past and assaulted him, the Strictly spokesman added.
A Lancashire Police spokesperson said: "We have checked CCTV and spoken to the club and inquiries continue.
"We have had no formal complaint from Mr Marquez."
After the attack, Marquez tweeted: "Thanks for all your kind messages and support about Blackpool.
"It was a bad experience but I'm feeling better and just want to look forward to the show on Saturday!"
Mr Marquez made his Strictly debut in this year's series and had been partnering EastEnders actress Tameka Empson, who plays Kim Fox in the BBC soap.
They were eliminated in the second round but Marquez has continued to appear in the programme as part of the weekly group routines.
