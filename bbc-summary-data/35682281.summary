Referee Steven McLean pointed to the spot following a challenge by Dons skipper Ryan Jack, 24, on Craig.
Aberdeen, who are second in the Premiership, had led 1-0 through Simon Church's first-half goal.
"He's given the referee a decision to make and the referee's given it and I've tucked it away," said Craig, 29.
"It's a penalty," he added on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
"When you see the reaction of Ryan Jack after the game - I spoke to him for about a minute about the game and that was a big moment in Aberdeen's season - if Jack feels that I've gone down easy or dived, he's chasing me off the park. He's not going to stand and talk to me and tell me, yeah he got a nick on the ball but he knew he caught me with the follow through as well.
"Our first-half performance probably deserved a point although the second half Aberdeen were very dominant and will be probably more frustrated that they didn't go on to win the game and add to the one-goal lead. That'll disappoint them more than the penalty I think."
The Dons, who were upset at the award of the spot-kick, missed the chance to close the gap on leaders Celtic to four points.
And boss Derek McInnes commented after the game: "Whether it's a penalty or not I still believe we should deal with things better in the build-up to it.
"I can't be certain from where I was and having seen it again I can't be certain it's a penalty either way.
"I thought there was contact [with the ball]. Ryan Jack said there's contact.
"It's a really disappointing way to end the game. Once we got ourselves in front we were in control of the game.
"We're licking our wounds a wee bit at the moment because I didn't see an equaliser coming."
