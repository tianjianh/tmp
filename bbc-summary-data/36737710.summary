The 16-year-old clocked 54.49 seconds with Russia's Kolesnikov Kliment winning gold in a world junior record of 53.65.
Ferguson was the second fastest qualifier into the final, having won his semi-final in 54.47 seconds.
He narrowly missed out on making the Irish team for the Olympic Games.
Sligo's Mona McSharry won bronze in the 50m breaststroke on Wednesday.
The 15-year-old, who swims with the Marlins club in Donegal, joins Olympians Grainne Murphy and Sycerika McMahon as a European Junior medallist.
