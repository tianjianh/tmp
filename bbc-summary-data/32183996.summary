New Zealand pick Martin Guptill & Matt Henry for England tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Zealand have recalled batsman Martin Guptill to the Test squad for their forthcoming tour of England.

Guptill, 28, has not played a Test since the 2013 tour to England, but last month hit 237 against West Indies, the highest score in World Cup history.
Paceman Matt Henry gets a maiden Test call and uncapped all-rounder Mitchell Santner is in the one-day squad.
The World Cup runners-up will play two Tests, five one-dayers and a Twenty20 international from 21 May to 23 June.
"This is a stable, established Test side but there will be opportunities for contenders," said coach Mike Hesson.
Of Guptill, who averages 39 in one-day internationals but only 29 from his 31 Tests, Hesson added: "Martin's a classically styled batsman and there's really no reason why he can't be as influential in the longer game as he is in the short."
Guptill's recall may mean Derbyshire have to make an additional overseas signing, as he had originally signed to play in their first six County Championship games but will now only be available for three.
Brendon McCullum captains the 15-man squad but is one of several players who will miss the two warm-up matches ahead of the opening Test at Lord's on 21 May because of Indian Premier League commitments.
Wicketkeeper BJ Watling will take charge of those fixtures, with Santner and uncapped pace bowlers Jacob Duffy and Ben Wheeler joining the squad.
Fast bowler Adam Milne, who was ruled out of the World Cup with a heel injury and replaced by Henry before the semi-final against South Africa, has been included in the limited-overs squad, while the only World Cup squad member not involved is seamer Kyle Mills.
Test squad: Brendon McCullum (captain), Corey Anderson, Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Mark Craig, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Luke Ronchi (wk), Hamish Rutherford, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Neil Wagner, BJ Watling (wk), Kane Williamson.
ODI and T20 squad: Brendon McCullum (captain), Corey Anderson, Trent Boult, Grant Elliott, Martin Guptill, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Mitchell McClenaghan, Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Luke Ronchi (wk), Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Kane Williamson.
