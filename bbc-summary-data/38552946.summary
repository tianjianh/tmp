The 23-year-old, from Kentucky, saw his five-shot lead cut to one in the space of two holes along the back nine.
But he recovered to close on four-under 69 and win a third PGA Tour title.
Matsuyama carded 70 for second place while American 2016 champion Jordan Spieth closed on 65 to share third with compatriots Pat Perez and Ryan Moore.
"It's a great feeling," Thomas told Golf Channel after his victory, which saw him jump 10 places to 12th in the world rankings.
"I obviously stumbled a bit more than I would have liked to on some of those holes but I think it really shows where my game is at right now.
"I had some lows there in the second part of the nine but I stuck it out to still get it done."
