[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 0-0 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall extended their unbeaten streak to six games with a League One stalemate against fellow play-off hopefuls Charlton Athletic in the south London derby at The Valley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Gregory had the best chance of the first half, but his lobbed effort just crept wide.
Charlton, who had both top scorer Josh Magennis and debutant Lewis Page withdraw during the opening exchanges through injury, responded with a volleyed effort from Nathan Byrne which tested the palms of Jordan Archer.
After a drab start to the second-half, Millwall were the first to force a chance in the shape of substitute Shane Ferguson, who flashed his volley wide.
The Lions then increased the pressure when Steve Morison's goal-bound shot was cleared by Jorge Teixeira before Shaun Hutchinson should have done better with a header that went past the post.
Centre-back Byron Webster failed to get his header from Shaun Williams' corner on target while Gregory somehow saw a header go just wide.
Following the full-time whistle, Teixeira was then red carded for an off-the-ball incident.
