[SN]TITLE[SN]
Government approves Crofting Commission's Plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A document setting out how the Crofting Commission will operate has been approved by the Scottish government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Called the Plan, it explains how the public body will make decisions in line with regulations contained in the 2010 Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act.
The organisation, formerly known as the Crofters Commission, had consulted publicly on the document before submitting it to the government.
Halting depopulation in remote communities is a key aim of the Plan.
The law requires the commission to ensure all tenants and owner-occupier crofters reside on or within 19 miles (32km) of their crofts.
Convener Susan Walker said: "People sometimes associate crofting with the past.
"But while an awareness and understanding of the past is important, through our Plan, the commission has clearly set its sights on the future of crofting."
