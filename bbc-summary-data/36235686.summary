A couple who completed a World Cup sticker album with their own drawings of players have picked up their pens again to sketch for charity.

Dubbed the "Panini Cheapskates", Alex and Sian Pratchett, from Oxford, created all 639 stickers of the World Cup Panini album in 2014.
Last year, the duo then turned their hands to politics, sketching party leaders ahead of May's election.
They now hope to create 800 stickers for the Euro 2016 album, for charity.
They plan to start their latest challenge on 10 June - the day the tournament starts - and finish when it ends on 10 July.
Raising cash for Cancer Research UK and Macintyre Charities would give the pair "the motivation to keep churning out our dishevelled little men even when our brains and bodies are telling us to stop", Mr Pratchett said.
He admitted the couple, who "have actual jobs and, in many ways, actual lives" had not got any better at drawing since 2014, describing their attempts as "uniformly awful".
As well as creating all 800 players, Mr and Mrs Pratchett have also pledged to sketch personalised pictures of the top 100 donors.
