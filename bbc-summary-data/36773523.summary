Super League: Hull FC 36-12 Hull KR

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC moved back to the Super League summit with a thrashing of Hull KR that also denied their rivals a Super League regular season top eight spot.

Rovers will now finish in the bottom four, who will face four Championship clubs in the post-split Qualifiers.
The hosts raced into an 18-0 lead at the break through Liam Watts, Danny Houghton and Mark Minichiello tries.
Minichiello and Steve Michaels twice added to the lead, with Adam Walker and Iain Thornley scoring for Rovers.
Wakefield's trip to Catalans Dragons this weekend was made less stressful, as the result ensures they can go into the Challenge Cup semi-final against Warrington later this month with top-flight status intact.
It was a typically bruising derby for both sides with James Donaldson, Gareth Ellis and Marc Sneyd all withdrawn for concussion assessments - but unlike the derby at Craven Park this season there was to be no second-half comeback.
Victory ensured a three-derby clean sweep for the Airlie Birds in 2016, who had lost their past two games, but things might have been so different had Robins winger Ken Sio collected a kick cleanly when picked out free by Albert Kelly.
Ex-Rovers props Scott Taylor and Watts were given plenty of stick by the travelling support, but it had little impact as their go-forward gave the influential Sneyd room to pull the strings with his kicking game.
The latter crashed over from Houghton's short-ball, who scored himself from a Sneyd kick and Minichiello twice showed great footwork and power to stride across.
Michaels twice got away down the right for Hull either side of Walker's well-worked try and Thornley's score was the last act on a tough night for Rovers, who have now lost five city derbies in a row.
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford told BBC Radio Humberside:
"I'm really pleased, we got our fluency back n our performance and intent in physicality, it was something we highlighted.
"We defended our tryline supremely well, that broke the momentum and then we were ruthless in their end.
"I felt it needed to be a team effort, the Huddersfield game we looked flat, and the effort was there last week against Leeds but the clinical side wasn't.
"To right those wrongs tonight was really pleasing in a huge game in front of a huge crowd."
Hull KR head coach James Webster told BBC Radio Humberside:
"Hull were outstanding, a very big strong team, there were a couple of periods where we had to take chances and we missed them.
"I'm not going to blame Ken, he's been outstanding and I've never seem him drop a ball but he did. We could have had 26 or 27 points tonight and we could have had a chance of winning if we had.
"We never looked like winning that game, they were too big and too powerful for us."
