The disturbance in Pill, on 20 October, also saw wheelie bins set alight and "Molotov cocktails" being thrown.
The Newport men pleaded guilty to violent disorder at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday.
Grant Cuthbert, 32, was jailed for 34 months, Gary Radford, 23, received a 24-month sentence and Ahbil Hussain Ahmed, 23, was jailed for 18 months.
In November, sentences were handed to five teenagers for their involvement in the same incident, with three of them given five months in custody.
Prosecutors described a riot on Commercial Road, with more than 20 people throwing stones at cars and one motorist having to perform a three-point turn to escape.
Social media footage was shown of a man throwing a flaming bottle with police retreating after a PCSO "narrowly missed being struck by a lit firework".
Other footage showed Cuthbert being encouraged to throw a lit bottle - described as a Molotov cocktail - from an alleyway, with flames erupting after it landed on the road.
He said it was to protect people around him, a claim Judge Michael Fitton described as "utterly ridiculous".
Radford and Ahmed were also shown throwing stones at police vehicles and parked cars, while other people set fire to cars and a shop front.
Judge Fitton said the fact missiles and Molotov cocktails were being thrown meant the situation was "rapidly getting out of control", adding: "you are all men of an age to know better".
He said they were "surrounded by children" and that Radford and Ahmed were "encouraging" those around them.
Mr Cuthbert said: "I want to make it known to the culprits that this is a very dangerous game they are playing and that there will be consequences for their actions.
"I will be working in partnership with Newport City Council and Gwent Police to ensure the culprits are brought to justice and to prevent further incidents."
