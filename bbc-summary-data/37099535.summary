A pipe bomb attack on a police patrol in Londonderry was "an act of madness", the Police Federation has said.

The bomb was thrown at the patrol at the Leckey Road flyover, close to a controversial nationalist bonfire overnight in Derry.
No-one was injured but people had to leave their homes at nearby Charlotte Street in the alert.
PFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said "mindless terrorists and their misguided supporters" were responsible.
"Lives were needlessly disrupted and put at risk. A local community was left traumatised and, in the end, nothing was achieved by this act of madness," he said.
"Officers were once again targeted by dissident republicans, but that won't deter them from doing their job in a professional manner."
Mr Lindsay urged anyone with information about the attack to speak to police.
The security alert in the city's Bogside ended at 03:13 BST on Tuesday.
The bonfire reached 20ft (6m) in height and partially blocked the road, leading to complaints from some residents.. Union jacks and Sinn FÃ©in election posters were burned.
"We are investigating all offences committed at the bonfire in the Bogside last night, including a serious incident where a viable pipe bomb-type device was thrown at a police patrol," said PSNI District Commander Mark McEwan.
Foyle Democratic Unionist Party MLA Gary Middleton, who was in the Bogside earlier on Monday, condemned those behind the attack.
"The fact that a viable pipe bomb was thrown, potentially putting dozens of lives at risk, is a deeply worrying incident," he said.
"Those who constructed and threw this device are terrorists who clearly have no regard for the lives of anyone in the city.
"My thoughts are also with many residents who were forced to leave their homes for a number of hours last night," Mr Middleton added.
A last-minute attempt to move the structure from the middle of the road failed on Monday night.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Raymond McCartney said he believed dissident republicans were responsible for the bonfire and the security alert.
"I don't think the focus should be on the election posters," said Mr McCartney.
"There were election posters of all other parties, ourselves included.
"This isn't an act of defiance, this is a group of young people aided and abetted by other dissident elements in this city."
Independent councillor Gary Donnelly said young people in the area have been forgotten about.
"People need to sit around the table and have dialogue - there seems to be a complete disconnect with the young people in that area," he said.
"All week they have been bombarded by a relentless demonisation and criminalisation policy by some elected representatives.
"They will no doubt say that two or three thousand people at that bonfire in the Bogside would be support."
A number of community festivals were held in Creggan, Shantallow and the Bogside areas of the city as an alternative to the annual bonfires.
Bonfires are traditionally set alight on 15 August in some nationalist areas of Derry to mark the Catholic feast day of the Assumption.
The date commemorates the Virgin Mary's death and assumption into heaven.
However, nationalist and republican politicians have criticised the practice, saying it causes disruption to local residents.
Social Democratic and Labour Party councillor John Boyle said: "We need to find different ways of celebrating culture.
"If the police or any other statutory agency had attempted to remove the bonfire we may well actually have been looking at something a hell of a lot worse than we're looking at currently."
