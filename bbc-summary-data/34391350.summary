West Yorkshire 'invalid driving fines not to be refunded'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly £500,000 worth of wrongly-issued parking fines will not be refunded, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Yorkshire Police confirmed last month that 16,000 tickets issued by police community support officers (PCSO) were not valid due because of an "administrative error".
But, the force said there was "no basis in law" for refunds, which would have "come from the public purse".
Many of the drivers paid up without challenging the ticket's validity.
After a review of PCSO powers in March, the force found some PCSOs who joined the force several years ago were not initially given powers to issue parking tickets.
In a statement, police said "an administrative error meant that the authorisation was invalid".
The force's current records system, which goes back to 2006, found 16,000 tickets were affected, resulting in total of £485,000 being paid to the courts.
The force admitted other tickets may have been issued in similar circumstances for up to three years earlier.
It said it had taken legal advice on the matter.
A spokesman said: "We are now satisfied that there is no basis in law that would entitle anyone to such a refund, which would in any case have had to come from the public purse.
At the heart of this assessment is that motorists had opportunity to challenge the validity of the process in court at the time, and only those found guilty in these circumstances were penalised.
"If, however, motorists elected to pay the penalty they effectively accepted having committed the offence and opted out of the court process, thereby waiving their right to contest the matter."
The force said the "anomaly" had since been corrected and PCSOs now had the full powers to issue the fines.
