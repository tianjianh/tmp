Ilkay Gundogan remains a long-term absentee but Fernandinho and Vincent Kompany will hope to earn recalls.
Swansea could name an unchanged starting line-up for a third successive game.
Captain Leon Britton has returned to training following a calf problem and will be part of the travelling squad.
Steve Wilson: "A few weeks ago, checking out Swansea's heaviest ever Premier League defeat was an essential task for whichever MOTD commentator was assigned to their next game.
"Under Bob Bradley they were lucky that record was only equalled when they lost 5-0 at Spurs - you suspect it could have been shattered had they played at Manchester City.
"But Paul Clement has already made such an impact that, incredibly, half of their Premier League wins this season have been accrued under his care - and he's only been in charge for four games.
"Getting something at City still looks a long shot, especially the way Pep Guardiola's men went about their oft-repeated task of ripping West Ham to shreds on Wednesday.
"But a Swansea thumping is not inevitable - and that's progress."

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola on leaving out Sergio Aguero recently: "I understand the debate. But there is no doubt about the quality of Sergio."
"He's played all the games except one in Barcelona for a tactical decision and one when he'd come back from Argentina. The other games when he was not banned he always played - and played good.
"But now we knew from the beginning with have a new player [Gabriel Jesus].
"The big clubs in Europe always have a lot of strikers... you see at Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus - at Madrid [Alvaro] Morata doesn't play. Big clubs need a lot of strikers and we do."
Swansea City head coach Paul Clement: "We know there are 15 games to go with a hard game on Sunday.
"If we keep going as we are we have a big chance [of staying up] but there is a lot football to be played.
"There is a lot of hard work to do before we reach that point."
Swansea have seen an upturn in results since Paul Clement took charge but Manchester City have also improved dramatically of late.
A big part of that is the fact all of City's attacking players are in really good form and I don't think Swansea can keep them out.
