An exhibition to mark the 100th anniversary of the Women's Institute (WI) in Wales is being shown in Beaumaris, on Anglesey, over the weekend.

The first meeting of the WI anywhere in Britain was in nearby Llanfairpwll in September 1915.
To mark the movement's history and campaigning, each regional federation in Wales has produced a decorated panel depicting key events from its past.
Digital stories are also included.
The aim of the 13 panels is to bring to life the contribution the WI has made and the influence it has had on communities and the country over the last 100 years.
The first panel depicts the journey from the very first WI in Stoney Creek, Canada, to Llanfairpwll.
Ann Jones, chairman of the Federation of Wales, said: "In Anglesey I think there was a real need for women to get together and it worked and it spread like wild fire.
"Within a few months there were 40 WIs in both Wales and in England, and within two years we were over 250 WIs."
The digital stories at the exhibition, which is being held at the Bulkeley Hotel, capture the memories, attitudes, feelings and experiences of WI members.
