Supermarket Sainsbury's is cutting about 800 jobs as part of a restructuring at its stores.

The changes will see the loss of department and deputy manager positions.
The cuts are part of a plan announced in November to save Â£500m over the next three years.
"These are exceptionally difficult decisions to make and we have not taken them lightly," said Roger Burnley, retail and operations director.
The company said it would also replace night shifts with early-morning and evening shifts in some stores as part of an effort to improve customer service.
Last month, Sainsbury's warned that the trading outlook for the rest of the financial year would "remain challenging for the foreseeable future" after reporting a drop in like-for-like sales for a fifth consecutive quarter.
BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson said Sainsbury's has already cut 500 jobs at its head office, and the changes follow similar moves at rivals  Morrisons, Asda and Tesco.
"All the big established supermarkets are trying to cut costs and simplify their business as they grapple with falling sales, the rise of online and changing shopping habits," she said.
Sainsbury's employs about 161,000 staff across 1,200 stores, depots and support centres.
