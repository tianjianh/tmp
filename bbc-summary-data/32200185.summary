[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
India's main opposition Congress party vice president Rahul Gandhi is preparing to return to politics after a leave of absence of nearly two months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A senior party leader said Mr Gandhi would speak at a meeting of farmers in Delhi on 19 April.
Mr Gandhi's break from politics created a stir on social media and the BJP government accused him of "holidaying" while parliament was in session.
Mr Gandhi led his party to its worst performance in May's general election.
He took leave on 23 February because he wanted time to think, his party said.
The decision came days after his party failed to win a single seat in state polls in Delhi. Party officials had said he wanted to assess his role and the party's future.
Mr Gandhi will now appear on 19 April at a rally of farmers to protest against the government's controversial land acquisition bill, Congress leader Digvijay Singh said.
Opponents of the bill, including the Congress, say it will be bad for farmers.
Mr Gandhi, 44, is from the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty that has dominated Indian politics for decades.
The Congress party has suffered a series of election setbacks since it lost power in May last year.
Some Congress leaders have suggested that Mr Gandhi formally take over from his mother, party president Sonia Gandhi.
Other say he remains aloof from party workers, and have called for his sister Priyanka Gandhi to take a more prominent role in politics.
However, Ms Gandhi has shown no inclination to join the party.
