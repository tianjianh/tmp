Hannah Wells and Maisie Clarke, both 17, saw the man in Warwick Road, Coventry, while walking from a friend's house after midnight on 10 August.
They offered the man, who appeared to be confused and distressed, a coat to keep warm, West Midlands Police said.
The teenagers stayed with him until officers arrived.
Hannah, a student at Warwickshire College, said: "We saw someone standing by the road and we were initially apprehensive, given the time of the day and the fact it was dark.
"But as we went to walk past we saw it was a frail man who said 'I need your help, I am lost.'
"He was cold so I gave him a coat to keep warm and we tried to put him at ease."
Officers identified the man as having gone missing from a care home, to which he was safely returned.
Maisie said: "We were concerned he was going to try to cross the road and could get hurt, so there was no way we were going to leave him."
Ch Supt Danny Long, from Coventry police, described it as "an outstanding act of kindness".
He said: "It would have been easy to simply walk on by and forget all about it, but the girls realised the man was in distress and were determined to help out.
"They should be immensely proud of their actions."
