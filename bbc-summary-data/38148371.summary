North West ambulance A&E wait times double since 2014

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of hours that ambulances spent waiting at A&Es in the North West of England has more than doubled in the past two years, the BBC has found.

Freedom of Information (FoI) data shows a rise from 17,413 hours in 2013-14 to 46,160 in 2015-16 beyond the standard 15-minute handover period.
All of the region's trusts bar one have seen increases with wait times up six-fold at the Royal Liverpool Hospital.
North West Ambulance Service said demand for emergency care is rising.
The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals' Trust said it had recently employed a number of hospital-trained paramedics in its emergency department to help in the "safe handover of patients" to get ambulances back on the road.
Nationally, only one of the UK's 13 ambulance services is currently meeting its target to reach seriously ill and injured patients, the investigation found.
Delays have also been blamed on a crisis in social care provision leading to bed-blocking caused by delays in the discharge of elderly patients.
In the period covered by the FoI, the number of hours spent by ambulance crews waiting to hand over patients at North West A&E units rose by 167% with many hospitals seeing even bigger increases:
Aintree Hospital in Merseyside, where last week 20 ambulance staff were photographed waiting to hand over patients due to a spike in 999 calls, recorded a 234% rise.
One paramedic at Aintree said they spent more than half of their shift standing in corridors.
The only hospital where handover times actually fell was Wythenshawe in Manchester where the number of hours has dropped by 9%.
We have all seen stories of long waits at A&E - bad for patients but bad for ambulance crews too.  Put bluntly if they are stuck in a hospital, they are not out on the road dealing with other emergencies.
Just to explain these totals, ambulance services allow 15 minutes to hand patients over. These figures are the number of extra hours they have had to spend waiting to do that.
For the last financial year, that totalled 46,160 hours for the North West - a huge increase on two years earlier when it was just under 17,500.
So why are the figures rising so dramatically? Well, the number of people going to A&E is steadily rising as the population ages.  But a number of hospital trusts are also pointing to the gaps in social care provision, particularly for the elderly.
One trust told me they currently had the equivalent of three wards being occupied by people who should not be in hospital at all, simply because there was not anywhere satisfactory for them to go.
And if those beds are occupied, that means there are fewer for the patients coming in to A&E.
Overall, handover delays at hospitals across England, Wales and Northern Ireland have shown a 52% increase in the last two years.
Lisa Grant, chief nurse at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals, said: "Hospitals across the area are working together with partners in community and social care to help to safely discharge patients who no longer require hospital care, providing beds for those in the emergency department who need to be admitted to a ward."
A statement from the North West Ambulance Service said: "We are seeing more and more people in need of our services, especially for Red incidents for patients with serious and life-threatening conditions.
"This contributes to additional activity at hospital emergency departments. During busy periods this can unfortunately result in ambulance crews having to wait longer to hand over patients into the care of hospital staff before they can be clear to respond to other emergencies."
