Call to give community journalism more help

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More support and recognition is needed for the UK's hyperlocal media sector, a conference on the future of community journalism has heard.

Damian Radcliffe, honorary research fellow at Cardiff University's School of Journalism, has launched a report into the state of the industry and the challenges it faces.
It highlights positive contributions hyperlocal offers, but there are concerns about sustainability.
The university is hosting the event.
Local publishers include the Port Talbot Magnet, Abergele Post, Abergavenny Now, Wrexham.com and MyWelshpool, along with a number of Welsh-language media predominantly in mid and north west Wales.
"We have the strongest indication yet of the civic and public value hyperlocal media creates in undertaking a range of journalistic and community outputs, from holding authority to account through to running campaigns and reporting on local events," Mr Radcliffe said.
"Yet, despite this increased recognition and understanding, the core issues that challenge the prosperity of UK hyperlocal media remain unchanged, meaning the sector has no degree of long-term certainty.
"For too many community publishers, their existence remains hand-to-mouth, which has an inevitable impact on both the sustainability and the appeal of the sector to new entrants."
The report found:
The report also recommends offering hyperlocal publishers the chance to sell credited content to the BBC, encouraging large technology firms like Google to making content more discoverable and providing recognition from the National Union of Journalists.
It also wants to ensure hyperlocal publishers are considered suppliers for statutory notices which amounts to about Â£45m advertising spend per year.
"There's a worry we'll be hearing the same concerns in three or five years time," Mr Radcliffe added.
"I'm keen to avoid a hyperlocal Groundhog Day, we need help for hyperlocal to move to the next level."
Community journalism expert Prof Dan Gillmor of Arizona State University said even not-for-profit sites had to act more like businesses while funding solutions had to be broad.
Ultimately it was about a conversation with communities where "my reader knows more than I do".
