Hundreds still driving despite having 12 penalty points

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 Welsh motorists are still legally driving despite having 12 or more penalty points, the BBC has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One person is still allowed to drive after amassing 27 points.
Jack Kushner, spokesman for Brake, the road safety charity, said it was "appalling that risky, repeat offenders are being allowed to continue driving with so many points on their licences".
A DVLA spokesman said magistrates can choose not to enforce a ban if it causes "exceptional hardship".
A Freedom of Information request to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) showed there are 213 people in Wales entitled to drive with 12 penalty points or more, as of 4 June this year.
The law states drivers with more than 12 points on a licence within a three-year period can face disqualification.
A DVLA spokesman said: "In a small percentage of cases where the driver has accumulated 12 or more penalty points, the court may exercise its discretion and not disqualify the driver.
"In the majority of these cases, magistrates may have decided to allow drivers to retain their entitlement to drive where it is considered that disqualification would cause exceptional hardship."
Mr Kushner added: "Drivers who flout the law repeatedly have shown disregard for not only their own lives but also those of other road users, and should be punished accordingly.
"It's time for the courts to protect innocent road users and crack down on these irresponsible individuals."
There are approximately 2.2 million driving licence holders with addresses in Wales.
