A manhole and a storage unit with a false back have both been used as places to hide illegal cigarettes.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and Trading Standards searched eight shops in Stoke-on-Trent last week.
In five of the shops they seized suspected illegal tobacco products, with an estimated value of almost Â£14,000.
In another shop the tobacco was hidden under chocolate bars and packets of crisps on the sweet counter, HMRC said.

Paul Fisher from HMRC, said: "These shopkeepers had gone to great lengths to build these concealments and thought we wouldn't be able to find them.
"But our experience and the highly trained sniffer dogs we use, ensure that no matter how sophisticated they believe their hiding places to be, even underground, we will uncover them."
During the visits, two workers were identified as illegal and one employer was issued with a civil penalty for employing an illegal worker, HMRC added.
They are the latest unusual methods used to conceal illegal cigarettes.
Border Force officers at Southampton Port found five Buddha statues filled with cigarettes in a shipping container in June 2013.
And crates of rotting pears were used to hide more than 146 million cigarettes smuggled into the UK by a lorry driver.
