The 39 children from St Patrick's Primary School received praise from the judges for their performance of Katy Perry's hit song Roar.
This was despite the choir having to restart their performance after a technical issue.
Singer Kyle Tomlinson and magicians DNA were voted through to the final.
The choir - made up of pupils from eight to 12 - won through to the semi-finals after auditions during Saturday night's episode on ITV.
After completing the song, St Patrick's were praised by judge Simon Cowell for their "calm" in the face of technical difficulties.
"I know the chaos that was going up in the gallery, where they direct the show, when this going wrong and you were so calm.
"You sounded amazing and you know what I love about you lot? I love your personalities."
David Walliams said it was a "fantastic performance" and that all the members were "singing with passion".
Alesha Dixon said the choir should be "extremely proud" while Amanda Holden added that the choir "represented your school brilliantly".
The choir was previously named BBC Radio Ulster School Choir of the Year in 2016.
