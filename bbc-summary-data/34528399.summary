Pathologist Dr Deborah Cook, who examined her body parts after police found them in a shed, said her injuries indicated "a violent struggle".
The injuries suggested the 16-year-old fought for her life as her attacker suffocated her, she told the jury.
Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare deny murder.
The jury was shown computer generated reconstructions of injuries to Becky's head, arms, legs and torso.
Dr Cook described going through a suitcase containing body parts wrapped in layers of carrier bags, cling film, duct tape and thick blue plastic.
She said the suitcase contained dishwasher tablets as well as body parts, some of which were covered in damp white crystals.
Becky had received 15 stab wounds and a slash wound, which were caused after she died, and her body was cut up into eight pieces, she said.
The prosecution alleges Becky was killed at her home and her body later dismembered. Body parts were found at an address in Barton Court.
Mr Matthews, 28, has admitted killing her, but denies murder. His girlfriend, Ms Hoare, 21, denies murder.
Det Sgt John Dowding, who searched the shed where Becky's remains were found, told the court it contained "numerous" small parcels, wrapped in cling film, and when he unwrapped one, it was "apparent it was a human hand".
Earlier the court heard Nathan Matthews "did not particularly like" his stepsister.
In a police interview read out in court, conducted before he was arrested, he said the teenager "could be quite rude" to her stepmother - his mother.
Mr Matthews, of Hazelbury Drive in Warmley, South Gloucestershire has admitted manslaughter but denies murder and conspiracy to kidnap.
He pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice, preventing the burial of a corpse and possessing a prohibited weapon.
Ms Hoare, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, denies murder, conspiracy to kidnap, perverting the course of justice, preventing burial of a corpse and possessing a prohibited weapon.
Two other men, Donovan Demetrius, 29, and James Ireland, 23, deny assisting an offender.
Karl Demetrius, 29, and Jaydene Parsons, 23, previously pleaded guilty to assisting an offender after body parts were found in their shed, but both said they were unaware of what the packages contained.
The trial at Bristol Crown Court continues.
