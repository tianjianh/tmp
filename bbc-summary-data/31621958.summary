The Red Arrows have revealed a new design inspired by the union jack on the tailfins of their jets.

This design has now replaced the three-stripe livery the jets had flown since the 1960s.
A special one-off design was also created last year to mark the team's 50th display season.
Squadron Leader David Montenegro said the new tail fin "perfectly illustrates the spirit of the Red Arrows" and reflected British excellence.
He said it represented "the UK, our engineering excellence and the capability of the Royal Air Force to protect our skies".
Last year, the Lincolnshire-based Red Arrows celebrated their 50th season, performing more than 80 displays across the UK and in nine other countries.
The milestone was marked with a special, one-off tailfin design on its aircraft.
Now, instead of returning to this original paint scheme following the season-long 50th pattern, the new Union flag design has been adopted for the future.
The team of fast-jet pilots, engineers and support staff are currently preparing for their new display season, which begins in May.
Sqn Ldr Montenegro said: "The Red Arrows have a major ambassadorial role. When we go abroad, it's not just defence we are representing, or the armed forces in isolation, it's all of the UK's industry.
"To have this ability, to keep spreading the message and promoting the UK in this unique, powerful way around the world, is invaluable."
The Red Arrows team was founded in 1965 at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire.
