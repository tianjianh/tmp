Plans for the City of London's tallest tower, One Undershaft, have been unveiled.

Just a fraction shorter than the Shard, the 73-storey tower could be the second highest column in the capital.
At 309.6m, the skyscraper will be 80m taller than the nearby Cheesegrater, which stands at 224m, and will dwarf the 180m-high Gherkin.
It will have a public square at its base, a free public viewing gallery and a sky-high restaurant, architects said.
"Most skyscrapers are used Monday to Friday, but One Undershaft will be used seven days a week, with visitors able to enjoy the new public square, viewing platform and restaurant every day," said Eric Parry, the architect behind the project.
"It will be the jewel in the crown of the City of London and something we hope Londoners will be very proud of."
The 90,000 square metre structure, which will replace the Aviva Building, will be able to accommodate 10,000 people and will have 1,500 bicycle spaces as well as new shower and changing facilities.
To avoid repeating the Walkie Talkie's car-melting disaster - where a London skyscraper was blamed for reflecting light and melting parts of a Jaguar car - architects said "special fins included in the design will reduce solar glare".
A planning application will be submitted to the City of London in the early in 2016.
