Racist chanting halts AC Milan-Roma game in Serie A

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Serie A match between AC Milan and Roma on Sunday was halted because of racist chanting inside the San Siro.

Play was stopped for about two minutes at the beginning of the second half after chants aimed at Milan's black players from the visiting supporters.
Roma captain Francesco Totti, who had complained to the referee about the chants, then went to speak to the fans.
An announcement was made ordering the chants to cease before play resumed, with the game going on to end goalless.

Former Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli and Kevin-Prince Boateng were part of the Milan team.
A friendly between Milan and Pro Patria in January was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Boateng.
Following that incident, the Italian Football Federation introduced new rules to help referees deal with racist behaviour.
Officials can stop play and ask for stadium announcements to be made.
Should any such announcements fail to have an effect on offenders, match and stadium officials are authorised to abandon the game.
In March, Fifa announced the formation of a new taskforce designed to tackle discrimination in the game.
Boateng, English referee Howard Webb and Football Association chief executive David Bernstein are all members.
