A blaze ripped through the building and destroyed the roof on 14 April.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case had been discontinued against three men aged 18 and a 16-year-old girl.
At its height, 70 firefighters tackled the fire at the premises on Wilson Patten Street.
A CPS spokeswoman said the decision was taken after fresh evidence came to light.
She said: "New lines of inquiry are now being pursued by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service will review any new file of evidence on this case when it is brought to us by the police."
No-one was injured in the blaze at the former nightclub, which closed in 2010.
Mr Smith's was a regular setting for the ITV Granada show The Hit Man and Her, which was presented by Pete Waterman and Michaela Strachan between 1988 and 1992.
