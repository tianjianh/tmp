Twenty-two people were killed and 59 injured in a suicide attack at Manchester Arena on Monday night at an Ariana Grande concert.
The mother of Jayden Parkinson said she was unhappy her daughter's image had been posted alongside images of other people alleged to be missing.
Jayden, 17, was strangled by her ex-boyfriend in Oxfordshire.
"She was killed almost four years ago not last night, not happy," Samantha Shrewsbury tweeted, after seeing the picture on an online newspaper article.
"Why is my MURDERED daughter's picture being used in a collage of pictures of children missing dead after last night terror attack?" she asked.
Ms Shrewsbury also posted a We Stand with Manchester picture.
Speaking to the BBC, she said: "It is horrible to see her photo being used in this way.
"I feel sorry for the genuine parents of missing children.
"The collage is still being retweeted... I can't figure out who made the collage and why they would include my daughter's picture in it.
"We are still trying to get to the bottom of this."
Several images circulating online after the Manchester attack have been identified as fakes.
Jayden was found in the graveyard of All Saints Church in Didcot, Oxfordshire, in December 2013.
She had been killed by Ben Blakeley, 23, from Reading, and hidden in his uncle's grave. Blakeley was jailed for life in 2014.
