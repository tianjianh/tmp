Hundreds of people have descended on Westminster in a rally calling for action in the wake of the Grenfell Tower blaze.
Demonstrators marched to Kensington Town Hall with signs reading "justice", "answers" and demands for an inquest.
Some entered the foyer and a number of people could later be seen being confronted by police and security guards in high visibility vests.
The Queen and Prince William visited a relief centre supporting victims of the Grenfell Tower fire earlier.
They met volunteers, local residents and community representatives at Westway Sports centre.
On Thursday, the Queen paid tribute to the "bravery" of firefighters and the "incredible generosity" of volunteers now offering support.
The visit comes as the number of those missing rose to 76, with police saying some of those killed might never be identified.
