Opposition parties renew NHS attacks

Opposition parties have renewed their attack on the Scottish government's record on the NHS.

The Liberal Democrats released the results of a survey which it said suggested many Scottish GPs would not repeat their career choice.
And Scottish Labour claimed funding for medical students had been cut since the SNP came to power.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said Scotland had more GPs and medical students per head than England.
She said the Scottish government "greatly valued the contribution made by GPs" and pointed out that the number of GPs employed in Scotland had risen to record levels under the SNP.
And she said Labour's figures on medical student funding "fail to take account of a number of complex changes" to the system, and that funding for general medical services had increased by 10%.
The Lib Dems said they had sent a questionnaire to 986 GP practices. It had been completed by 389 GPs at 352 of these practices - equivalent to about a twelfth of the workforce.
In the survey, the doctors were asked whether they would choose to be a GP if they had their time again.
Of those who responded, 42% said they would, while 33% said they would not and a further 25% said they did not know.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie claimed the results suggested that GPs were "all too often taken for granted by the Scottish government".
He said the full results of the survey would be released next week, and added: "The Royal College of GPs have warned that Scotland will be 740 GPs short by 2020. My survey will show how this shortfall is already having a real impact on local doctors."
Meanwhile, Labour MSP and former GP Dr Richard Simpson said his research indicated that funding for medical students had fallen by 5% over the past six years.
Dr Simpson said that 900 medical students received funding in 2008/09 but the number decreased to 848 students in 2014/15.
He accused the Scottish government of being "negligent" as the country "heads towards a GP recruitment crisis".
Dr Simpson said: "Instead of investing in the future of our NHS the Scottish government is making existing problems even worse."
Responding to the attacks, Ms Robison said: "Record funding for general practice of Â£768m has brought GP numbers to nearly 5,000, 7% more GPs under this Scottish government - the highest ever - and there are more GPs per head of population in Scotland than in England.
"Scotland has more medical students per head of population than the rest of the UK and we are carefully considering the future workforce requirements, focusing especially on widening access to medical school for applicants from more diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds.
