The 24-year-old was making her first public appearance since August, when she called off her world tour to deal with anxiety and depression stemming from the auto immune disease Lupus.
She spoke as after winning the award for favourite rock/pop female artist.
"I kept it all together enough to where I would never let you down," she said.
"But I kept it too much together to where I let myself down. I had to stop, because I had everything and I was absolutely broken inside.
"I don't want to see your bodies on Instagram," she said, indicating her heart. "I want to see what's in here.
"I'm not trying to get validation, nor do I need it any more. All I can say is I'm so grateful that I have the opportunity to be able to share what I love every day with people that I love.
"I have to say thank you so much to my fans, because you guys are so damn loyal, and I don't know what I did to deserve you.
"But if you are broken, you do not have to stay broken. That's one thing you should know about me - I care about people. And this is for you."
Fellow singers applauded Gomez for her remarks, with Hailee Steinfeld embracing the singer as she left the stage.
Lady Gaga broke down in tears, while Taylor Swift - who did not attend the show - shared a video in which she yelled with pride at her television.
Elsewhere, many stars took the opportunity to attack US President-elect Donald Trump, with Green Day amending their song Bang Bang to include the lyrics: "No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA!" (a reworking of lines from Born To Die by Texas hardcore outfit MDC).
Supermodel Chrissy Teigen was bleeped out by censors as she talked about the election, before introducing a song by her husband John Legend.
Frozen star Idina Menzel also referred to Trump's Twitter war with the cast of Broadway musical Hamilton, who made an impassioned speech for inclusivity while Vice-President-elect Mike Pence attended the show on Friday.
"Us unsafe, scary theatre people probably wouldn't be invited to the inauguration," she joked. "I love you Hamilton!"
Prince's sister Tyka Nelson also provided an emotional interlude as she accepted the top soundtrack award on his behalf for Purple Rain.
"Prince defied the odds, a black teen from Minneapolis with a goal to electrify the world," she said.
"He had the courage to be different. With his vision and God-given talent, he is still one of the world's most respected and loved artists.
"But what he told me was that he wanted to be known as the world's most prolific songwriter and with 984 titles to his credit and counting, he has done just that."
Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and Twenty One Pilots also performed at the ceremony, which took place at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.
Drake and Justin Bieber were the night's big winners, taking home three awards each; while British star Zayn was named new artist of the year, and Ariana Grande was named artist of the year.
