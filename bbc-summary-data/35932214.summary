On Tuesday, the Tata Steel company announced its plans to sell its UK factories including Port Talbot, putting thousands of jobs at risk.
Prime Minister David Cameron will hold a special meeting to discuss the future of the steel industry in the UK.
Steelmaking has a long tradition in Britain, which has lasted well over a hundred years.
Lots of children in Port Talbot have parents who work at the steel plant or know someone who works in the factories as Ricky's been finding out.
