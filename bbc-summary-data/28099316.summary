The 19-year-old left back completed his medical at the Liberty Stadium on Monday and has signed a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
Kingsley, who has represented Scotland at Under-18 and Under-19 level, made more than 100 appearances for the Scottish Championship club.
He is Swans boss Garry Monk's third summer signing after goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and striker Bafetimbi Gomis.
Kingsley, who was named in last season's Scottish Professional Football League Championship team of the year, joins former team mate Jay Fulton at Swansea.
On Monday, midfielder Fulton signed a new four-year deal with the Swans.
He said: "I'm absolutely delighted. Everything has happened pretty quickly but I didn't need any persuading to sign and I'm really looking forward to the future.
"Garry [Monk] has been brilliant. He's put a lot of confidence in me and made me feel part of the squad and hopefully I can continue to progress under him."
