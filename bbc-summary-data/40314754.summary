Derry comfortably saw off Waterford by seven points to qualify for the second round of the All-Ireland Football Championship qualifiers.

Centre-forward Niall Loughlin scored in the first minute at Fraher Field to give the Oak Leaf boys a lead which they never surrendered.
Waterford fought back to be just 0-11 to 0-9 down at half-time.
But the hosts failed to score for the first 22 minutes after the break and a goal by Danny Haveron killed them off.
Derry will find out who they play next when the draw for Round 2A is made on Monday morning.
Manager Damian Barton, buoyed by the way his team saw off the Waterford challenge in the early stages of the second half, will be looking for a decent run in the qualifiers.

Loughlin landed the first two points from play and Danny Tallon also scored a couple as Derry built up an 0-8 to 0-4 lead.
However, Waterford responded and Donie Breathnach, Conor Murray and Gavin Crotty were among their scorers as they cut the gap to just one point.
But the early stages of the second half saw Derry pull away to build up a commanding 10-point advantage.
Magherafelt club man Heavron got the goal and there were points for substitutes Emmett McGuigan and Mark Lynch, as well as Chrissy McKaigue, Ciaran McFaul and Tallon.
Waterford did stage a late revival but Derry's progress to the second round was never in question.
