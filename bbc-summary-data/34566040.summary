Laverty will be team-mates with Yonny Hernandez, with American Nicky Hayden leaving Jorge Martinez's team to ride for Ten Kate Honda in World Superbikes.
The Toomebridge rider limped home in 19th place at Phillip Island on Sunday after suffering tyre grip problems.
The 29-year-old's team had made an error with the tyre pressure.
Laverty had won the Open class race for the first time in his rookie season at Aragon in Spain in September.
The Aspar Honda rider from Toomebridge has picked up nine points this season with two rounds remaining.
Aspar team-mate Hayden failed to finish the race while Laverty was over 50 seconds behind winner Marc Marquez.
Marquez snatched the lead from Jorge Lorenzo on the final lap to win a thrilling race at Phillip Island with Italian Andrea Iannone in third.
Honda's 22-year-old Spaniard, who started on pole, overtook his compatriot on the last turn to win his fifth race of 2015 by 0.249 seconds.
Lorenzo is now 11 points behind Yamaha team-mate Valentino Rossi in the overall standings.
