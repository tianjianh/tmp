The New Zealander replaces Tamsin Greenway, who left the Storm for new franchise Wasps after guiding them to back-to-back titles.
Hoffman has previously held the role of assistant coach with New Zealand team Central Pulse.
"Tania will bring a new level of experience and knowledge of the game," Storm director Gavin Barker said.
Former head coach Kathryn Ratanapala also left the Storm to join Hertfordshire Mavericks this summer, while veteran shooter Rachel Dunn was released and Pamela Cookey retired from playing and joined Severn Stars.
