Charlotte Eades died in February at the age of 19, after being diagnosed with glioblastoma when she was 16.
On her YouTube channel the teenager from Brighton inspired many with her humour and frank videos on the ups and downs of the disease.
Her mother Alex Eades and brother Miles are launching Charlotte's Battle Against Glioblastoma (BAG).
Their new charity, whose name was inspired by Charlotte's love of handbags, is being set up to raise funds for research into and awareness of glioblastoma.
Mrs Eades said: "Losing Charlotte was and still is completely devastating, but the aim of Charlotte's BAG is to try and make sure that other glioblastoma patients and their families do not suffer in the same way.
"Medics call glioblastoma 'the Terminator' because currently there is no cure and the only treatment is to reduce the symptoms and relieve pain for as long as possible," she said.
"We aim to change this."
