Cheltenham Town have re-signed Birmingham City's Koby Arthur and brought in Bristol City winger Jonny Smith, both on loan until 2 January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forward Arthur, 20, scored four goals in eight Cheltenham appearances during a loan spell at the start of 2014-15.
He then made 10 appearances for the Championship club later that season, and played two senior games in 2015-16.
Smith, 18, joined Bristol City's Under-21 setup from Wrexham in May, after his debut for the Welsh side in February.
"Koby is now very close to reaching his full potential," manager Gary Johnson told the League Two club's website.
"Jonny is another lad who's got great potential and will end up at least a Championship player."
