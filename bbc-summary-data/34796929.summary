South Korea's An Byeong-hun and Victor Dubuisson of France are one stroke behind, with England's Ross Fisher a further shot back on six under.
England's Danny Willett, who can close on absent Rory McIlroy in the Race to Dubai standings, started with a par 72.
His fellow countrymen Paul Casey and Justin Rose are three off the lead.
Garcia, who holed nine birdies, said: "Hopefully, I keep improving and I'll be out there on Sunday with a chance."
The Shanghai competition is the penultimate event in the European Tour's Race to Dubai Final Series, which compromises four events at the end of the regular season.
Northern Ireland's world number three McIlroy is not competing in Shanghai, but leads the European Tour list at the moment and stands to collect the Â£820,000 prize money bonus for the third time in four years.
