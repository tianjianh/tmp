[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£48,000 boat will be called "Mary & Archie Hooper" in memory of a couple from Llandanwg Beach, near Harlech.
Mr Hooper, a former commander in the Royal Navy, and his wife were keen RNLI fundraisers who left behind funding for the new boat.
The naming ceremony and a service of dedication will take place in Holyhead on Saturday.
The boat, which has already launched, will be handed over to the RNLI by the donor's representatives Dr Susan Hooper and James Hooper.
Lee Firman, RNLI divisional operations manager, said: "As a charity, we are so very grateful for this most generous legacy which has made this kind gift possible."
