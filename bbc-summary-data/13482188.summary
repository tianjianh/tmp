The ceremony was attended by many African heads of state, as well as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
Mr Ouattara thanked the international community for its support and said the will of the people had triumphed.
He said the day represented a "historic moment" for the people of Ivory Coast.
He said: "This day is, for all Ivorians, the start of an era that marks our common will to write a new page in the history of our country. The grave crisis that Ivory Coast went through... is now behind us.
"This has been achieved by the victory of democracy, in other words respecting democracy and the will of the Ivorian people."
Mr Ouattara won the November presidential election but was prevented from taking office after incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refused to give up power.

The theme for this ceremony was a day to reunify the country, but in Yamoussoukro it was more a celebration for Ouattara supporters in a capital that voted overwhelmingly for him in November's election.
In the six months between the second round of elections and this inauguration ceremony, Ivory Coast has witnessed some of its darkest days. But this ceremony is meant to draw a line under those troubles.
Tens of thousands watched on big screens around the capital and lined the streets leading from the airport.  Inside, about 20 heads of state from Africa joined President Sarkozy in the marble-lined Felix Houphouet-Boigny foundation for the ceremony.
The city's party will last long into the night - not least because very few found a place in the fully-booked hotels. Nevertheless the ceremony itself still had a sombre feel and a minute's silence was held for the victims of the crisis.
Mr Gbagbo was arrested last month after a military raid on the presidential compound where he had based himself. He and the former first lady are under house arrest awaiting trial, as are many of his ministers and advisers.
Hundreds of civilians died in the fighting that erupted after both men declared themselves the winner of the poll.
Representatives from across the political spectrum were invited to the inauguration, including members of Mr Gbagbo's party.
The BBC's Barbara Plett said the ceremony was designed to reinforce Mr Ouattara's legitimacy as president after a violent power struggle with Mr Gbagbo, and to symbolise the beginning of a reconciliation process regarded as key to the country's recovery.
She adds that Mr Ouattara is keenly aware that he won only a little more than half the vote, and the presidential stand-off reignited festering ethnic tensions, with human rights groups accusing both sides of killings, rape and other crimes.
Mr Ouattara, who took the oath of office two weeks ago, has promised to promote reconciliation in the country.
