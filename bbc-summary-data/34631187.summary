Ko hit a final round seven-under 65 as she eased to victory by nine shots to overtake South Korean Inbee Park, who was not playing in the tournament.
It was the 18-year-old's fourth round of under 70 as she became the youngest to earn 10 wins on the LPGA Tour.
England's Charley Hull (70) was fourth on 10 under, while Scotland's Catriona Matthew (75) finished on three under.
