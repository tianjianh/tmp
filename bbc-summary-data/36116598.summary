The 24-year-old European amateur lightweight champion is hoping to emulate 1972 Olympic light-flyweight bronze medallist Ralph Evans and 2012 Olympic welterweight silver medallist Fred Evans.
Cordina, the 2014 Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, is stable-mates with 2012 Olympian Evans, IBF featherweight champion Lee Selby, 2010 Commonwealth Games bantamweight champion Sean McGoldrick and British title challenger Andrew Selby.
