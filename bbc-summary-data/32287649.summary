The Neath-born mezzo-soprano, 34, announced the news on Monday that she and husband Andrew Levitas were expecting a baby girl.
The singer posted a picture on her Instagram and Twitter accounts of two pink baby boots on top of a framed picture of the married couple.
Next to the image she wrote: "Couldn't be more excited to meet our little girl!"
In a statement, she said they were "overjoyed" to be expecting their first child.
"Starting a family and moving into this exciting phase of our lives is a blessing for which we are incredibly grateful," she added.
"We eagerly await the arrival of our little girl."
The singer married American director Mr Levitas at Hampton Court Palace, Surrey, in September last year.
