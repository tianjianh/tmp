The 31-year-old, who was born without a right forearm, hopes to take on the solo round-the-world race in 2020.
Taekwondo and badminton have replaced sailing in the Paralympics from 2020.
"Sailing's been dropped from the Paralympics so this is me kicking in the door for everyone else to prove it can be done," she told BBC Look East.
Stodel has never completed a full ocean cross, so in preparation will be attempting a transatlantic crossing in November.
She also needs to raise funds in order to buy the correct boat for the Vendee Globe, considered by many as the hardest of sailing races, with the most recent edition of the competition running last year.
The four-time Paralympian continued: "[The Vendee Globe] is certainly going to be a challenging race. Every skipper I've spoken to has said it's the best and the worst of off-shore racing.
"I'm actually quite looking forward to that. At the same time I'm obviously scared of the challenge but my uncle left me with a nice little saying to put on the boat: I am strong, but the boat is stronger."
