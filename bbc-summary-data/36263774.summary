A Taiwanese man who killed four people in a mass stabbing on an underground train in Taipei has been executed.

Cheng Chieh, 23, was anaesthetised on Tuesday evening at a jail outside the capital before being shot three times.
Cheng had injured another 22 people when he boarded the train in May 2014 and stabbed passengers at random.
He had pleaded guilty to murder and attempted murder charges, and was sentenced to death after the court ruled he was not mentally ill.
Deputy Justice Minister Chen Ming said his death was "the only way to show publically that justice had been served and to relieve the sorrow and pain of victims' families".
The case shocked Taiwan, where violent street crime and mass attacks are rare.
Taiwan restarted its use of the death penalty in 2010 after a five-year moratorium and it has significant public support.
It currently has 42 people on death row.
