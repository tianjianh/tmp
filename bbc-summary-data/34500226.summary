Jamie Peacock, Kevin Sinfield and Kylie Leuluai ended their careers and left the club after beating Wigan Warriors at Old Trafford on Saturday.
The win followed success in the League Leaders' Shield and Challenge Cup to complete a domestic treble.
The trio were honoured at a celebratory event at the First Direct Arena.
Speaking after winning the Grand Final, former England captain Peacock said: "It's a bit difficult to sum up. I'm lost for words.
"I just feel fortunate to be in a great team. It's a team sport and that's why rugby league is such a great sport."
Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake said: "It has been another amazing season for the Leeds Rhinos and [the event] is an opportunity for supporters to congratulate the team on their efforts and also say a big thank you to legends Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Kylie Leuluai."
"We are extremely proud as a city of the Rhinos, whose commitment, dedication and achievements on the field - coupled with the work they do in our communities - is simply fantastic.
"They are undoubtedly fully deserving of an event such as this."
Leeds Rhinos chief executive, Gary Hetherington, said it would be a "spectacular live show" with performances from The Pigeon Detectives showing appreciation for the three retiring stars.
