The singer from The Saturdays said she was "so excited" to be a contestant in the dancing competition.
She told Nick Grimshaw on Radio 1's breakfast show she always watched the show with her family and added that she "can't wait to get into the sequins".
The new series starts on BBC One next month.
King said: "I'm a huge fan of Strictly Come Dancing so I can't actually believe I'm lucky enough to be taking part in it this year! I'm literally so excited to learn Latin and ballroom dancing, and of course I can't wait to get into the sequins too!
"It's going to be a lot of hard work but I'm ready for the challenge."
The 30-year-old told Grimmie it had been tough to keep news of her involvement a secret.
She had previously only told her parents and bandmate Frankie Bridge, who made it to the final of Strictly three years ago.
King said: "It's something that I always said I wanted to do. I've always watched it with my family and it looks so fun.
"I'm going to be giving it my all. I'm very competitive so watch out, other contestants, I'm taking you down!"
She added that she would be up for having a "cheeky spray tan" and wearing sparkles, saying it was a chance to be a "princess".
King said she was starting training soon - and that she hoped she would not be voted out in the first week.
She also said she was a huge Britney Spears fan and would love to dance to her music on the show.
This year's contestants have all been given code names relating to classical Greece, with King's being Clio, one of the nine muses.
