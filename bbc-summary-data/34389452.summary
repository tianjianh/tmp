Durham University opposes student accommodation plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A university is opposing plans for new student accommodation, saying it would have a detrimental effect on permanent residents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Proposals for The Gate shopping centre in Durham include new retail, leisure and cinema outlets and student flats.
Durham University said there was no need for extra accommodation beyond what was already planned elsewhere.
Residents' groups and the City of Durham Trust also opposed the plans, which have attracted some support.
Objections concern the location of bicycle racks, late-night noise and anti-social behaviour and the impact on the World Heritage Site.
Supporters welcomed the redevelopment of a "neglected" area and said the effect of students would be felt less by residents on this site than elsewhere.
But, in comments submitted to planners, the university said the development "would perpetuate an unbalanced residential population where one community group (in this case a temporary population of students) dominates to the exclusion of other types of resident".
The 40-year-old shopping centre went into administration two years ago and was bought by London-based developer Clearbell Capital LLP for almost Â£12m.
Councillors are recommended to approve the proposals at a meeting on 6 October.
