Ms Stevens, elected to Parliament in 2015, was previously part of the shadow justice team.
The Wales brief had been held by Llanelli MP Nia Griffith, one of several leading figures who resigned from the shadow cabinet in June.
Ms Griffith has been appointed shadow defence secretary.
Mr Corbyn has promised to unite his party following his re-election as leader last month.
Ms Stevens said she was "delighted" to have the job "at a hugely important time for my country".
"I'm looking forward to getting stuck into the role working closely with Jeremy and Carwyn [First Minister Carwyn Jones] to ensure Labour continues to be the party that best represents the interests of all people across Wales," she said.
She added: "As always, my constituents in Cardiff Central are and continue to be my top priority.
"It's a privilege to represent them and I intend to approach the Welsh shadow cabinet role with the same commitment and dedication."
In July, Ms Stevens backed Owen Smith's challenge to Mr Corbyn's leadership, saying the Pontypridd MP was the "best candidate" to unite the party and win the next general election.
