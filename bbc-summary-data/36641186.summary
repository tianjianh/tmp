Dina Asher-Smith, Adam Gemili and James Dasaolu will also compete but Jessica Ennis-Hill, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Mo Farah will be absent.
The squad is a mix of athletes who have already qualified for the Olympics, and others still hoping to book a spot.
Farah, Johnson-Thompson and Ennis-Hill declined selection, to prepare for Rio.
The championships in Amsterdam will run from 6 to 10 July, with British Athletics naming its final squad for August's Olympics on 11 July.
Neil Black, the performance director for British Athletics, said: "With the European Championships and Olympic Games scheduled so close together you have to take a sensible approach to selection and look at what is best for each athlete as an individual.
"With a firm focus towards Rio, we have liaised with athletes selected for the Olympics, and their coaches, before making a decision on selection."
