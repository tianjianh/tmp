Six Nations 2017: Wales' England preparation time no excuse - Alun Wyn Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones says his team will not hide behind the excuse of less preparation time for Saturday's home Six Nations match against England.

Wales defeated Italy 33-7 in Rome on Sunday, 24 hours after England narrowly beat France at Twickenham.
Rob Howley's side are on a six-day turnaround, having arrived from Rome in Cardiff in the early hours of Monday.
"We could make a big fuss and say this could prove the difference - but that'd be an excuse," said Jones.

He says players from Wales' Pro12 teams Ospreys, Scarlets, Cardiff Blues and Newport Gwent Dragons regularly face such logistical challenges.
"With our regions we do this quite a bit with the short turnarounds between games," said the Ospreys second row.
"There is an added intensity and physicality with international rugby and it's something you have to deal with."
England coach Eddie Jones has said England will be "sharper" in Cardiff than in their win over France as he looks to guide his side to a 16th consecutive win under his tenure.
The Australian also said England's record against Wales in Cardiff is "horrendous", but Wales skipper Jones would not be drawn when asked about outside comments affecting the squad.

"England have the form at the moment and there are question marks about ours, which we are trying to answer and will continue to do so," he said.
"It is a big week. We have a few new players in the group who haven't experienced it before (England home match) and it will be interesting to see how they perceive it and how they attack the week.
"It was a typical physical performance from England (against France). They were clinical and did what they had to do to win the game. They carried on in a similar vein to their previous 14 wins.
"Their bench made a massive impact and it will be interesting to see if any of those guys feature in the starting side."

Jones and his team-mates meet on Tuesday evening following the Rome success.
"There is a positive mood in the camp," said Jones. "We are content with what we did on the weekend.
"There are large areas to improve with regards to the first half and aspects of the second half."
Scrum-half Rhys Webb and wing Liam Williams were denied tries by inches, denying Wales a bonus-point win in Rome.
"We can be even more clinical when we have possession," said Jones. "You don't get any points for style, but it was pleasing the way we scored a couple of those tries.
"We will be buoyed by some of the character that we showed and also a little bit of frustrations we didn't capitalise on the possession we had in the first-half and not getting the bonus point."
Jones will captain Wales for the first time in Cardiff since taking over the permanent captaincy, but insists it will be about the team rather than the individual.
"I would like to think I am part of a team and everyone will be as proud as me," Jones added.
