A £2,000 reward has been offered for information after a dead horse appears to have been dumped in a car park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The grey mare was found on Wednesday night by a dog walker near woodland in Calverton, Nottinghamshire.
The RSPCA called it an "upsetting incident" and urged anyone with information to come forward.
It comes six weeks after a horse with a broken neck died after it was "fly-tipped" at Shirebrook, in neighbouring Derbyshire.
Nottinghamshire-based charity, Help for Horses, is offering a £2,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction over the Calverton horse.
Founder Janice Dixon said: "The people who do this, they're not people, they're a waste of life."
Former veterinary nurse, Hilary Taylor Kench, who found the horse, said she believed it may have died giving birth.
"I was glad my daughter, who's 14, wasn't with me - it wasn't a pleasant sight," she said.
"I could barely use my phone because I was shaking, I was so angry."
