[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
FC Halifax claimed their first win of the season by beating Solihull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Morgan finished off a searing counter-attack to punish the hosts after 28 minutes, scoring only their second league goal in five games.
Moors had a golden opportunity to equalise moments after the break but Oladapo Afolayan's penalty was well saved by Sam Johnson after Matty Brown was adjudged to have fouled the striker in the box.
The defeat sees Solihull sink to the bottom of the fledgling National League table, having only picked up one point from their first four games.
