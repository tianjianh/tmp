It comes exactly a week after the incident which happened at the junction of Croft Street and Greenbank Street at midday on 10 September.
The woman suffered serious injuries when the man pushed her to the ground and stole her bag before running off.
Police are keen to trace the victim's bag and have been stopping and speaking to passers-by at the scene.
They have asked members of the public to check their gardens and communal areas.
The bag is unbranded, light beige in colour and has a wide shoulder strap.
It contained a brown umbrella, a Radley branded black purse with a small dog on the front and a small quantity of medication.
Det Sgt James Welsh, of Police Scotland, said: "We know the man, who was wearing a dark grey hooded top with the hood up, ran off along Greenbank Street towards the Croft Street flats.
"Extensive searches have been carried out here but the bag has not yet been found, so I would urge everyone in the area that stretches from the Gala Water Retail Park up to Abbotsford Road to please check their gardens, communal areas, bins, anywhere where this bag or its contents might have been discarded."
Scottish Borders local area commander, Ch Insp Andy McLean, said: "Such a violent incident is extremely rare in Gala and the Borders as a whole, and the local community has been extremely shocked that something like this has happened."
He said they were determined to bring the person responsible to justice.
"Local community officers have been assisting the team of detectives investigating this crime, and will be taking part in the checks today," he said.
"Please do come and speak to my team if you have any concerns or any information about what happened last weekend."
