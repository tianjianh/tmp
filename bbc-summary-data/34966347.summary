Adur District Council said it was looking into the possibility of a memorial walk along the River Adur.
People are being invited to submit their thoughts and suggestions to the shorehamremembers.org website.
A shortlist of ideas will be created in January, followed by a public consultation in March.
Eleven men were killed on 22 August when a vintage Hawker Hunter plummeted into the A27 in West Sussex during the Shoreham Air Show.
In a statement, Adur District Council said: "It has been suggested that a new memorial, close to both the river and the proposed site for a new slipway, could form the start and finish of a beautiful walk between the recreation ground and Old Tollbridge.
"This idea potentially also incorporates the temporary memorial board and archway erected by the county council in a meaningful way, and could create a multitude of spaces and perspectives for reflection along the walk's length."
It continues: "While other ideas are being invited this particular one appears to be currently gathering support throughout the community."
In the days after the crash, thousands of flowers, cards, pictures and messages of condolence were left on the Old Shoreham Toll Bridge, which became known as the "Bridge of Flowers".
A memorial service was held at Lancing College's gothic chapel on 22 November, three months after the disaster.
During the service, the Bishop of Chichester, The Right Reverend Dr Martin Warner, praised the "human courage, generosity and compassion" of the emergency services and said this was a time when "grief must blend with love" in a celebration of those who died.
