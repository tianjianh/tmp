Unite union to ballot on offshore action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of North Sea workers are to be balloted for industrial action in a dispute over pay cuts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Unite union working for Wood Group on eight Shell installations will vote on whether to strike.
The union said its members were "deeply worried" and felt they had no other option but to consider industrial action.
Wood Group said it was "extremely disappointed" at the news during the consultation process.
The platforms involved are Shearwater, Gannet, Nelson, Curlew, Brent Delta, Brent Alpha, Brent Bravo and Brent Charlie.
In February, Aberdeen-based Wood Group PSN announced it was cutting rates paid to about a third of its UK contractor workforce.
