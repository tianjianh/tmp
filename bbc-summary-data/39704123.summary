England prop Ellis Genge has agreed a new contract with Leicester Tigers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old joined Tigers in January 2016 from Bristol, initially on loan before making the move permanent ahead of this season.
"Leicester Tigers is a club with a lot of success and a big history," Genge told the club's website.
"I feel I have come on a lot since I joined the club, learning all the time working with people like Marcos Ayerza, Dan Cole and now Boris Stankovich."
He added: "I just want to play rugby and I am enjoying it at Tigers. It's great to play at Welford Road with crowds over 20,000 every week."
Capped by England in the end-of-season game against Wales last year, he was included in the 2017 Six Nations squad and has been named in the tour party for this summer's two-Test trip to Argentina.
Leicester, who face Sale Sharks at Welford Road on Saturday, have not confirmed the length of Genge's new deal.
