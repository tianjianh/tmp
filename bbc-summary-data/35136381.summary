Louisa Johnson has recorded the lowest chart entry for an X Factor winner's first single, making her debut in this week's UK singles chart at number nine.

Every other winner of the ITV talent search, bar two, has hit the top spot in their single's first week on sale.
Johnson's single Forever Young is at a comparative disadvantage, however, as only four days of the chart week count towards her song's chart position.
This follows the shift of the singles and album chart from Sunday to Friday.
Weekly chart positions are determined by sales from Friday through to midnight on Thursday, and Forever Young did not go on sale until Sunday night.
Only Steve Brookstein and Joe McElderry previously failed to claim the top spot with their winners' singles in their first week.
Both initially had to settle for a number two slot, in 2004 and 2009 respectively, though both tracks did subsequently climb to pole position.
Without a realistic challenge from this year's X Factor winner, Justin Bieber remains at number one for a third week with his track Love Yourself.
With his previous single Sorry holding fast at number two, the Canadian star is now the first artist to spend four weeks at numbers one and two consecutively.
The previous record holders were The Beatles, who logged three consecutive weeks in 1967/68 with Hello Goodbye and Magical Mystery Tour (EP).
The rest of this week's top five is made up of Adele's Hello at three, You Don't Own Me by Grace featuring G-Eazy at four, and another Bieber track, What Do You Mean, at five.
Christmas favourites continued to make a strong impression on this week's top 40, with Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas is You at 12 and Fairytale of New York by The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl at 15.
Elsewhere Wham's Last Christmas charts at 24, Wizzard's Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday at 34, while Merry Christmas Everyone by Shakin' Stevens was at 35.
In the album chart, Adele's 25 continues to command the number one position in its fourth week of release.
According to the Official Charts Company, her third album is set to become the fastest album to sell two million copies in UK music history.
When figures for this week's chart were finalised, 25 had reached 1.97 million sales, having sold between 46,000 and 61,000 copies a day over the past week.
At its current rate of sales, the singer's latest release is likely to pass the 2.5 million sales mark by the end of the year.
Elvis Presley's If I Can Dream Album climbs one place to two this week, trading places with Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams.
Justin Bieber's Purpose and Jess Glynne's I Cry When I Laugh complete the top five in this week's album countdown.
