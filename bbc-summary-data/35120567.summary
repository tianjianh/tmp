The crash happened on the A944 Dunecht to Alford road on Saturday 5 December.
Relatives said in a statement issued through Police Scotland: "Douglas' family are devastated to confirm that Douglas has died. They are very grateful for all the support they have received."
Aberdeenshire Council chief executive Jim Savege said: "It is with great sadness that we have learned today of the death of one of our colleagues, Douglas Edwardson.
"Douglas was an incredibly warm, loyal and supportive colleague who will be greatly missed by many people right across this council.
"He had worked in the north east for more than 22 years, initially as director of housing and technical services with the former Banff and Buchan District Council, and was a well-known and respected figure in his role as head of service for housing with Aberdeenshire Council.
"Our thoughts are with his family, and for our colleagues who worked closely with Douglas over the years. We will be doing everything we can to ensure we provide them with the support they need."
