About 50 people took part in the march through Queen Street, which was organised by Bring Back Our Girls Cymru-Wales.
Militant Islamist group Boko Haram claims responsibility for taking the girls from their boarding school in April.
The Nigerian Welsh Association also plans a march on Thursday.
Sunday's rally hoped to "gather support and pressurise governments into action".
The girls were seized from their school at night in Chibok on 14 April.
Boko Haram has said the girls should not have been in school and should get married instead. It has threatened to sell the students.
The group, whose name means "Western education is forbidden" in the Hausa language, began its insurgency in Borno state in 2009.
The kidnappings have been condemned around the world.
A social media campaign, Bring Back Our Girls, has been launched in the UK, while on Saturday, US First Lady Michelle Obama said she and president Barack Obama were "outraged and heartbroken" by the kidnappings.
Experts from the US and UK, including military advisers, negotiators and counsellors, arrived in Nigeria on Friday to help find the girls.
On Thursday, the Nigerian Welsh Association plans to march from the centre of Cardiff to the Senedd building.
Spokesman Kolawole Ponnle said the kidnappings were a "chilling situation".
He added: "What we want to do here is not just keep quiet, because Nigerians are married into the Welsh community and we have children growing up in Wales, and trying to have an identity as well back home."
He said he wanted the protest to be "heard around the world".
