South Africa head coach Russell Domingo will have to reapply for his role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Africa head coach Russell Domingo will have to reapply for his job if he wants to stay in charge of the team after their summer tour of England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Domingo has been in the role since May 2013 and his contract ends in August.
Cricket South Africa have said they are "resolved to begin a recruitment process" as they look to appoint a head coach "through to the 2019 World Cup".
South Africa will play three one-day internationals, three Twenty20 games and four Test matches against England.
Domingo's side are currently ranked third in Tests, second in one-day internationals and fourth in T20 cricket.
The 42-year-old guided his team to a 3-0 Test series win over Sri Lanka earlier this month and a 2-1 away Test series success in Australia in November.
South Africa won the first of five one-day internationals against Sri Lanka on Saturday with a convincing eight-wicket victory at Port Elizabeth.
Sri Lanka were bowled out for 181 and South Africa reached 185-2 with 15.4 overs remaining with Hashim Amla scoring 57 and Faf du Plessis making an unbeaten 55.
