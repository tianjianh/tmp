Stephen Heffernan was captured on CCTV aiming the carbon dioxide air pistol at his victim in Brick Lane, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, in March.
The 44-year-old, from Bradford on Avon, admitted possessing a weapon with intent to cause fear of violence and was sentenced at Swindon Crown Court.
The woman was unharmed and they walked away together after the incident.
Heffernan had been carrying the gun in his pocket before whipping it out to point at his victim.
Det Con Andy Henson, from Wiltshire Police, said: "I want to reassure the community that behaviour like this is never tolerated and we will do all we can to catch anyone who acts like this in public."
