[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew McDermott is accused of assaulting Niall Grace, who plays for Institute Football Club, at 00:45 BST on Sunday.
Mr Grace remains in a critical condition in hospital.
Mr McDermott, from Cornshell Fields in the city, is accused of grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of the Class A drug ecstasy.
A police officer said he could connect the defendant to the charges.
A defence barrister said a fight between the victim and the defendant outside a city centre bar had been caught on CCTV.
She said it showed both men throwing a punch before the victim fell and hit his head on the pavement.
Londonderry Magistrates Court was told Mr Grace was taken to Altlagelvin hospital before being transferred to Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, where he was placed in an induced coma.
Remanding Mr McDermott in custody, the judge said said there were potential safety concerns, given the public reaction to the case.
Institute FC has expressed support for Mr Grace in a tweet, saying the club's "thoughts and prayers" were with him.
In another message of support on Twitter, Harland and Wolff Welders football club said: "Our thoughts are with Niall Grace and the wider @Institute_FC family and hope Niall makes a full and speedy recovery from his injuries."
