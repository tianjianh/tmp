[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chinese media say that global focus on the Boston marathon bombings is skewed, as the public continues to mourn the death of a Chinese student killed in the blasts.

People's Daily and Global Times say the Western media have placed "disproportionately high" attention on Boston compared with terrorist attacks in Iraq and elsewhere or the earthquake on the Iran-Pakistan border.
Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong Beijing-backed daily, tells the US that its biggest threat is from terrorism, not China, and stresses that the Pacific is big enough to accommodate China and the US.
It accuses US President Barack Obama of turning China into a "new enemy" by expanding its military presence in Asia and boosting military alliances with Asian countries.
The majority of mainland state media continue to stay silent on the identity of Dorothy Lu Lingzi, a Chinese student from north-east Shenyang, who was one of three people killed by the Boston marathon bombings.
This has fuelled even more speculation among internet users on whether the student was the daughter of a "naked official" - a reference to officials who transfer assets and their families overseas.
Beijing News commentator Yang Gengshen criticises how photos and the identity of the student are already widespread on the internet.
He says netizens speculating over the student's identity are being "disrespectful" towards the request for anonymity from the deceased's family.
Shenyang Evening News says local residents held a candlelight vigil for "Little Lu" last night.
Shenyang Daily recounts how her last microblog entry on Monday showed a photo of bread and fruit and the message, "My wonderful breakfast". Over 25,000 condolence messages were posted on the entry.
"I had not thought that this would be your last breakfast," read one. Another said: "May you rest in peace," South China Morning Post reports.
Commentator Cao Lin of China Youth Daily denounces a minority of netizens as "human scum" for gloating over the attack, but stresses that the vast majority of internet users have expressed condolences to the victims and to the US.
In military news, Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou has warned the armed forces to guard against mainland Chinese cyber-attacks or attempts to lure spies through money or sex, Liberty Times reports.
While watching the island's first live-fire drill since 2008 at the annual Han Kuang military exercises on the outlying Pescadores on Wednesday, Mr Ma also declared that Taiwan would not "concede one step" in a sovereignty dispute with Japan over islands known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese.
Mainland Chinese internet users expressed disappointment after China Central Television reported that two People's Liberation Army navy ships had only patrolled non-disputed waters around 70 nautical miles from the disputed islands on the sensitive anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan on Wednesday.
South China Morning Post says the users' comments were later deleted from Sina news portal.
Health authorities are testing a family infected by H7N9 in Shanghai for human-to-human transmission of the new bird flu strain, The Beijing News reports.
The family is an 87-year-old man who died from bird flu on 4 March, along with one of his sons who died of pneumonia who tested negative for the virus.
The man's elder son recovered after contracting the H7N9 virus. However test results of the younger son are not available, says China Daily.
China's media regulator, the General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, has issued a circular banning journalists from quoting foreign media or websites and newsmakers without "prior verification", Xinhua news agency reports.
The tighter restrictions have triggered an outcry from Chinese internet users and international media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders.
After a breakdown in negotiations with contractors, striking Hong Kong dockers demanding higher pay on Wednesday moved their camp from Kwai Tsing Container Terminal to outside Cheung Kong Centre, Ming Pao report.
The building is the headquarters of Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, who owns strike-hit port operator Hong Kong International Terminals.
Finally, donors are flocking to China's first breast milk bank in Guangzhou that was set up in March to help feed premature babies and sick infants, Yangcheng Evening News reports.
