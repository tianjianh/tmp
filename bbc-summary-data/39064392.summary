Alloy wheel plant planned for Lochaber Smelter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Facilities for making alloy wheels have been proposed for the UK's last remaining aluminium smelter yard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liberty British Aluminium, which took over the running of the Lochaber Smelter near Fort William last year, also plans to construct a rolling mill.
The company has informed Highland Council of its plan to submit a planning application for the new facilities at a later date.
About 170 people are employed at the site.
In December, plans were announced to create up to 600 jobs and invest Â£120m in the yard.
Liberty British Aluminium took over the smelter from Rio Tinto in a Â£330m deal.
