Officials in Seoul said efforts were under way to rescue two sailors found on a life raft, Yonhap news agency reports.
On Friday, a crew member sent a text saying the Stellar Daisy freighter was taking on water.
The Uruguayan navy alerted merchant ships in the area, which began a search.
A navy spokesman said they had reported a strong smell of fuel.
The ship, a Very Large Ore Carrier (VLOC) with a capacity of 260,000 tonnes, was being operated by a South Korean company but was flagged to the Marshall Islands, and had eight Filipinos and 16 Koreans on board.
It had departed from Brazil, reports said.
