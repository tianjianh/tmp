Scottish cities 'worst in UK for nuisance calls'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cities in Scotland have the highest rates of nuisance calls in the UK, according to a new study.

Glasgow ranked top out of 18 cities across the UK, with Edinburgh second and Aberdeen fourth.
The number of nuisance calls was also found to be increasing, with vulnerable users experiencing the greatest rise.
Consumer body Which? and call-blocking provider trueCall analysed over nine million phone calls made between January 2013 and September 2016.
They found that more than half (51.5%) of calls in Glasgow were classified as a nuisance, as were 47.8% in Edinburgh and 45.6% in Aberdeen.
Scottish customers received an average of 42 nuisance calls a month between April and September this year, up from 35 per month in the previous six months.
Calls to vulnerable users in Scotland increased even further, up an average of 11 a month from 41 to 52, with 41% receiving more than 60 nuisance calls a month.
Which? called on the Scottish government's nuisance calls commission to tackle the problem.
The commission is due to hold its first meeting on Wednesday, the day the chancellor is expected to announce a ban on pensions cold calls in the Autumn Statement.
Alex Neill, from Which?, said: "Nuisance calls continue to be an everyday menace for everyone in the UK and the fact that three Scottish cities are among the worst-affected in the UK shows the scale of the problem for Scots.
"The Scottish government must use this opportunity to set out clearly how they plan to address the issue.
"Positive steps are needed so that people in Scotland are no longer plagued by these unwanted nuisance calls and texts."
Scotland's Economy Secretary Keith Brown said: "The latest data from trueCall further highlights that citizens in Scotland are plagued by nuisance calls to an unacceptable degree.
"These calls are a serious problem that can cause both emotional and financial harm, particularly to some of our most vulnerable citizens.
"That's why I established the nuisance calls commission and will chair the first meeting next week.
"Although devolution arrangements mean the Scottish government has limited powers to take direct action in this area, by working closely with partners from industry, regulators and consumer groups, we will develop a joint plan setting out practical solutions to the problem."
