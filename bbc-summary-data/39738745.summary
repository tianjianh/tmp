[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Thompson, 39, shot the teenager, who was riding on the back of a motorcycle, in Sunderland in October.
Last month, Thompson admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of an air rifle without a firearms certificate
The victim suffered a "serious head wound" and was taken to hospital.
He was admitted to hospital in a critical condition and regained consciousness a week later.
In a witness statement read at Newcastle Crown Court, the teenager said he felt he had lost the life he loved as a result of his injuries.
He was said to have been an active boy who loved swimming and going to the Lake District on activity holidays.
Since the shooting he has lost most movement in the left side of his body and can only walk for short spells and uses a wheelchair for longer distances.
The judge praised the determination of the boy, and the support of his family, which has supported him with his recovery.
Detective Inspector Ed Small, said: "This has truly been an awful incident and Thompson's actions have left this poor young man with severe life-changing injuries.
"No 15-year-old should have their freedom or dignity taken away from them in this way."
Thompson, of Hewitt Avenue, also admitted another firearms charge but denied perverting the course of justice.
The driver of the motorbike was not hurt in the attack.
