It is thought the red tablets, known as Beanos or Red Death Cons, may contain ketamine or methamphetamine.
A girl aged 14 and a 15-year-old-boy were taken to hospital on Tuesday night and have since been discharged.
A 16-year-old boy from Shanklin was held on suspicion of supplying a class A drug but has since been released.
He remains under investigation, Hampshire Constabulary said.
Police said taking the tablets could be "life threatening" and urged anyone who had any to hand them in
Symptoms experienced after taking them include light-headedness, losing feeling in extremities and increasing anxiety.
Police said anyone who handed potential ecstasy tablets into police would not be prosecuted.
Det Con Jessica Hughes said: "We do not condone the sale or use of any illegal substances, however, in this particular case it is imperative that we establish where these tablets have come from and who may be in possession of them before anyone else takes them."
