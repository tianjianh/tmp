Alloa woman given ban after neglecting dogs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Alloa woman has been banned from keeping dogs for three years after neglecting two animals in her care.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lorna Wood, 34, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Maisie and Lola by failing to provide adequate care and treatment for the two dogs.
Alloa Sheriff Court heard that the dogs were underweight as a result of not being fed properly.
The Scottish SPCA said both animals weighed about 13.2kg, almost 7kg short of their ideal weight.
SSPCA Inspector Louise Seddon said: "Maisie, the Border collie, was extremely thin under her coat and I could only feel bones rather than fat or muscle.
"Although it was difficult to pinpoint an exact timeframe as to how long they had been suffering, the vet confirmed that they had a lack of food for a number of weeks.
"Whilst in our care it became clear to us that Maisie and Lola were simply not being fed as they quickly put on a significant amount of weight when they were fed adequately.
"We are delighted that Wood has been dealt with by the courts and hope she will give serious consideration to her ability to care for animals in the future."
