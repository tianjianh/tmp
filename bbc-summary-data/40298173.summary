The Thermomix is a luxury appliance that can steam, blend, chop and cook food in a short amount of time.
Australia's consumer watchdog, which filed the lawsuit, alleges Thermomix in Australia misled consumers over the safety of the TM31 model.
At least 14 customers suffered serious burns from faulty lid seals, it said.
Nearly 90 people had reported issues with a Thermomix, according to a report from consumer group Choice last May.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched an investigation into Thermomix in August.
Thermomix in Australia was allegedly slow to disclose the problems with the appliance in 2014 before ultimately issuing a recall for the faulty lids.
Customers were also allegedly made to sign non-disclosure agreements before getting a replacement or refund that prevented them from making negative comments about the brand.
"The law requires that suppliers must act to notify the ACCC as soon as they become aware of any person who has suffered a serious injury associated with the goods they have supplied," ACCC acting chairwoman, Delia Rickard said in a statement.
The kitchen appliance costs around $1,500 (Â£1,200) each and has gained a dedicated following in Australia for its multiple functions.
Thermomix in Australia has said it is co-operating fully with the ACCC but would not comment further while proceedings were ongoing.
