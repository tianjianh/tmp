Sandwell Hospital in West Bromwich declared a "level 4" incident after a "very high" number of admissions.
Medical director Dr Roger Stedman said the hospital had decided to require trainee doctors due on shift to attend as normal during the strike.
The British Medical Association (BMA) said its members should continue with industrial action for the time being.
Junior doctors' strike: Live updates
In a statement, it said: "Junior doctors should continue with industrial action until NHS England has confirmed and the BMA has agreed - via the agreed escalation process - that a major unpredictable incident is taking place for a specific Trust.
"The BMA will notify members as soon as such an incident is in place."
The hospital is run by Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust.
It comes as the first strike by junior doctors in 40 years is under way in a row over a new contract.
About 100 picket lines have been put in place, with a large concentration in and around London.
Anne Rainsberry, national incident director for NHS England, said: "The local NHS is actively reviewing the situation to support the Trust. Nationally, we are continuing to work closely with our BMA colleagues to ensure patient safety."
The BBC has seen a letter sent to doctors in training from Dr Stedman dated 11 January which said: "Over the past few days there has been a surge in activity which has continued today.
"There are over 50 additional adult beds open with further medical outliers in surgery.
"There have not been enough discharges today to accommodate patients requiring admission.
"Tomorrow we will be running Sandwell General Hospital site as a Trust internal incident with all medical teams working to increase the numbers of discharges.
"I have reviewed the situation this afternoon and I believe that given the situation and staffing levels, it would be unsafe to deliver care to all our in-patients with a reduced workforce tomorrow."
A junior doctor who received the letter told the BBC: "Over the past few days, our medical director Dr Roger Stedman never outlined that this hospital was facing a major incident level 4 and to top it all off, he sent us a letter this morning at 08:15 GMT which was actually dated the 11 January
"If this was a major incident the trust has been facing as per the letter ''over the past few days'' why wait until now?"
"There are about 15 junior doctors here holding placards.
"They say they've had representatives inside the hospital, there are spare beds and they are happy it is safe, so they will be remaining on the picket line.
"The junior doctors have told me that 15 minutes before they went onto the picket they received an email ordering them to go back into work.
"They say that didn't follow the procedure agreed between the British Medical Association and NHS England.
"They are getting lots of drivers beeping their horns and support from passers by."
