[SN]TITLE[SN]
Denbighshire high school bus service shake-up agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Free secondary school transport rules are being tightened up in Denbighshire to save the county council Â£270,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bus transport will now only be provided from central pick-up points from next September in a move to reduce costs.
The council's free travel policy will now only be offered to children for their nearest school and not a preferred choice as had become the case in recent years.
The changes affect 232 pupils at half a dozen high schools in the county.
However, a transitional period will be introduced so pupils who are not attending their nearest school, will remain eligible for transport "to prevent disruption to their education".
Councillors requested further scrutiny be given to the issue of children travelling to their preferred Welsh school - which will not necessarily be their nearest school - with a further report prepared in early next spring.
The issue was raised as some parents in rural areas like Prion are concerned they will not be able to send their children to Welsh medium Ysgol Glan Clwyd in St Asaph, as their local school would be bilingual Ysgol Brynhyfryd in Ruthin and the bus route is on roads not suitable for buses.
A report to the committee said the changes were needed as the transport budget was overspent.
