Review of Aberystwyth care home transfer to private firm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The decision to transfer a Ceredigion care home to a private company has been called in by a group of councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Tuesday the council cabinet decided to look for a private firm to run the nursing dementia home at Bodlondeb Care Home in Penparcau, Aberystwyth.
But four councillors have written to the council saying they would prefer residential care remains alongside the nursing dementia beds.
The scrutiny committee will review the decision over the next two weeks.
Another vote is possible if the committee disagrees with the decision.
