The rest of the home nations have two nominees each, with last year's winner Stuart Hogg selected alongside Scotland team-mate Finn Russell.
Scrum-half Conor Murray and back row CJ Stander are shortlisted for Ireland.
Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb and hooker Ken Owens are also included.
France fly-half Camille Lopez - the 2017 top points scorer - and team-mate Louis Picamoles make the list, as does Italy captain Sergio Parisse.
Voting is open to the public on the Six Nations website and closes at 12:00 GMT on Tuesday 21 March.
Centre Farrell, second row Launchbury and fellow forward Itoje are recognised after England claimed their second straight title, despite missing out on back-to-back Grand Slams with defeat to Ireland on Saturday.
Scotland full-back Hogg could become the first player since Ireland centre Brian O'Driscoll in 2006 and 2007 to win two successive player of the tournament titles.
