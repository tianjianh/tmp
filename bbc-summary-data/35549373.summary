The 30-year-old, who featured in the recent Test series against England, has played 69 one-day internationals and 15 T20 internationals.
He has 117 T20 wickets at an average of 21.77 and previously played for Kent and Surrey.
At the end of June he will be replaced by New Zealand international Adam Milne.

"He will add a different dimension to our bowling attack, being a left-armer and bowling with real pace."
