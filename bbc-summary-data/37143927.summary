Englishman Garner, 28, has scored 57 goals in 148 appearances since joining the Championship club in 2013.
The forward could make his Rangers debut against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Friday evening.
Preston said on their official Twitter account: "We're yet to receive the paperwork but expect the deal to be completed over the weekend."
But Garner, who was paraded at Ibrox Park ahead of a 2-1 win over Motherwell on Saturday, is not expecting any last-minute hitches.
"It's fantastic to be here and to have got it over the line," he said. "Now it's done, I'm really looking forward to it.
"It was a great finish to the game today, a great atmosphere and I'm sure the lads will be buzzing in the dressing-room.
"If you look at the history of the club, it's obviously massive.
"When I was driving in with my family, you could get a sense of how much they love their football up here.
"I've been brought in to score goals and hopefully pick up points and trophies along the way."
Garner was left out of Preston's side as they lost 1-0 at home to Derby County on Tuesday after Rangers submitted their bid.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton was delighted to add to his striking options along with Kenny Miller, Martyn Waghorn and summer signing Joe Dodoo.
"We've been chasing him for a while," he said. "He comes in with a real edge to his play and offers us something a bit different.
"We've now got four strikers with Joe, Kenny, Martyn Waghorn and Joe Dodoo, so we've got some real options now up front."
Garner has previously played for Carlisle United, Nottingham Forest, Huddersfield Town, Scunthorpe United and Watford, scoring over 100 goals since 2006.
