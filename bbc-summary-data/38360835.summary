[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Bodin netted a hat-trick as Bristol Rovers made it a miserable start for new Coventry boss Russell Slade at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took an 18th-minute lead when Bodin's free-kick from the right was met by Peter Hartley, who sent a glancing header past Lee Burge from 12 yards.
Bodin grabbed the second in the 54th minute, making space to drive a fierce left-footed shot into the centre of the goal from Rory Gaffney's pass.
Three minutes later the Sky Blues replied when centre-back Jordan Willis took advantage of poor defending to volley home Gael Bigirimana's left-wing corner from close range.
Bodin clinched the points in the 74th minute with another sweetly struck left-footed shot, this time from 25 yards. The midfielder completed his treble from the penalty spot nine minutes later after being tripped by Turnbull.
Andy Rose headed against the crossbar for Coventry late on but they were well beaten.
