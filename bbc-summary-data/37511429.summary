[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British woman and her alleged lover have appeared before a court accused of plotting to murder her husband in India.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sukhjit Singh, a businessman from Derby, was found with his throat slit on 2 September in Banda, Uttar Pradesh.
Police allege his wife, Ramandeep Kaur Mann, was having an affair with his childhood friend, Gurpreet Singh.
Her lawyer told the BBC she is innocent and claims a land dispute is behind the killing.
Neither of the suspects have been formally charged yet but both are in custody while police prepare to charge them with murder.
They both appeared in court via video link for a procedural hearing, at which their remand was extended.
Officials from the British High Commission have visited Ms Kaur Mann in prison to check on her welfare.
Separately, a case has been filed in the UK by her parents over the custody of the couple's two young boys.
It is expected to be heard on Saturday.
