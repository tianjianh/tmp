[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four horses including joint favourite Wings of Desire have been added as late entries for the Derby at Epsom on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cloth Of Stars, Humphrey Bogart and Red Verdon are the other supplementary entries at a cost of £75,000 each.
Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien has seven of the 18 contenders still in the race, including leading hope US Army Ranger.
The additional entries mean the race will be worth £1.454m and the most valuable ever staged in Britain.
If all 18 horses line up, it will be the largest Derby field for 10 years since the victory of Sir Percy in 2006.
O'Brien, who has won the race five times previously, saddled eight runners in 2007 when his best finisher Eagle Mountain was second to winner Authorized.
