[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wine drinkers urged to drop glass size

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new scheme to help wine drinkers cut down on their alcohol consumption is being introduced in East Dunbartonshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 100 licensed premises have volunteered to serve customers smaller glasses.
Previously, if you ordered a glass of wine you would most likely be offered it in a 175ml or a 250ml glass.
But now, East Dunbartonshire customers will be offered wine in a 125ml glass in a bid to promote sensible drinking.
The scheme was set up by the Scottish Government Alcohol Industry Partnership which brings together politicians and the alcohol industry.
Public Health Minister Maureen Watt described it as a simple, effective way to promote responsible drinking.
Research conducted by YouGov suggested that 70% of adults do not know how much wine is in a small, medium or large glass - with nearly half of customers surveyed opting for a large glass which can contain more than three units of alcohol.
