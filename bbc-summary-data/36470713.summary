[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Tomkins' late try helped Wigan Warriors come from behind to win at Hull KR and go second in Super League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dominic Manfredi put the visitors eight points up with two early tries.
Albert Kelly reacted first to Terry Campese's kick to touch down for Rovers before the break, and second-half tries from Thomas Minns and Mitch Allgood put them 10 points ahead.
Anthony Gelling went over in the corner to reduce the deficit, and Tomkins crossed to win it for Wigan.
Warriors remain two points behind leaders Hull FC, whose victory at Warrington saw the Wolves slip to third.
The hosts, who are now five points off the top eight with five games left before the Super Eights phase of the season begins, thought they had taken the lead inside three minutes when Kieran Dixon went over in the corner, only for the officials to rule that the winger had gone into touch.
Manfredi scored his first try in similar circumstances moments later, with the 22-year-old this time ruled to have stayed inbounds before going over.
Wigan started the second half on top, but a string of errors and strong Rovers defence prevented them from adding to their lead, before Minns put the hosts ahead against the run of play.
Allgood ran over untouched from 10 metres out, but Wigan's late fightback ensured the ninth-placed Robins' wait for successive wins in Super League this season continued.
Hull KR coach James Webster:
"It's was a really gutsy effort. We made too many errors. We were unbelievably tough to repel our tryline for 80 minutes. To lose in that manner was gut-wrenching.
"We had players out there who wanted to come off but we didn't have enough players to do so.
"We'll fight to the death... we'll go to St Helens with whoever we can put out.
"The other teams might win three or four games and take it out of our hands. If they don't win those games, we have to be good enough to capitalise."
Wigan coach Shaun Wane:
"We put ourselves under a lot of pressure with 16 errors and kicking the ball out on the last play so many times. I'm ecstatic to have got the win in the end.
"I felt we could snag the game if we showed a bit of composure. We showed we can grind games out and it was a great effort to finish the game the way we did.
"We were way off our best - but we still found a way to win."
