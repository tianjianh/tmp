Gatwick flight paths: Campaigners win right to appeal changes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners fighting changes to flight paths to Gatwick have won the right to take the issue to the Court of Appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2013 the National Air Traffic Control Services (NATS) altered some routes which mean more aircraft fly over some villages in north west Kent.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said NATS could make changes in "established airspace" without a consultation.
Campaign group Gatwick Obviously Not disputes this and wants a judicial review into the process.
Its application for a review was rejected at the High Court in July but this has now been overruled by a senior judge.
Gatwick Obviously Not chairman Martin Barraud said he was delighted with the decision to take the issue to the Court of Appeal.
He added: "The legal team say this vindicates the arguments made before the High Court judge that this clearly is a seriously arguable case."
A CAA spokesman said it noted the decision and remained "committed to working with industry to ensure more is done to address the issue of aviation noise and to better support the communities affected by it".
The changes NATS introduced in 2013 that are being challenged are separate to the six narrower flight paths the CAA approved in November.
