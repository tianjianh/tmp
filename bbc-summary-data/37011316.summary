The 23-year-old joined Real at the age of 14 and was part of their Champions League-winning squads in 2014 and 2016.
He will link up with former Sevilla boss Unai Emery, who succeeded Laurent Blanc as PSG manager in June.
"It will be a great pleasure to work under the direction of Unai Emery, who has developed an excellent reputation," Jese told the PSG website.
