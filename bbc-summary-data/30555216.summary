The soldier discovered the object under her vehicle at Corbracky Road, Portadown, on Friday afternoon and called police.
Bomb disposal officers were called and a controlled explosion was carried out.
Police said on Saturday that the object had been accidentally left attached to the underside of the vehicle following a recent service.
In a statement, Supt Simon Walls said: "The object found under the car in Corbracky Road was categorically not an explosive device of any description."
Army Technical Officers (ATO) were called to examine a "suspicious object" on Corbracky Road on Friday afternoon.
Sources told the BBC they believed the object was a booby-trap bomb.
A controlled explosion was carried out at about 16:45 GMT and a police spokesman later confirmed the object was not explosive.
A number of residents who had to leave their homes during the alert were later allowed to return.
