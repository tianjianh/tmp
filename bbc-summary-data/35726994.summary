It becomes the second chart-topper for the British band, after selling 58,000 copies (including streams) - about 6,500 more than Adele's 25.
Her sales doubled week-on-week, thanks to her performance at the Brits and the start of her UK tour.
Meanwhile, Lukas Graham topped the singles chart for a fourth week.
Their wistful ballad, 7 Years, achieved combined chart sales of more than 106,000 - higher than they managed in their very first week at number one.
In the singles chart there are two new entries, the highest being Tinie Tempah featuring Zara Larsson at 15 with Girls Like. US girl band Fifth Harmony are at 23 with Work From Home, featuring TY Dolla Sign.
Adele's When We Were Young has broken into the top 10 for the first time this week - moving up four places to nine.
And DJ Riton's Rinse and Repeat featuring Kah-Lo is the biggest climber rising 65 places to 13.
In addition to The 1975, there are eight new entries on the album chart.
Britain's Got Talent finalists Richard & Adam entered the chart at number nine with Songs of Inspiration. It is the third top 10 album for the classical singers.
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis are at 16 with This Unruly Mess I've Made, which is their highest UK album chart ranking to date.
There are also new entries for Anthrax, at 21 with For All Kings, and Steve Mason with Meet The Humans at 28.
David Bowie's reissued albums continue to climb the chart, with Hunky Dory climbing 11 places to 26 and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust rising 12 places to 29.
There are also new entries from Magnum, Raleigh Ritchie, Bonnie Raitt and DMA in the top 40.
However Phase - the debut album from the BBC's Sound of 2016 winner Jack Garratt - fell from three to 18 in its second week of release.
