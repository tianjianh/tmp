Cheryl James Deepcut death: MoD misses inquest deadline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has failed to submit documents before a promised deadline in the case of a soldier who died at Deepcut Barracks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a bullet wound to her head in Surrey in 1995.
At a pre-inquest review at Woking Coroner's Court, her father said he was "disappointed" with the MoD.
Pte James was one of four soldiers who died at the barracks between 1995 and 2002 amid claims of bullying and abuse.
Ptes Sean Benton, James Collinson and Geoff Gray also died from gunshot wounds.
A fresh inquest into the death of Pte James is due to start on 1 February and is expected to last seven weeks.
It was ordered after High Court judges quashed an open verdict recorded in December 1995.
In the summer, her body was exhumed and a fresh post-mortem examination was carried out.
Metallic fragments were recovered which were analysed by a ballistics expert but a report has yet to be finalised.
In a statement read to the court , Des James, said he found it both surprising and disappointing that documents had not yet been disclosed.
Nicholas Moss, representing the MoD, said thousands of files were being searched, which meant a lot of time was taken up deciding which documents were and were not relevant for the inquest.
He promised all of the relevant documents would be delivered by 11 January.
The coroner, Judge Brian Barker, said he did not see that things could have been done differently.
