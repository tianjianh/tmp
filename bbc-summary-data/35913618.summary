Joe Marler calling Samson Lee 'Gypsy boy': Misconduct hearing set

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Joe Marler will face a World Rugby misconduct hearing on 5 April for calling Wales' Samson Lee "Gypsy boy".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six Nations organisers had ruled Marler would not be punished for the comment, made during the first half of England's 25-21 win over Wales on 12 March.
But World Rugby, which governs the international game, says the prop's remark "amounts to misconduct and/or a breach" of its code of conduct.
Marler apologised to Lee, who is from the Traveller community, at half-time.
The Harlequins player was reprimanded by England head coach Eddie Jones, but the Welsh Rugby Union was disappointed he was not suspended.
