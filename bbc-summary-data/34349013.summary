Bertrand Denarie worked at hospitals in Bristol, Salford and Gateshead from 2013 until early 2015.
An investigation by North Bristol NHS Trust found mistakes in 106 cases, including two that led to a delayed diagnosis of cancer.
An NHS spokesman said "immediate action" was being taken, with patients "now receiving appropriate care".
The results were all follow-up examinations where initial cervical screening tests had shown abnormal results and were collected in colposcopy clinics.
The trust said it had contacted all the patients involved.
A "final letter" with the findings of the investigation would be sent out to those involved soon.
"We are aware that errors may have occurred in relation to the laboratory testing of cervical biopsies at four trusts," the NHS added.
"These were discovered as a result of routine audit and are being investigated by the trusts concerned and NHS England, with the support of Public Health England."
Of the 106 mistakes found in the Bristol cases, 87 of those led to "no harm" with 11 needing extra testing and two having delays in cancer diagnosis.
Dr Denarie worked in Bristol at Southmead Hospital in two periods in from January to April 2014 and then later that year from May to July. He also reviewed cases from St Michaels Hospital in Bristol during those periods.
Before Bristol, he worked at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead for nine months in 2013 and worked at Salford Royal Hospital for about four months at the end of 2014.
A spokesman for NHS England said investigations at these two hospitals were at a much earlier stage.
Salford Royal Hospital said it had identified three errors with the pathologist's cervical biopsy work, which "had the potential to lead to minor harm for the patients concerned".
"We've been in contact with those three patients to apologise, explain the outcome of our review and discuss any changes we need to make to their treatment plan," said Dr Pete Turkington, medical director for standards and performance.
"It's important for me to emphasise that we are confident no patient has experienced significant harm. However, we apologise unreservedly for any stress or inconvenience that this has caused."
The General Medical Council confirmed they were investigating Dr Denarie and that a number of conditions had been placed on his licence.
One of those specified he "must not report on any cervical biopsy specimens".
