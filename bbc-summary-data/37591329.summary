The fire service was called to the privately-owned Cosgrove Hall, near Milton Keynes, just before 14:30 BST.
BBC reporter Stuart Ratcliffe, speaking at the scene, said: "Only the stone shell of the building remains. There really is nothing else."
The fire at the 18th Century limestone mansion had been been brought under control by 17:15. There are no reports of any injuries.
At least six crews from Northamptonshire tackled the fire, helped by engines from Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire.
The cause of the blaze is not known at this stage.
