Gwent Police said residents on Ruperra Street in Pill are being disrupted through the night by people "looking to buy illegal drugs".
The force added locals are "fearful" after being "intimidated" by visitors "shouting and swearing abuse".
Police are to apply for a three-month anti-social behaviour closure notice
"No-one should be living their lives faced with this daily intimidation and disruption," said PC Paula Spence, the crime and disorder reduction officer.
The owner consented to the house being boarded up with steel shutters installed and police warned anyone who attempts to enter it could be arrested.
