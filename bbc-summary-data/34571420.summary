Swansea council sells 19th Century folly at auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 19th Century folly once owned by one of Swansea's founding industrial families has been sold at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grade-II listed tower, known as the Belvedere, in Sketty, is believed to have sold for around Â£130,000.
Built between 1820 and 1830, the folly is all that remains of Sketty Park House, the former home of copper and tin magnates the Morris family.
It was sold by Swansea council as the local authority looks to save more than Â£80m over the next three years.
The folly, which is in need of renovation, had been owned by the local authority since the 1930s, although the rest of the mansion was demolished in the 1970s.
Local historian Gary Gregor explained: "Sketty Park House was designed by William Jernegan, the architect of Regency Swansea, whose local designs include Stouthall, Kilvrough Manor, Mumbles lighthouse and the Assembly Rooms.
"After varied usage by the Swansea Corporation, including as the Civil Defence Service headquarters, it was demolished in 1975 so that the Sketty Park housing estate could be erected.
"The part which still remains is a ruined gothic belvedere, after a design of Margam Park's Chapter House, on a tree-covered mound in Saunders Way.  It was built by Sir John's reclusive grandson Sir John Armine Morris."
The dynasty began in the 1720s when Shropshire entrepreneur Robert Morris started the first mass smelting at the Llangyfelach Copper Works.
However, it was his son Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet of Clasemont, who made the most lasting impact.
In the 1760s, Sir John hired architect William Edwards to create Morris Town - now Morriston - one of Europe's first purpose-built villages, to house his workers.
At its heart was Morris Castle, containing 24 workers' apartments which were palatial by the standards of the day.
While Morriston was good enough for his workers, Mr Gregor explained that it was not entirely to Sir John's own liking, so he moved.
"Built around 1775, Sir John had a Palladian-style mansion called Clasemont at Pengwern, near the present-day DVLA building. Lord Nelson and the Hamiltons dined there in 1802.
"But the spread of fumes from the copper smelting works in the lower Swansea valley rendered it unsuitable, so Clasemont was dismantled in 1805 and much of the materials were transported west of Swansea to construct the new mansion, Sketty Park House."
Sir John never saw the fruits of these labours as he died aged 74 in 1819, a year before work started on Sketty Park House.
But Mr Gregor said he left an "enduring memorial" in the form of Morriston, where you can still see "the workers village laid out in a gridiron pattern, with every cottage having sufficient garden to grow vegetables".
