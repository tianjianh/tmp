[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A reward of up to Â£2,000 has been offered to identify a cyclist who lifted his bike over train barriers seconds before a train sped past.

The man lifted his bike over the North Sheen level crossing on Manor Road, Richmond upon Thames, on 11 May.
He managed to cross before the train arrived.
Crimestoppers, which is offering the reward, said the cyclist risked his own life and left the train driver with "psychological trauma".
Commuters who witnessed the event pleaded with the cyclist to wait, the charity said.
Dave Hunter, Crimestoppers' head of operations, said: "This man could have caused himself serious injury or even death.
"His actions were incredibly dangerous. Someone will know who he is and we hope they will see that there is no excuse for this behaviour.
"The barriers are there for a very good reason."
