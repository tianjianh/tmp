[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One US support group is criticising Maroon 5's new music video claiming it promotes violence against women.

In the video for Animals, Victoria's Secret supermodel Behati Prinsloo, frontman Adam Levine's wife, is stalked by his character who is a sociopathic butcher.
The singer is seen taking secret photos of her and storing them in a meat fridge.
Smeared in blood, Levine fantasises about having sex with her.
The storyline shows him approaching her in a club edited together with blood-soaked sex scenes.
One US anti-sexual assault group, RAINN (Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network), has released a statement about what it calls the "dangerous depiction of a stalker's fantasy" in Animals.
"No-one should ever confuse the criminal act of stalking with romance," it reads.
"The trivialisation of these serious crimes, like stalking, should have no place in the entertainment industry."
Lyrics to Animals include: "Baby I'm preying on you tonight. Hunt you down eat you alive".
On Friday, a voluntary scheme will see music videos get film-style age ratings in a new pilot to protect children from unsuitable content.
Maroon 5 are yet to respond to the complaints.
