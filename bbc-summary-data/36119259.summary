The 27-year-old's Eastern side were crowned Hong Kong Premier League champions courtesy of a 2-1 win over South China on Friday.
Chan, who took over from Yeung Ching-kwong in December with Eastern one point clear at the top of the table, has lost only once in 15 matches.
Eastern won the title - their first in 21 years - with one game still to play.
