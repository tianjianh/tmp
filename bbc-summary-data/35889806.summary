Investigators of child abuse in Bristol 'slow to react'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Investigators of "horrific" child sexual exploitation in Bristol were slow to recognise the abuse, a serious case review said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nine girls were groomed and abused by men in their 20s, from 2012 to 2014.
Thirteen men were jailed following a wide-ranging police inquiry.
The review found there was "no endemic failure" once abuse was identified but a "considerable delay" in recognising it with police apparently viewing it as "consensual underage sexual activity".
Avon and Somerset Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over "shortcomings" in the case.
The force set up Operation Brooke in May 2013, but reports of sexual abuse and underage sex were being made to police and social services from November 2011, the review confirmed.
The 13 men, of Somali heritage, abused the girls between December 2012 and May 2014.
The review noted police were "under pressure" from spending cuts and had a heavy workload.
However, it detailed how complaints were left to "drift" with alleged abusers not interviewed, and one complaint from an 11-year-old girl was not investigated for five months.
Four parents told reviewers they "felt they had not been taken seriously" when making reports to the police.
Some of the girls involved considered themselves to be in loving relationships and "at times" professionals saw the abuse "as underage sexual activity more in line with the boyfriend model", the review found.
One parent reporting that her daughter had been raped twice, was told by an investigating officer she was "making lifestyle choices".
Crimes committed against them were "horrific and beyond most people's comprehension", the review found. Where dangers were recognised, some professionals felt they did not have "the tools" to do much about it.
A 16-year-old girl, who had been in care, was moved from her home local authority to supported housing in Bristol at the direction of a youth court.
But, accommodation was hard to find and she was placed, alone, in an area known for "street crime and drug dealers", something the review said was" hard to understand".
Her own social worker felt "uncomfortable" leaving her there but felt "helpless" to do anything about it. The girl quickly fell in with drug dealers who used her home to "run their drug dealing activities".
They paid, and sold her for sex and encouraged her to provide them with other young victims.
Her former local authority, which cannot be named, said it was "very sorry about what's happened" and acknowledged "failings" in its systems.
It said changes had been made to help staff recognise the signs of child sexual exploitation and work would continue to help others, including the victims, to recognise they are being abused.
Assistant Chief Constable Kay Wozniak said child sexual exploitation is now "a priority for Avon and Somerset".
"We are much better able to spot the links, join up the intelligence and, alongside our partners, see a fuller picture," she said.
Bristol Clinical Commissioning group said GPs and hospitals were being trained to "spot the signs" of child sexual exploitation.
The review stated some health workers had been confused by patient confidentiality and the group also said it was tackling the issue "when children are at risk of significant harm".
