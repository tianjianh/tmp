County Championship: Keaton Jennings revives Durham against Yorkshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Opener Keaton Jennings made the highest score of his career as Durham turned their match against Yorkshire on its head on day three at the Riverside.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jennings batted through the entire day for 185 not out as the north-east county reached 452-8, a lead of 301.
He put on 117 with Paul Collingwood (61) and 156 with Usman Arshad, whose 84 was also a career-best.
Arshad was eventually caught behind off Ben Coad, the 22-year-old debutant's first wicket in Championship cricket.
Durham began the day on 98-3, still 53 in arrears after conceding a first-innings lead of 151, but by the close had ensured that all three results will be possible on the final day.
Michael Richardson was soon run out by Coad from square leg but, crucially, Collingwood escaped on 19, when wicketkeeper Andrew Hodd was unable to hold a difficult high chance off Josh Shaw.
Jennings reached his fourth Championship hundred of the summer off 228 balls after Collingwood finally fell lbw to Kane Williamson, and also saw Ryan Pringle (20) bowled by Tim Bresnan with the new ball.
Yorkshire had to wait 36 overs for their next success when Arshad departed, but they could not find a way to dislodge Jennings, who has so far batted for eight hours and 43 minutes, faced 367 balls and hit 19 fours.
