A church hall in Stoke-on-Trent is being refurbished as part of a wider Â£750,000 investment in one area of the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Central Hall Methodist Church in Longton, built in the mid-19th Century, will be restored as part of a scheme to renovate the town's architectural gems.
Restoring the exteriors of a further 10 buildings during 2012 will be funded by the city council and English Heritage.
Work on the church hall is expected to get under way on Monday.
Longton Market Hall has already benefited from the heritage grant with shop fronts refurbished and a new illuminated metallic market sign installed.
The funding has also helped to reinstate cobbles along the historical route of Handcart Lane.
Councillor Ruth Rosenau, Stoke-on-Trent City Council cabinet member for regeneration, said: "Longton has a strong architectural heritage and this project is helping to restore the exterior of some of the town's most historical buildings.
"The Methodist hall is well used by the community and has a long historic connection with the town.
"The work will repair the front stained glass windows and restore the intricate canopy designs which will bring the building back to its former glory."
