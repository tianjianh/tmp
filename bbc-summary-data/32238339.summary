Montage of Heck features unseen footage, photographs, extracts from his journals growing up and interviews with his family.
Filmmaker Brett Morgen says he wants to dispel the myths about Cobain and show a more relatable side to the rock star, who killed himself at 27 years old.
He says we will see a funny and very romantic side to the Nirvana frontman who ultimately was someone who just wanted a family.
Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck is released in the UK on 10 April.
