Clerk of the course Gary Thompson confirmed the opening four-lap Supersport race will start at 13:00 BST.
However, police said part of the course between Ballacraine and Ballig is currently closed after a tree fell on top of a car.
It is not believed anyone in the car was injured.
The day's schedule also includes the first Sidecar race at 14:50 BST and practice sessions for TT Zero, Superstock and Lightweight machines.
Most roads around the course will close to traffic at midday.
The Mountain Road from Barrule Park, Ramsey to Bungalow will close at 11.15 and Bungalow to Creg Ny Baa at 11:30.
The event's opening Superbike race was won by Yorkshire racer Ian Hutchinson on Sunday.
