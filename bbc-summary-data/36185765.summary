At the age of 31, the Welsh chicken farmer, who runs a successful family free range egg business in Gwent, is serious about fulfilling a genuine ambition to tread the boards.
"I'm sure people will think my West End ambitions are a wind-up," he said.
"The family farming business is going really well. The time is right to hang up the boots and try a new challenge."
As well as spending more time with his young family and successful chicken farming and countryside recycling business, based at St Brides just outside Newport, the rugby-playing Shervington fulfils another traditional Welsh custom of being a good singer. He has a passion for musicals and theatre and is now enthusiastically ready to target the West End.
"I'm not always seen as the most serious bloke in the game," he added. "But I'd genuinely love to try something different and to follow another of my passions, just like rugby has been for the past 12 years."
After two years working with his fellow Welshman, Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said: "Edd has been a great addition to the squad, not only for his strength at the set-piece but also for his off-field presence.
"His sense of humour is sometimes an acquired taste, but he has created a lot of laughs among the squad throughout his time here and I'd like to wish Edd and his family the best of luck for their next steps."
Shervington represented Wales at age-group levels up to Under-21s, as well as Neath and Ospreys, before signing for Worcester Warriors in 2010.
After four seasons at Sixways, he joined Wasps in 2014, since when he has made 31 appearances.
"I would like to thank everyone at Wasps for such an enjoyable two years, particularly our owner Derek Richardson, who has been phenomenal for the club as well as being a really decent guy," he said.
"I'd also like to thank Dai and the coaches for the opportunities and support they've given me and the players for such a memorable couple of seasons.
"It's been a pleasure to be part of such a tight squad, to reach a European semi-final and still with a Premiership semi-final to look forward to."
