BBC Wales and Arts Council of Wales said Horizons would continue into 2018.
It was launched in 2014 and originally scheduled to run for two years, but was extended for one more year in 2016.
Head Bethan Elfyn said: "We've had an overwhelming response, from artists, festival organisers and industry creatives wanting to work with us and people wanting to hear the music."
The project, which supports emerging, independent Welsh musicians, has helped 36 artists since its inception.
Director of enterprise and regeneration for the Arts Council of Wales, Sian Tomos, said: "Every year, Horizons showcases some brilliant artists and assists in the creation of a diverse mix of new music."
