The lyrics are from Vegas, a track on Eminem's upcoming compilation album.
He raps: "So what's it gon' be? Put that away Iggy. You don't wanna blow that rape whistle on me. Scream!"
Azalea also said that she is "bored of the old men threatening young women as entertainment".
She said that women in the music industry have "bigger balls" and "endure much more harassment".
Of course Eminem is famed for his controversial lyrics.
In a freestyle rap to promote his new album he said he would "punch" Lana Del Ray.
He also referenced the shocking case of an NFL footballer who in September was seen in video footage attacking his wife in a lift.
"I'll punch Lana Del Rey right in the face twice," he raps, "like Ray Rice in broad daylight".
"The new Eminem rap song is yet another example of a stream of music videos that glamorises and normalises rape, rape culture and violence against women," Betiel Barakia, a spokesperson for Object, which tackles issues around women and girls in the media, told Newsbeat.
"It normalises and legitimises forms of behaviour that should be condemned, not celebrated or tolerated.
"Eminem is a global, successful rapper; his target audience are young boys and he, alongside the music industry as a whole, have a responsibility towards their audience."
