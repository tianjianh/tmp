A crossing patrol officer in Gwynedd has been issued with a body camera in a bid to cut down bad driving outside a school.

Gwynedd council claimed the pilot project in Bangor was the first of its kind in Wales.
Lollipop man Arwel Owen said he has already ended up on the bonnet of a car outside Ysgol Garnedd primary school.
"It's getting worse - there are a lot more cars and they are getting faster," he said.
Gwynedd council said the move was a joint project with police and would help provide evidence if motorists near the school in the busy Penrhosgarnedd area of the city were driving poorly.
"The vast majority of motorists respect the important work the school crossing patrol do helping pupils to walk to school and home at the end of the day," said cabinet member Dafydd Meurig.
"But in some circumstances, there may be the occasional motorist who isn't thinking and ignoring the school crossing patrol when they stepped out into the road to assist children."
The road outside the school is one of the busiest routes into the city and close to the main hospital.
Head teacher Llion Williams said there had been concerns about drivers "for some time".
"We welcome the new camera being able to record any case of drivers ignoring the highway code," he said.
Lollipop man Mr Owen said the body camera had already helped slow vehicles down.
"It's very dangerous here," he told BBC Wales' Newyddion 9.
"I've been really close to cars and I've had to hold on to children to stop them going, because the car isn't stopping.
"I've been on the bonnet of a car once... others have hit my coat."
Insp Dave Cust from North Wales Police's road traffic unit added: "Those who are willing to risk their lives and those of others are not welcome on our roads.
"If people know that there is a much higher chance of being prosecuted and risk losing their license, then they might think twice about these offences."
