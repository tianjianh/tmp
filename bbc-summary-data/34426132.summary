Corporation tax: Treasury may have over-estimated NI cut cost by £133m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Treasury could have "over-estimated" the cost to Northern Ireland of cutting corporation tax by as much as £133m, a campaign group has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stormont has the potential to introduce a 12.5% rate - in line with Ireland - from 2017.
It is seeking to attract thousands of new jobs from overseas firms.
The Treasury has previously calculated the cost to the block grant at £325m, annually, by 2020.
But Grow NI, a lobby group in favour of the tax cut, believes the cost "may be closer to £192m".
It says its estimate is based on an analysis of newly-released 2014/15 Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs figures.
Corporation tax is the tax companies pay on their profits.
The current UK rate is 20%, but it will fall to 19% in 2017.
An even lower corporation tax rate locally would mean less revenue for the Treasury.
Under rules, Stormont has to surrender a slice of its block to make up for that - this is where the calculation comes in.
Corporation tax powers were devolved to Stormont earlier this year.
But a clause was built in meaning it can only implement a cut from 2017, provided it resolves the dispute over implementing welfare reform and other budgetary issues.
