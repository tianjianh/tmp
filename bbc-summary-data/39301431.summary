It's a far cry from some of his previous work, which include Romeo in Sir Kenneth Branagh's stage production of Romeo and Juliet.
Fox, 27, comes from an acting dynasty that includes his sister Emilia and father Edward.
"To borrow Dennis's catchphrase, 'This is going to be BLAM!"' he said.
The actor, who will make his Dennis debut later this year, added: "As a life-long fan of Dennis, I am honoured to voice him for a new generation.
"I am so excited to be carrying on the red and black striped legacy of a character adored for his mischievousness, energy, live-in-the-moment attitude and full-on imagination."
The 52-part series, Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed, will see the 10-year-old schoolboy and his dog do their best to unhinge the adults around them, along with Dennis's life-long adversary Walter.
The show will feature CGI 3D techniques, producers said.
Dennis will still have his trademark red and black T-shirt and and spiky hair but will not have the catapult that featured in the Beano comic strip.
Previous BBC TV series starring Dennis and Gnasher, the last of which aired in 2013, showed the pair only in cartoon animation form.
Fox's other acting credits include 2014 film Pride, about gay activists who helped the miners during their 1980s strike.
He currently appearing with Tom Hollander in a West End revival of Sir Tom Stoppard's play Travesties.
