[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire enjoyed the better of the second day in the Roses match as they came close to making Lancashire follow on before closing with a lead of 189.

With just seven added to the overnight score, the Tykes totalled 308.
Lancashire then collapsed from 46-0 to 92-7 and, when Neil Wagner went to Adil Rashid's first ball, at 126-8 they were in danger of being asked to follow on.
But they rallied to reach 196, thanks to Liam Livingstone's unbeaten 60 before Yorkshire closed on 77-3.
Livingstone's 48-run ninth-wicket stand with Kyle Jarvis (33) took Lancashire past the initial follow-on avoidance target of 159.
But the Division One leaders were bowled out just four runs shy of a batting point, leaving the hosts with a 112-run first-innings lead.
Earlier, after being last out in the Tykes first innings for 45, it was the introduction of Steven Patterson that parted the Lancashire openers, Tom Smith square driving low and hard to point.
Hameed soon followed to Bresnan for 17, taken at second slip by Adam Lyth moving to his left and, three runs later, with the first ball of a new spell, Jack Brooks trapped Luke Procter lbw moving across his stumps.
Wickets continued to topple in the afternoon, Bresnan, Brooks and Patterson each claiming a second victim, until Jarvis came in to thrash 33 off 28 balls in his stand with Livingstone which took just in 6.4 overs. He was stumped after charging at Rashid, who then had last man Simon Kerrigan lbw.
Lyth dominated the final session with an unbeaten 44 in 31 overs as the Tykes built on their lead, for the loss of three wickets, two of which fell to Wagner.
Yorkshire's Steven Patterson:
"It was a good day for us in the end. We would have liked 15-29 more runs in the morning but it was good to get out there and bowling. We bowled a bit wide for 10 or so overs but then found our rhythm, applied pressure and it showed.
"I knew when I went out that I wanted a couple of wickets for 300 and it is always nice to reach a personal milestone. Now I will have to set another one, probably 350 but I will struggle to reach that this year.
"The pitch is offering plenty, if we have a strong first hour with minimal damage and can get 250 ahead with seven wickets in hand. We can then make an imposing total to put them under pressure."
Lancashire's Liam Livingstone:
"We didn't get as many runs as we would have liked but we are ready to fight on over the next couple of days.
"If we have a good morning and can bowl them out for under 200 we can chase it on the final day. We want to play a positive brand of cricket and are not scared of chasing final-day totals.
"It was a difficult day for us, but we finished it quite well and pegged it back at the end and I was very happy with my knock."
