Crawley adds to South East car charging point network

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rapid car charger has been installed by Crawley Borough Council as part of a drive to have a network of charging points across the South East.

The rapid charger is one of 25 set up across Kent, Sussex and Surrey.
It is part of a plan by public sector-led Energise Network to set up more than 150 charging points across the region by the end of the year.
The network has rapid (30 minute), fast (three to four hours) and slow (six to eight hours) chargers.
Crawley council said there were already 75 fast points in operation.
Energise Network said fast chargers included 50 this year fitted by Southern rail operator at its car parks and more installed by county councils.
Rapid chargers have also been installed at Eurotunnel.
Crawley councillor Colin Lloyd, cabinet member for environmental services and sustainability, said electric vehicle sales had soared but drivers were still put off by the lack of a proper network of charging points and the length of time cars took to charge.
The network should make owning an electric vehicle far more attractive, he said.
