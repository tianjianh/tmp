Canadian singer Michael Buble has revealed how some people walk out of his concerts because of his bad language on stage.

In a Daily Telegraph interview, the star said he regularly receives letters of complaint from fans.
"Almost every night when I'm on stage my agent will say to me: 'Well kid, 30 people wanted their money back'," the 36-year-old said.
"At first it was a real worry for my agents," he added.
"They kept saying: 'Mike, you're losing the audience'. Especially when I wasn't playing to that many people.
"I remember my American agent saying: 'Tonight it was huge, 70 people wanted their money back'.
"And I said: 'Give them their money back. I don't want them at my show. I don't want some stuck-up prudes [who] can't laugh at themselves'. Give me my kind of people and we'll be fine.
"I get letters saying: 'I really liked you, but you were crude, you were rude, you used foul language, you were suggestive'," he said.
Despite the walkouts, the singer has sold 35 million albums worldwide and is the world's most popular contemporary male vocalist.
His music career began in his teenage years, when he won a Canadian talent search and began releasing a series of independent albums.
Eventually, the youngster was spotted by music producer David Foster (Madonna, Michael Jackson, Celine Dion) and given a record deal with Reprise Records - an offshoot of Warner Brothers, originally founded by Frank Sinatra in 1960.
The pair produced his self-titled breakthrough album, which featured jazzy interpretations of songs like Van Morrison's Moondance.
Since then, he has released a new record every two years, winning several Grammy awards in the "pop vocal" category.
Last month, Buble celebrated his second number one album in the UK after his Christmas covers album topped the UK chart.
