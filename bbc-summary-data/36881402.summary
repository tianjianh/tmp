No players were on board the tour bus involved in the accident on a highway in the south-western state of Arizona.
It had been on its way to a Dallas Cowboys fan event in Las Vegas when the collision happened 48km (30 miles) north of the city of Kingman.
Officials said all four fatalities had been riding in the van.
"All on the bus came through OK with some bumps and bruises," the Associated Press news agency quoted Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple as saying.
It was not clear what caused the crash on Sunday afternoon, and investigations are under way.
After the Las Vegas stop, the bus had been due to go on to Oxnard in California for the team's training camp, AP reports.
The Dallas Cowboys topped Forbes' 2016 list as the most valuable sports team in the world, with a value of $4bn (Â£3bn).
