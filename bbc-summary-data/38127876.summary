The Met said uniformed and undercover officers will be on the streets to spot those carrying out "hostile reconnaissance" and other crimes.
The patrols will begin in Lambeth and Wandsworth "to disrupt potential terrorist activity and crime" on Monday.
The force stressed the move was "not in response to a specific threat".
Operation Servator is a tactic of policing already used by other forces including City of London and British Transport Police.
Patrols are due to be expanded across the capital in the coming months.
A spokesman said the operation was "based on extensive research into the psychology of criminals and what undermines their activities".
Specialist teams including the dogs and boat units and the territorial support unit will be on hand to support the patrols.
The move also aims to encourage local people to keep their eyes open for suspicious behaviour.
Sophie Linden, London's deputy mayor for policing and crime, said: "This tactic was endorsed by Lord Harris in his review of London's preparedness for a terror attack, commissioned by the mayor.
"Keeping Londoners safe is the mayor's top priority and we know our emergency services do a great job every single day protecting our city."
City of London Police introduced Servator tactics in February 2014 using undercover teams, CCTV and number plate recognition technology to add to the 1990s "ring of steel" in place around the Square Mile.
