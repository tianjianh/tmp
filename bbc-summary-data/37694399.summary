Two people suffered minor head injuries when part of the roof collapsed at Manchester's Victoria Station because of heavy rain.

Several panels fell to the ground at about 16:30 BST above Platforms 1 and 2.
Eye witnesses said "gallons of water" fell on people standing on a platform when the panels collapsed.
The main concourse was later also sealed off over fears other parts of the roof could collapse.
BBC North West Tonight reporter Peter Marshall said:  "Other panels are bowing under the weight of the water."
Contractors for Northern Rail are repairing the roof and services are running normally.
Jenna Barton, from Bolton, told the BBC:  "I was just at the ticket gate and then I heard a massive crack and I then just saw, like, gallons of water fall down on top of the train.
"I don't know whether people were boarding or leaving the train, but it hit quite a few people and then I saw a lady on the floor, obviously drenched from the water. She'd been hurt."
Rachel Fish from Saddleworth was waiting to board a train when the collapse happened.
She said: "People were shocked. They were stood around wondering what else was going to come down from the roof."
The two injured passengers were taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary in one ambulance.
A Northern Rail statement said: "Emergency services have attended to treat two customers with minor injuries.
"The station remains open, as do all platforms with no disruption to services."
The station reopened last year following a Â£44m upgrade, which included a new roof.
