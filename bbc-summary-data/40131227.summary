Paris climate deal: Buildings go green in defiance of US withdrawal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A green glow on the outside of US buildings usually means it's St Patrick's Day. But on Thursday night, green stood not for Irish heritage, but for the environment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As US President Trump announced he would pull the country out of the international Paris agreement on climate change, city governors and mayors responded by lighting buildings up green to symbolise that they disagreed with his decision.
The green glows were concentrated in US cities on the east coast, but some other places around the world, including Paris itself, took the symbol on too.
Further afield, buildings and monuments were lit up too.
