In the men's race, Jonathan Brownlee was third behind two Spaniards - Fernando Alarza and winner Mario Mola.
The 25-year-old defending Gold Coast champion, who has been pre-selected for Rio, finished 41 seconds behind the 1:46.28 of number one-ranked Mola, who also took the opening World Series event in Abu Dhabi in March.
Brownlee's brother Alistair, the defending Olympic champion and also pre-selected for Rio, finished 36th.
With an official announcement due in June, Jenkins and England's Commonwealth champion Stimpson are competing to join Non Stanford and Vicky Holland as Britain's female triathlon contingent in Rio this summer.
Jenkins' victory in Queensland is an important one, after Stimpson followed up her season-opening win in Abu Dhabi on 5 March with victory at a sprint-distance World Cup in Mooloolaba, Australia a week later.
Two-time world champion Jenkins is currently ranked number one in the world, two places above Stimpson but the latter is 5-2 up in head-to-head results between the pair since 2014.
On Saturday, Jenkins finished 41 seconds ahead of current world champion Jorgensen of the USA, unbeaten in World Series events since 2014, with New Zealander Andrea Hewitt another second back in third.
"I can't quite believe it," said Jenkins. "I did not have the best swim today, and then on the bike, because it was so technical, it was just as hard even if you were at the front. And I got to the run and just went for it."
Regarding Rio, she added: "The team is not announced yet but I think I have probably done enough today.
"Our team is so strong and it is so unfair that Jodie might not be going to the Games."
