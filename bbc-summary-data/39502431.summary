Dominic Hill, 32, of Luton Road, Stockport, grabbed two women, aged 22 and 24, in February last year although both managed to escape.
He pleaded guilty to two counts of kidnapping at Manchester Crown Court and given a minimum of six years.
He had been out on licence after sexually assaulting a woman in Manchester and was recalled to prison.
Hill was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life.
A 22-year-old woman was dragged from a bus stop on Reddish Road, Stockport at about 07:00 on 6 February and pushed down the side of public toilets but she managed to kick out and escape, police said.
In a separate incident on 23 February, Hill followed a 24-year-old woman before covering her mouth and pinning her to the floor. She also managed to kick out and run off.
The incidents followed a similar attack six years ago which he admitted to after a reconstruction was shown on the BBC's Crimewatch programme.
A 20-year-old woman had been on a night out with friends when she was attacked by Hill in an alley near Manchester Town Hall at about 02:00 GMT on 31 October, 2010.
CCTV footage and the reconstruction shown the following February, caused him to turn himself in.
He pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was sentenced to five years and four months but was released early on licence.
Det Con James Grundy said: "Hill is a sexual predator who forced women into secluded areas and instilled fear into them.
"Everyone has the right to go about their daily lives without fear of being attacked and we will not tolerate this.
"Thankfully Hill is now behind bars where he can't target any more women."
