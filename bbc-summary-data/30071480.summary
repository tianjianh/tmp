They were the numbers as Mary J Blige headlined 1Xtra Live.
The annual music event was held at Birmingham's NIA (National Indoor Arena) last night.
UK rap duo Krept & Conan can stake a claim for biggest cheer of the night when they were joined on stage by Chip and Wretch for the remix of Don't Waste My Time.
There were also performances from Lethal Bizzle, American rapper Rick Ross and Fuse ODG.
If you missed any of last night's action 1Xtra will be playing highlights or you can see the action on BBC iPlayer.
Here are three bits not to miss according to these fans who were in Birmingham.
Jordan, 19 (right): "Quality night, that's all I am saying. Stand out moment Krept & Conan. Man went off when they came out and Chip jump on stage."
Keegan, 18: "Boy Better Know. Grime is back that's all I am saying. It's all about the UK at the moment."
Emma, 22 (right, with friends Chelsea, 21 and Bessie, 22): "My feet hurt, we went hard, I had to take my shoes off. Fuse ODG, the thing he did with the torches. His music just makes you happy, makes you want to dance. And you don't care who's watching or who's around."
Hamza, 24 (left): "When Rick Ross came on the atmosphere just just changed. I think that was the highlight for me."
Awais, 20: "For me, it was when Fekky came out for the Don't Waste My Time remix. For the type of music I like that's the biggest track of the year. My boy missed out because I told him to get tickets and he didn't. I'm sorry for him."
