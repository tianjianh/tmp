The Channel Tunnel is running a reduced service after being shut earlier when a freight train came to a halt inside.

The train was stopped after an alarm sounded inside the 31-mile (50km) tunnel at about 08:30 BST.
Operators resumed running a reduced number of trains about 45 minutes later. They apologised for any inconvenience caused to passengers.
Eurotunnel and Eurostar customers from the UK have been warned to expect delays of about 40 to 60 minutes.
A spokesman for Eurotunnel said an "alarm in the tunnel sounded but no fault was found" when the train was checked.
"It's a moderately busy day for us and there will be delays of around 40-60 minutes for a while but we hope to be back to normal running soon," he added.
