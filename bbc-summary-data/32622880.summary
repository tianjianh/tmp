He replaces Phil Blake and is making the switch from New Zealand along with new head coach Aaron Mauger.
Coaches Geordan Murphy and Richard Blaze have extended their contracts, with all four signing three-year deals.
"Aaron knows Scott very well and comes very highly recommended as a coach," Cockerill told the club website.
"He has worked in some top-class environments and we look forward to sharing that experience and knowledge with the playing squad here."
Blake is leaving the Premiership club, who are fourth in the table and will play Wasps and leaders Northampton in their final two games of the season.
"Aaron has already had a lot of input on our plans for next season, while he has continued to work with the Crusaders in New Zealand, and we look forward to having him here as we build up to next season," added Cockerill.
"We're delighted that Richard and Geordan have agreed new contracts, because they are outstanding young coaches with a big future."
