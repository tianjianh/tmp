The 37-year-old from Nottingham, who has been crowned world champion four times, said it was a "massive honour and a big surprise".
He added: "It's fantastic for me, my sport, my city and my family."
Froch, who has not been in the ring since May 2014, said he has still not made a decision over whether he will fight again.
He told BBC Radio Nottingham: "If I do fight again it will be once only. [It will be] my swansong, my retirement fight but I need to be really up for it."
The boxer, who has won 33 of his 35 fights at super middleweight level, grew up just outside Nottingham in the village of Gedling.
It was in Nottingham that Froch won his first world title against Canadian fighter Jean Pascal, in 2008.
He unified the IBF and WBA titles against Danish fighter Mikkel Kessler, in 2013.
He later retained both of those titles in fights against George Groves, the second bout was fought at Wembley in front of a record breaking crowd of about 80,000.
His exploits and affinity to Nottingham won him the accolade of becoming an honorary freeman of of the city, in September.
