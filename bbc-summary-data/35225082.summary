South Korea have banned 2008 Olympic champion Sa Jae-Hyouk from competition for 10 years following an assault that hospitalised a fellow weightlifter.

The 30-year-old, who claimed gold in the men's 77kg class at the Beijing Games, is being questioned by police for punching Hwang Woo-Man, 21.
The Korea Weightlifting Federation said the decision to ban Sa was made "quickly" as online photos of Hwang's swollen face had "created a big stir".
Sa had hoped to compete at Rio 2016.
His attempt to defend his title at the London 2012 Olympics ended when he suffered an elbow injury during the competition.
This decade-long ban is set to end the career of one of the biggest names in South Korean weightlifting.
Reports have claimed Sa has tried to apologise to his victim and has told police he "accidentally" hit Hwang after they met up in Chuncheon near Seoul on New Year's Eve.
Although Hwang was not expected to make the Rio Olympics, he is viewed as a future medal prospect having won silver at the World Junior Championships.
