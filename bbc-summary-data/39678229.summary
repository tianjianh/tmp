A man and a 15-year-old girl have been charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice following an investigation into jury tampering.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonaade Hussain, 27, and the teenager appeared before magistrates in Leeds earlier.
The investigation relates to a "crash-for-cash" trial that resulted in four men being jailed for offences including the manslaughter of a woman aged 88.
A 28-year-old man who was also arrested remains in police custody.
The three people were initially arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to intimidate jurors and perverting the course of justice.
Betty Laird died in hospital after a car she was travelling in was hit on Old Lane, Beeston, Leeds, in 2014, in a staged "crash-for-cash" collision.
Mr Hussain, from Leeds, was remanded in custody while the girl, who cannot be named because of her age, was released on bail, West Yorkshire Police said.
