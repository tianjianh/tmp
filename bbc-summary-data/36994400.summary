Killie trailed to Louis Longridge's powerful low strike, which had put Accies ahead at the interval.
But, with the home side looking comfortable, Kris Boyd pulled Kilmarnock level with a bullet header.
And Souleymane Coulibaly came off the bench to curl in a winner for Lee Clark's side.
The result preserves their unbeaten record at New Douglas Park, which dates back to 2010.
It also gives them their first points of the campaign, in the week they lost Josh Magennis to Charlton Athletic.
They fell behind - after Boyd had missed a glorious early opportunity - when Longridge swept the ball past Jamie MacDonald from a narrow angle.
The chance looked to have gone as Alex D'Acol's effort was blocked but Greg Docherty showed good composure on the edge of the box to pick out Longridge, who fizzed the ball in at the near post.
Accies looked comfortable after making the breakthrough and if Ali Crawford had not been denied by MacDonald with a volleyed effort, the points might have been safe.
As it was, Kilmarnock took full advantage and pulled themselves level when Jordan Jones picked out Boyd with a pinpoint cross and the striker headed emphatically past Remi Matthews.
And, just a few minutes later, the visitors turned the game around completely when substitute Coulibaly turned his marker inside the box and curled a beautiful shot past the diving Matthews.
Accies may feel they were worthy of a point and should have equalised when substitute Richard Roy raced on to a long Georgios Sarris pass, but his shot was well saved by MacDonald.
And there was further misery for the home side as Crawford curled a free-kick past the keeper, but agonisingly for him, the ball ricocheted away off the post.
Hamilton player-manager Martin Canning: "I thought we were the better team from start to finish. I thought we played good football, created lots of opportunities but we didn't take them and we conceded sloppy goals and it's a bad mix.
"But it's hard to be critical of the players because for large parts of the game we were totally comfortable and very much on top. If we'd taken one of our opportunities and got the second goal I think the game would have been done.
"(Richard Roy) is through on goal and he should score and then Ali Crawford bends in the free kick but it comes back off the post. You've just got to put it down to one of those days.
"I also thought there was a potential second yellow for William Boyle. I thought there was a foul on Greg Docherty in the corner but those things maybe go against you on days like this as well."
Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark: "I think the substitutions and change of formation helped us once again and obviously it's food for thought now because that's two games in a row when we've gone with two strikers and it's been a lot more positive for us.
"Jordan Jones was outstanding. He's showed that in flashes during the course of the League Cup campaign but we need more consistency and today he's been very productive.
"Second game in, we've got three points on the board - we've won one, we've lost one - and I think our performance was probably better last week than it was today.
"But I think we're starting to improve without the ball. I felt we were quite poor at that and that's why we got hit with a couple of results like we did."
