World Cup qualifying: Pick your England starting XI

Would you include Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart - or would you bring in Mark Noble and Fraser Forster?
Is there room for Andy Carroll, or would you stick with Harry Kane? And who would man your defence?
Then there is the question of formation - would you stick with a 4-3-3 or revert to 4-4-2?
Use our team selector to pick your next England team and slot them into the formation of your choice.
And after you've done that, you can share them with your friends or post them on your social media accounts.
We will publish your most popular future England team and squad on Friday.
