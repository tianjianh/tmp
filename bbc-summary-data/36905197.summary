Mustafizur Rahman: Sussex and Bangladesh bowler out with shoulder injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bangladesh pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman will miss Sussex's remaining group matches in the T20 Blast and the One-Day Cup because of injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old is set to have a scan on a shoulder problem this week.
Mustafizur played two T20 group games for the Hove side, taking 4-23 in the win over Essex and 0-31 in the defeat by Surrey.
The left-armer may be fit to play in the knockout stages of both competitions if Sussex progress.
Sussex are currently sixth in their T20 Blast group with one group game to play, but level on points with fourth-placed Essex.
In the One-Day Cup, they have only won one game out of five so far and are bottom of their group.
