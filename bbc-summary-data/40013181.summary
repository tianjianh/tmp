Chris Turner died in April 2015 aged 64, after being diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2006.
He spent nine years as a player with Posh before winning back-to-back promotions as manager in the early 1990s.
Sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn has created a statue which will be unveiled at the club's London Road ground.
Images of the bronze statue will not be released ahead of its unveiling on 1 September.
When fundraising began in November 2015 fans said they wanted it "to have a large plinth, all lit up and covered in granite and very tall, because Chris Turner was a very tall man".
They also hoped it would depict Turner's face as it was "when we won at Wembley, absolutely laughing his head off and having the time of his life".
The original fundraising target of £80,000 has been passed and the total stands at just over £100,000.
The surplus will pay for landscaping the area around the club's North Stand where the statue will be placed, and its maintenance.
Turner was a defender with Peterborough United from 1969-1977, and later played for Luton, Cambridge United, Swindon and Southend before retiring in 1984 and going on to manage both Cambridge and Peterborough.
Before his death, Turner's wife Lynne said doctors told her his dementia was "caused by heading too many balls".
