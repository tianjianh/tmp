The 19-year-old joins the Tynesiders, who are fifth in the table and within the play-off spots.
Green has made just two league appearances for Pools since coming into the first-team squad in 2014, with one appearance this season.
His two other appearances this term have come in EFL Trophy fixtures against Notts County and Sunderland.
Gateshead have given Green the number 26 shirt and he could make his debut against Eastleigh on Saturday.
