A 31-year-old man has been found guilty of murdering another man, who was knifed through the heart in Conwy county.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Cody was warned by a judge he will be jailed for life for killing David Kingsbury, 35, in Old Colwyn on 5 January.
A jury took three hours to find him guilty at Caernarfon Crown Court.
Thomas Revatto, 50, of Colwyn Bay, was also convicted of helping an offender.
The court heard he had removed a Vauxhall Corsa that Cody had travelled in.
He was remanded in custody for sentencing on Friday with two other men who helped Cody.
Susannah Buckley, 40, formerly of Colwyn Bay, was cleared of assisting an offender and freed from the dock.
Mr Justice Griffith-Williams told the court: "There is only one sentence for murder and that is life imprisonment."
On Thursday, he will fix the minimum term Cody must serve before he can be considered for parole.
"It will obviously be a long time," he added.
After he died, Mr Kingsbury's family said he was "a very loving, affectionate son, brother and uncle with a good heart".
"We all loved him to bits and will miss his happy, easy going nature, his infectious smile and sense of humour," they added in a statement.
