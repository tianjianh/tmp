The song United We Stand brings together Ladysmith Black Mambazo from South Africa and Malian singer Salif Keita.

At least seven people have died over a month of attacks on foreigners and foreign-owned property in South Africa.
African news at it happens: 1 May 2015
Ladysmith Black Mambazo singer Sibongiseni Shabalala told the BBC he was trying to send the message that "Africa is for all of us".
"You can't say you don't like the foreigners to stay in your country. This is not your country, this is our country.
"We are saying people should unite. If there's problems, people should sit down and talk.
"One day your child will want to go and live in Mali, Nigeria or Ghana but because of your decision today it will be very difficult for your future generation to be able to do the same."
The song is playing on South African radio from Friday, will be premiered on TV on Friday evening and will be released on iTunes on Monday.
