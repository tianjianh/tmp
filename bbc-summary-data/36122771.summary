[SN]TITLE[SN]
Manchester United 1-1 Leicester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City moved to within two points of the Premier League title after holding Manchester United to a draw at Old Trafford - and will clinch it on Monday if Tottenham fail to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

The Foxes recovered well from a shaky start, during which they went behind after eight minutes when Anthony Martial drilled home a near-post finish from Antonio Valencia's cross.
Claudio Ranieri's side demonstrated the strength of purpose that has become their trademark this season when captain Wes Morgan outmuscled United's defenders to head the equaliser past David de Gea nine minutes later.
Both sides had penalty appeals turned down when United's Marcos Rojo blocked off Riyad Mahrez and when Leicester's Danny Drinkwater was sent off late on after receiving a second yellow card for dragging back Memphis Depay, with referee Michael Oliver ruling it was right on the edge of the area.
Leicester's supporters celebrated long and loud after the final whistle but this was a blow to United's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League as they now stand four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with only three games left.
Leicester City did not quite complete the formalities of the greatest story the Premier League has ever told - but it surely will not be long before they can officially celebrate this spectacular triumph.
Thousands of visiting fans stayed behind well after the final whistle at Old Trafford in a demonstration of sheer elation as this dream journey towards a first top-flight crown reaches its conclusion.
Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal gave his counterpart Ranieri a warm, almost congratulatory, greeting at the final whistle, while those home fans still inside the stadium rose to applaud Leicester's players as they made their way to the dressing room.
It was another sign of the wave of goodwill that has accompanied Ranieri and his players on this momentous journey.
The scenery now shifts to Stamford Bridge on Monday night, where the title will be Leicester's if Spurs do not beat Chelsea. Viewers can watch highlights of that game on a special Match of the Day programme on BBC One at 22:55 BST (23:25 in Northern Ireland).
And even if Spurs do beat Chelsea, a victory at home to Everton will seal the deal next Saturday.

Leicester have answered every question put in front of them this season - and so it was again when Martial put United ahead and the Foxes were on the rack.
Keeper Kasper Schmeichel kept Leicester in it with a fine save from Jesse Lingard before Morgan equalised.
This Leicester City side is built on solid foundations of character and resilience as well as ability and it served them well here. Many might have crumbled in the face of that early United surge - not the Foxes.
They grew into the game, matched United and proved once again they will be worthy Premier League champions.
Marouane Fellaini's use of his elbows has characterised his career in England, both at Everton and now at Manchester United - and he shows no signs of curbing his excesses.

The Belgian's wild swinging elbow that caught Robert Huth on the jaw in the first half at Old Trafford went unseen and unpunished by referee Michael Oliver and will surely attract the attention of the Football Association.
Fellaini's mitigating circumstance will be that Huth pulled at his hair in an act of provocation.
This was clearly true but there can be no excuse for Fellaini's reaction, which would surely have brought a red card from referee Oliver had he been seen.
In the light of Tottenham's Dele Alli receiving a three-match ban for his punch on West Bromwich Albion's Claudio Yacob, it is hard to see Fellaini escaping similar sanction. The consolation will be that any suspension will cover three league games and leave him available for the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace.
If Tottenham fail to win at Chelsea on Monday, then Leicester will be crowned Premier League champions.
Otherwise, Ranieri's side - 5,000-1 outsiders at the start of the season - will have the chance to seal the title in front of their own fans when they play Everton next Saturday (17:30 BST).
United travel to struggling Norwich next Saturday (12:45 BST) as they look to boost their slim Champions League hopes.
