Sir David Murray's son leaves MIH board

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sir David Murray's son and business heir has quit the board of Murray International Holdings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Douglas Murray is to focus his attention instead on family investments, from vineyards to bus manufacturing.
The move appears to end plans for the metals-to-property company to remain at the heart of family investments.
With large debts owed to Lloyds Banking Group, Sir David has had to sell Rangers football club.
He is also off-loading property from his extensive portfolio and he said earlier this year that the metals business is up for sale, in parts or as a whole.
Part of that sale could be to a new firm. BBC Scotland can reveal the setting up of such a shell company, Murray Metals Ltd, with Sir David as a director.
It had a name change last month from Jackdaw Acquisitions 1, and has had a capital injection of Â£100,000.
Jackdaw was one of two shell companies set up by Sir David earlier this year.
While Sir David was not available for comment, a source close to Murray International Holdings said of the resignation of David Murray Jr: "Murray Metals Ltd is part of the family set-up. It's nothing to do with Murray International Holdings".
This is despite Graeme Hill, managing director of MIH metals division, becoming a director of Murray Metals Ltd in May. David Douglas Murray is also a director.
In March, Graeme Hill was one of two directors to quit the board of Murray International Holdings, while retaining executive posts.
Donald Wilson left the board and remains managing director of oil and gas.
