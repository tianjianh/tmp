Conservative party names Geoff Gollop as Bristol mayor candidate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol's Conservative party has chosen its candidate for the city's mayoral election taking place in November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Westbury-on-Trym Councillor Geoff Gollop has been nominated as the chosen candidate following a vote by party members at a private meeting.
Mr Gollop is a former lord mayor of the city - a ceremonial post which does not carry direct power, unlike the role of elected mayor.
He said: "I'm very positive about the campaign ahead".
He added: "Bristolians want people who can speak up for the city and I believe I can do that."
Mr Gollop said he was aware that the role of elected mayor is different to that of lord mayor.
He said: "Lord mayor is a wonderful ceremonial role, but the elected mayor is the one who actually has ultimate responsibility for running the city and delivering its services, and there's a need for absolute change in the way we do things.
"This is a wonderful opportunity for the city, and I hope we grab it with both hands."
Mr Gollop said the three key areas he would focus on if he was elected are transport, education and inequality.
The Labour Party has previously announced Marvin Rees as its candidate, the Lib Dems named Jon Rogers and the Green Party has chosen Daniella Radice.
Bristolians voted in favour of replacing the council leader with an elected mayor in a referendum in May.
