Shahzaib Hussain died in hospital on Monday after he was struck by a car in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.
Henry Brandon Barker, 19, of Hampton Road, Failsworth, has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving.
Aaron Ward, 23, of Hattersley, has been charged with aiding and abetting a person causing death whilst uninsured.
Mr Barker has also been charged with driving without insurance, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident.
