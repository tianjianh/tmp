Airbus warns over Brexit free movement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"We are entering a dangerous phase" if Airbus cannot seamlessly move people and products around the European Union, a senior executive has warned.

Chief operating officer Tom Williams told MPs that Washington would be "delighted" if that happened.
Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury Select Committee, he added that the US would make decisions based on the benefits to US rival Boeing.
Airbus employs 6,000 people at its wings plant in Broughton, Flintshire.
Mr Williams, also president of commercial aircraft at Airbus, told the committee's inquiry into Britain leaving the EU, that he was "sceptical" that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was effective at resolving disputes.
He added that relying on WTO rules if an EU deal could not be reached was not a "sensible fallback position".
Airbus and its main rival, US aircraft giant Boeing, have been in dispute over subsidies for production and development.
Airbus had 731 net aircraft orders last year, compared to 668 for Boeing.
The prime minister said last week that no deal was better than a bad deal as the UK leaves the EU and negotiates its future relationship.
That would mean WTO rules would apply.

Treasury committee member, Conservative MP Steve Baker, who is also a chartered aerospace engineer, said it would be possible to develop a full aircraft industry in the UK.
Mr Williams suggested that would not be a successful model.
Outside north Wales, Airbus employs a further 9,000 workers across the UK.
Mr Williams said any EU deal must allow the company to move its products and workers around Europe, including at short notice and without restrictions.
The UK government has indicated it may try to make special arrangements for key sectors such as aerospace.
If free movement of labour could not be agreed, Mr Williams said the company's concern would be "does the UK not really care about Airbus in the future?"
