Josh Davey took three wickets as Canada, who sit bottom of Group B, were limited to 135-8 at Goldenacre in Edinburgh.
The Scots passed that total for the loss of only two wickets after 14.4 overs, with George Munsey, 33 not out, securing the winning runs.
Scotland lie third in the table after three wins and two defeats.
Leaders Afghanistan stumbled on Wednesday, when they lost to Oman by 40 runs.
They are now level at the top with Kenya, who defeated United Arab Emirates by 42 runs in their latest game.
In the next Group B games, Netherlands face Canada and UAE take on Oman on Friday.
Scotland next play Oman on Saturday as Afghanistan take on Canada and the Dutch face Kenya.
And the Scots go into a must-win match in good spirits after back-to-back wins.
Davey took his first wickets of the tournament and Alasdair Evans delivered figures of 25-2 from his four overs as Canada struggled to get going.
Only Navneet Dhaliwal (34 not out) and number 10 Junaid Siddiqui (28 not out off 16 balls) provided any resistance.
In reply, Coetzer and Calum MacLeod put on 45 before the latter fell for 29 from the final ball of the fifth over.
Wicketkeeper Matt Cross, Scotland's leading scorer at the Qualifier, added 21 from 20 balls before Munsey ripped into the Canada attack, reaching his 33 in just 12 balls to settle a one-sided contest.
