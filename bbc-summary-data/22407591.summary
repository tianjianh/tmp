Moeen, 25, has committed to a further five years on top of his current deal, while 29-year-old Andrew has signed up for an additional two years.
"We're now seeing the benefits of our hard work," said coach Steve Rhodes. "They are game-changing all-rounders.
"As number three, one-day opener and number one spinner, Moeen is one of the most important players on the staff."
Moeen, younger brother of former Worcestershire and Gloucestershire batsman Kadeer Ali, and cousin of ex-England fast bowler Kabir Ali, moved to New Road from Warwickshire as a teenager in 2007.
"When I first joined the club many people told me what a fantastic place New Road is to play," he said. "And they are right, so I am delighted to commit my long-term future to the county.
"The future for Worcestershire looks good and being a part of it excites me.
"I look forward to helping the club progress back to Division One and win some trophies."
Andrew, signed from his native Somerset in 2008, added: "I'm really happy to extend my stay here at Worcester, and am looking forward to the next two years.
"Hopefully, I'll play an integral part in helping the county progress during what is an exciting time, both on and off the pitch."
Both players were rested this week for Worcestershire's three-day game against Oxford MCCU in The Parks.
Skipper Daryl Mitchell (118), Matt Pardoe (89),  Neil Pinner (54 and 80), Joe Leach (55), Ben Cox (52no) and Alexei Kervezee (47) all found their touch with the bat in Worcestershire's 130-run win, while Jack Shantry's second-innings haul of 7-60 was a career-best.
After this Sunday's first YB40 game of the season at Hove, Rhodes' men return to four-day action when they start their first home County Championship game of the season against Leicestershire on Wednesday.
