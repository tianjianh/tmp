The former Lizzie McGuire star wore a pilgrim top and hat with hot pants and fishnet tights, while Jason Walsh was dressed as a Native American.
Duff tweeted that she was "so sorry" about the choice of outfit, which some found offensive.
Walsh said on Instagram that he "meant no disrespect" and apologised to anyone who was offended by what he wore.
"I only have admiration for the indigenous people of America," wrote Walsh, who wore a headdress and face paint as part of his costume. "In hindsight I would not have made that decision."
Duff added in her statement: "It was not properly thought through and I am truly, from the bottom of my heart sorry."
She currently appears in US comedy series Younger.
