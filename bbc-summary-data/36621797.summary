Tesche, 29, spent two months on loan at Birmingham at the end of the 2014-15 campaign, scoring twice in 12 matches.
The German, who joined Forest on a free transfer in 2014, made 25 appearances for the Reds last season, having broken his foot in August.
He was previously on German Bundesliga club Hamburg's books for five years.
A statement from Birmingham City said: "Blues had previously attempted to bring Tesche back at the start of last season, but were unable to do so after a change in management at his previous club, Nottingham Forest."
Birmingham finished the 2015-16 season in 10th place, 11 points off the play-off places, while Forest finished 16th, 15 points above the relegation zone.
