The fire started close to an oil tank and quickly spread to a bungalow at Kirkistown Walk in the Belvoir estate after 05:00 GMT on Tuesday.
The house was destroyed and six other properties were damaged by the blaze.
A pigeon coop in a garden of one of the houses was destroyed, killing all but a few of the birds homed inside.
Police and the fire service are investigating what caused the "severe" fire.
Alwyn Crawford, 48, who owned the pigeons, said his son Reece had saved his life after discovering the fire.
He said: "We don't know who done it or what happened, the place was ablaze when we came out.
"We were so worried about the pigeons but it happened so quick and we couldn't get near them.
"I'm a member of a pigeon club and I race them.
"I have a bad back and a bad heart, and they're just so relaxing for you to watch."
One elderly resident, Michael Hammond, had just replaced his garden after it was ruined in a wheelie bin fire last October.
It was destroyed again in Tuesday's blaze, along with his mobility scooter.
"There's nothing left, I've lost everything," he said.
"But I think we're the lucky ones because those [other] bungalows are unliveable."
