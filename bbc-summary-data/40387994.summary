[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

Queally, who guided the legendary Frankel to all 14 of his wins, produced a determined ride on the 9-2 chance.
The winner survived a stewards' inquiry into bumping in the late stages, with Tasleet second and Limato third.
The Queen left Royal Ascot without a winner this week as her horse Dartmouth finished fourth in the Hardwicke Stakes behind winner Idaho.
The David O'Meara-trained Out Do (25-1), a veteran aged eight who has needed two operations to fix a broken jaw, won the Wokingham Handicap under  Danny Tudhope.
Josephine Gordon, seeking to become the only the second female jockey to win at the meeting since Gay Kelleway 30 years ago, finished runner-up on Steady Pace.
After a thrilling finish and inquiry, The Tin Man - who had won over course and distance on British Champions Day in October - emerged winner of the Group One six-furlong sprint.
"I'm a very relieved man and I'm very grateful to The Tin Man for putting up a fantastic performance, to Tom, who gave him a great ride, and everyone back at home," said Fanshawe.
Queally, who was given a two-day ban for careless riding, said: "It's very hard to get a ride here and it's even harder to ride a winner.
"I'm riding as good now as I was then (when Frankel was racing) and I will be for a few more years."
BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght:
A fine performance this by The Tin Man, who clearly relishes the Ascot challenge.
There was argy-bargy late on as the winner interfered with the third Limato, who did the same to Tasleet, the runner-up, which didn't affect the result, but Tom Queally did receive a two-day ban.
But what a big result for Queally and for James Fanshawe.
No one doubts how good Fanshawe is, but he doesn't have as many good horses as his talents probably deserve, while Queally, forever associated with the unbeaten Frankel, hasn't seen his name up in lights so often since his retirement in 2012. It was today.
Idaho (9-2), ridden by Seamie Heffernan, was a sixth victory of the week for Aidan O'Brien as he became leading trainer for the eighth time.
Last year's winner Dartmouth, partnered by Ryan Moore, was bidding to win the race for the second year running and give Her Majesty a 24th Royal Ascot victory.
But after looking well primed turning into the straight roared on by a 70,000 crowd, he faded to finish fourth and leave trainer Sir Michael Stoute still seeking a record 76th victory at the Royal meeting.
Moore kept his cool after a slow start aboard September (11-8 favourite) to win the opening Chesham Stakes for O'Brien,
September is now the general 6-1 favourite for next year's 1000 Guineas after an impressive victory.
O'Brien, who struck 12 months ago in the Chesham with subsequent dual 2000 Guineas winner Churchill, said: "You'd be delighted with her.  She has a massive engine. She's a great traveller and quickens really well."
Moore, with six victories, finished top jockey for the seventh time in eight years and his employers Coolmore just edged out a resurgent Godolphin team as leading owners.
The 25-1 chance Snoano, bred by former champion jockey Willie Carson, won the Wolferton Handicap under jockey David Allan for trainer Tim Easterby.
Oriental Fox (10-1) followed up his victory two years ago by denying Thomas Hobson a second win of the week to land the concluding Queen Alexandra Stakes.
