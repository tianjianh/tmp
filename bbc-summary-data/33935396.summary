Britain's Jo Pavey says the prospect of being awarded a retrospective World Championship bronze medal has left her emotions "all over the place".

On Thursday it was confirmed Turkey's Elvan Abeylegesse, who won silver in the 10,000m in Osaka in 2007, is under investigation over doping allegations.
If Abeylegesse is found guilty, Pavey will be moved up from fourth place.
The 41-year-old tweeted on Friday: "My emotions are all over the place. Thank you for all the nice messages."
Last year the Devon-based distance runner won bronze in the 5,000m at the Commonwealth Games and gold in the 10,000m at the European Championships, but she has never claimed a World Championships medal.
The Turkish Athletics Federation revealed Abeylegesse is one of 28 athletes being investigated by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) after the retest of samples from the 2005 and 2007 World Championships.
Ethiopian-born Abeylegesse, 32, is still competing but has been withdrawn from this month's Worlds in Beijing.
Before Abeylegesse's name had been released, Pavey tweeted: "If reports are officially confirmed then it's bitter sweet. Lovely if I get a medal but very upsetting & frustrating to miss the moment."
In Osaka, Pavey was beaten into fourth by the American Kara Goucher, with Abeylegesse taking silver and Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia winning gold.
Goucher posted a photo of her bronze medal on Twitter and said: "Lots of rumours floating around, but nothing would make me happier than to pass this to the rightful owner, Jo Pavey."
