The former London mayor is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU in the upcoming referendum, while Lord Sugar is in favour of staying.

In the interview, he also expressed concern about US Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. "If I was an American I would be very, very worried," he said.
