Jeffrey Okafor, 24, attacked Carl Beatson Asiedu in Vauxhall in August 2009 when a late-night row escalated into violence.
The court was told he confessed to his girlfriend before fleeing to Nigeria using his brother's passport.
Mr Beatson Asiedu, who appeared in the CBBC series M.I. High, was also a part-time DJ known as DJ Charmz.
On the night he was killed he was with friends and had performed a set at the Club Life nightclub near Vauxhall station.
Outside the club he and his friends were approached by a larger group of men, which included Okafor, and an argument broke out.
The court heard it was at this time the DJ became separated from his friends and was stabbed by Okafor.
A post-mortem examination concluded the cause of Mr Beatson Asiedu's death was a single stab wound to the front of the chest.
Sarah Whitehouse QC, prosecuting, told Woolwich Crown Court: "After the attack, Jeffrey Okafor actually confessed to a girlfriend that he had stabbed Carl Beatson."
Okafor confessed in a phone call within an hour of the attack and days later he told the same woman that he had stabbed the DJ in the stomach.
She said he gave her a pair of black gloves to look after which were later passed to police.
DNA which may have come from the victim was found on one of the gloves.
The prosecution said four days later Okafor boarded a flight from Heathrow Airport to Lagos using his brother's passport.
He was extradited from Nigeria in November.
Okafor, of East Dulwich, south-east London, is due to be sentenced on Friday.
