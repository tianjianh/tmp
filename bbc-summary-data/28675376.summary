[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Briscoe, 57, was jailed in May for trying to pervert the course of justice as part of the investigation into ex-minister Chris Huhne's speeding points.
She lied to police in a statement, falsified a statement and provided a false document to an expert witness.
Her dismissal was confirmed by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office.
It said in a statement: "Miss Constance Briscoe, a recorder and fee-paid tribunal judge of the first-tier health, education and social care chamber, has been removed from judicial office without further investigation by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice following her conviction and sentence for perverting the course of justice."
The JCIO said Briscoe had not undertaken any judicial duties since her arrest in October 2012.
Briscoe, who was one of Britain's first black female judges, was convicted of three counts of intending to pervert the course of justice at the Old Bailey in May.
The conviction related to her role in liaising with the press over Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce's speeding points case.
Both Huhne and Pryce were jailed for eight months after it emerged he passed his speeding points to her. Both served two months.
Former energy secretary Huhne left Pryce in 2010 as his affair with with PR adviser Carina Trimingham was about to be exposed, ending his 26-year marriage.
The court heard Pryce had revealed the speeding points scandal to newspapers in 2011 to seek revenge.
Jurors were told that Briscoe was intent on bringing about Huhne's downfall and knew how to manipulate the criminal justice system to her advantage, misleading police in her witness statements and deliberately giving them an altered copy of one of her statements.
Jailing her, Mr Justice Baker told the mother of two that her conduct had struck "at the heart of our much-cherished system of criminal justice".
