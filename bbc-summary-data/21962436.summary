The Rolling Stones have been named as one of the three headline acts for this summer's Glastonbury Festival.

It will be the first time the band have played the event at Worthy Farm, Somerset, which takes place on the final weekend of June.
The Stones will perform on the Saturday night, with Mumford and Sons and the Arctic Monkeys the other headline acts.
Frontman Mick Jagger tweeted: "Can't wait to play Glastonbury. I have my wellies and my yurt!"
Guitarist Ronnie Wood claimed he cajoled the rest of the band into playing, saying: "I've been using all my persuasive charm on the boys for a few weeks now, really pleased to be doing it, can't wait to be getting out on that stage."
Fellow-guitarist Keith Richards added: "We all had such a ball last year, and the energy between the band is so good, we can't wait to play Glastonbury, see you on a summer's day in England."
The festival, set to be attended by 135,000 people, was not held last year because of the Olympics, and to allow the farmland to recover from the previous event.
The full line-up, announced on the official website, includes Primal Scream, Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds and Elvis Costello, with chart acts such as Professor Green and Dizzee Rascal also appearing.
Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis called it "as big a coup as we ever thought would be possible".
She said: "It is something we never thought we'd be able to pull off - a dream booking.
"We've tried or talked about getting the Rolling Stones to play Glastonbury throughout my entire life - I can't remember a year it hasn't been wished upon.
"It is such an honour to have them. I get the sense they are excited too, there's been a real buzz about it from both camps."
Surprises among the 190 acts include country star Kenny Rogers. The 74-year-old will perform on the main Pyramid Stage, which also hosts Rita Ora, Jake Bugg, Rufus Wainwright and festival veteran Billy Bragg.
Names on the Other Stage include Portishead - almost 20 years after they released their debut album Dummy - along with Smashing Pumpkins, Mercury Prize-winners Alt-J and John Lydon's band PiL. The XX, The Lumineers, Alabama Shakes and Foals are also included on the bill.
Elsewhere on the huge site will be performances by 1970s disco pioneers Chic, Tom Tom Club, hip-hop giants Public Enemy, Dinosaur Jr, The Horrors and former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr.
This year's Glastonbury is already a sell-out but there will be some resales next month.
