[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the two teenagers were assaulted at about 17:00 on Friday 3 July at the Cramond Waterfall.
After the man approached the girls and attacked them, he walked off in the direction of Cramond Beach.
It is thought the suspect is of Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi ethnicity and about 25 years old. He had a large build, short dark hair and a full beard.
He was wearing a white polo shirt, black dress trousers and black shoes.
Det Sgt David Brady from Police Scotland said: "This was a distressing experience for the young girls and we have been pursuing various lines of investigation over the past week to identify the suspect.
"However, we have so far been unable to establish who he is and I am keen to hear from anyone with information that can assist with our inquiry.
"In particular, we would like to speak with anyone who was walking between the Cramond Waterfall and Cramond Beach last Friday evening and may have seen this male."
He added: "Similarly, anyone with any further information in relation to these assaults is also asked to come forward."
