[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ilir Hasa, 24, of Denmark Villas, Hove, and Saimir Nezaj, 24, of no fixed abode, bundled their victim into a car in Prince's Terrace on 12 April.
Their victim Ardi Murataj, 20, was found safe and well.
A third man, Gazmend Mula, 29, of Temple Street, Brighton, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to kidnap at the trial in Lewes Crown Court.
Murataj - who was also known by the name of Tony Kurt - pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply.
In April Sussex Police appealed for information as to who Murataj was after CCTV showed him being kidnapped.
He eventually contacted police himself after seeing the appeals, which were in both English and Albanian.
Another man, Redon Sadria, 19, of New Steine, Brighton, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply drugs.
A date for sentencing has not been set.
