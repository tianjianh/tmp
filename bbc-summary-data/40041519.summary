[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London's FTSE 100 share index ended tantalisingly close to a record level on Thursday, but the mid-cap FTSE 250 index enjoyed the greater action.

The FTSE 100 ended the day 3 points, or 0.04%, ahead at 7,517.71 - not far from its record close of 7,522.03.
However, one of the more eye-catching performances came in the FTSE 250 from budget airline Wizz Air.
Wizz shares jumped 13.3% after reporting a 19% rise in passenger numbers and 10% increase in revenues.
The Budapest-based carrier also said it had enjoyed a strong start to the current financial year, and forecast  group net profit would be between 250m and 270m euros.
Another big mover in the FTSE 250 - but in the opposite direction - was Petrofac. Shares in the oil services company plunged almost 30% after it said it had suspended its chief operating officer amid a fraud inquiry.
Shares in Halfords added 3.2% as investors shrugged off news of lower profits at the car parts and bike retailer.
Annual profits fell 10% due to the impact of the weak pound, but revenues were up more than 7%.
The FTSE 250 finished at 19,967.58, a rise of 17 points or 0.1%.
On the currency markets, the pound was down 0.16% against the dollar at $1.2953 and fell 0.12% against the euro at 1.1551 euros.
