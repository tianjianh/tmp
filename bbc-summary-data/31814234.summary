The 51-year-old, who was appointed in January 2014, had his contract terminated with the Lions second from bottom after five defeats in six games.
Ex-Millwall striker Neil Harris will take charge for the rest of the season.
"This was a hard decision to take because we very much hoped that Ollie would prove to be the man to take us forward and on to the next level," said chairman John Berylson.
"I would like to thank him for his efforts, and in particular for keeping us in the Championship last May.
"This season, though, has proved to be an extremely challenging one and we now find ourselves facing another uphill battle to avoid relegation."
Former Queens Park Rangers, Blackpool and Crystal Palace boss Holloway took over last season following the departure of Steve Lomas.
He guided them from 21st to 19th in the table, avoiding relegation by four points.
The club made an encouraging start to this season, winning three and drawing one of their first five Championship matches, but have won just three times since October and are eight points from safety.
Harris scored 138 goals across two spells at The Den and had been coaching Millwall's Under-21 side, having returned to the south London club under Lomas in June 2013.
The 37-year-old had a brief spell in caretaker charge of the Lions after Lomas was sacked in December 2013, drawing one and losing two games.
"I am confident that Millwall fans will give him every support over the next couple of months as we strive to turn our current run of form around," Berylson added.
