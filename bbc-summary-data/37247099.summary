The 30-year-old left the Cherry and Whites earlier this summer following five years at Kingsholm, where he scored eight tries in 98 appearances.
"Dan will bring a wealth of experience in a key area for the team," Quins director of rugby John Kingston told the club website.
Harlequins have not disclosed the length of the loosehead's contract at the Twickenham Stoop.
