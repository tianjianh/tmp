Josie Cunningham: I won't be hated for free - I'm not naive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josie Cunningham says she doesn't care people call her Britain's most hated woman - because it earns her money.

She claims to have "the UK's most controversial boobs" and receives continuous online abuse.
In 2013 she appeared in The Sun boasting about her boob job courtesy of the tax payer - on the NHS.
She's also sold tickets to the birth of her daughter and said she'd have an abortion if it meant she could go in Big Brother.
Her agent, Rob Cooper, claims they usually charge "no less than a four figure sum" for access to her because they have a lot of overheads - including security.
Newsbeat filmed an unpaid interview with Josie as she prepared for a photo shoot.
We were asked not to film her new boyfriend because "there's money in exclusivity" for an interview with Andy - Josie's boyfriend.
Speaking to Newsbeat, Josie says: "Everybody just thinks I'm this fame hungry bitch but actually I'm a hard-working parent.
"I think people are slowly realising there is a game there to be played. It's a whole case of don't hate the player - hate the game."
"My career is a lot of things at the moment, I've got a couple of endorsements. I'm also constantly filming and doing TV interviews, press releases, radio interviews - so it's really exciting, who knows what tomorrow may bring."
When the subject of how much money Josie makes comes up, she quickly says "No comment" but admits to being "definitely" well paid.
Josie's team explained to Newsbeat discussions had taken place for her to enter the Celebrity Big Brother house but an agreement was never made.
"I'd make for fantastic viewing," Josie explains. "I'd well entertain the public if I was in. I think it would be Â£150,000 well spent."
Reality TV offers regularly come in for the mother-of-three but she says she won't consider leaving her children unless a guaranteed fee was agreed that could change their life.
Her agent smirked when asked if Josie had earned hundreds of thousands of pounds over the past two years but wouldn't deny it.
Josie says: "I don't really discuss finances and things because I find it a bit tacky but it is paying well and I am providing for the kids. They're spoilt rotten but that's beside the point."
Nearly 80,000 accounts follow Josie Cunningham on Twitter - something she regularly uses to criticise other people in the public eye.
She's also on the receiving end of abuse but says it doesn't bother her because she was regularly bullied in school.
"I never expected all this backlash and the reaction I did get," Josie admits.
"I thought to take this on the chin and use it to my advantage and we're still around so we must be doing something right.
"Up until the past couple months I'd say I definitely got more of a hard time. Now, there's a couple of people online I've noticed that have started to turn their opinion around. Things are looking up."
Josie says doctors had told her she had no natural breast tissue.
She had her boob job when she was 22, increasing her breast size from a 32A to a 36DD.
Doing Page 3 for The Sun was "a dream" and being a hate figure wasn't something Josie had in mind. She was hoping for the opposite.
She tells Newsbeat: "I wanted to be a role model to younger people, to anybody that didn't have a chest and was feeling like giving up on life and couldn't go on with this - maybe have difficulties going out or suffering with anxiety because of this."
Being so public about her views isn't something Josie regrets.
"All this hatred that comes with my name I'd say is worth it because I've got my name out there so much more from being hated.
"All of a sudden everybody knew my name so thanks for that - it's been great.
"It does feel amazing to be where I'm at now. I've had two years of hard work to get to this point and I'm just really excited to see what the future holds."
