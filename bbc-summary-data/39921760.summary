Glamorgan head coach Robert Croft has praised his team's resilience in finishing with four wins from eight in the One-Day Cup.

They won thrillers against Hampshire and Kent in their last two games.
"We left the competition with some respectability, I think that was crucial," Croft said.
"It is disappointing for us and the fans not to see us move forward but the way we played against Hampshire and Kent has been a show of resilience,"
Glamorgan saw their hopes of making the top three in the South group take a severe mauling with heavy defeats against Surrey,Sussex and Somerset in the space of six days.
They pipped Essex by one run but crucially lost a winnable match away to Middlesex.
That meant that high-scoring victories over Hampshire in Southampton and Kent in Swansea could not propel them into the knock-out stages.
Batsman Colin Ingram recorded his third century in four games against Kent, keeping him top of the competition's run-scorers with 564, while there were career-best performances from home-grown players Will Bragg, with 94, and David Lloyd, taking five wickets for 53 runs.
"Everyone knows what Colin has done, but the beauty is that he keeps doing it" Croft told BBC Wales Sport.
"Will Bragg coming back into the team has added steel at the top of the order, [teenager] Kiran Carlson with the bat, Marchant de Lange with the ball (taking 18 wickets.) And even with the disappointment of defeat, we're starting to get some young talent exposed to this level of competition with Kiran, Lukas Carey, Aneurin Donald, and Dave Lloyd getting five wickets after a tough time.
"As well as our senior players, we've also got some younger Welsh players also showing what they can do."
Glamorgan next face Nottinghamshire at the SSE Swalec Stadium on Friday 19 May, with fast bowler Michael Hogan expecting to recover from a shoulder problem and a badly bruised shin which saw him sit out the Kent match.
But all-rounder Graham Wagg is still not ready to make his first appearance of the season after a groin operation in April.
