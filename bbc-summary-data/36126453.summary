The Olympic bronze medallist split the strong Chinese pair of Aisen Chen, who took gold, and Qiu Bo to improve on his bronze-winning performance in Windsor, Canada a week ago.
"There are still things I have to improve, but I'm very happy with the silver medal," said 21-year-old Daley.
"It was fun to battle against Chinese divers to see who can come out on top."
He added on fina.org: "This is the last chance to compete against them before Rio. That's exciting and nice to know that going into Olympic Games I can be very close to the Chinese."
Attention now switches to the European Aquatics Championships in London next month, a key part of Daley's preparations for Rio.
"It will be a very special competition," said Daley. "I live in London, train in London. But it's going to be tough."
