Scottish Premiership ins and outs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was no tartan  to produce a record-breaking wow factor, no  dramatic late arrival.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland's summer transfer activity was , not only in terms of pound signs but in quality too.
Victor Wanyama and Gary Hooper, though, were big-money departures from Celtic, who were again the only club to pay substantial transfer fees as the champions reinvested a portion of that cash.
But there emerged some other headline-grabbing deals and intriguing arrivals into the new Scottish Premiership.
As the focus returns to the domestic scene after the international hiatus, here's a rundown of who exited and arrived at the 12 top-flight clubs.
Marquee signing: Barry Robson
Robson received rave reviews at Sheffield United after his return to Britain from Vancouver Whitecaps. Pittodrie is a romantic move for the Aberdeen-born midfielder, but will the former Scotland man's impact be limited by injuries that have already sidelined the 34-year-old at the start of the season?
Key arrival: Willo Flood
The 28-year-old Dubliner brings with him great experience, including playing alongside Robson at Celtic, Middlesbrough and Dundee United, and has already been a calming influence in the Dons' central midfield.
One that got away: Isaac Osbourne
The English midfielder rejected a new deal at Pittodrie because he wanted to be closer to his family in Birmingham. But, having failed to find a suitable club closer to home, he ended up in Glasgow with Partick Thistle.
In: , goalkeeper (Sheffield Wednesday); , midfielder (Sheffield United); , midfielder (Bolton Wanderers); , midfielder (Dundee United); , midfielder (Queen's Park); , forward (Burton Albion). Loan: , defender (Reading)
Out: , forward (St Johnstone); Mitch Megginson, forward (Dumbarton); , midfielder (Rotherham United); Gary Naysmith, defender (East Fife); , midfielder (Partick Thistle); , midfielder (Dundee); Dan Twardzik, goalkeeper (Dundee); Jordan Brown, midfielder (Peterhead); Stephen Hughes, midfielder; Scott MacAulay, goalkeeper; Zach Szemis, defender; Stuart Close, defender; Jamie Hamilton, midfielder; Michael Rose, defender. Loan: Declan McManus, forward (Alloa Athletic); Stephen O'Neill, midfielder (Peterhead); Scott Rumsby, defender (Stranraer)
Marquee signing: Derk Boerrigter
Boerrigter was Celtic's most expensive purchase during the summer and the winger has already lived up to his reputation as an exciting but injury prone talent.
Key arrival: Teemu Pukki
The Finland striker was the only major transfer deadline-day signing in Scotland. Celtic will hope he improves on a mediocre strike rate while at Schalke and proves to be the goalscorer they believe they need to replace Gary Hooper, sold to Norwich.
One that got away:
Celtic's deadline-day attempt to sign the Dutch left-back on loan collapsed because Manchester United failed in their attempt to sign Leighton Baines from Everton.
In: , defender (Wolves); , defender (Groningen, £2.6m); , midfielder (Ajax, £3m); , midfielder (Ashdod, £700,000); , forward (Vitória Guimarães, £1.5m); , forward (Schalke 04, undisclosed); Max Oberschmidt, goalkeeper (Fulham)
Out: , goalkeeper (Rochdale); , defender (Nottingham Forest, £2.5m); , defender (Wigan Athletic); , midfielder (Southampton, £12.5m); , midfielder (Barnsley); , forward (Norwich City, £5m); , forward (Ipswich Town); James Keatings, forward (Hamilton Academical); Lassad Nouioui, forward. Loan: , forward (Lierse); , midfielder (Kilmarnock); Calum McGregor, midfielder (Notts County); Mo Bangura, striker (Elfsborg). Loan ended: Miku, forward (Getafe); Lubos Kamenar, goalkeeper (Nantes); Viktor Noring, goalkeeper (Malmo); Rami Gershon, defender (Standard Liege)
Marquee signing: David Goodwillie
Goodwillie is looking to emerge from the shadow of a reputation that led to his big-money move to Blackburn Rovers but which is languishing under a cloud that resulted in a return to Tannadice on loan.
Key arrival: Andrew Robertson
Months after ending his first full season in the first-team with amateurs Queen's Park, the 19-year-old full-back has outshone any of Jackie McNamara's other summer signings to suggest he has a big future in the game.
One that got away: Jon Daly
While United were always resigned to losing top scorer Johnny Russell and at least got £750,000 from Derby County in return, the decision by captain Daly to drop two divisions, albeit for more money, and join Rangers was a sore one to accept.
In: , defender (Bristol City); , defender (Hayes & Yeading); , midfielder (Partick Thistle); , midfielder (Partick Thistle); , midfielder (Queen's Park); , defender (Queen's Park); , forward (Breda); , forward (Raith Rovers); , forward (Hayes & Yeading). Loan: , forward (Blackburn Rovers)

Loan: , forward (Kilmarnock); Luke Johnston, defender (Dunfermline Athletic); Dale Hilson, defender (Forfar Athletic); Ross Smith, defender (Stenhousemuir); Paddy Barrett, defender (Waterford United); Ryan Ferguson, midfielder (Dunfermline Athletic); Jordan Moore, forward (Dunfermline Athletic)
Marquee signing: Danny Wilson
Hearts' only summer signing squeezed through the loophole of a signing embargo because the Scotland cap's registration was switched from a loan to a permanent move from Liverpool.
Key arrival: Foundation of Hearts
The community group has become the preferred bidder and Hearts are reliant on a successful takeover being completed if they are to have their signing embargo lifted - and avoid administration becoming liquidation.
One that got away: Vladimir Romanov
Many around Tynecastle might not miss the unpredictable and eccentric former Hearts owner as a person, but they definitely lament the absence of his money after the Lithuania-based businessman's empire collapsed and brought the club down with it.
In: , defender (Liverpool, loan to permanent deal)
Out: , defender (Coventry City); , defender (Kilmarnock); , defender (St Mirren); Marius Zaliukas, defender; , defender (Hibernian); , midfielder (Houston Dynamo, loan to permanent deal); , midfielder (Sivasspor); , midfielder (Erzgebirge Aue); , midfielder (Sevastopol); , forward (Motherwell); Gordon Smith, forward (Raith Rovers). Loan ended: , forward (Liverpool)
Marquee signing: James Collins
Hibs were the biggest spenders outside of Celtic in the Scottish Premiership and will hope that their investment in the former Swindon Town striker is enough to replace top scorer Leigh Griffiths, whose form ensured a return to Wolves at the end of his loan.
Key arrival: Liam Craig
Craig had a fine season with St Johnstone and the midfielder has been the one shining light in Hibs' unconvincing start to the season.
One that got away: David Wotherspoon
Not too many around Easter Road were up in arms as Wotherspoon was released - that is until the midfielder's fine early-season form for St Johnstone.
In: , defender (Bradford City); , defender (Hearts); , defender (Manchester City, loan to permanent deal); , midfielder (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); , midfielder (St Johnstone); , forward (Kilmarnock); , forward (Swindon Town, £200,000); , forward (St Johnstone). Loan: , midfielder (Istres)
Out: Calum Antell, goalkeeper (Queen of the South);  defender (Barnet); Pa Saikou Kujabi, defender; Scott Smith, defender (Dumbarton); , midfielder (St Johnstone); , midfielder (Northampton Town); Martin Scott, midfielder (Livingston); , forward (Chesterfield); Shefki Kuqi, forward. Loan: Paul Grant, goalkeeper (Berwick Rangers); Callum Booth, defender (Raith Rovers); Bradley Donaldson, defender (Arbroath). Loan ended: , forward (Wolves); Jorge Claros, midfielder (Motagua); , midfielder (Barnsley)
Marquee signing: Ben Greenhalgh
Caley Thistle boss Terry Butcher has again plucked a host of relative unknowns from the more obscure parts of English football and Greenhalgh was the best known, not because of his on-field achievements but because he once won a TV reality show that came with it a contract with Inter Milan.
Key arrival: James Vincent
Along with on-loan Luton goalkeeper Dean Brill, midfielder Vincent, previously of Conference outfit Kidderminster Harriers, appears to be the pick of Caledonian Stadium's 2013 intake so far - purely by virtue of making the starting line-up.
One that got away: Andrew Shinnie
Midfield Shinnie made his debut in the Scotland squad just in time for Birmingham City to secure his services for this season.
In: Nick Draper, goalkeeper (Lincoln City); , defender (Macclesfield Town); Joe Gorman, defender (Crewe Alexandra); , defender (Cheltenham); , midfielder (Kidderminster Harriers); , midfielder (Ebbsfleet United); Marley Watkins, midfielder (Hereford United); Danny Williams, midfielder (Kendal Town); , midfielder (Burnley); , forward (Brighton & Hove Albion); , forward (Coleraine). Loan: , goalkeeper (Luton Town)
Out: , goalkeeper (Kilmarnock); Kenny Gillet, defender; Simon King, defender; George Brislen-Hall, defender; , midfielder (Birmingham City); , midfielder (Hibernian); Gavin Morrison, midfielder (Brora Rangers); Shane Sutherland, forward (Elgin City); Chris Hogg, defender; Simon King, defender; Jordan Gibbons, midfielder; Jason Oswell, forward; Scott Mathieson, goalkeeper; Martin Laing, midfielder; Kyle Whyte, forward; Andre Martins, midfielder. Loan ended: Charlie Taylor, defender (Leeds United); Philip Roberts, forward (Arsenal)
Marquee signing: Kris Boyd
That the Scottish Premier League's record scorer signed a new contract at Rugby Park is either a sign of a diminishing talent and standing in the game, or that he has resisted his mercenary instincts.
Key arrival: Sean Clohessy
New Kilmarnock manager Allan Johnston could have matched Caley Thistle's ability to pluck a gem from the English lower leagues by securing the 26-year-old overlapping right-back who rejected a new deal with Southend United.
One that got away: Cammy Bell
Goakeeper Bell's decision to drop two divisions and join Rangers is another sad indictment of the amount of money available for wages at any Scottish club other than Celtic or their Glasgow rivals. New arrival Craig Samson has, though, taken Bell's place in the Scotland squad.
In: , goalkeeper (St Mirren); , goalkeeper (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Conor Brennan, goalkeeper (Leicester City); , defender (Heart of Midlothian); , defender (Southend United); Ismael Bouzid, defender (Alger); Caoimhin Bonner, defender (Derry City); , midfielder (Fleetwood Town); Francisco Borja, midfielder (Alcorcon); Kyle Jacobs, midfielder (Livingston); , forward (Dundee). Loan: , midfielder (Celtic); , forward (Dundee United)
Out: , goalkeeper (Rangers); Kyle Letheren, goalkeeper (Dundee); Anssi Jaakkola, goalkeeper; Ryan O'Leary, defender (Los Angeles Blues); Garry Hay, defender (Airdrieonians); Papa Idris, defender; Ross Fisher, defender; Danny Racchi, midfielder (Valur Reyjkavic); , midfielder (Oldham Athletic); , forward (Tenerife); , forward (Apoel Nicosia); , forward (Hibernian); Mark Taylor, midfielder. Loan ended: Mahamadou Sissoko, defender (Udinese)
Marquee signing: Stephen McManus
McManus will be hoping to revive a career that blossomed at Celtic and with Scotland but stalled at Middlesbrough then went into reverse with a loan to Championship rivals Bristol City.
Key arrival: John Sutton
With Viking Stavanger forward Henri Anier only on loan until January, former Hearts striker Sutton could be shouldering the main burden of matching the scoring exploits of the departed Michael Higdon.
One that got away: Michael Higdon
Motherwell lost half a team to clubs who were able to offer higher wages than Scotland's league runners-up, but the biggest loss was SPL top scorer Higdon, now playing with Dutch outfit Nijmegen.
In: , goalkeeper (Silkeborg); , defender (Middlesbrough); , defender (Birmingham City, loan to permanent deal); , midfielder (Ross County); , midfielder (Ross County); Ben Hall, midfielder (Dungannon Swifts); , forward (Heart of Midlothian). Loan: , midfielder (Rotherham United); , forward (Viking Stavanger)
Out: , goalkeeper (Birmingham City); , defender (Ross County); Scott Stevenson, defender (St Johnstone); Nicky Devlin, defender (Stenhousemuir); Dominic Green, defender; , midfielder (Rangers); , midfielder (Preston North End); Omar Daley, midfielder (Minnesota United); Tom Hateley, midfielder; Adam Asghar, midfielder; Steven Hetherington, midfielder; Joshua Watt, midfielder; , forward (Nijmegen); , forward (Legia Warszawa). Loan: Lee Erwin, forward (Arbroath). Loan ended: , forward (Huddersfield Town)
Marquee signing: Gary Fraser
Fraser is the latest talent to be plucked from the Hamilton youth conveyor belt and, in the case of the 19-year-old midfielder, has immediately been loaned out in the hope that first-team football at Firhill will help Bolton Wanderers develop the next James McCarthy.
Key arrival: Kallum Higginbotham
With Alan Archibald staying faithful to his promotion-winning side, Higginbotham will hope to improve on his scoring rate and become a regular after loan spells with Barnsley, Carlisle United and Motherwell before his release by Huddersfield Town.
One that got away: Paul Paton
One of Jackie McNamara's first acts as Dundee United manager was to return to his former club and secure Paton and fellow midfielder Chris Erskine on pre-contract deals, with the former already establishing himself as an ever-present.
In: , goalkeeper (Ross County); , defender (Rayo Vallecano); Darren Brownlie, defender (Ayr United); , midfielder (Aberdeen); , midfielder (Dunfermline Athletic); , midfielder (Barcelona); Declan McDaid, midfielder (Morton); Dale Keenan, midfielder (East Fife); , forward (Huddersfield Town); , forward (Dundee). Loan:  defender (Liverpool); , midfielder (Bolton Wanderers)
Out: Graeme Smith, goalkeeper (Peterhead); Ludovic Roy, goalkeeper; Bryn Halliwell, goalkeeper; Craig Hinchcliffe, goalkeeper; Glen Daniels, goalkeeper; James Wightman, goalkeeper; Andy Dowie, defender (Queen of the South); Jonathan Lindsay, defender (Arbroath); Ian Maxwell, defender; Ryan McGowan, defender; Kyle Lochhead, defender; Ross McGeouch, defender; , midfielder (Dundee United); , midfielder (Dundee United); Bradley Halsman, midfielder; Jamie Campbell, midfielder; Thomas Stewart, midfielder; , forward (Wycombe Wanderers); Jordan Moffat, forward (Annan Athletic); Shaun Fraser, forward; Jordan McGrotty, forward; Aaron Sekhon, defender. Loan: Ryan Scully, goalkeeper (Dunfermline Athletic); Hugh Murray, midfielder (Dumbarton); Mark McGuigan, forward (Albion Rovers); Gerry O'Donnell, forward (Maryhill)
Marquee signing: Graham Carey
The former Republic of Ireland Under-21 midfielder was released by St Mirren amid reports that he had a transfer request rejected in January and will hope to produce more of the stunning long-range finishes that won him goal of the season last term.
Key arrival: Kevin Luckassen
Striker Luckassen might not have played a first-team game for Alkmaar, but the 20-year-old has come through the Dutch system at a top club and has already established himself in the County line-up.
One that got away: Iain Vigurs
Vigurs was the dynamic force in the Ross County midfield last season and the 25-year-old looks like justifying Motherwell's decision to secure him on a pre-contract agreement.
In: , defender (Dundee United); , defender (Motherwell); , defender (Yeovil Town); , midfielder (St Mirren); , midfielder (Excelsior Rotterdam); , midfielder (Cambuur-Leeuwarden); Marc Klok, midfielder (Utrecht); Kevin Luckassen, forward (AZ Alkmaar). Loan: , forward (Grasshoppers Zurich)
Out: , goalkeeper (Partick Thistle); Joe Malin, goalkeeper; André Hainault, defender (Aalen); Jonathan Bateson, defender; Evangelos Ikonomou, defender; Archie McPhee, defender (Nairn County); Russell Duncan, defender; Evangelos Ikonomou, defender; , midfielder (Motherwell); , midfielder (Motherwell); , midfielder (Notts County); Marc Fitzpatrick, midfielder (Morton); Archibald Macphee, midfielder; Steffen Wohlfarth, forward (Ravensburg); Marc Corcoran, forward (Stranraer); Sam Morrow, forward; Tony Dingwall, midfielder; Adam Porritt, forward. Loan ended: Martin Scott, midfielder (Hibernian)
Marquee signing: Murray Davidson
Maybe managers in England know something his Scottish admirers don't, or they just didn't like his mop of long curly hair at interview, but Davidson failed to win the move south he desired and the talismanic midfielder returned to sign a new deal at McDiarmid Park.
Key arrival: David Wotherspoon
Wotherspoon was not wanted by Hibs, but his early displays for his hometown club suggest the Perth outfit are either a better fit or more able to utilise his midfield talents.
One that got away: Liam Craig
Craig was the creative force that took St Johnstone into Europe, but Hibs offered both more money and a new challenge after five years in Perth.
In: , goalkeeper (Dundee United); Mark Hurst, goalkeeper (Livingston); , defender (Dundee); Alex Kitchen, defender (Newcastle United); , midfielder (Hibernian); , midfielder (Morecambe); Scott Brown, midfielder (Bradford City); Scott Stevenson, midfielder (Motherwell); Anthony Higgins, midfielder (Alloa Athletic); Scott-Taylor MacKenzie, midfielder (Livingston); Dwayne Coultress, midfielder (Aldershot); , forward (Aberdeen); Dylan Easton, forward (Berwick Rangers). Loan extension: , midfielder (Swansea City)
Out: Jonny Tuffey, goalkeeper (Linfield); David McCracken, defender (Falkirk); , midfielder (Hibernian); Jamie Adams, midfielder; Chris Tobin, midfielder (Brechin City); Ricky McIntosh, midfielder (Montrose); Marcus Maddison, midfielder (Gateshead); Christopher Moffat, midfielder; , forward (Cluj); , forward (Hibernian). Loan: Gareth Rodger, defender (Montrose). Loan ended: , midfielder (QPR); , midfielder (Newcastle United)
Marquee signing: Gary Harkins
St Mirren manager Danny Lennon is looking for the talented Harkins to add some penetration to the Buddies midfield but more consistently than he did with Kilmarnock and relegated Dundee.
Key arrival: Stéphane Bahoken
Lennon and the Buddies fans will hope the French-Cameroonian striker is the goalscoring cavalry riding to the rescue of their season after a poor start.
One that got away: Paul Dummett
Dummett impressed so much last season in Paisley that Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has included the 21-year-old defender in his match-day squad instead of sending him out on loan again.
In: , goalkeeper (Blackburn Rovers); , defender (Heart of Midlothian); , midfielder (Dundee); , midfielder (Hull City). Loan: , goalkeeper (Swansea City); , midfielder (Blackpool); , forward (Nice). Loan extension: , midfielder (Newcastle United).
Out: , goalkeeper (Kilmarnock); Chris Smith, goalkeeper (Stenhousemuir); Grant Adam, goalkeeper (Cowdenbeath); , defender (Dumbarton); , midfielder (Ross County); Josh McArthur, defender (Ayr United); Jon Robertson, midfielder (Cowdenbeath); Jamie McKernon, midfielder; Graeme MacGregor, midfielder; Mark Lamont, midfielder; , forward (Exeter City); , forward (Carlisle United); , forward (Morton); , forward (York City); Jack Smith, forward. Loan ended: , defender (Newcastle United); , forward (Rio Ave)
