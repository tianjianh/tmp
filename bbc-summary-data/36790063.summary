A clinical review is to be carried out into an NHS Trust after a report exposed "bullying and harassment" and "failures at multiple levels", the government has confirmed.

Labour MP Rosie Cooper called for a public inquiry after the report found "an oppressive culture" at Liverpool Community Health NHS Trust since 2011.
Health Minister Ben Gummer said NHS Improvement would examine the case.
The trust said it had acted on all the report's recommendations.
The report, published in March, found an "oppressive" culture at the trust led to poor services, bullying of staff and may even have contributed to some deaths.
One man who was suffering from lung cancer was not diagnosed for four months, it revealed.
The review was conducted by the law firm Capsticks at the request of the trust.
At Westminster Ms Cooper asked for "assurances" that "preferably a public inquiry" or "at least an independent review that includes a clinical review into patient harm associated with the leadership failings at Liverpool Community Trust between 2010 and 14" would be conducted "without further delay."
Mr Gummer said he had commissioned NHS Improvement to do a review "or at least to ensure a review happens."
He said he would ensure it was "as robust as it needs to be".
The Liverpool Community Health NHS Trust delivers community health services to about 750,000 people in Liverpool and Sefton, either in their homes or at health centres.
A trust spokesperson, said the Capsticks report found the "problems of the past" were down to a series of "poor decisions" and an "unsafe drive for savings" but it had "acted on all the report's recommendations."
They said it "turned an important corner" since changing direction two years ago.
The trust was by no means complacent about the challenges that lie ahead and the work still to do, they added.
