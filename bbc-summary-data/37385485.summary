The club apologised on Thursday after a group of fans reportedly used pepper spray on security staff as they tried to break into the away section.
Fireworks were also set off in the stadium and there were allegations of racist chanting, which Legia deny.
Uefa have also charged Dortmund for their fans' use of fireworks in the Champions League tie on Wednesday.
The governing body will hear the case on 28 September.
