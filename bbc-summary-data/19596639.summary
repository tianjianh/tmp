[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prison has been described as safe and well-run, but does not always celebrate its successes, says a report.

The Independent Monitoring Board said HMP Parc in Bridgend gave prisoners and young people the opportunity to develop skills and gain qualifications.
But it said Parc needed to make more of an effort to inform the board and local people about its "excellent projects".
HMP Parc, which is also a young offenders' institution, houses 1,038 prisoners.
It was one of the first prisons to be built under the UK government's private finance initiative.
The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) comprises of 20 volunteers from the community, appointed by the UK's Minister of Justice.
Its report said Parc prison was well-run and safe.
It added: "There is a great deal of good work going on at HMP Parc but as reported in previous years HMP Parc does not always celebrate its own successes.
"More effort is needed to inform the board and the local communities of the excellent projects going on and the effect this has on the prison population at HMP Parc."
The IMB said it was impressed by how the prison had maintained links to the community and the number of awards made to prisoners for artistic and cultural activities.
Janet Wallsgrove of G4S, which runs Parc, said: "The safety and welfare of all prisoners in our care is our top priority, and the IMB's comments are testament to the hard work and dedication of our staff, who are committed to helping every prisoner to serve their time constructively.
"G4S believes the prisons we run should be places of both punishment and rehabilitation, with prisoners given the opportunity to turn their lives around so that they are less likely to reoffend on release.
"We are proud of the successes we have had at Parc and agree with IMB that we should do as much as we can to promote these - particularly in the local community - and we look forward to working together with the IMB to make this happen."
