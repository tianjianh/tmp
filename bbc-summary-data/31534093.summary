Oscars: Radio 1's Film Critic Rhianna's predictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hollywood is getting ready for the biggest night of its year - the Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.

There are 24 award categories and, this year, performers in the four-hour ceremony will include Rita Ora, Lady Gaga and Adam Levine.
Radio 1's Film Critic, Rhianna Dhillon, has shared her predictions for the top categories with Newsbeat.
But, as well as who she THINKS will get an award, she also revealed who she WANTS to get one.
I think Boyhood will win, not necessarily because it's the best film but because there has been SO much campaigning around it. I think the dedication of everyone involved (12 years!!) will resonate with voters.
Seeing a fantastically, well-made film is not rare at the Oscars but watching actors grow up and mature before your eyes is such a unique experience and that is what makes Boyhood stand out.
I want Whiplash to win. I wasn't expecting a tense thriller about a jazz drummer but that's what I got.
Again I think it will be Richard Linklater.
Boyhood is not the most action heavy film but it's beautifully shot and captures moments that almost everyone can empathise with. It's got the awkwardness of growing, embarrassing parents, falling in and out of love. It's such a natural story.
I want it to go to Birdman. Alejandro G. IÃ±Ã¡rritu should get it for his unnerving and excellent 'all shot in one take' experience.
I reckon Eddie Redmayne will probably take home a little golden man in this one. Mainly because he's just so transformative in the Theory of Everything. His performance goes so much further than just a good impression of Stephen Hawking.
It would have been easy to make the film sad or depressing but he makes it an inspirational and uplifting watch.
It's what I want to happen as well! Eddie's performance is stand-out and he deserves the award.
Julianne Moore has given two stunning performances, for Maps to the Stars and Still Alice. Her characters in those films are poles apart and it's incredible that someone so experienced can still surprise with her versatility.
Still Alice is a film that will stay with audiences for a very long time after they've watched it, not for the script, not even necessarily for the plot, but for Moore's acting ability.
Just because she's pulling a double during the awards season, I want Julianne to get this one.
Patricia Arquette. She's won SO MANY awards already for her role as a single mum struggling to bring up 2 children in Boyhood. It's a very human role and one that audiences can recognise.
She almost makes you forget you're watching a film because she's so natural and portrays such raw emotion in it.
I want Emma Stone to get it for Birdman. That would be brilliant because of the way her character rebelled her egotistical dad.
JK Simmons as the vicious, megalomaniacal conductor in Whiplash is such a alteration from the smaller, character roles we usually see him play.
He shows us a super-villain in an ordinary situation and it is breath-taking and gripping in equal measure. This was the role that came out of nowhere and wowed audiences. He deserves an Oscar.
If JK doesn't get it, I'll eat all the M&Ms in that picture.
The Oscars Red Carpet starts at 23:30 GMT on Sky Movies 22 February.
