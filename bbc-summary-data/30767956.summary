Keith Towler: Child abuse survivors voices heard

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The conviction of a paedophile as part of a wider operation into abuse at north Wales care homes has proved survivors have finally been heard, the children's commissioner has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-care home owner John Allen was jailed for life for sexually abusing boys between the 1960s and 1990s.
He was the first to be convicted under Operation Pallial.
Now, Keith Towler has praised Pallial for "successfully" managing a survivor-led investigation.
