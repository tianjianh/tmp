[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ayr United 0-1 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk ended a run of four games without a win with a deserved victory at Ayr United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A first-half strike from James Craigen was the difference, finishing off a free-flowing Falkirk attack.
Falkirk hit the woodwork twice in the second-half as they searched in vain for a second goal.
Ayr United played well in patches, but lacked a cutting edge, with Falkirk closing the gap on the three teams directly above them.
A hail storm created horrendous conditions for the players and fans in the early stages, but the Falkirk players soon gave their large travelling support a goal to cheer.
John Baird back-heeled into the path of James Craigen who fired a pass out wide to Aaron Muirhead. The right-back galloped up the flank before delivering a low cross right to the penalty spot, and Craigan was there to fire home first time into the bottom corner to give Falkirk the lead.
With the experienced midfield duo of Mark Kerr and John Rankin controlling the centre of the pitch Falkirk created another chance. This time the shot from Craig Sibbald was comfortably held by Ayr keeper Greg Fleming.
Ayr United had plenty of the ball but struggled to create clear-cut chances. A couple of crosses from their full-backs Nicky Devlin and Paddy Boyle flashed across goal but there were no takers.
In the second-half Falkirk twice hit the post. The first was a looping shot from John Baird, the second was a poked shot from Craigen.
There were shouts for an Ayr United penalty when David McCracken appeared to tug the jersey of Ayr sub Andy O'Connell but the referee waved away the protests.
A late cross from Devlin found Gary Harkins in the box but he failed to get a shot on target as Falkirk held out for all three points.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "I think we started the game well, we created more chances than Ayr United. We hit the inside of the post twice in the second-half.
"The last 10 minutes were always going to be hairy, Ayr throwing everything at us. But to be honest I don't remember Danny Rogers making many saves.
"I'm not saying we can win the league, I'm not saying we can't win the league either. But if we're in the play-offs the other teams there won't like facing us."
Ayr United manager Ian McCall: "I'm not sure we did enough to win but I certainly don't think we deserved to lose.
"In the second-half we penned Falkirk in for long periods. We played well ourselves and got down the sides.
"The linesman has told me he's seen it (the penalty shout), the player almost pulled off his jersey. I thought the directive at the start of the season was to clamp down on that. The referee felt that both players were pulling. To everyone in the stadium it looked like a clear penalty and we didn't get it, but that happens."
