Ulster ready for Ospreys onslaught in vital Pro12 game, says Les Kiss

Ulster's director of rugby Les Kiss says his side need to be prepared for an Ospreys onslaught in Saturday's vital Pro12 game in Swansea.

The Ospreys need a bonus-point win and for other results to go their way to clinch a place in next season's European Champions Cup.
A bonus-point win for Ulster will see Kiss' side into the Pro12 play-offs.
"I think the Ospreys will chance their hand and we need to be ready for that," said the Ulster boss.
The Welsh side have never previously failed to qualify for the top tier of European competition.
However, while Kiss is expecting the Ospreys to come out firing at the Liberty Stadium, he remains confident that Ulster are capable of securing the bonus-point victory that will secure their semi-finals berth.
"If we're smart, organised, have discipline in our game, we can deliver something that is important for us, whether it's a four-point win or a bonus-point win."
An Ulster win, without a bonus point, would mean the Scarlets could pip the Irish province for a semi-finals spot if they manage to come away from their game against Munster at Thomond Park with a maximum five-point haul.
"We may have to rely on Munster yet," accepts Kiss.
Asked about the possibility of defeat and the prospect of missing out on a semi-finals spot, Kiss said such an outcome would be "gut-wrenching".
However after seeing off Leinster last weekend, Ulster should not lack confidence going into Saturday's game.
"The result was important last weekend but the way we went about our business and the excellence of our work was there for all to see," added Kiss.
"We kept putting pressure on them and they couldn't recover. We were quick of mind and quick of tactics and we delivered.
"But the deal is not done yet. I think we've got a team that is hungry enough to do it this weekend. I just hope we've got the nous and the performance to get over the line."
