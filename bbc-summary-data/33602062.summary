The 27-year-old has signed a three-year deal at Loftus Road and becomes the club's sixth signing of the summer.
Director of football, Les Ferdinand, said the club fought off Premier League sides for the player's signature.
"He had offers to earn much more money elsewhere," said Ferdinand.
"He's chosen QPR because he feels he can progress here as a player and that's fantastic."
Chery scored 15 goals in 34 appearances in the Eredivisie last season.
"Playing in England has always been a dream of mine," he said.
