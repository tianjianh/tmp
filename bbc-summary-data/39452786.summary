Mike Hall was competing in the Indian Pacific Wheel Race when he was involved in a collision with a car on Friday.
The race began on 18 March and was due to finish on Friday. Mr Hall, from Harrogate, had been in second place.
Race organisers said his death was a "great loss to the global cycling community". The race, from Perth to Sydney, was cancelled after the crash.
ACT Policing - the community policing arm of the Australian Federal Police - and race organisers are investigating.
The crash happened on Friday morning on the Monaro Highway at Royalla, south of Canberra, in New South Wales.
Mr Hall - who won the 2012 World Cycle Race - died at the scene.
His family has been informed, police said.
The 35-year-old had been living in Monmouthshire, South Wales.
Mr Hall founded the annual Transcontinental Race - an ultra-endurance across Europe.
In 2013 and 2016 he won the Tour Divide mountain bike race in the Rocky Mountains.
In a statement ,the organisers of the 5,450km, unsupported IPWR said Mr Hall "leaves an incredible legacy".
They said he "revelled in the spirit and adventure of ultra-endurance cycling events", and praised his efforts in "both raising money and the spirits of others".
Ultra-triathlete Sean Conway said on Twitter: "Today is a very, very sad day. Cycling has lost a legend.
"Ride in Peace Mike Hall. We'll miss you so much."
A tribute ride is being planned in Sydney for Sunday.
