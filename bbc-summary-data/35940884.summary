John Hughes admits he is struggling to find replacements for Danny Williams and James Vincent, who are to join Dundee from Inverness CT next season.

Caley Thistle have approaches Partick Thistle midfield trio Stuart Bannigan, Steven Lawless and Abdul Osman.
But the Inverness manager said: "We are finding it difficult to get one or two over the line and we are finding it difficult to keep who we want to keep.
"We are busy trying to bring someone to the club."
Caley Thistle lost midfielder Nick Ross to Dundee last summer, while their former strikers, Edward Ofere and Billy McKay, now line up for Dundee United, Ryan Christie was sold to Celtic, full-back Graeme Shinnie moved to Aberdeen, while midfielder Marley Watkins joined Barnsley.
"We are going to lose Vincent and Danny Williams and it's our job to replace that," said Hughes.
"Our budget will not be right up there, we will be in the bottom two in the league.
"We have to be very shrewd in the way we spend our money."
Hughes also expects to lose Miles Storey once the striker's loan spell from Swindon Town ends this summer.
"I've never heard anything, but what will happen, just from being in the game a long while, is that Miles Storey will probably move somewhere on the back of the season he has had here," said the Caley Thistle boss.
"And that will not be his choosing. It will probably be the agent trying to cash in.
"If Miles Storey wanted to come back here for roughly the same deal then we would jump at it."
The 22-year-old striker has scored 10 goals this term and is out of contract at the end of the season.
"I haven't thought about my future to be honest," said Storey.
"To be honest, I've just been counting myself as being here and trying to embed myself in the club. I've really enjoyed it up until now.
"I've just got to help Inverness these next three league games, then after the split we will see what happens."
