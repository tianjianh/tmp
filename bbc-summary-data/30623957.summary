Call to consult business on Holyrood powers proposals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A leading Scottish business figure has called for "full and extensive" consultation over legislative proposals that would hand new powers to Holyrood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said 2014 had seen "great advances" by business.
But she warned many Smith Commission recommendations, particularly on tax, had wide implications for the sector.
Ms Cameron added it was "vitally important" business was listened to as proposals advanced towards legislation.
In a New Year message, Ms Cameron said: "An early challenge will be to secure clarity, resolution and speed on the recommendations of the Smith Commission concerning more powers for the Scottish parliament.
"Scottish businesses have been extraordinarily patient over a protracted period that has seen political attention dominated by constitutional politics.
"While the political battle raged, little attention was paid to the daily endeavours and achievements of business.
"Throughout the referendum campaign many felt that lip service was paid to the business sector. This has to change.
"We need to ensure, not just that we are creating more businesses but that we grow our medium-sized businesses into tomorrow's corporate giants."
She added: "Truly, without a thriving business sector, our chances of economic and social improvement are slim indeed.
"This needs to be recognised in the latest phase of constitutional change.
"Many of the Smith Commission recommendations - particularly on changes to rates and level of personal taxation - will have wide implications for business.
"So it is vitally important that as the proposals advance towards legislation there is full and extensive consultation with businesses and business organisations and that we are listened to.
"It is vital that changes to taxation do not prejudice the ability of Scottish companies to attract skills and talent from across the UK and overseas as well as within Scotland."
