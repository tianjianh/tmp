'Glum Pope' and other weird Trump trip moments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump is now in Brussels on the latest part of his first foreign trip as US president, having left Rome and, earlier, the Middle East.

It is a trip that has not passed without incident - many of them bizarre, and plenty of them worthy of further analysis.
Settle down as we round up the more intriguing and awkward moments of his trip so far.
Pope Francis has been mostly smiles during his time at the Vatican - but apparently not when he met President Trump.
On Wednesday, the grin belonged entirely to The Donald while the pontiff came across somewhat stony-faced.
Social media wits joked that he had just learned he would have to listen to Mr Trump confess his sins.
Other photos from the occasion however showed the pontiff looking more cheerful. And President Trump seemed to have been inspired, later tweeting that he was "more determined than ever to pursue PEACE in our world".
A zoomed out version of the same photo showing Melania and Ivanka dressed in black has meanwhile spawned comparisons with the 1960s US TV series The Addams Family
Melania in black at the Vatican. Why?
The show featured a family of macabre oddballs who believed they were normal, and was famed for its catchy finger-snapping theme song.
From the Pope to something that had the appearance of the occult.
It was a surreal sight - President Trump and his Saudi and Egyptian counterparts placing their hands on a glowing globe (they were inaugurating a centre in Riyadh aimed at combating extremist ideology).
It's the image that launched a thousand memes. And when Satanists got involved, you knew things had become especially weird.
Before leaving for Saudi Arabia, Mr Trump team had touted the speech he would give on combating radicalisation. When he left, people were speaking only about The Orb.
A White House press statement about Mr Trump's visit to Israel said he would be looking to "promote the possibility of a lasting peach".
Given that he went on to give a speech speaking about peace in the region, we're guessing the White House statement should have referred to "peace" rather than the shelf life of a particular fruit.
The eagle-eyed observers with Israeli newspaper Haaretz spotted Melania Trump swatting away her husband's hand as he reached out for her.
Watch it for yourself - has he got tired of waiting for her to take his hand, and so withdraws it? Or is Melania really swatting her husband away? And did she do it again when they both landed in Rome on Tuesday? Make up your own minds.
If you're one of those people who looks for clues into the health of the Trumps' marriage, this may provide more fodder.
When Mr Trump arrived in Brussels, he had meetings with EU and Nato leaders. He has previously talked about how Britain leaving the EU is "great" and "fantastic", and how Nato is "obsolete" (before changing his mind).
Anyone expecting him to be at his most diplomatic, then, may have been puzzled by an on-camera moment when he appeared to push the prime minister of Montengro aside at photo time - putting Donald J Trump front and centre.
Mr Trump appeared to emerge from the back, and firmly - though not violently - push aside Dusko Markovic, before the US president fixed his coat, ready for the family photo.
It didn't go down well on social media. When JK Rowling tweeted the video, calling Mr Trump "you tiny, tiny, tiny little man", she was retweeted some 43,000 times.
More work here for body language analysts.
This clip, broadcast by the White House, showed Mr Trump with Israeli officials late on Monday.
He tells them - in Israel, remember: "We just got back from the Middle East", before quickly correcting himself: "We just got back from Saudi Arabia".
You can then see Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the US, seemingly put his head in his hand, only to quickly correct his gesture and brush his hair.
Again, watch the clip and make up your own minds.
Towards the end of the long line of people whose hands the Trumps had to shake when they arrived in Israel was Oren Hazan, an MP from the ruling Likud party.
There was just one problem - he wasn't supposed to be there.
Israeli media said he pushed his way through the line of dignitaries - and he then demanded a selfie with Mr Trump.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discreetly tried to stop Mr Hazan, whose career has been hit by scandal, but failed.
"I told Trump that they say I'm the Israeli Trump, I told him how excited I was," Mr Hazan told Israel's Ynet news site.
Israeli media said his brazen move had gone down badly with senior Likud officials.
