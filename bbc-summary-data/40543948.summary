Intimate photos of rare Siberian tigers in the remote Russian far east have been released by the Land of the Leopard national park.

The tiger family are seen play-fighting, at one point seemingly posing for the camera.
There are estimated to be about 22 adult Siberian tigers and seven cubs in the park, which spans 260,000 hectares.
Poachers at one point hunted the species close to extinction but their numbers are now recovering.
The Land of the Leopard (in Russian) says the pictures, filmed by a ground-level automatic camera, are the first time the family life of the animals has been so vividly recorded.
The cameras were set up by rangers in the park to monitor the tigers and equally endangered leopards, The Siberian Times reported.
The video and still footage captures cubs rolling around in woodland, at one point being disciplined by their mother.
She has been seen before, and is known as T7F to scientists monitoring the Siberian tiger population.
She was filmed in 2014 with three cubs, two of which are now believed to have grown up and moved from Siberia into neighbouring China.
In another image one of the cubs is seen approaching the camera trap and barging into it - causing the memory card to fall out and bringing an end to the picture show.
The Land of the Leopard national park is in the south-western part of Russia's far eastern Primorsky Krai Province
