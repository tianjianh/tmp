A senior NHS manager who sent "dark and spiteful" notes to a colleague with whom he had become infatuated has been jailed for stalking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karl Perryman, 51, was head of complaints and legal services at King's Lynn's Queen Elizabeth Hospital when he wrote the letters between late 2012 and early 2013.
He told colleague Joanne O'Neill she had "slept her way to the top".
He was jailed for 14 months at Norwich Crown Court earlier.
Perryman, of Elvington, King's Lynn, was found guilty of of stalking, harassment of a work colleague and intimidating a witness, by a jury at King's Lynn Crown Court in March.
He first met Ms O'Neill - now Mrs O'Neill-Brown - when she went for what turned out to be an unsuccessful job interview at the hospital.
The jury was told Perryman later phoned her and promised to find her a role there.
She subsequently became a complaints manager at the hospital.
Perryman sent eight abusive letters after Ms O'Neill began a relationship with the hospital's deputy director of ICT, who she has since married.
In May 2013, police seized computers and evidence from his home, linking Perryman to the letters.
He was later arrested and suspended from working at the hospital.
Perryman was sentenced to 12 months in prison for stalking and two months in prison for witness intimidation to run consecutively. He has also been issued with an indefinite restraint order.
