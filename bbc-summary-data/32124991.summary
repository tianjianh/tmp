Haroon Aswat pleads guilty to US terror charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British terror suspect Haroon Aswat has pleaded guilty in New York to charges of plotting to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Aswat from Batley, West Yorkshire, is accused of conspiring with radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri to establish a camp 15 years ago.
Thought to be aged 45, paranoid schizophrenic Mr Aswat was extradited to the US last year to stand trial.
He faces up to 20 years in prison and will be sentenced on 31 July.
Mr Aswat was arrested in the UK in 2005 at the request of authorities in the US.
In 2008, he was transferred from prison to Broadmoor psychiatric hospital with paranoid schizophrenia.
He fought extradition for several years, with the European Court of Human Rights ruling in September 2013 that he could not be extradited as his mental health could deteriorate.
However, in September 2014  two High Court judges said they were satisfied he would receive satisfactory care in the US.
He lost his final legal battle when in January 2015, the European Court of Human Rights dismissed a case he brought against the government arguing his extradition rested on inadequate assurances from US officials about his treatment.
Abu Hamza was extradited from Britain to the US in 2012 and found guilty of multiple terrorism charges in May 2014.
He was sentenced to life in prison in January.
