Hundreds object to new Banstead cemetery plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 350 people have objected to revised plans for a cemetery on green belt land in Surrey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cemetery Development Services withdrew proposals for a new private cemetery off Croydon Lane, Banstead last year because of local opposition.
It has now re-submitted plans to Reigate and Banstead Borough Council for the cemetery and chapel.
The company said there was a need for a new cemetery but residents say it should not be built on green belt.
Woodmansterne Green Belt and Residents' Association is among the objectors, saying the narrow strip of green belt is that separates Banstead village from nearby "urban sprawl".
They say the cemetery would increase traffic, causing safety concerns for drivers and pedestrians, and create a precedent for further development.
Justin Smith, managing director of Cemetery Development Services, said it was difficult to find vacant land in the borough that was not green belt.
"There is only one cemetery left and that is running out of space," he said.
"We have designed about 30-40 cemeteries and the topic of traffic always comes up.
"The amount of traffic that will be going to the cemetery will be very, very small compared with the existing traffic on the road."
