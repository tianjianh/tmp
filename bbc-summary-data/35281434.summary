Mundell hails Scotland Bill powers creating 'Holyrood 2.0'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Mundell has called on parties to demonstrate how they plan to use new devolved powers he says will create "Holyrood 2.0".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Secretary of State for Scotland said new powers, in effect, created "a new Scottish Parliament".
He said parties should be "up front" about how they would use provisions contained in the Scotland Bill.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has criticised the powers transferred in the bill as not going far enough.
In a speech in Edinburgh, Mr Mundell said 2016 would be "the year of a new Scottish Parliament", thanks to "the biggest transformation of powers in the history of devolution in the UK".
He said: "With major new powers being devolved to that Parliament in the Scotland Bill - which by the time of the Scottish elections should be an Act - there will be many more decisions for which it will be responsible. Decisions that will affect the daily lives of everyone in Scotland.
"The Scottish Parliament will see a huge increase in its financial accountability to the people of Scotland. The major new powers of tax, welfare and other matters will give added weight and effectiveness to the powers it already possesses.
"So significant are the changes to its powers, and so immense the potential for their use, the Scotland Bill will create, in effect, a new Scottish Parliament. In tech-speak, you could say that this will be 'Holyrood 2.0'."
When the Scotland Bill passed through the House of Commons, David Mundell made it clear the UK government believed it fulfilled the promises of 'The Vow'.
This speech was an attempt to move the debate beyond what powers should be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood and onto how they will be used.
Arguing the next Scottish government will have considerably more power than the current one - Holyrood 2.0 - Mr Mundell believes parties should make clear what they intend to do with them if they are in power after May.
Will a future administration, for example, use its new powers to top-up welfare payments? Will it alter rates of income tax?
The SNP has consistently argued the Bill does not go far enough and the party is unlikely to change its mind. But as the Holyrood election approaches, expect to hear further questions about how the powers coming Holyrood's way will be used.
The government elected in May will have a range of new powers available to it, with the Scotland Bill expected to receive royal assent within months.
When it was first published, Ms Sturgeon said the bill "falls short in almost every area", did not "contain the full welfare powers recommended by the Smith Commission" and retained "a veto for the UK government on key policy areas".
Fellow SNP MSP Stewart Maxwell added: "It is a bit premature of David Mundell to be asking parties how they will use the powers proposed in the Scotland Bill, given that the financial arrangements underpinning them are still being negotiated.
"He seems to be putting the cart before the horse.
"The SNP has always been clear that we want to see as many new powers as possible come to Scotland's parliament, and that we will use them to the fullest - but no party in the Scottish Parliament should consent to them being devolved without a fair fiscal deal."
Mr Mundell said the Scottish government would have "unimpeded power" over income tax rates - although Finance Secretary John Swinney has already ruled out an immediate increase in rates.
Holyrood will also have "broad" authority over welfare, with the devolved administration able to vary frequency of benefit payments or make housing costs payments direct to landlords.
The parliament will also have an increased role in the licensing of onshore oil and gas extraction, and a consultative role in setting strategic priorities for bodies like Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator.
Mr Mundell said: "If anyone is of the view that things haven't really changed, they only need to look at the kinds of issues the new Scottish Parliament will be grappling with.
"The new parliament will have a very different job to do, when compared with its predecessor."
The Scottish Parliament will be dissolved on 23 March, ahead of elections on 5 May.
