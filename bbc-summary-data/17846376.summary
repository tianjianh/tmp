Slovenia country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Slovenia is a small country in Central Europe, but contains within its borders Alpine mountains, thick forests, historic cities and a short Adriatic coastline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Slovenia was the first former Yugoslav republic to join the European Union, in May 2004 - shortly after joining Nato.
Unlike Croatia or Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia was almost bloodless. The country also found the transition from a state economy to the free market easier than most.
Long regarded as one of the best-performing new EU members, Slovenia was dragged into a deep recession by the European financial crisis in 2012.
Slovenia's relations with Croatia have been strained on account of a rumbling dispute over sea and land borders dating back to the break-up of Yugoslavia.
Population 2 million
Area 20,273 sq km (7,827 sq miles)
Major language Slovene
Major religion Christianity
Life expectancy 76 years (men), 83 years (women)
Currency euro
President: Borut Pahor
The prime minister of a centre-left government between 2008-12, Borut Pahor was elected president in December 2012, beating incumbent Danilo Turk by a thumping margin of 34% of the vote.
However, the low turnout - only one in three eligible voters made it to the polls - was seen as a sign of widespread disenchantment with Slovenia's political class.
The election took place against a background of popular discontent at the centre-right government's austerity measures, with many Slovenes taking to the streets to call for the resignation of the political elite.
The role of president is largely ceremonial, but carries authority in defence and foreign affairs.
Prime minister: Miro Cerar
Miro Cerar was appointed prime minister in August 2014, after month-long coalition negotiations in the aftermath of parliamentary elections.
Originally a lawyer and an academic, he acted as a legal advisor to parliament and expressed opinions on various constitutional matters for years.
His SMC party won 34.5% of the vote and secured 36 seats in parliament as the leading faction even though it was established only a month before the elections.
Mr Cerar faced the tough task of putting the eurozone country's finances back in order after the past two governments fell after little more than a year after being hit by corruption trials and political infighting.
Slovenia's media scene is diverse and free.
The main papers are privately-owned.
The broadcasting sector is a mix of public and private ownership. Many households are connected to cable, satellite, or internet protocol TV (IPTV). There is an advanced digital terrestrial TV (DTT) network.
By the end of 2015 almost 73% of the population was online.
