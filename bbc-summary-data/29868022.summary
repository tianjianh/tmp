Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says there is emphasis on him to play Harry Kane because he is English, but stresses he will not bow to pressure.

Striker Kane, 21, has scored eight goals this season, all in cup matches.
He is yet to score, or start, in the Premier League, but could get his chance against Aston Villa on Sunday.
Asked whether there is more pressure to play Kane, Pochettino said: "Always. He is English, he is young and from the Tottenham academy so it is normal."
The Argentine coach added: "If we were in Argentina, he was an Argentine player and playing with two foreign strikers, it would always be a sensitive situation.
"We understand he is a special player for Tottenham and for our supporters.
"My decision (on team selection) is always about my analysis on the training and after to give the balance to the team and our performance."
Kane, who previously had loan spells at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester, is challenging Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor for a place in the Tottenham starting line-up.
Soldado and Adebayor have managed just two goals between them, but Pochettino feels all three play an important part at the club.
He added: "Harry is young, Roberto and Ade have a lot of experience and I think the energy Harry brings to the squad is important.
"In every competition, we need to win. And sometimes you decide to pick different players in different competitions.
"But it's true that the competition in front with Adebayor, Soldado and Harry Kane is very tough but I am very happy with Harry, I am very happy with Roberto and Ade.
"They need to improve like their team-mates but I think we are in a good way."
