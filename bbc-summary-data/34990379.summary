The passenger was treated at the scene by London Ambulance staff before he was taken "as a priority" to a hospital in central London. His condition is not known.
After the incident, witness Verity Slattery tweeted: "I feel physically sick... in utter shock and disbelief. I just hope the guy will be OK. Thoughts and prayers are with him and his family."
Commuters at the station told the BBC earlier the incident was probably a "one-off" but they would exercise more caution when using the underground.
Daniel Fajemisin-Duncan, said: "It will probably make me change the way I behave on the platform. I think [gates] on the Jubilee Line would be a good idea. It makes it a lot safer."
"When it happened we were quite shocked and appalled," said Claire Turmel, 29, who works on a nearby coffee stall. "Maybe I will stand a bit further back on the platform than usual. I think it's a one in a million."
However, others said little could be done to prevent a similar situation happening.
Sales consultant Chris Wyburd, 52, said: "It's like everything - standing in front of a zebra crossing someone might push you. Are you going to put barriers everywhere?"
Mark Young, 55, vicar at St Andrew Holborn, who has lived in the area for eight years, said: "These things happen living in a city mixed up with all sorts of people. There are bound to be people who are maybe unwell.
"They are in the midst."
Sally Keable has worked on a nearby fruit and vegetable stall for 10 years.  Asked if she would change her travel habits, she said: "You are more likely to get pushed on the tracks at Oxford Circus during the Christmas rush."
BTP confirmed a 29-year-old man from Colindale, London, is being questioned over the incident.
