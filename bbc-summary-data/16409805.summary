Plans to restore run down Oakham canal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A run down canal which runs through Rutland and Leicestershire could be restored to its former glory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Melton and Oakham Waterways Society wants to tidy up a quarter mile (400m) stretch of the canal at Oakham which is now overgrown and full of rubbish.
It then wants to restore the canal up to Melton Mowbray, where it originally ran to.
The 15-mile (24km) waterway was sold off in the 19th Century and only small sections have survived.
Ron Francis, from the Melton and Oakham Waterways Society, said: "It's beginning to look a bit like a tip with all sorts of refuse thrown in there.
"We'd like to sort it out and get rid of the debris and make it an area to be proud of."
If proposals to restore the canal at Oakham are approved by from Rutland County Council, the group said it could be restored within two years.
