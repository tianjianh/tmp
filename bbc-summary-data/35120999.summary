A panoramic camera designed by an Edinburgh firm has been selected for a mission to create digital records of dozens of at-risk heritage sites in Syria, Iraq and the Middle East.

NCTech's iSTAR camera will help conservationists keep a 360-degree visual image of the sites.
It will be used in a mission called Project Anqa.
Anqa is run by non-profit organisation CyArk and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).
The organisations will work with local experts in the Middle East to record cultural landmarks, using reality-capture technologies such as 3D laser scanning and traditional surveys.
The mission was formed after Islamic State militants targeted monuments in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra and museum artefacts in Mosul.
Ben Kacyra, president of CyArk, said: "The beloved heritage in the ancient 'cradle of civilisation' is under threat, evidenced by the destruction of landmarks at Palmyra and Mosul.
"Project Anqa needs to leverage the most cutting edge and user-friendly technology available.
"Due to the instability in the region, in many cases we may only have one shot at doing it, so we are thrilled that NCTech has joined us as a technology partner in this monumental challenge."
Neil Tocher, from NCTech, said: "When we heard about Project Anqa, we immediately recognized the synergy between the project's requirements and the core benefits of iSTAR.
"It is already used by organizations around the world, many of whom operate in hostile environments, so we're confident that it will be up to the task."
The data collected by Project Anqa at each location will generate blueprints that can be used to rebuild a site if damage or destruction occurs.
CyArk aims to digitally preserve 500 cultural heritage sites across the world within the next five years.
It has already completed 40 projects, including Pompeii, Babylon, Mount Rushmore, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Sydney Opera House and, most recently, the Tower of London.
