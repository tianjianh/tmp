Bids of £20m, £26m and £30m for the 21-year-old have been rejected and both Martinez and chairman Bill Kenwright insist the player is going nowhere.
"It is no good just to think that because you have a Champions League budget you're going to click your fingers and get anything you want," said Martinez.
"Clearly we don't work like that."

The England international asked to leave Goodison Park on Tuesday and Kenwright released a statement on Thursday which insisted Stones was not for sale.
It is understood the Premier League champions do not currently intend to make another offer for the central defender before the transfer window in England closes at 18:00 BST on Tuesday.
Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho refused to comment on Stones at a pre-match news conference before his side's game with Crystal Palace on Saturday but Martinez said Stones would feature in Saturday's 17:30 BST kick-off against Tottenham at White Hart Lane.
It has been reported that Stones - who arrived from Barnsley for £3m in February 2013, and has four years left on his contract after signing an extension in August 2014 - has been forced to move out of his home and into a hotel after being targeted by angry Everton fans.
Martinez says action needs to be taken to help talented young players in the transfer window.

"John is just another victim of this stupid system and he needs protection. All the young players that are doing well at their clubs need protection," added the Spaniard.
"I don't think it's fair that any player should have to go through that while having to perform on a football pitch.
"The football authorities need to look into it very seriously.
"We are very much aware of the security in this particular period when the transfer window is open, that we need to be more alert and help our players because it is what we are exposing our players to - those emotions. That is natural.
"It seems like money can buy anything these days and clearly what we stand for at Everton is more important values."
