[SN]TITLE[SN]
Final whistle approaches for Aberdeen stadium views

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The opportunity for members of the public to give their views on Aberdeen Football Club's new stadium plans is drawing to a close.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stadium and training facilities would be built at Kingsford, close to the Aberdeen bypass, near Westhill.
Thousands of responses have already been lodged with Aberdeen City Council.
Monday is the closing date for responses to the planning application, with councillors due to rule on the plans in the summer.
The ground would have a capacity of 20,000.
The club believes the new stadium is vital if it is to achieve a sustainable future.
However, there has been opposition to the plans, with concerns including traffic and parking issues.
