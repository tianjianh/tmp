[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 3-1 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend surged to their first home league win of the season with victory against Millwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers began the game with just one victory in their first seven outings but they roared back to winning ways with a convincing performance.
They went in front after just six minutes when Jermaine McGlashan's low left-wing cross was neatly controlled by David Mooney before the striker turned to fire home, via the aid of a deflection, from eight yards.
However, Millwall hit back to equalise in the 33rd minute when Aiden O'Brien poked the ball home from close range.
The Lions were then extremely fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men when Joe Martin somehow avoided a second yellow card for a foul on Mooney.
Millwall boss Neil Harris immediately substituted Martin but could not stop the Shrimpers regaining the lead when Stephen McLaughlin lashed home a right-footed shot in the 50th minute.
Substitute Luke O'Neill completed the scoring for the Shrimpers three minutes from time, netting from a narrow angle after Jordan Archer had parried Ben Coker's left-wing cross.
