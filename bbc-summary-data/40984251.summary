[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dumbarton 0-4 Dunfermline Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dunfermline climbed to the top of the Championship with an emphatic victory at Dumbarton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joe Cardle slotted in his eighth of the season before setting up Kallum Higginbotham to extend the Pars' lead.
Dumbarton's Craig Barr hit the crossbar with a second-half header but the Sons then had Andy Dowie sent off for two bookings.
Substitutes Nicky Clark and Andy Ryan added late goals to add gloss to the visitors' victory.
That is four wins on the bounce for Allan Johnston's men and on this form Dunfermline appear to be more than capable of sustaining a promotion challenge.
Of the six players playing in midfield or attack, only Nate Wedderburn really sits back. That security allowed Cardle, Higginbotham, Declan McManus, Dean Shiels and Callum Smith to roam forward in the first half.
Cardle converted at the back post after a messy scramble following good initial play down the right by McManus.
A superb counter-attack brought the Pars their second, as Higginbotham rolled the ball calmly into the far corner from a fairly tight angle.
Dumbarton nearly reduced the deficit, but Barr's header bounced off the woodwork after he had connected with Tom Walsh's corner.
The Sons also felt aggrieved not to be given a penalty when Ally Roy appeared to be clipped just inside the box.
Dowie was given his marching orders with 15 minutes to go, before Clark made his comeback from an ankle injury to head in David Hopkirk's cross.
Clark then back-heeled to tee up another substitute Ryan for a well-executed, low curled shot into the far left corner.
Dunfermline manager Allan Johnston: "I'm happy but I'm realistic as well because we know it's only the start of the season. We've started really strongly, we've got a really good, competitive squad and we've got people that can score goals.
"We're defending really well as well, so it's a good balance to have. We've just to make sure we keep up that kind of performance.
"I don't think we lacked confidence last season, it was a step up and it took us a bit of time to get in our stride. It's about consistency and coming to places like Dumbarton and winning. We can't take our foot off the gas."
Dumbarton manager Stevie Aitken: "We gave Dunfermline a two-goal start and you can't do that with a team of the quality of Dunfermline. There was indecision by the goalkeeper in the first one, then we gave the ball away cheaply for the second.
"Second half there was plenty of endeavour and we hit the crossbar, but it was a disappointing day.
"Danny Handling has come in and has this problem with his knee we weren't aware of. We don't know what's wrong with it, but we can't go into a game having to take a player off after 10 minutes because of a knee injury - so we'll have to get that looked at."
