Chesterfield led on 19 minutes from James O'Connor's own goal, only for another own goal, sliced in off Tom Anderson, to level it by the break.
Sam Mantom put Walsall in front before Chesterfield had Dion Donohue sent off.
But two goals in four minutes from on-loan Jordy Hiwula, who ran clear to score, and midfielder Mantom sealed victory against the 10-man Spireites.
In their first game under new boss Jon Whitney, Walsall's 10th away league win of the season moved them back to within three points of second-placed Wigan Athletic.
Mantom drilled home his first from the edge of the box on 57 minutes, before adding his second on 75 minutes when he rounded off another precise passing move.
But the celebrations turned ugly when players from both sides clashed, producing a red card for Donohue and yellows for three other players.
Walsall boss Jon Whitney told BBC WM:

"It caps off a really good week. If you think back to last Sunday when I found out after Sean's dismissal, straightaway I'm thinking: 'Right, how can I get the lads ready for this?'
"We started off just thinking about us, respecting the opposition but it was all about getting back to that early season form where we were really fluid.
"I don't think Chesterfield had enough for us, Our movement was fantastic and we came out deserved winners in the end."
