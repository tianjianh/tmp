[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colchester United 1-1 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mikael Mandron netted his first Colchester goal to rescue a point in their League Two draw with Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colchester wasted a good fourth-minute opportunity when Mandron fired over from inside the area, after exchanging passes with Drey Wright.
Stevenage's Danny Newton was denied by U's goalkeeper Sam Walker after 30 minutes while at the other end, Ryan Jackson's effort was saved by goalkeeper Joe Fryer.
Stevenage started the second half strongly and came close to scoring when Matt Godden's strike flashed inches wide of the post, after Dale Gorman had done well to set him up.
And the visitors took a 51st-minute lead when Newton hooked in from close range, after Ronnie Henry had done well in the area to pick him out.
But Colchester were level 15 minutes later through Mandron, who finished emphatically after Fryer had raced out of his goal and Wright had crossed.
Stevenage's Fraser Franks twice went close and Walker denied Ben Kennedy late on, as the spoils were shared.
