[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scarlets Samoan lock Maselino Paulino banned for Lawes 'strike'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets lock Maselino Paulino has been banned for "striking" Northampton's England lock Courtney Lawes in their European Champions Cup defeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Samoan forward was sin-binned but a disciplinary hearing has suspended Paulino for three weeks so he will miss games with Connacht and Edinburgh.
The 27-year-old's absence will be a blow for Scarlets, whose Wales lock Jake Ball is out injured.
Paulino will join a French team next season and has been linked with Lyon.
