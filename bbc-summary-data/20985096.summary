[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It's just over a century since archaeologist James Curle published the findings of excavations at Trimontium, at one time a key frontier post for the Roman army.
Now a new book, containing a series of essays and illustrations, has been published by National Museums of Scotland.
It's aimed at celebrating the discoveries Curle made, as well as outlining the development in knowledge about the site over the past century, and putting Trimontium in its wider context.
The book, A Roman Frontier Post and its People, was edited by Fraser Hunter and Lawrence Keppie.
Mr Hunter, who is principal curator, Iron Age and Roman Collections with NMS, says the Newstead site is of real importance.
He says there's a fascination with the Roman period.
"Partly it's because you have this link into this amazing empire and here you are, at Newstead, on the edge of that empire where there was interaction between the Romans and the local societies of what's now Scotland," he said.
"It's a fascinating story."
The book is designed to appeal to the general reader who has an interest in the Romans and their time in the Borders and Scotland.
