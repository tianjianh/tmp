The taxi driver, 47, was delivering aid to Syria in December 2013 when he was kidnapped and then held hostage.
A video purporting to show Mr Henning being beheaded was posted on the internet in October 2014.
In a ceremony earlier, his two children collected his honorary doctorate.
Mr Henning, from Eccles, was on his fourth mission providing humanitarian relief to the country when he was captured within minutes of arriving.
He had gone there to drive an ambulance for Rochdale Aid 4 Syria, a group which raises money on behalf of humanitarian charity Al-Fatiha Global.
University of Salford Vice Chancellor, Prof Helen Marshall, said: "The values that Alan stood for and embodied in his efforts to help the world's most vulnerable people, are the values of Salford and of our university.
"Today we celebrate Alan's work, he will be remembered with pride by all Salfordians."
Mr Henning's wife, Barbara, said: "On behalf of the family I would like to thank the University of Salford for honouring Alan in this way.
"We are extremely proud of him and hope that he will always be remembered as the kind, caring person he was, who made a decision to go and help those less fortunate, and whose life was taken because of that decision.
"We would like to express our gratitude to the staff and students at the University. Their compassion and support at the time of Alan's death was a great comfort to the family."
