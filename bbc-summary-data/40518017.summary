Work has started on the new Â£750,000 pitch at Rodney Parade, home to the Dragons and Newport RFC rugby union sides and Newport County football team.

The improvements are part of the Welsh Rugby Union's successful bid to take control of the Dragons, which came into effect on 1 July.
The work will be completed by 26 August, with a new drainage and irrigation system also installed.
Rodney Parade has regularly suffered from flooding in previous seasons.
"Flooding at Rodney Parade will be a thing of the past and the playing surface will be stable and consistent and fit for purpose," said Principality Stadium manager Mark Williams.
"We are using the same company who installed the pitch at Principality Stadium and they will also be providing training to all Rodney Parade ground staff.
"The Rodney Parade solution is similar to that which we have at Principality Stadium and to the surfaces at Liberty Stadium and Cardiff City Stadium, although it does come with its own unique and well publicised set of circumstances with, three teams sharing it throughout the season."
The Desso playmaster pitch contains a mixture of both live grass and artificial fibres.
Newport County will play only away fixtures in League Two before christening the new pitch against Chesterfield on Saturday, 26 August.
The two rugby teams will begin competitive fixtures in September.
