Ross Moriarty: Wales flanker hopes All Blacks experience bears fruit

Ross Moriarty has used his summer break to ponder the lessons of Wales' 3-0 series defeat by New Zealand in June.

The Gloucester back-rower played every minute of the series in the absence of injured Ospreys flanker Dan Lydiate.
"I've had a bit of time off and I've thought about what I have to do to compete at the highest level," he said.
"The first game was a big shock, it shows you the pace that the southern hemisphere teams - well, especially New Zealand teams - can play at."
Having started in only one of his first five international appearances, Moriarty hopes his performances in New Zealand will lead to more starts for Wales.
"The experience has made me a bit more of a mature player I think," Moriarty told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"I'll definitely be able to handle myself a lot better on the pitch with different situations and different teams I come up against so hopefully it will help.
"It was nice to get the three 80 minutes in New Zealand and hopefully I've done enough to make the coaches think when everyone is fit 'Ross, is he ready to play every game for us'."
Wales' next game is against Australia in Cardiff on 5 November.
With 2013 British and Irish Lion Lydiate on the mend after the double injury which ruled him out of the summer tour, Wales coach Warren Gatland will have more back row resources at his disposal for the autumn internationals.
But Moriarty believes the New Zealand experience will stand him in good stead when it comes to selection.
"We probably didn't achieve too much as we didn't win a game in New Zealand," he said.
"But it was obviously good on a personal level to be able to play against the All Blacks and test myself against the best and hopefully it's made me a better player."
