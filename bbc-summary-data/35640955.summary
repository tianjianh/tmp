[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Swedish doctor has been sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty of kidnapping a woman and keeping her in a bunker for six days.

Martin Peter Trenneborg had admitted kidnapping her but denied and was acquitted of rape.
He had planned to hold her captive as a girlfriend in the purpose-built bunker for years.
The 38-year-old abducted his victim after meeting her for a date in Stockholm last September.
He has been dubbed the "Swedish Fritzl", after the case of Austrian Josef Fritzl, who kept his daughter locked up in a cellar for 24 years.
Arriving at her home with champagne and gifts, and pretending to be an American, Trenneborg drugged her with Rohypnol-laced strawberries dipped in chocolate before kidnapping her.
He used two rubber masks, of a bearded man and an older woman, to conceal their identities, prosecutors said. He then put his victim in a wheelchair, took her to his car and drove her about 350 miles (560km) to his home near Kristianstad in southern Sweden.
Trenneborg held his victim in a soundproofed cell he had built at his home, where she was shackled before being permitted to leave to take a shower.
According to Swedish media, the court found insufficient evidence to prove rape, and the sentence handed down was lower than the 15-16 years sought by prosecutors.
But prosecutors are considering whether to appeal against that finding, the reports suggest.
Trenneborg must also pay 180,000 Swedish krona (Â£15,000; $21,200) in damages to the victim.
The doctor was found to have drafted a "sex contract" listing sexual acts which would reduce the amount of time his victim would have to stay in the bunker - and other actions such as escape attempts that would add time.
The document, found on his computer, required her to provide a "GFE" or "girlfriend experience", such as shaving body hair and kissing him during sex.
His crimes were found out when, six days after the kidnapping, he returned to his victim's home in Stockholm to pick up some of her belongings.
Discovering that she had been registered missing, he then forced her to attend a police station with him to tell police she was safe and well and not being coerced.
But suspecting something was amiss, the police took the woman aside. She told them what had happened and Trenneborg was arrested.
