The four-day convention in Manhattan normally attracts tens of thousands of people, many dressed as their favourite fictional characters.
Peter Capaldi has previously attended San Diego Comic Con, but his appearance this weekend will be his first at the New York event.
He will be joined by Pearl Mackie, who plays the Doctor's new companion Bill.
The show's writer Steven Moffat and actor Matt Lucas will also appear alongside the shows's stars.
Former Doctor Who star Matt Smith and his ex-castmates Jenna Coleman and Alex Kingston will take part in a separate panel called Tales from the Tardis.
New footage from the show will be screened at the event, ahead of this year's Doctor Who Christmas special and the new series set to air in 2017.
Several other TV shows will also be previewed as part of the event.
The new Doctor Who spin-off series Class, set in Shoreditch in east London, and Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, starring Lord of the Rings actor Elijah Wood, will be previewed by the BBC.
Other highlights include:
Last year's New York Comic Con attracted approximately 167,000 fans.
The event, now in its 11th year, is vying with San Diego Comic Con, which takes place in July, for the title of the world's most popular comic convention.
