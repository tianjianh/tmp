Kilmarnock's Conor Sammon looks to recreate career high

Conor Sammon hopes his return to the place where he enjoyed the best period of his career can improve his own fortunes and those of Kilmarnock.

Sammon moved back to Rugby Park on loan from Hearts on transfer deadline day.
The Irishman spent two-and-a-half years at the club previously, scoring 18 goals in 2010-11 to win a January move to Wigan, then in England's top flight.
"My last season here was probably my best as a professional footballer. That's a good omen," said Sammon, 30.
"Everything clicked into place - the style of play, the creative midfielders we had, they really helped my game, created a lot of chances and played to my strengths.
"I'm looking forward to getting to know the lads and striking up some good relationships, which will hopefully result in me getting a lot of goals between now and the end of the season.
"I'm appreciative of the opportunity to come and play here. The past couple of months have been frustrating for me so it's nice to come back to a place where I have so many fond memories and I'll look to try and add to that."
Sammon was never able to recreate that prolific scoring streak during his time in England and since moving to Hearts in the summer he has managed just one goal.
With Ian Cathro's arrival at Tynecastle, it appears he is surplus to requirements but he still has a strong belief in his own ability.
"A new manager comes in and has fresh ideas, his own style and unfortunately I didn't fit in to that so this is an opportunity to go and show what I can do and help both myself and Kilmarnock at the same time," he added.
"It's frustrating when you don't score as many goals as you would like. As a striker that's your job, you're judged on goals, I judge myself on goals.
"I'm full of confidence in my ability to come and help the team both scoring and setting up goals.
"Confidence is a huge part of a striker's game. If you're confident going out on the pitch, if you've scored in your last couple of games, you go out and play on instinct.
"I've had times when I haven't scored goals and you think about things too much, you over-analyse instead of relaxing. I'm a little bit older now. I've experienced good times, tough times so you learn how to deal with things."
Lee Clark, the Kilmarnock manager, tried to sign Sammon in the summer, but the striker chose to go to Hearts.
Knowing that Clark has belief in him too is important to the player.
"It's a bonus when you know a manager is keen on you and has been for a time," he said.
"It's up to me to repay that faith and do the business on the pitch to help the team get the results we want between now and the end of the season."
