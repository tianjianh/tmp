Samuel Eto'o: Sampdoria contact Everton over Cameroon striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Samuel Eto'o could leave Everton after he was left out of the team against West Ham in the FA Cup - amid interest from clubs including Sampdoria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Italian club have contacted Everton about the Cameroon striker, who only joined the club from Chelsea in August on a two-year deal.
Eto'o, 33, has scored three goals in 14 league appearances this season.
"A couple of clubs contacted us in the last 12 hours so I decided to leave him out," said manager Roberto Martinez.
"We will see what is best for him and us over the next few days."
Eto'o would become the second striker to depart Goodison Park this month, after Hallam Hope moved to Bury for an undisclosed fee.
The veteran striker has previously played for Real Mallorca, Barcelona, Inter Milan and Anzhi Makhachkala during a nomadic career.
