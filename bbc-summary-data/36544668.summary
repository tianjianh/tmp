EU referendum: Tories attack anti-Brexit 'scare stories'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior Conservatives have accused the Bank of England and the Treasury of "peddling phoney forecasts" to scare people into voting to stay in the EU.

Former chancellors Lord Lamont and Lord Lawson and ex-Tory leaders Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Howard said "startling dishonesty" had been displayed.
They said George Osborne's warning of spending cuts and tax rises after a Leave vote was "born of desperation".
Remain dismissed "yet more fantasy economics from the Leave campaign".
Elsewhere in the EU referendum debate:
The Leave campaign has faced a string of warnings from the government and financial bodies about the implications of a vote to leave the EU on 23 June.
The Treasury has claimed a Leave vote would tip the UK into a year-long recession, while Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said the risks of leaving "could possibly include a technical recession".
Hitting back, the four Conservatives said: "There has been startling dishonesty in the economic debate, with a woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury, and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis.
"They have been peddling phoney forecasts and scare stories to back up the attempts of David Cameron and George Osborne to frighten the electorate into voting Remain."
How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.
They said the main risk for the UK was remaining "locked to a doomed eurozone".
On Wednesday, Mr Osborne sparked anger among his Leave-backing colleagues when, alongside his Labour predecessor Alistair Darling, he said an emergency Budget would be needed if the UK voted Out.
He listed examples of the measures that could be required including hikes to income tax and cuts to the NHS, saying leaving the EU would be an "irreversible" step causing "financial instability" and leaving the UK "with no economic plan".
This prompted 65 MPs to sign a letter claiming the chancellor's position would be "untenable" if he tried to implement such measures.
In a letter to the Daily Telegraph on Thursday, the four senior Conservatives said Mr Osborne's warning was "nothing more than ludicrous scaremongering born of desperation".
They added: "No chancellor would seriously propose any such thing."
But a spokesman for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign said: "This is yet more fantasy economics from the Leave campaign.
"The reason they don't want to listen to economic experts is because they are all agreed that leaving the EU would wreck our economy and hammer family finances.
"On 23 June, we can put our faith in economic experts across the globe who believe our economy is stronger in Europe or take a leap in the dark with the Leave campaign."
