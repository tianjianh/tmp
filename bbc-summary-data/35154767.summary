Cauley Woodrow rounded the goalkeeper for Fulham's early opener before Farrend Rawson equalised following a goalmouth scramble for Rotherham.
Woodrow converted Ross McCormack's cross just before half-time, before Alex Kacaniklic slotted home right-footed after a cross from Woodrow.
McCormack fired in the fourth as Fulham moved up to 18th in the Championship.
Former Watford boss Jokanovic, who was appointed as head coach of Fulham on Sunday, was present to see his new side seal a much-needed victory.
The hosts took the lead within six minutes as Woodrow picked up the ball and beat the Rotherham back line before easily slotting home.
Rawson levelled with a powerful shot off the crossbar, capitalising on Fulham's failure to clear from inside their own box.
Woodrow netted his second of the game and Fulham continued to pressure Rotherham, who offered little in the second half, as Kacaniklic benefitted from good link-up play between McCormack and Woodrow to make it 3-1.
McCormack wrapped up all three points when he latched onto Dan Burn's header to volley the ball past Lee Camp.
Fulham interim head coach Stuart Gray:
"He (Slavisa Jokanovic) met the players an hour before kick-off and he came and introduced himself and I got two minutes with him and we'll sit down tomorrow and have a chat as well.
"I'm sure with any new manager in the stand, people are always going to say it has an effect. You cannot fault the players' application and commitment they've put in.
"I'm looking forward to working with him and I'll learn off him and hopefully he'll learn off me.
"He got Watford promoted so he knows about the Championship and obviously I'll pass on my knowledge and experience of the Championship as well.
Rotherham manager Neil Redfearn:
"When we got back to 1-1, I thought we were the better side and they looked a bit fragile. They concede a few goals at home and they looked like they were wobbling a bit. But we took our foot off the gas and full credit to them.
"I'm frustrated more than disappointed and if it had finished five each then it would have been about right. But they've got quality players that can hurt you.
"We've got ourselves out of the bottom three and we want to stay out of it and the lads need some help.
"There are players at other Championship clubs that could make us better. We know where we want to strengthen and we've got our targets in place."
