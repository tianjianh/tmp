Meteorologists say a cold front will reach Scotland and Northern Ireland on Wednesday and hit the rest of the UK on Thursday, causing temperatures to fall.
The BBC weather centre said showers could turn to snow later in the week, but it was too early to say where this was likely to happen.
The Met Office has issued a weather warning for snow from Wednesday.
The yellow "be aware" warning initially covers Northern Ireland and much of Scotland, before being extended on Thursday to cover the whole of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, South-West England and east coast as far south as The Wash.
Temperatures across the UK are currently above average for January, with some areas even reaching 10C and above.
However, the weather front is heading to the UK from the north-west.
BBC Weather presenter Carol Kirkwood said "almost anywhere" could see some snow by the end of the week.
She said the areas most likely to see snow were northern Scotland, parts of north-west England, north Wales and parts of south-west England.
Charles Powell, from the BBC weather centre, said if there were rain showers on Thursday and Friday "there is likely to be some snow".
The Met Office said: "Friday and Saturday will see sunshine and snow showers across Britain, the showers probably heaviest and most frequent in the north and north-west.
"It'll be cold and windy with coastal gales, and frost is likely overnight."
It comes as icy temperatures across Europe have left more than 20 people dead, with snow blanketing even the Greek islands and southern Italy.
At least 10 people died of cold in Poland. Meanwhile, temperatures in Russia have plunged to -30C.
The BBC weather centre said the weather front heading for the UK was different from the one hitting Europe.
