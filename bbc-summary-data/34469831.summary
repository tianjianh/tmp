The NFL has approved a resolution to play regular-season games overseas until 2025.

Regular-season American football fixtures have been played in London since 2007, with three now taking place each year, and the NFL wants to play in other countries as well as the UK.
"This marks an important step in our international growth," said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.
On Sunday, the New York Jets beat the Miami Dolphins 27-14 at Wembley.
The 2016 schedule of international fixtures will be announced later in 2015, with other countries in contention to host the NFL.
Earlier this year, the NFL signed a 10-year partnership with Tottenham Hotspur to play two games a season at Spurs' new stadium, which is due to open in 2018.
In a statement, the NFL also said that Wembley was "expected to host games in future seasons".
"Fans in the UK have responded incredibly well to the regular-season games we have played in London since 2007," added Goodell.
"They have demanded more NFL games, and we have worked to accommodate them. We think it's time to expand our international series to other countries and respond to the growing interest in our game not only in the UK, but elsewhere around the world."
A total of 12 regular-season games have been played at Wembley, with two more to come this season - the Buffalo Bills v the Jacksonville Jaguars on 25 October and the Detroit Lions v the Kansas City Chiefs on 1 November.
