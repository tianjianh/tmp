The sudden death shootout was won by Alfie Stirling, of the Green Party, who was the only penalty taker to put the ball past the goalkeeper.
His prize was 60 seconds on the PA system to address the crowd.
The contest also featured Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and UKIP candidates in the Lewes constituency.
Club director Stuart Fuller said each of the candidates took two penalties but Mr Stirling was the only one who managed to score.
"There were plenty of cheers and jeers when the penalties went by," he added.
When he was asked how well the fans had taken the 60-second political broadcast. Mr Fuller said: "There was a bit of heckling but nothing serious, it seemed well received."
The candidates were introduced to the crowd at the Dripping Pan stadium before the shootout at half-time in the Ryman League match.
"We thought that a 'first past the post' system such as this would be more familiar to them," said Kevin Miller, the club's commercial manager, before the match.
