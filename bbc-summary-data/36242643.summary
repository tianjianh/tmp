Darren Sarll will continue as Stevenage manager next season alongside advisor Glenn Roeder, the club has confirmed.

The League Two side put former first-team coach Sarll in caretaker charge at the start of February, following the sacking of Teddy Sheringham.
Roeder, an ex-Newcastle and West Ham boss, joined Sarll six weeks later.
"The decision was made at the end of last week but we wanted to finish the last game before announcing our plans," said chairman Phil Wallace.
"Glenn and Darren have proved to be an inspiring combination and the way we have finished the end of the season bodes well if we can add some goals to the squad."
Stevenage ended the season on a five-game unbeaten run, finishing 18th, one place higher than they were following Sheringham's departure.
