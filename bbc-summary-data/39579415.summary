[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents at a Flintshire care home are being moved to "safe and secure surroundings" by council officials after "poor standards" were found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a critical inspection at Allerton Lodge Care Home in Brynford, near Holywell, by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate for Wales.
Flintshire council said it was moving all 15 residents out as the home had not made enough progress since the CSSIW report.
The home owner has declined to comment.
The CSSIW inspection found one resident had not received prescribed medication for 17 days and another was seen crying because she was so hungry.
A council spokesman said: "The home has been given every opportunity and support.
"A decision has been made to withdraw the contract with immediate effect and move all residents to safe and secure surroundings as a matter of urgency.
"The council will not tolerate poor standards of care and has acted promptly."
The spokesman added: "Over recent months we have been working closely with the owner of Allerton Lodge Care Home and CSSIW to support the home to address concerns we share over the quality of care.
"Unfortunately, the home has not made sufficient progress and cannot provide us with the assurances we need in the interests of the welfare of its residents."
The CSSIW said in a statement: "Following serious concerns that we had about standards of care provided at Allerton Lodge, we worked closely with Flintshire County Council, who are now terminating their contract with the home.
"They are making arrangements for the residents living there to move to other services as soon as possible.
"Our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of everyone who uses the service."
