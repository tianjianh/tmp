Saido Berahino: West Brom striker faces drink-drive charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom striker Saido Berahino has been charged with drink-driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old was arrested by Cheshire Police after being stopped near junction 20 of the southbound M6 in the early hours of 22 October.
He will appear before North Cheshire magistrates in Runcorn on 19 January.
The England Under-21 international has scored 13 times in 24 appearances for the Baggies this season, and has been linked with a big-money transfer to a top Premier League club.
The player's form earned him a call-up to the full England squad in November but he did not play in matches against Slovenia and Scotland.
Berahino,who came to the UK from war-torn Burundi as a child, signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with West Brom in December 2013.
