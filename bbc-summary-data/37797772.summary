The club confirmed that the 19-year-old picked up the injury during training.
It means he misses Saturday's trip to face second-top Aberdeen in the Premiership and the League Cup final against the same side on 27 November.
"It is a big blow because he has been absolutely brilliant for us," Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers told BBC Scotland.
"His game has really developed and it is a big blow for Scotland as well with an important game [the World Cup qualifier against England on 11 November] coming up.
"It came as a bit of a shock for us all really. It was just a nothing challenge.  He came in to slide for the ball and landed awkwardly.  So unfortunately he will be out for a couple of months."
Tierney will also miss the rest of Celtic's Champions League Group C fixtures. They  face Borussia Monchengladbach on Tuesday in Germany before hosting Barcelona and then completing their fixtures away to Manchester City.
Honduras international Emilio Izaguirre is likely to reclaim the left-back role he lost to Tierney, who has made 20 appearances for the Scottish Premiership leaders this season.
He made his debut for Celtic aged 17, in a 2-1 win at Dens Park in April 2015 and made 34 club appearances last season.
"He has played a lot of games as a young player and he is really old school, Kieran, tough physically and mentally," Rodgers added.
"He has had some great experience and great games, and he will miss out on some other big ones.  But he is going to have a fantastic career and he is a positive kid.  He will come back stronger and a better player."
Tierney started for Scotland in their 3-0 defeat by Slovakia on 11 October after Andrew Robertson picked up a knock against Lithuania.
The Hull City defender has since also been ruled out of the England game with a calf injury.
Rangers captain Lee Wallace was the third left-back in Scotland head coach Gordon Strachan's last squad.
Aberdeen's Graeme Shinnie, Swansea City's Stephen Kingsley and Konyaspor's Barry Douglas are among those now vying for a place when the squad for the England game is announced on Wednesday.
