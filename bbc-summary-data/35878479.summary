People carrying candles and flowers gathered in the Place de la Bourse in the heart of the city, in a show of defiance and unity.
Tributes are being paid to the victims near the Zaventem airport and the Maelbeek metro station - the sites of the attacks.
The bombings, claimed by so-called Islamic State, have brought condemnation from around the world.
