Seonaid (Shona) Bacon was reported missing after she was last seen at about 12:20 in the Skelmanae area, near the A98 Fraserburgh to Banff road.
People living in the area have been asked to check garages and sheds.
She is described as 5ft 6in, with short, white hair. She was last seen wearing a white dressing gown, slippers and grey tracksuit bottoms.
Insp Kevin Goldie, of Police Scotland, said: "It is out of character for Seonaid to not be in touch with family or friends and as time goes by we are increasingly concerned for her well-being.
"We are asking residents in the local area to please check any outbuildings, garages or sheds for signs that someone may have sought shelter there.
"Searches are being carried out in the local area including the use of a search dog and the Police Scotland helicopter."
