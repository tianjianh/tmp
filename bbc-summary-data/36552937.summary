Winchester flood defence wall to be built

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Â£895,000 flood defence wall is to be built in a town to prevent a repeat of the severe flooding the area has experienced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The barrier will be built in Winchester, Hampshire around North Walls and Park Avenue including St Bede School and The Art College.
Roy Perry, leader of Hampshire County Council, said it would "provide much needed relief and peace of mind".
The area previously flooded in 2000 and 2014.
The wall will be constructed in red brick to match existing walls in the area, but its foundation will be constructed out of reinforced concrete to resist water pressures.
It is being funded by Hampshire County Council, Winchester City Council, Southampton University, and the Environment Agency.
Mr Perry said: "This is a good example of a joined up approach by partners to help protect Winchester residents."
Work is expected to start in the summer and be completed at the end of the year.
