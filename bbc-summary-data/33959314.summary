Aung San Suu Kyi meets ousted Myanmar ruling party figure

The former chairman of Myanmar's ruling party has met opposition head Aung San Suu Kyi, prompting speculation of an alliance.

Shwe Mann was sacked from the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) last week in a power struggle.
He has been rumoured to be discussing an alliance with Aung San Suu Kyi whose party is expected to win wide popular support in the 8 November elections.
They will be the first elections since democratic reforms began in 2011.
Rivalry between President Thein Sein and Shwe Mann came to a head last Wednesday night when trucks with security sealed off the headquarters of the party.
Shwe Mann, who had been seen as a likely successor to Thein Sein, remains speaker of parliament and a USDP member.
Ms Suu Kyi and Shwe Mann met for an hour on Monday in the country's capital, Naypyidaw.
They have often said that they have a mutual understanding for future co-operation, reports Moe Myint of the BBC Burmese service.
One likely area of collaboration might be amendment of the constitution, which prevents Ms Suu Kyi from running for the presidency.
Most expect Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy to win the election, but the constitution bars her from becoming president because her children hold British passports.
