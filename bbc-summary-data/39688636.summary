The 39-year-old is the 13th batsman to break the 10,000-run barrier.
Younus, playing his 116th Test, will retire from internationals after the three-match series in the Caribbean, having made his debut in 2000.
He has 32 Test centuries with a highest score of 313 against Sri Lanka in 2009.
He secured his place in the record books with a sweep for four off spinner Roston Chase from the second ball after the interval at Sabina Park, having started the day requiring just 23 runs to reach his target.
