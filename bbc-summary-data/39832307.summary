Brownlee claimed his first victory over the middle distance at Challenge Gran Canaria last month, but was competing against a much stronger field in Utah.
Victory gives him a spot at September's Ironman 70.3 World Championship.
"I saw this as a start of a learning curve towards the World Championship, so I am on the way up," he said.
"I definitely got something from today, like my nutrition. I couldn't get enough in my stomach and I felt like I didn't have enough salts and fluid in me at the end of the run, which is why I had to back off a bit.
"But that's the good thing about it for me. I spent a decade doing the Olympics, so it's really nice to have a different challenge."
The World Championships take place in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on 9 and 10 September.
The Ironman 70.3 event, named after the total number of miles it covers, entails swimming 1.9km, cycling 90km and running a half-marathon (13.1 miles or 21.09km) - half the regular Ironman distance.
The men's Olympic triathlon - which Brownlee won in 2012 and 2016 - involves a 1.5km swim, a 40km cycle and 10km run.
