Rangers 4-0 Hamilton Academical

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers marked Pedro Caixinha's first match as manager with a comfortable Scottish Premiership win over Hamilton Academical, who slipped to bottom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emerson Hyndman converted James Tavernier's cross to put the hosts ahead and Clint Hill knocked in Jon Toral's delivery for their second.
Martyn Waghorn tucked away from the penalty spot after being fouled by Hamilton's Massimo Donati.
And Ibrox captain Lee Wallace's strike completed the scoring.
The Ibrox side are eight points behind second-placed Aberdeen but are seven clear of St Johnstone, with third place guaranteeing a Europa League qualifying spot.
Accies fall below Inverness Caledonian Thistle on goal difference and are three off Motherwell.
Caixinha, 46, had signed a three-year deal to take over from Mark Warburton earlier this month but took in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Celtic from the stand while Graeme Murty continued in interim charge.
There was little change in personnel on the field as the Portuguese took charge in the dugout, with Toral replacing Lee Hodson while Hamilton player-manager Martin Canning made three changes following last week's 4-0 loss to Hearts.
Rangers' intent early on was clear as Jason Holt and Waghorn had efforts before on-loan Bournemouth midfielder Hyndman finished off an inventive move involving Kenny Miller and Tavernier.
And, from Toral's whipped free-kick, Hill continued his recent scoring run to take his season's tally to six from close range.
Former Celtic player Donati felled Waghorn and the Englishman scored his fifth goal in five games against Accies this season.
And Waghorn turned provider for Wallace's goal, the Scotland left-back driving home from a tight angle.
Accies, who had brought Alex Gogic, Grant Gillespie and Darian MacKinnon into their starting line-up, rarely threatened and have now lost 14 goals in their last three games.
The Premiership breaks for international football next weekend and Rangers resume their campaign at home to Motherwell on 1 April, when Hamilton host St Johnstone.
