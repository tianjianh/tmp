The 28-year-old, who can play lock or flanker, is now contracted to 2019 and said he was "delighted to be staying".
He started his professional career with Edinburgh in 2006, leaving for Sale Sharks in 2011 and Newcastle Falcons two years later.
After a year with Falcons, he returned to Murrayfield in 2014 and had a brief spell on loan with Pro12 winners Glasgow Warriors last season.
"When I left the first time, things at the club were a bit unsettled but since then Solly's [head coach Alan Solomons] stabilised the ship, has good coaches around him, I'm happy being back here and it's great to see Edinburgh heading in the right direction," said McKenzie.
"We have a really good close-knit bunch of guys here. You class them all as friends. That's one of the real strengths of this club and another reason I wanted to stay.
"I still class myself a relatively young player with plenty of opportunity for progression and I want to kick on from here."
McKenzie played at Scotland Under-19 and Under-20 level and also featured for Scotland A in 2009.
Edinburgh are currently seventh in the Pro12, four points behind Glasgow, with the top six teams qualifying for next season's European Rugby Champions Cup.
And Solomons said: "It is great to see Fraz make a long-term commitment to the club.
"Since coming back from Newcastle he has become an integral part of the team and has made a huge contribution to its development.
"He is a real team man and a pleasure to coach. I look forward to continuing working with him."
