The blaze gutted Newgrange Care Home in Cadmore Lane, Cheshunt, when it broke out at about 06:00 BST on Saturday.
A further 33 residents were rescued from the collapsing building, three of whom needed hospital treatment for burns and smoke inhalation.
They are said to be in a serious but stable condition.
Hertfordshire Police said that formal identification of the two people who died had not yet taken place.
A spokeswoman said that a joint investigation with the county's Fire and Rescue Service was continuing on Sunday.
Chief fire officer for Hertfordshire, Darryl Keen, said the outcome could have been even worse had crews not reacted so quickly.
"We had a number of people that were unable to get themselves out, you know, physically would not have been able to move even under normal circumstances," he said.
