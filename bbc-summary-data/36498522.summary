Held at Dores on the shores of Loch Ness for the first time last year, the latest event is to be staged on 20 August.
Formed in 1989, Leftfield released a new album last year called Alternative Light Source.
Other acts confirmed include Duke Dumont, Mark Knight and Boys Noiz.
Also, underground dance music acts Leon Vynehall, Dan Shake and Moxie.
Festival founder Dougie Brown said: "We are delighted to announce Leftfield as our special guests, there is no arguing the impact they have had on the electronic music world and their set is guaranteed to be a highlight of the festival."
Groove Loch Ness is held at the site of the cancelled RockNess music festival, which drew up to 35,000 people at its peak but has not been held since 2013.
Last year's inaugural event was headlined by Groove Armada and was organised in just eight months by four people working in the music industry in Scotland.
