[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Antoine Maury, 21, was last seen on Monday at 22:30 after leaving friends at Edinburgh College's Milton Road East Campus.
His mother, Laura Maury, issued an appeal to him to come home, saying he was not in any trouble.
She urged people living in the area to check their outbuildings and garages.
Mrs Maury also appealed for information from anyone who may be sheltering her son.
Police said there was a possible sighting of a man matching Mr Maury's description near the Duddingston Village area of Holyrood Park, heading into the park, on Monday between 22:45 and 23:00.
The man was topless.
Laura and Pascal Maury, who have flown in to Edinburgh, said their son's disappearance was completely out of character.
Mrs Maury said her son was well liked and had been enjoying his studies in Scotland.
He has been a student at Edinburgh College for three months.
They plan to organise a search on Saturday with family and friends.
Divers from the Borders Water Rescue Team are continuing to search Duddingston Loch.
Duddingston Village has been searched using police sniffer dogs.
Ms Maury said: "We are desperate to find Antoine and are appealing to anyone who might have information as to where he is or know if someone is sheltering him.
"We want him to know that we love him, he is not in trouble and for him to come home.
"We ask that anyone living in the area to please check their outbuildings and garages again to confirm that Antoine is not hiding there.
"He is a very happy young man and there is no reason to believe my son would run away."
Mr Maury was described as white, of medium build, 6ft with short brown hair, a beard and has a bleeding hand tattoo on his forearm.
He has a good level of English, but was unfamiliar with Edinburgh.
He has lost his glasses and his eyesight is not very good.
Insp Alan Carson of Police Scotland, said:  "We are continuing our search to find Antoine today and are still appealing to the public for their assistance.
"This is a live missing person investigation and we are very concerned for Antoine's welfare. I would urge anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact us immediately.
"Any information passed to police may hold the key to finding Antoine."
