Lawnmowers, a scarifier and a turfer were taken from the Lockerbie site some time between 09:00 on Thursday and the same time on Friday.
Det Con Scott Barr said it appeared to have been a "targeted raid" with a vehicle needed to remove the property.
He appealed for anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area to contact them as soon as possible.
