It smashed the previous women's ODI record of 268 set by England in 2008.
Sharma was eventually bowled for 188 from 160 balls while Raut retired hurt on 109 as India finished on 358-2.
Ireland were dismissed for 109 in 40 overs, with Mary Waldron top-scoring on 35 while Jennifer Gray added 26.
Left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad took 4-18, supported by Shikha Pandey (3-16) as the under-strength Irish suffered a fourth straight defeat in Potchefstroom.
India hammered the Irish by 10 wickets in their opening game of the tournament while a six-wicket defeat by Zimbabwe was then followed by a 178-run reverse against the hosts last Thursday.
Seven uncapped players - Aoife Beggs, Rachel Delaney, Louise Little, Lara Maritz, Sophie MacMahon, Leah Paul and Rebecca Stokell - were included in Ireland's 15-woman squad for the tournament as a number of regulars were unavailable.
Ireland's women missed out on earning a place at this year's World Cup in England at the qualification tournament in Sri Lanka in February.
