The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader will visit the Somerset site on Sunday, although no timing has been announced.
Festival organiser Emily Eavis said she was "honoured" to welcome him, calling his visit "a special moment for the festival".
Kanye West, The Who and Florence and the Machine top the bill for the festival, which opened yesterday.
Florence stepped in after Foo Fighters' frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg, forcing the band to pull out.
Other acts appearing include Rudimental, Burt Bacharach, Pharrell Williams, Mark Ronson and The Moody Blues.
The Dalai Lama will be talking in the festival's Green Fields area.
A spokesman said the key themes of his visit would be "the promotion of His Holiness the Dalai Lama's message of compassion, non-violence and the oneness of humanity".
Glastonbury will also have a visit from Professor Stephen Hawking, who is due to appear in the Kidz Field. It's not known what format his "performance" will take.
And the festival has not lost its political principles. This year, two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot will appear to give talks about their protests against President Vladimir Putin.
