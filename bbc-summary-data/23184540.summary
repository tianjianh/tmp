Other expense claims include a £23.68 taxi to a premiere of the film House of Cards and an £84.31 round trip in his official car to tour the Westminster offices of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority - the body which administers MPs' expenses.

The biggest single claim is £11,252.81 for a return business class flight for Mr Bercow and two staff to Toronto for the G8 Speakers' conference in September 2010.
The Freedom of Information request came from the MailOnline website.
A statement from the Speaker's Office said it was an important part of Mr Bercow's duties to represent Parliament abroad and foster good relations with fellow speakers and parliamentarians.
As part of his role, Mr Bercow was invited to address parliaments including Poland, Greece, Germany, the United States and South Africa.
His office said the vast majority of travel had been economy class, except for long-haul flights and where other classes were the best value for money or matched timing requirements.
It has also been confirmed that the Speaker's costs will now be published on a quarterly basis.
Before becoming Speaker in 2009, Mr Bercow was a Conservative MP.
