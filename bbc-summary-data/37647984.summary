Sam Alger, 25, originally from Norfolk, died after a night out in June.
He was last seen outside the Spanish city's Elrow club before his body was found on farmland the next day.
An inquest heard there was no indication drugs he had taken caused his death. The coroner recorded a narrative verdict.

The inquest at Norwich Coroner's Court heard how he had been on a night out with his brother and friends.
His friend, Daniel Sale, said in a written statement they had spent the day at the Elrow festival and Mr Alger had been "fun-loving and happy".
At about 20:00, Mr Sale said, Mr Alger insisted on leaving on his own and, when he saw he was being followed by two friends "decided to run".
Post-mortem examinations found traces of ketamine and other drugs in his body "consistent with recreational use", the court heard.
In a statement, Spanish police said: "During the day of the party, he took a pill, a drug he had bought... he got nervous as if he was crazy."
However, the precise cause of Mr Alger's death was "unascertained", the inquest heard.
Assistant Norfolk coroner Yvonne Blake said his body was found "in a prone position, partially submerged", and showed changes consistent with drowning.
She said she was "satisfied that something prevented him from breathing, either the water or the plant matter in his airways".
Paying tribute to Mr Alger, his family said in a statement: "Sam's passing is a terrible, heartbreaking tragedy and we are so thankful for everyone's love, care and support.
"We will now endeavour to focus on what a wonderful, inspiring, healthy and loved filled life Sam enjoyed in his all too few years."
