Recruitment opened at noon, with candidates invited to register online until 20 February.
Acting Chief Constable John Long said the force wanted to encourage people from all backgrounds to consider a career in policing.
The force is also in the process of reducing its total number of officers by 134 in order to save ??8m.
This reduction is posts, due to changes in the force structure, is being achieved through natural attrition.
A force spokeswoman said the new recruits would replace officers who have retired, transferred to another force or left for other reasons in the last year, combined with the anticipated number of leavers over the forthcoming year.
"The individuals we are recruiting now will join the force at intervals over the next 12 months," she said. "Our aim is to maintain the required number of PCs to deliver the service to the public."
Mr Long said: "We want to reach all parts of the community and I hope to see people from all corners of the force area apply.
"It's important that our workforce reflects the communities we serve to provide value and build trust. That's why we're actively encouraging people from all cultural, ethnic and religious background to consider a rewarding career in policing with us."
Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens said: "Policing is a challenging and rewarding job and it is vital that the service reflects the communities it serves.
"Opportunities to recruit police officers over the next few years will be few and far between so I hope people will strongly consider this exciting opportunity now."
