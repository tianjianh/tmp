There are no plans to resume the search for a missing fisherman after a boat capsized in the English Channel, the Maritime & Coastguard Agency has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One man survived, a second died and a third is still missing after the Belgian vessel overturned on Tuesday.
An investigation into the cause of the incident will be carried out by Belgian authorities, as will the missing person enquiry, the Coastguard added.
A salvage operation is expected to begin later on Thursday.
A temporary exclusion zone has been put in place around the vessel to allow the operation to take place.
The vessel from Belgium capsized off Ramsgate on the Kent coast at about 23:00 GMT on Tuesday.
Dover Coastguard said weather conditions at the time were "relatively benign" and the sea had been calm.
A man was rescued from the upturned hull at 07:30 GMT on Wednesday after he was spotted clinging to the vessel by a passing boat.
A second man "showing signs of life" was rescued from the sea later in the day but died in hospital.
The third crewman remains unaccounted for. An extensive search involving helicopters and boats was called off for the day late on Wednesday due to fading light.
