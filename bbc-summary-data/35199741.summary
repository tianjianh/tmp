He was among crews sent to the US in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita - one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record - in 2005, and has taken part in humanitarian campaigns in Bosnia, Romania, Tanzania and the Middle East.
Describing his work in disaster zones as "an extension of what firefighters do every day", he said the recognition had come as "a total surprise".
"I simply enjoy helping people, especially at their greatest hour of need," he said.
"I only wish my mum, who passed away five weeks ago, could have been here to see it."
Others recognised in the New Year Honours include Coventry University Pro-Chancellor Michael Judge and Dennis Davison, chairman of Coventry-based charity Normandy Veterans UK, who were both appointed MBEs.
Warwickshire Police's Chief Constable Martin Jelley has been awarded the Queen's Police Medal.
