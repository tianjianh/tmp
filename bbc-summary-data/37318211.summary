The 19-year-old was treated in hospital after he was hit with a weapon by the pair.
Both attackers are thought to be in their mid-teens. The first was about 5ft 2in with black hair. He was wearing a light blue jacket and denim jeans.
The second attacker was about 5ft 7in with brown hair and was wearing a dark blue jacket and denim jeans.
Det Sgt David McMillan, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a violent, unprovoked attack that left a young man needing hospital treatment.
"I'm particularly keen to trace any witnesses who saw the incident or the suspects in the area around the time of the assault."
