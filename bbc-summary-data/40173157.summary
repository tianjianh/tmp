Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba stabbed revellers in Borough Market, shouting: "This is for Allah," and wearing hoax bomb belts.
Police are now trying to piece together how the three men met and how they planned the attack.
This is what we know about them.
Khuram Butt, 27, was born in Pakistan but was a British citizen.
He lived in a flat in Barking, east London, with his wife and two children.
According to a CV obtained by the BBC, Butt worked at a security firm until 2016 and as a customer service assistant at Transport for London.
He also claimed he had a Security Industry Authority (SIA) licence, which is required by security workers and involves a criminal record check.
The SIA told the BBC it was was unable to comment because an investigation was under way.
A spokeswoman said a criminal record would not necessarily prevent someone from holding a licence, as criteria including the type and seriousness of any offences are taken into consideration.
Before this, Butt claimed jobseeker's allowance for seven months and later worked in an administrative role between 2012 and 2015 for a company based in East Ham, which manages Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets.
The fast food firm confirmed Butt had worked at the franchise, run by Auriga Holdings, and added it was co-operating with authorities.
Butt's Whatsapp account shows he was last active on the network at 17:59 BST last Wednesday.
He was known to police and security services; an investigation into him began in 2015, when one man called the terrorism hotline after concerns that Butt had been radicalised.
A woman also went to police after she became concerned that Butt was trying to radicalise her children.
Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police and MI5 had downgraded the investigation because "there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned".
Butt had featured in a Channel 4 documentary, The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year.
In the programme, he was seen to support convicted hate preacher Anjem Choudary.
It is also believed that he had been thrown out of a mosque after interrupting an imam who had urged people to use their vote in the 2015 general election.
His family condemned the attack, saying they were "shocked and appalled" by his actions.
His wife's cousin, Fahad Khan, has said Butt watched propaganda videos made by the militant group Islamic State, and wanted to travel to Syria. He also said Butt openly expressed extremist views at family gatherings.
Rachid Redouane, 30, claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan and was based in the east London suburb of Barking.
An Irish identity card was found on his body after he was shot dead by police.
Redouane, who was not under surveillance in Ireland, was also known by the name Rachid Elkhdar.
It is understood he arrived in the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum but that the application was rejected in 2009.
The details of when he arrived in the Republic of Ireland or how long he stayed there are still not clear.
He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse Ann O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012.
The couple lived in Rathmines, Dublin, and reports suggest Redouane worked as a pastry chef.
He may have intermittently visited the UK because he had a European Union permit.
He left Ireland after the marriage and settled in the UK before returning to Ireland in 2015.
Redouane is understood to have had a one-year-old daughter with Ms O'Leary, although the couple were estranged.
According to reports, he visited his child before carrying out the London attack.
Ms O'Leary said she was "deeply shocked, saddened and numbed" by his actions, adding: "My thoughts and efforts now are with trying to bring up my daughter with the knowledge that someday I will have to try and explain to her why her father did what he did."
Italian-Moroccan Youssef Zaghba has been named as the third attacker.
The 22-year-old lived in east London but was an Italian national of Moroccan descent.
Italian police sources confirmed that Zaghba was stopped at Bologna airport in March 2016 when he was on his way to Turkey, because of concerns he might travel to fight in Syria.
Material about the so-called Islamic State group was found on his phone.
Sources told the BBC that the database, which Zaghba was on, would have been shared with British security services - although it is not clear how this was done. There are various methods for passing on information either directly or through shared EU border databases.
The Italian authorities said they informed UK intelligence agencies about him and Italian police said they had a "clear conscience".
Speaking at her home in Bologna in northern Italy, his mother Valeria Collina Kadhija said: "From 2016 there were problems with my son - the fact that he was stopped at Bologna airport.
"He would say to me 'Come on Mum let's go live in Syria. Over there, they have a pure Islam.'
"I told him 'Are you crazy? I have no intention of going to Syria with you or with anyone. I'm fine in my country.'"
