[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man dialled 999 on a mobile phone, was put through to Essex Police and was heard shouting "Basildon, near petrol garage, help me".
The call cut out but other 999 calls were made as people heard a man screaming for help inside the Eastgate petrol station at about 04:35 BST.
A man in his 40s was treated for leg injuries and arrested.
Police officers, Asda security staff, a fire crew and paramedics went to the garage to help free the man, who was taken to hospital.
