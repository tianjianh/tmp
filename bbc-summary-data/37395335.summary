Samia Shahid 'honour killing': Father dismisses murder accusations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of Samia Shahid, allegedly killed in a so-called "honour killing" in Pakistan, has denied accusations she was murdered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid made the denial before he appeared in court along with Ms Shahid's first husband, Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel, who is accused of murder.
Mr Shahid is being held as an accessory to her murder.
Ms Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died in July in northern Punjab.
The BBC has since learnt that Ms Shahid had not obtained a legal divorce before her second marriage.
A final report into her death was due to be presented in court, but the prosecution said it needed more time to examine it.
It is thought Ms Shahid had been visiting family in the village of Pandori after being told her father was ill.
Her relatives initially said she had suffered a heart attack but a post-mortem examination confirmed she died as a result of being strangled.
Mr Shakeel is accused of strangling Ms Shahid, while her father is accused of taking part in her murder.
But BBC Pakistan correspondent Shaimaa Khalil, reporting from Jehlum in the northern Punjab province, said Mr Shahid "flatly denied" police accusations his daughter had been strangled when responding to media questions as he was taken into court.
Ms Shahid's second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazim, believes she was the victim of a so-called "honour killing" as her family did not approve of their marriage.
A document purportedly from West Yorkshire Police, seen by the BBC, states Ms Shahid's divorce was not legally binding in the UK and therefore she should not have been married a second time.
According to the document, there was no suggestion her second husband was aware of that.
West Yorkshire Police confirmed a complaint of bigamy had been made, but said no further action had been taken.
Earlier this month, the officer in charge of the investigation said Ms Shahid had also been raped before her death.
A judge in Pakistan previously dismissed a bail application from Ms Shahid's father.
Samia Shahid's father flatly denied police accusations that she was strangled. He said they were all lies and that he loved his daughter very much.
He also denied accusations that Ms Shahid came to Pakistan because she thought he was ill.
He emphasised that she was only married once - he refused to acknowledge Samia's second marriage - and said all the documents were fake and even the wedding photos were fake.
According to him, Samia was only married once and that was to Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel, who would not speak to us.
I put to her father the allegations that she had been raped before she was killed. He said: 'How could her husband rape her?'
