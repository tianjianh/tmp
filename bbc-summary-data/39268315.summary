Stabbed teacher inquest: Ann Maguire's family seek review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a teacher murdered by a student in 2014 is seeking a judicial review citing "serious concerns" about the forthcoming inquest.

Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death by Will Cornick at Corpus Christi Catholic College, Leeds, in April 2014.
A full inquest is scheduled to begin at Wakefield Coroners' Court in November.
The Maguires have said they have "many unanswered questions" and challenge the West Yorkshire Coroner's decision to exclude "vital" evidence and witnesses.

Cornick, who was 15 at the time, was given a life sentence in 2014 after admitting murdering Ann Maguire, who had taught Spanish at Corpus Christi for more than 40 years.
Because he quickly admitted responsibility, police never fully reviewed the evidence.
A full inquest is not usually held following a successful prosecution but in January 2016 it was announced that one would be held into the death.
The family's lawyers, Irwin Mitchell, said the Maguires have "serious concerns" about the scope of the inquest.
Senior coroner David Hinchliff said it was "inappropriate" to comment at this stage.
Yogi Amin, of Irwin Mitchell, said: "The family hoped a full public inquest would examine the full chain of events and all the evidence available so lessons could be learned to reduce the risk of similar incidents happening again.
"They have become very concerned about the scope of the full inquest hearing scheduled for later this year.
"The police investigation was itself limited in scope, as the defendant quickly admitted responsibility meaning there was no examination of all the evidence publicly."
In 2015, the family was told no Serious Case Review would be held.
In November 2016, a report by Leeds Safeguarding Children Board said no-one could have predicted or prevented Mrs Maguire's murder.
Also in 2016, a council Learning Lessons Review was held, but a recent pre-inquest review revealed many conversations had not been recorded.
