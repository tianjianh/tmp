'Long delays' on M5 in Worcestershire after road reopened

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motorists have faced long delays after a section of the M5 closed because of an overhead gantry blocking the road.

The northbound carriageway between junction 5 at Droitwich and 4a at Bromsgrove was due to reopen at 06:00 GMT following overnight works.
But there was difficulty removing the gantry from the carriageway as the available equipment could not lift it.
It reopened at around 16:20, but Highways England said "long delays" remained at that stage.
The troublesome gantry was moved at about 15:50.
Frank Bird, emergency planning officer with Highways England, said they thought they had "covered all the bases".
"There were no indications at all on the previous gantries that we'd dropped this week overnight - all went well, all resulted in the motorway reopening quite early in the morning. It was this last gantry that just caught us out."
Some drivers told BBC Hereford and Worcester they had been stuck on the M5 for up to four hours, while others took to social media to vent their anger over the congestion.

Brad Hayward tweeted: "Thank you @HighwaysEngland for a well managed closure of #M5. 3hrs stationary and now missed hospital appt."
Chris Newman also criticised the agency: "@HighwaysEngland #getagrip will you now be issuing water to those who have been stuck between M5 6-5 Northbound for 4 hours?
One motorist, @capasphil, tried placating other fraught drivers by offering free hugs - even identifying the car he was in for those who wanted to take up his offer.
Another Twitter user, Emily Baker, wrote: "I hope whoever is responsible for the #M5 traffic is made to sit through it."
Highways England advised northbound motorists to exit at junction 5 and follow diversions.
Operations manager Sioux Hine said: "We can understand the frustration this has caused and it's frustrating for us too. We always try to carefully plan our overnight work to avoid this kind of disruption and we'd like to apologise for the inconvenience.
"Sometimes, things happen which no one can foresee."
A number of southbound lanes were also shut for long periods but have now reopened.
