Europa League: Man Utd fans to get 9,500 tickets for Stockholm final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United will receive no more than 9,500 tickets for the Europa League final in the 50,000-capacity Friends Arena in Stockholm.

United will play Ajax - who will get a similar allocation for the 24 May final - after edging past Celta Vigo.
The rest of the tickets went on general sale and to local organisers, national associations, commercial partners, broadcasters and corporate hospitality.
There will be no screenings of the game in Stockholm for fans without tickets.
The only United supporters eligible to apply for a ticket will be season ticket holders who have attended every cup game this season and season ticket or executive ticket holders who have applied for a ticket for an away game in Europe at some point over the past two seasons.
Even then, United - who have written to fans to say the likely allocation will be between 8,000 to 9,500 - expect to have far more applications than tickets.
Last year's final at Basel's St Jakob-Park, which has a capacity of 35,000, saw Liverpool and Sevilla allocated 10,236 tickets each.
