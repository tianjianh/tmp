[SN]TITLE[SN]
A new anthem for England? You decide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Could this be goodbye to God Save the Queen as MPs give support to the idea of a new national anthem for England.

In the UK, #NationalAnthem, was the top trending hashtag for a while on Wednesday, closely followed by #Jerusalem #England and #GodSavetheQueen.
The anthem debate has prompted a wide response with emails coming in to the BBC and comments posted on Twitter and Facebook. Here is a selection of them:
Definitely agree to a separate anthem for England, it is long overdue. I am a royalist, so I still want the national anthem too. My choice would be Land of Hope and Glory as it is rousing. As much as I love Jerusalem, I do not think it rousing enough for an anthem at sporting events. Rhona Parks, UK.
In a post modern era it's time to move on. Make Heroes by David Bowie a national anthem! Marcus Lannie, UK.
@LauraTisdall thought she'd conduct a poll on Twitter  and the results were interesting:
When I was a child going to Saturday matinees we often sang There will always be an England. I am surprised that this doesn't feature in the choices. James M. Hockey, UK
Land of Hope and Glory without a doubt. It is one of the most beautiful, awe-inspiring tunes penned by man and a poignant anthem to represent England. Hairs on the back of the neck stuff. David Rudd, UK
Some weren't too impressed with how much attention the vote generated.   @OneEyedFishSurf and @hraarmstong  commented:
Perhaps it's better to keep it simple, as @jamesbirchall97 and Doug Fisher suggest:
Please keep God save the Queen. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Doug Fisher, UK
