Ian Parkhill headed an early goal from a corner and teenager Brad Lyons made it 2-0 with a superb long-range shot.
Aaron Burns revived Linfield's hopes with a firm header from a Ross Gaynor corner before the interval.
The visitors equalised six minutes after the break through Mark Haughey and the Blues defender scored with another header to clinch the victory.
Coleraine were unhappy about the winning goal as it came from a free-kick for a foul by Howard Beverland which they felt should not have been awarded.
It was an important comeback for David Healy's men as defeat would have left them 10 points behind leaders and defending champions Crusaders.
Linfield manager David Healy: "We were disappointing in the first half but the goal from Aaron Burns gave us something to hang on to at half-time.
"I asked the players to show guts. People outside Linfield have been questioning this team, but they delivered today.
"Cliftonville are not going to give it up and we aren't either."
Coleraine manager Oran Kearney: "When you go 2-0 up at home you expect to have enough to see the game through.
"The manner in which we conceded the goals was disappointing. We know Linfield are dangerous from set pieces."
