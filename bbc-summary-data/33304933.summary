Wimbledon 2015: Andy Murray favourite for title - Richard Krajicek

Andy Murray is the clear favourite to win Wimbledon for a second time, says former champion Richard Krajicek.

The Scot, who won the title in 2013, goes into this year's championships on the back of another grass-court title at Queen's Club.
"For me, he was the favourite to win even before Queen's," the Dutchman, who won in 1996, told BBC Scotland.
"He came with so much confidence from the clay and winning two titles and playing very good in the French."
Murray, who plays his first match on Tuesday, is in the same half of the draw as Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, who Krajicek thinks is second favourite.
"Tennis wise, Andy and Roger are at the same level, maybe Roger has the edge, but we saw in the final against Novak Djokovic last year, Roger was just tired," he said.
"And I think that, when Andy plays Roger, and he's going to move him around and it's going to be a long match, in the end, Andy's going to win because he is physically stronger and he's going to last much younger than Roger."
Murray's half of the draw has been weakened by the withdrawal through injury of world number seven David Ferrer, who was seeded to meet Murray in the quarter-finals.
It increases the likelihood of Murray facing Ferrer's fellow Spaniard and twice champion Nadal.
Krajicek believes that, since winning at Wimbledon two years ago, Murray has improved two crucial parts of his game - the backhand down the line and first serve.
"If it had gone a little bit different, he could have walked away with the French Open title," he said. "He was a bit unlucky against Novak."
Djokovic went on to lose the final to Stan Wawrinka and Krajicek wonders how the Serb will react.
"He hasn't played since, so I have no idea how he is going to recover from the disappointment of losing the French Open final," he said.
"Andy is the man to beat as he has beaten everyone at Wimbledon and he's won the title.
"It is never easy to win a Grand Slam, especially in this era with so many good players.
"He is full of confidence and now he is on his favourite surface and he's ready to do it.
"He wins Queen's and that makes him even more of the favourite."
