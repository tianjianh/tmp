Lord Dubs, the man behind a scheme to bring lone child refugees to the UK, has told Newsround he's "bitterly disappointed" at how much the government is doing to help.

Around 200 unaccompanied children have been helped by the Dubs Amendment, which will stop once 350 have arrived.
But Lord Dubs, who was a child refugee himself, had hoped to help several thousand come to the UK and find somewhere safe to live.
"We just can't turn our backs on them," he told Newsround's Jenny. "I hope the government is feeling ashamed of itself."
There is a big refugee crisis in Europe right now, with millions of people fleeing from their homes in the Middle East because of fighting in their home countries.
There has been a lot of debate between politicians about how the UK should help these people - particularly children.
The government told us: "We want to do everything we can to protect children who are fleeing conflict and danger."
It said it's helped more than 8,000 children in the past year, and 20,000 Syrians will be getting a new home in the UK by 2020.
