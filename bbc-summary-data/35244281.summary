[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital placed in special measures two years ago has been told it will remain so until significant improvements have been made.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Medway Maritime Hospital, in Gillingham, has been rated "inadequate" following its latest Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection.
It found the hospital's A&E department could not cope when busy.
Medway Maritime's chief executive Lesley Dwyer said the hospital was on a "continuous journey of improvement".
The trust was originally placed in special measures in July 2013 because of concerns over mortality rates and standards of care.
The latest inspection took place in August and September 2015 and found there were continuing concerns with medical care, surgery, outpatient and diagnostic services.
The chief inspector of hospitals, Prof Sir Mike Richards, said he was not satisfied the "underlying issues" had been resolved.
"It is disappointing to report that performance may even have deteriorated in some areas, despite the support which has been offered to the trust up until now," he said.
"It is clear that the trust cannot solve these important issues on its own, and will require continued support for the foreseeable future."
However, the hospital was praised for the "compassionate care" staff provided in "almost all their interactions" with patients.
The report said patients spoke positively about the staff and said they considered their privacy and dignity had been maintained in most cases.
Ms Dwyer said: "We accept the findings of the CQC, we recognise that was in a point of time in August and take their concerns seriously.
"We are continuing to make changes that we know will improve the safety and quality of care we provide here at Medway."
