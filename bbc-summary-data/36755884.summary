The searches, on Friday night and Saturday morning, were carried out as part of an investigation into dissident republican activity.
They were in the Creggan and Galliagh areas of the city.
A 48-year-old man arrested following a house search in Creggan on Friday has been released unconditionally.
The bomb, which police described as "a viable improvised explosive device", was found in the Galliagh area.
SDLP councillor Brian Tierney condemned those responsible for the bomb.
"Those behind the viable device discovered at a local social housing site are reckless thugs who could have caused chaos here," he said.
"As this city comes together to celebrate the the arrival of the clipper crews, there's no place for those who seek to divide us with the violence of the past. This is a city on the rise and we will not be dragged back."
