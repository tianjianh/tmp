The 17-year-old from Blackwood beat Russian Polina Khan 13-4 in the final to repeat her success of 2014.
Scottish fighter Rebecca McGowan, 16, took a bronze medal in the +68kg category.
Already a senior European champion, Williams' success underlined her potential as a candidate for Team GB at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Williams was dominant throughout the tournament, dropping only six points while racking up 76 herself and stopping four of her opponents before full distance.
McGowan, a senior medallist at last month's Galeb Trophy, was unfortunate not to earn a fight for gold.

The Glaswegian opened up with a 14-4 success over Australia's Chelsea Hobday and then edged out 2015 Asian Championship bronze medallist Shuwen Lu of China 5-4.
In the quarter-finals, McGowan despatched Ella Borisova of Russia 6-2 before losing 13-11 against eventual silver medallist, Yun Ci Pan of Chinese Taipei.
"I'm happy, but a little gutted I couldn't be number one," McGowan told the World Taekwondo Federation website.
"I was doing really well but switched off a couple of times which was vital for the match.
"I'll go back to training and work on my mistakes and hopefully next time I'll come out on top."
