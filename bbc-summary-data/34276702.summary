She currently leads the party in the London Assembly, where she speaks for the Lib Dems on transport, policing and education.
Party members selected her after another shortlisted hopeful, Duwayne Brooks, withdrew from the race.
Ms Pidgeon says she wants to tackle the barriers that make London "a city that serves the few, not the many".
Last week, Sadiq Khan was selected as the Labour candidate. Sian Berry will represent the Greens.
The Conservatives and UKIP have yet to choose their candidates.
