Runny green beach slurry 'harmless' - Natural Resources Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A runny green slurry which has appeared on some beaches around the Welsh coast is algae, not sewage, an environment watchdog has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said phytoplankton has washed up on the shores at Aberystwyth in Ceredigion, West Angle in Pembrokeshire, and Pendine in Carmarthenshire.
Despite looking like pollution, NRW said the seaweed-smelling foam is harmless.
Phytoplankton is eaten by marine life.
