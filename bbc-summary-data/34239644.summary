Nama deal: Ex-adviser Frank Cushnahan rejects critical claims at Stormont inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former adviser to the National Asset Management Agency (Nama) in Northern Ireland has written to a Stormont committee to reject critical comments made about him at an inquiry hearing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The finance committee is investigating the £1bn sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan book.
Earlier this month, businessman Gareth Graham accused Frank Cushnahan of trying to ruin his family's business.
But Mr Cushnahan has now issued a lengthy rebuttal of Mr Graham's claims.
In a letter sent on his behalf by a solicitor, he states that he "achieved a maximisation of value" for the SP Graham Group that he advised for three years.
Mr Cushnahan's letter also deals with tapes made of his phone calls and allegations that he had a conflict of interest.
Mr Graham told the committee's inquiry that Mr Cushnahan was conflicted in his Nama role because he retained shareholdings in some Graham property companies that were moved into Nama, effectively a "bad bank" responsible for recovering the value of problematic loans made by other Irish banks.
But Mr Cushnahan said he gave up those shareholdings in 2009 and that if he remains on the share register it is only because the Graham companies have not provided the necessary updates.
Mr Graham said recordings of Mr Cushnahan's phone calls could expose an "ingrained culture of inappropriate and possibly illegal conduct" across political, banking, legal and accountancy sectors.
Phone calls in and out of the Grahams' bookmaking business were recorded for regulatory reasons.
Mr Cushnahan said that he was never informed his calls were being recorded and he believes it was illegal to do so.
He added that they deal with "all aspects" of his professional and personal life, and that Mr Graham had no right to listen to them or disclose their content.
The recordings were made between 2005 and 2008.
It is understood Mr Graham stands fully behind the evidence he gave and will point to a staff handbook that referred to the fact that all calls were recorded.
Mr Cushnahan sat on Nama's Northern Ireland advisory committee from 2010 until 2013.
He then worked as an adviser to US investment firm Pimco, one of the companies that wanted to buy Nama's Northern Ireland loans.
He was in line for a £5m payment if Pimco's bid was successful, an Irish parliament committee was told.
But Pimco pulled out after discovering the fee arrangement.
Weeks after Pimco withdrew due to its concerns, Nama's loan portfolio sale went ahead to a different bidder, US investment firm Cerberus.
In his letter Mr Cushnahan states that he never had "any meetings, dealings, correspondence or contact" with Cerberus or any of its representatives.
The letter also criticises the conduct of the committee and expresses concern that the loyalist campaigner Jamie Bryson may be asked to give evidence in public.
