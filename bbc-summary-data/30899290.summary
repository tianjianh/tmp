Weather sayings: Science or myth?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Love it or hate it, it's that time of year when snow is a hot topic - pardon the pun.

But as kids up and down the country are digging out their sledges, or hoping to, there is one burning question.
Can it really be too cold to snow?
Newsbeat takes a look at whether there is any truth in the phrase or in several other well-known weather sayings.
Hasn't everyone's mum said this at some point?
Many people believe icy temperatures reduce the number of water droplets that can freeze into snowflakes.
But according to the Met Office, this is a myth.
It can snow even at incredibly cold temperatures as long as there is a source of moisture and some way to lift or cool that moisture in the air.
However, exceptionally cold weather is often associated with very dry air, making snow more unlikely.
This means that if the clouds mushroom into large cloud "mountains", thunderstorms will follow in the afternoon.
This is true - if the clouds have developed during the morning, by the afternoon, they will have risen to the top of the atmosphere which results in rain and lightning.
This is often true.
Red sky - which appears when small particles are trapped in the atmosphere by high pressure - means fair weather is generally headed towards you.
This is especially true in the UK where the weather system usually comes in from the west.
A red sky at sunset means high pressure is moving in from the west so the next day will usually be pleasant.
A red sky in the morning appears due to the high pressure weather system having already moved east, which means the good weather is on its way out.
This saying is based on the fact that weather systems tend to move through the UK quite quickly off the Atlantic, so there is some logic to it.
But we do still have weather systems that like to hang around all day so it's not really reliable.
So if it rains on 15 July, it's supposed to rain for the next 40 days.
St Swithin was a bishop of Winchester who died around AD 862.
He requested that his remains be interred among the common people outside the church, but in 971, after he had been made patron saint of Winchester Cathedral, his body was dug up and moved to a new indoor shrine.
Legend has it that this action displeased God and caused the heavens to open, raining continuously for 40 days.
But since records began, there has never been a 40-day drought in the UK during the summer months, and there has been not one instance at any time of the year of 40 consecutive days of rainfall.
Even if it sometimes feels like it.
This old saying suggests that the weather at the beginning of March is wet and windy but by the end of the month it's fine.
While it's true that we're more likely to get strong winds and heavy rain at the start of spring, it's certainly not always the case that the end of March is settled.
And, of course, April showers are only just round the corner.
This has some truth to it.
The air mass that comes into the UK from a north-easterly direction is the Polar Continental, which has been known to create bitterly cold winds and record low temperatures on our shores.
If the ash tree shows buds before the oak then the summer is supposed to be a washout.
But if the oak buds before the ash tree then the summer should be fine.
A survey by the Woodland Trust found that the timings of the first buds appearing depends on the springtime temperatures.
Generally oak came first.
Using data collected over 250 years it showed that the proverb is no help in predicting summer rainfall.
This means that in our UK climate, heavy rain doesn't really last for very long, and it largely holds true.
Cloudy and rainy weather can continue for several days at a time but really heavy rain rarely goes on for longer than a couple of days.
It's colder when there's a clear sky because there are no clouds to trap the heat in from the earth's surface.
Stars are the most clearly visible when the air is very dry and clean.
In our case, this kind of air often arrives from the Arctic.
