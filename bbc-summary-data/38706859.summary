The explosive back, one of France's key players, sustained the injury in the first half of Clermont's Champions Cup win over Exeter Chiefs on Saturday.
"He will see a surgeon tomorrow for a very likely operation and a long period of unavailability," the Top 14 club said in a statement.
"He is out of the Six Nations."
France - who finished fifth in last year's tournament - begin their 2017 campaign against reigning Grand Slam champions England at Twickenham on Saturday, 4 February at 16:50 GMT.
