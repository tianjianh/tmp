Flynn, 28, was one of Widnes' longest-serving players, making 168 appearances for the Super League club.
However he only featured once this season and moved on loan to their league rivals Castleford in May, where he scored six tries.
Samoan-born Sa, 29, joined the Vikings from Hull FC in August 2015, playing 13 times in an injury-hit campaign.
Meanwhile, 20-year-old Widnes hooker Almer Salvilla has decided to leave the sport.
