Money will be saved by combining the police and border agency, says Guernsey's new Head of Law Enforcement.

Patrick Rice took up the new role as head of the police and Guernsey Border Agency last week.
The former Guernsey police chief said the business case for the joint role was undeniable.
He admitted it had caused some anxiety among staff and it was his job to allay their concerns with a clear plan for the future.
Mr Rice said: "[The police] collaborate very closely with its colleagues in Jersey, and the border agency does with its colleagues in Jersey as well.
"It is about finding where the duplication is... and where to pool resources, as we have done with our colleagues in Jersey around [police] training."
He said the police and border agency faced the same financial challenges as other States departments and his focus would be to make savings while protecting front line services.
The States of Guernsey is currently undertaking a five-year programme aimed at delivering Â£31m of savings from the annual budget by the end of next year.
