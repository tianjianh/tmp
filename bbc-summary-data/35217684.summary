[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 24-hour strike by Arriva Trains Wales drivers has cancelled all of the operator's services in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Aslef union have walked out on the day many commuters return to work after the Christmas break.
The union said a pay deal had been accepted, but a dispute remained with changes to terms and conditions.
Aslef members have refused to work overtime since 28 December. Arriva said it "regrets" the disruption to more than 1,000 services it runs each day.
"Arriva Trains Wales deeply regrets this disruption which is due to Aslef's failure to accept a generous offer to improve pay and conditions for all our train driver employees," the train operator said in a statement.
The operator runs services in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, the West Midlands, Cheshire and up to Manchester.
Customers are advised to make alternative travel arrangements for Monday and to check travel plans for Tuesday.
A planned strike was called off in November.
