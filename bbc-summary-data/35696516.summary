A new national autism service is to be set up to improve support for children and adults in Wales, the health minister has announced.

It comes after National Autistic Society Cymru criticised "patchy" provision for the 34,000 people with autism and Asperger syndrome in Wales.
It said nearly two-thirds of people wait too long for diagnosis and it wants targets to back up the strategy.
The Welsh government said the new service would be more joined up.
64% had issues in obtaining a referral
30% waited less than six months for a first appointment
23% waited six months to a year
44% rated the assessment process as poor or very poor
73% were not given written information about autism
On Tuesday, the National Autistic Society argued Wales needed its own Autism Act, similar to those in England and Northern Ireland, and called for all Welsh political parties to commit to one before May's assembly elections.
Welsh Conservative leader, Andrew RT Davies, has backed that call.
He said: "Wales is crying out for an Autism Bill to ensure people with autism have additional support and to improve understanding of the condition, and prioritise timely diagnosis through statutory means".
An independent analysis of the current Welsh strategy, published last month, said despite improvements, and Wales leading the way in the UK in forming policies, there were weaknesses and it lacked impact.
This included a lack of priorities which created "islands of good practice" rather than systemic change.
The new service, which is backed by Â£6m from the Welsh government, will be rolled out over the next three years.
It will be a key part of an action plan, which is a refreshed version of one launched eight years ago, and aims to bring together the agencies and health workers involved in supporting people with autism to provide an improved, joined-up service.
The new service will:
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said it would ensure people with autism received "the right support, by the right professional, in the right place, at the right time".
He added: "It will ensure there is consistency across the country, ensuring people with autism are able to access comparable services across Wales."
The "refreshed" action plan will focus on areas such as raising awareness, improving assessment and addressing support issues, including in education and careers support.
