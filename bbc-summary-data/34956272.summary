Prince Harry has had a dramatic fall from his polo pony during a charity match in South Africa.

The prince pulled up his pony but was thrown forward head-first to the ground and broke his fall with his hands.
Play was stopped as Harry was left on his knees before he got up apparently unhurt and swapped mounts.
He captained a team in the event near Cape Town, in aid of his Sentebale charity which supports underprivileged young people in Lesotho.
As the match came to an end, he tumbled to the ground again this time falling between two other players.
Harry is an accomplished polo player like his father the Prince of Wales, and grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh, and regularly plays in competitive and charity matches.
The first charity polo match for Sentebale was held in in 2010, and more than Â£3m has been raised from events in the UK, US, Brazil, Barbados and Abu Dhabi.
Writing a joint message in the official match programme with Sentebale co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, Harry said the support from the event's backers was "vital".
"The success of our previous five polo events has helped Sentebale make a real difference to the lives of vulnerable children in Lesotho," he said.
"The situation in Lesotho remains critical and every day children continue to lose their parents to the HIV/Aids epidemic.
"Sentebale works to protect and support these children providing them with basic necessities we take for granted: food, shelter, care and access to education."
Harry's Sentebale team was beaten 8-7 by opponents Royal Salute at the Val de Vie Estate, with the prince scoring one of the goals.
