Derby County: Gary Rowett targeting one more defensive signing after Curtis Davies

Derby manager Gary Rowett says he wants to sign one more defender to add to the recent arrival of Curtis Davies.

Davies, 32, joined the Rams on a two-year deal to become Rowett's first signing since becoming boss in March.
"The defence was one area we were short of in terms of bodies," Rowett, 43, told BBC Radio Derby.
"This one (Davies' signing) ticks a lot of boxes in that sense and we spoke about getting a couple of deals done early and this is one of that couple."
Rowett added: "You appreciate that the fans are edgy to get one or two deals done but there hasn't been a lot of action - it's been really dead.
"There'll be a flurry of action a week before pre-season starts and a couple of weeks before the start of the season.
"I'd love to say we'll have our complete squad by 28 June when we come back from pre-season, and it's our aim, but that's never going to happen.
"I still think we'll end up brining another defender in at some point - the exact position in the back four would be irrelevant at the moment."
Although he is continuing to add to his squad, Rowett knows he will have to trim his playing staff ahead of his first full campaign in charge.
One player who is back in the picture at Pride Park is winger Andreas Weimann, after his proposed move across the Midlands to Wolves failed to materialise after the Molineux club ended their interest in turning his loan into a permanent transfer following the departure of head coach Paul Lambert.
"It was a really good option - something like Â£2.2m - that Wolves had to sign Andi and we assumed he was leaving," Rowett said.
"They then said they weren't taking it up, which is fine by us - Andi is the type of player who has the characteristics we're looking for.
"But if someone else comes in and offers a deal then we're open-minded, as we are with all our players
"I know there's a lot of interest in our players. We've got some fantastic players that will suit a lot of clubs and we've probably got a couple of players who may want a different type of opportunity."
