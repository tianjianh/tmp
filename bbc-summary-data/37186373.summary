Primal Scream and The Charlatans head a line-up of more than 90 acts who are set to perform at the third edition of the Dumfries and Galloway event.
Organisers hope to see a crowd of about 5,000 at the festival near Thornhill.
Co-founder Nick Roberts said the bill had been carefully crafted to showcase emerging talent alongside more established artists.
He said it was about having a "happy balance" between bands with commercial clout and more "underground" acts.
Mr Roberts said the growing reputation of the event had definitely helped it to attract performers he might previously have considered out of reach.
"If you had said to me last year, 'At next year's festival you're going to have Primal Scream and the Charlatans headlining' I would have called you crazy," he said.
"But here we are."
Meanwhile, police have reminded revellers that making or distributing so-called legal highs are now criminal offences due to recent changes in legislation and anyone found with them will be arrested.
Drug sniffer dogs will also be at the site.
