Drivers  on the Luas tram system in Dublin are taking further strike action this weekend in a dispute over pay.

The latest two-day strike comes as the deadlock between the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (Siptu) and tram operator Transdev continues.
A deal brokered at the Workplace Relations Commission was rejected by workers.
Another two days of industrial action is scheduled for later in April.
