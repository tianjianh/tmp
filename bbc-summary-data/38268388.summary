Chesterfield: Talks on League One club's future 'satisfactory'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield director Ashley Carson says he is confident the club will avoid going into administration.

The club's future was put in doubt when five board members, including chairman Dave Allen, resigned in November.
Carson said Allen has agreed to continue to provide support until "a suitable investor" is found.
"The club will only be sold to someone who will satisfy not only Mr Allen's requirements, but also the long-term best interests of the club," he said.
"I am delighted that we have been able to bring talks to a satisfactory conclusion as there was a very real possibility of the club going into administration, which would have been disastrous."
