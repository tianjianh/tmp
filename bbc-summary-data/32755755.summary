Jake Livermore: Hull & FA suspend player over cocaine test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City midfielder Jake Livermore has been suspended by the Football Association and his club following a positive test for cocaine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Livermore, 25, joined Hull for Â£8m last June from Tottenham.
"The club has suspended Jake Livermore pending further investigations to be made by the Football Association and our own internal disciplinary procedures," a Hull statement read.
Livermore, who has one England cap, has played 39 times for Hull this season.
His international debut came in a friendly against Italy in August 2012.
Players who test positive on match days for illegal 'social' drugs - as opposed to performance-enhancing drugs - can face up to a two-year ban under FA rules.
The FA confirmed a player had failed a drugs test but did not name them. A statement read: "In line with its anti-doping regulations the FA can confirm it has issued a provisional suspension to a participant following a positive test for a prohibited substance."
Prior to signing for Hull permanently, Livermore spent the 2013-14 season on loan at the KC Stadium and has had loan spells at MK Dons, Derby, Peterborough, Ipswich and Leeds.
When he joined Hull, Livermore signed a three-year contract, with the club holding an option for a further 12 months.
Steve Bruce's side are 18th in the Premier League, the last relegation place - two points behind Newcastle and Sunderland and three points adrift of 15th-placed Leicester.
They travel to Tottenham on Saturday (15:00 BST) before ending the season with a home game against Manchester United on Sunday, 24 May.
