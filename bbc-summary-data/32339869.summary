The owner of Neath Rugby Club has been released from police bail, one year after being arrested on suspicion of fraud and money laundering.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Geraint Hawkes, 48, and another man, 43, both from Swansea, were arrested as part of a fraud investigation by the Wales Regional Asset Recovery Team, supported by the National Crime Agency.
Arrests were made at addresses in south Wales, including at Neath RFC.
Gwent Police said two men had been released pending further inquiries.
Mr Hawkes's lawyer said: "Mr Hawkes doesn't really have anything further to add save to confirm that he has been released from police bail and will continue to cooperate with the police."
