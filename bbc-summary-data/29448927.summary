Voices behind new Angry Birds film revealed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's your classic storyline, a group of different birds hurling themselves towards different structures to take out some green piggies.

Well it's worked as a game at least, the Angry Birds app was the first to get 500 million downloads.
So inevitably its makers Rovio are now dipping their toes into the world of film.
An animated feature is set for release in 2016, and they've just announced the cast.
The main character "Red" is set to be played by Jason Sudeikis, and in his first role since Frozen, Josh Gad will play Speedy Chuck.
Arguably the most useful bird, the Bomb, will be played by Danny McBride, who appeared in This is the End with Seth Rogan last year. Bill Hader however, will be on the receiving end of the birds' anger after joining the Pork Side.
Maya Rudolph will act the role of Matilda, and the smooth-talking Tyrion Lannister, or Peter Dinklage, will swap the Game of Thrones set for providing the voice of the Mighty Eagle.
There are a number of supporting roles being added to the flock too, including the YouTube stars Smosh (Ian Andrew Hecox and Anthony Padilla), who have more than 30 million subscribers.
While it might be Rovio's first go at films, they've already enjoyed screen success with their recent animated TV series notching up more than 3 billion views in its first 18 months.
The film's producer Josh Cohen says: "I'm extremely proud of this cast.
"These are some of the funniest people out there today, and we're thrilled to have them all on board."
