Jonathan Pearce: "A Chelsea win will end Arsenal's title challenge. The Gunners are in the last chance saloon where the fat lady is about to go quiet!
"When Arsenal thumped the Blues 3-0 on 24 September they were three points ahead of their rivals after six games.
"A defeat here will leave them 12 points behind them after the subsequent 18 matches - an astonishing swing.
"Antonio Conte's man management has been behind it. His transformation of Diego Costa and David Luiz is astonishing.
"Arsene's Wenger's admission that his players weren't mentally prepared for Watford was equally gobsmacking.
"He surely must play Theo Walcott, Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez up front, with Hector Bellerin recalled. They need quick thinking. Otherwise it'll be Chelsea's day and title."
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte: "Anything can happen. It's important to keep the antenna very high.
"If someone thinks that the league is finished, I'm not so sure. I want to have this tension, this right tension.
"In the past I fight to win the title and I know we must pay great attention. There are 15 games to play and there are a lot of great teams behind us.
"We all know the real potential of Manchester City."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "When we beat them [Chelsea] 3-0 I didn't expect them to win 13 games in a row.
"They have found a better balance, defensively, and they are very good in transition. I watched their game on Wednesday night against Liverpool - N'Golo Kante had a huge impact on their team.
"It is no coincidence they are in the position they are in, and Leicester were the same last season.
[Eden] Hazard and [Diego] Costa have come back to strong form, so they are efficient going forward."
Antonio Conte's side will be thinking they have something to prove against Arsenal after losing heavily at the Emirates Stadium in September.
This is a very different Chelsea side now, not just in formation since their switch to three at the back later that month, but also in mentality - the title is in their sights now.
