New average speed cameras have been turned on in the West Midlands three years after fixed ones were scrapped.

Seven cameras in Birmingham and two in Solihull are to operate for five years.
Fixed cameras in the West Midlands were switched off in 2013 in a bid to save about Â£1m a year and since then only mobile cameras have been used.
Birmingham City Council said criteria such as the number of crashes and casualties were taken into account when choosing the camera sites.

The new cameras are digital and will read motorists' numberplates as they enter and exit the roads where they are sited.
Summer showers had delayed the switch-on by three weeks and had prevented final work and testing.
There will be an initial 21-month evaluation phase to assess the effectiveness of the cameras, equipment and system, the council said.
Between 2010 and 2014 there were 2,078 people killed or seriously injured in Birmingham, an average of 416 per year, according to the authority.
