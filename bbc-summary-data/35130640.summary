[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jack the rabbit treated for aggressive behaviour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A violent lop-eared rabbit is being treated for aggressive behaviour after biting staff at an animal refuge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pet, named Jack, was brought into Maria's Animal Shelter in Probus, Truro, and left Sandra Taylor needing stitches in her hand at hospital.
He was also biting members of staff and running after them if they interfered with his cage.
He is now with a foster carer where he is being encouraged to "have a more positive attitude to humans".
1 Space and exercise - the  minimum acceptable size of a hutch according to the Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund is 6ft x 2ft x 2ft with an attached exercise area of 8ft x 4ft by 2ft high
2 Areas to hide and retreat - often their hutch
3 Proper diet - unlimited hay and grass
4 Free from fear - due to their keen senses rabbits can quickly make fearful associations
Jack started showing his wayward side about three weeks ago.
Maria Mulkeen, who owns the refuge at Probus, said: "He started nipping people and got worse.
"I was outside feeding other rabbits when I heard screaming and a volunteer was being chase around and being bitten by Jack.
"I have never seen a rabbit do that before - he was like a psychopath. Even if we were cleaning out his hutch he would come over and attack you."
She asked Cornwall animal behaviourist Carol Valvona for advice and she recommended one-to-one care.
Jack is now staying with foster carer Sandra McIlduff from Tresillian.
Ms McIlduff said: "He is getting better. I have picked up on what stresses him out. If you move too quickly around him he doesn't like it he thinks you are going to grab him.
"He's actually a big softy if you get down to his level."
Ms Valvona said: "The most important difference between the rabbit, and dogs and cats, is it is a prey animal.
"If your whole life revolves around avoiding becoming someone else's lunch, you will be on the alert and easily scared."
