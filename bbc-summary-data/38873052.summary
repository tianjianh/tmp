The shooting happened at the Second City Suite in Sherlock Street, in the city centre, on Saturday evening.
The victim, aged 30, is in a stable condition in hospital, the West Midlands force said.
Two men, aged 18 and 22, have been arrested on suspicion of assault and two others, aged 26 and 31, remain in custody on suspicion of firearms offences.
Det Supt Tom Chisholm said: "This is a fast-paced inquiry, we have spoken to a number of witnesses and there is CCTV coverage in the area.
"I would urge anyone who has not yet spoken to us and has information which would assist to come forward as soon as possible."
Officers have cordoned off the area around Sherlock Street and Hurst Street and are examining the CCTV footage.
