The Cardiff-born peer is one of five non-executive members named by the BBC for the new body.
Cardiff University professor Ian Hargreaves is also included on the unitary board, which succeeds the BBC Trust and includes senior BBC managers.
The post for Wales remains vacant after Welsh ministers vetoed the UK Government's choice of Dr Carol Bell.
"I am delighted to be asked to join the Board of the BBC at this exciting time of challenge and opportunity," said Baroness Grey-Thompson.
She said she had "grown up as an avid fan" of the BBC and had been "fortunate over time to work for them in various guises".
"The world is changing at a rapid pace and competition [in the media] is stronger than ever," she added.
"I want the BBC to be a strong part of the future of broadcasting across the UK and around the world."
Prof Hargreaves, a former newspaper editor and senior BBC manager, said: "I look forward to playing my part in working for an independent and creatively outstanding BBC."
The position of a board member representing Wales is to be re-advertised following a dispute between the UK and Welsh governments over the appointment of Dr Bell.
A businesswoman with a background in the oil and gas industry, she has previously held board and trustee roles with S4C, National Museum Wales and the Wales Millennium Centre.
Alun Davies, the minister who handles broadcasting matters for the Welsh Government, wrote to UK Culture Secretary Karen Bradley saying he felt "dismay" at being asked to accept Dr Bell or re-open the process, rather than choose one of the other shortlisted candidates.
