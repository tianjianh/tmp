Euro 2016: Will Grigg & Kyle Lafferty should start for NI - team selector users

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland fans think Michael O'Neill should play 4-4-2 at Euro 2016 - with Will Grigg starting alongside Kyle Lafferty.

Despite qualifying for their first European Championships mainly playing with one striker, the majority of users of BBC Sport's team selector have gone for a more attacking line-up.
Almost 30,000 teams have been chosen so far, with West Brom defender Jonny Evans and Southampton midfielder Steven Davis getting the most picks - 28,000 apiece.
Lafferty - who scored seven in nine qualification games - is third choice (25,500), and in-form Wigan striker Grigg is the sixth-most selected player (21,000).
O'Neill's team finished top of their qualifying group and will take on Poland, Ukraine and Germany at Euro 2016.
Despite starting the final five Group E qualifying games, Hamilton goalkeeper Michael McGovern is very much the second-choice among fans (7,000 picks) behind veteran Roy Carroll (16,000).
Those playing just in front of the goalkeeper were also in the forefront of fans' minds, with West Brom centre-back Gareth McAuley and Manchester United defender Paddy McNair among the top five most selected players.
Grigg just missed out on the top five after a 28-goal promotion season for Wigan and 88th-minute strike in Northern Ireland's 3-0 warm-up friendly win over Belarus.
In order of the most selections to the fewest, here are the most popular Northern Ireland players after almost 30,000 teams were selected:
