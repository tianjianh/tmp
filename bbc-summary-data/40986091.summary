Her safari-inspired picture book, named The Ugly Five, focuses on wildebeest, hyenas, warthogs, vultures and marabou storks.
Julia gave live performances of her work during two sessions at the park on Saturday.
She took time out from performing to meet the park's vulture, Kevin.
The event was in aid of the Stirling-based charity Artlink Central, which works with disadvantaged or marginalised people in society.
Julia, who lives in England, said: "When I am up in Scotland it's nice to do something with them because they're such a worthwhile charity."
