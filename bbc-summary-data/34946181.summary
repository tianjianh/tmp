A "truly transformational" £200m investment to be focused on the Crichton estate in Dumfries has been announced.

It is being made by Jansons Property, an investor and developer, in conjunction with the Crichton Trust.
Included in the plans are a purpose-built campus for the University of the West of Scotland, a museum, and student residences.
It could also see two new grandstands built at Queen of the South's stadium.
The Crichton Trust unveiled full details of the project alongside Jansons Property, which works in partnership with the William Pears Group.
The full range of benefits includes:
Andy Jansons, managing director of Jansons Property, said it was pleased to be involved in the "exciting development".
"We will bring together the funding and expertise to deliver appropriate projects for the Crichton and the community of Dumfries and Galloway," he said.
Rob Shaw, Crichton Trust chief executive said it was "the most compelling and tangible investment opportunity" that the region had had "in living memory".
He described it as a "truly transformational investment" and a "very exciting day" for Scotland and Dumfries and Galloway.

We tend to believe things when we see them in Dumfries and Galloway.
It is a natural consequence of a number of major investments mooted which have, ultimately, failed to materialise.
A dose of doubt is a healthy thing but so, too, is a splash of enthusiasm.
The proof of this investment pudding will come when the diggers move in and the buildings start to take shape.
However, the credentials of those involved should give some cause for optimism.
Even if they only deliver half of the "aspirational" projects outlined at the official launch today, it would make a huge difference to the town, the region and further afield.
Jansons Property said it was committed to its initial investment and had signalled that further funds would be available "should further opportunities emerge".
Councillor Colin Smyth said Dumfries and Galloway Council had continued to "invest significantly" in the site since the local authority acquired it in 1995.
"There are a lot of major projects we want to see come to fruition to ensure the Crichton fulfils its massive potential but in a way that preserves this historical site which is close to the hearts of the people of Dumfries and beyond," he said.
"That will require significant investment of the scale being proposed and really could help deliver on our number one priority to build the local economy and create jobs and opportunities for local people."
