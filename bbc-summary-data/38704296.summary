Former British spy and author Ted Allbeury, from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, wrote The Twentieth Day of January during heightened cold war tensions in 1980.
The 37-year-old novel has attracted a fresh wave of attention as its plot reflects current concerns about US politics today.
Donald Trump was sworn in as US President on Friday after a controversial campaign which included claims Russian spies were involved in hacking during the election campaign.
