[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sgt Bowe Bergdahl quit Afghan post to 'expose problems'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl left his post in Afghanistan six years ago to express concerns with his unit's leadership, an officer has testified.

Those "problems" were unsubstantiated, Maj Gen Kenneth Dahl told a courtroom in San Antonio, Texas.
Sgt Bergdhal was captured by the Taliban and released after five years in a controversial prisoner swap.
He is charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy.
The hearing at Fort Sam Houston, at which Sgt Bergdahl did not testify, was held to determine whether there is enough evidence to have a military trial.
Sgt Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban just 24 hours after he left his post in 2009 and he was finally released last year in exchange for five Taliban commanders held at US detention centre Guantanamo Bay.
The move sparked controversy in the US with Republicans saying the deal could have put American lives at risk.
Gen Dahl said he did not think Sgt Bergdahl should go to prison.
If convicted, he faces life in prison or a dishonourable discharge from the military.
Commanding officers from his unit testified on Friday that searching for Sgt Bergdahl put other soldiers in danger.
He originally wanted to end up at a forward operating base about 19 miles (30km) away and create a "PR event" that would enable him to get the attention of a general, the court heard.
"He felt it was his duty to intervene," said Gen Dahl of Sgt Bergdahl's reasons for leaving the unit, and said his perceptions about issues were "completely off the mark."
The soldier felt the problems were so severe that they put his platoon in danger, but that was not true, said the officer.
Sgt Bergdahl had claimed another soldier in his unit kicked rocks over Afghan graves, but that was not substantiated.
A Department of Defense employee who helped debrief Sgt Bergdahl after his release told the court he had been kept in conditions akin to those experienced in the Vietnam War.
The injuries sustained were both physical and mental, the court heard.
