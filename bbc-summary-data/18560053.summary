The 20-year-old made 34 appearances for Birmingham after joining the club from Derby County in 2007.
Mutch spent loan spells at Doncaster, Hereford and Watford, where he played under Cardiff manager Malky Mackay.
"I'm delighted that we've managed to bring Jordon in here at Cardiff City," said Mackay.
"Jordon is a top player with great potential for a big career in the game, which we hope to see him fulfil with us here at Cardiff City."
Cardiff concluded the transfer with Birmingham City after Mutch agreed personal terms and passed a medical.
He is Cardiff's the second summer signing following the arrival of goalkeeper Joe Lewis from Peterborough United.
"He's a talented player who I know well, both from my time working with him back at Watford and from the progress he's made at Birmingham City," added Mackay.
"His record of playing right through from under-17s to under-21s for England is also impressive and Jordon will no doubt make a great addition to the squad that we are building here in south Wales."
