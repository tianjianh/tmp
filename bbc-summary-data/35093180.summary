The 25-year-old, who was allowed to leave the Broncos with a year remaining on his contract, also has a second-year option with the Wildcats.
Walton played just six times for the Broncos in 2015 after leaving Salford.
"Jason has immediately impressed everyone at the Wildcats with his enthusiasm," said coach Brian Smith.
"His rugby talents and strong physical attributes suggest that Jason will make a real contribution in this big opportunity for him."
