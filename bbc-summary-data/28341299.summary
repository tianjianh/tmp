The 58-year-old actor will reprise his role as President Lyndon B Johnson in a TV adaptation of the Broadway play All the Way.
Cranston won a Tony for his Broadway debut in Robert Schenkkan's play about the first year of Lyndon's presidency following JFK's assassination.
Cable network HBO has acquired the rights to turn the play into a TV movie, starring Cranston.
The play focuses on two parallel storylines: Johnson's battle to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and his campaign for re-election.
Schenkkan will adapt the play for television, with Steven Spielberg among the executive producers. Schenkkan previously earned two Emmy nominations and a WGA award for his miniseries The Pacific, also on HBO.
Last month Cranston, who recently starred in Godzilla, won the Tony for best lead actor in a play. The actor garnered rave reviews from critics for his performance in All the Way, with the New York Times hailing Cranston's "terrific portrayal".
HBO Films received 99 Emmy nominations last week, including 16 for Ryan Murphy's adaptation of Larry Kramer's play The Normal Heart.
Last year, the cable network won multiple awards for the made-for-TV film Behind the Candelabra, starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.
