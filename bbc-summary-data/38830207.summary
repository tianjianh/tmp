[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old is a free agent after leaving Fleetwood Town and Notts player-manager Kevin Nolan has taken his ex-Newcastle team-mate on a trial basis at the League Two club.
Nolan last week revealed his interest in signing Carlton Cole.
But Magpies chairman Alan Hardy has said that the former England striker will not be moving to Meadow Lane.
Notts signed five players in the final 36 hours of the January transfer window, with Nolan also registering as a player.
Arsenal defender Marc Bola, Nottingham Forest's Jorge Grant, Hull defender Josh Clackstone and West Brom forward Tahvon Campbell all joined on loan on Tuesday.
Blackpool winger Mark Yeates signed a permanent deal the previous day.
