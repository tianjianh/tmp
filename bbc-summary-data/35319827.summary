[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor Nichola Mallon has been selected to contest the Northern Ireland Assembly election in North Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
If elected, the former lord mayor of the city would replace Alban Maginness, the current SDLP MLA for North Belfast.
Mr Maginness announced this month that he would be retiring from politics.
Ms Mallon was selected by party members at a convention in the Lansdowne Hotel in Belfast on Thursday evening.
She said it was "a great honour" to be selected to defend the seat for her party and "a privilege" to take over from Mr Maginness.
"Alban has been a tireless servant for the people of north Belfast," she said.
"His dedication to justice, human rights and the defence of civil liberties will mean his voice is sorely missed from politics here."
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: "Her dedication to, and compassion for, people in the city is clear to everyone who meets her and contributed to a powerful and uniquely successful year as lord mayor."
