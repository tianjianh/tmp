South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (SYFRS) delivered a load of redundant tools, clothing and kit to Albufeira on the Algarve.
Nine out of ten firefighters in Portugal are volunteers who rely on gear donations, the fire service said.
The shipment included hose-reel fittings, ropes and tools.
The equipment will now be repaired and used by the Albufeira fire service.
Nuno Correira, of the Albufeira fire service, said: "It's completely overwhelming and the equipment really will make a big difference."
Andy Strelczenie, of SYFRS, said: "When the request came to help our colleagues overseas we were only too happy to help."
