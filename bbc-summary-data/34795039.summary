The Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.03% at 19,697.77.
Japan's core machinery orders - seen as a good indicator of company spending - rose by 7.5% in September from a month earlier, the first rise in four months.
Orders were down 1.7% from a year earlier, but this was not as bad as forecasts for a drop of about 4%.
While the numbers were better than expected, analysts said they still reflected the continuing slowdown in China, one of Japan's most important trading partners.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 index also closed flat, up just 0.06% at 5,125.70 despite strong jobs numbers.
The economy created 58,600 net new jobs in October, the data showed, with the jobless rate dropping to 5.9% from 6.2%.
South Korea's benchmark Kospi index closed down 0.15% at 1,994.75 after the Bank of Korea kept its interest rate on hold.
The one bright spot in the region was Hong Kong where the benchmark Hang Seng index was up 1.98% at 22,793.03, boosted by technology shares.
Shares in Chinese computer and smartphone giant Lenovo rose 5% after its losses for the three months to September were not has bad as expected.
The company reported a net loss of $714m after taking hefty charges to cover restructuring costs, but this was not as bad as expectations for a loss of more than $785m.
Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6% at 3,628.07 in late afternoon trade.
