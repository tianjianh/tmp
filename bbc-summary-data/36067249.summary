Dalriada School, Ballymoney, was named the top senior choir in Northern Ireland.
St Patrick's Primary School, Rathfriland, won the junior choir prize.
Sixty-five choirs had battled over the course of nine weeks for a place in the final at Belfast's Ulster Hall.
Six finalists performed two songs each in Sunday's final, which was broadcast live on BBC Radio Ulster.
Dalriada School performed 'The Conversion of Saul' and 'The Lord Bless You And Keep You', while St Patrick's Primary School performed 'Can You Hear Me?' and 'Ching-A-Ring-Chaw'.
In the junior category, Holy Family Primary, Omagh, was the runner-up, and Carrickfergus Grammar came second in the senior grade.
The other finalists were Ebrington Primary School, Londonderry, in the junior section and New Bridge Integrated College, Loughbrickland, in the senior category.
Vocal coach and television presenter Carrie Grant was the special guest judge and presented the schools with their awards.
The competition is produced in association with the Ulster Youth Choir, and supported by the Arts Council for Northern Ireland.
The two winning choirs will feature on range of BBC Radio Ulster's programming during this year.
BBC Radio Ulster School Choir Of The Year is available on the BBC Radio iPlayer and video clips and photos from the competition are available on the BBC website.
