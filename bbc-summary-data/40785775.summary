[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 1-2 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Karl Robinson's selection gamble paid off as Charlton came from behind late on to beat Exeter in the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Addicks boss made 11 changes from the side which opened their League One campaign with a 1-0 win over Bristol Rovers.
And it looked like Robinson was going to be left red-faced when Lee Holmes' 54th-minute free-kick evaded a clutch of players and nestled in the far corner.
But Charlton staged a stirring fightback to seal their place in the second round.
Billy Clarke came off the bench to fire the equaliser after 72 minutes before academy product Regan Charles-Cook produced an accomplished finish to seal the outcome.
Charlton were reduced to 10 men in the 82nd minute when Andrew Crofts saw red for a late challenge on Matt Jay but the League One side held on.
