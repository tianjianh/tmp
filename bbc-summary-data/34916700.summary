Magherafelt-born Jonathan Anderson won both best menswear and best womenswear designer in London.
"We're just delighted and it's lovely for Northern Ireland as well," said his father Willie Anderson.
"We rang him last night and he was just overwhelmed," he said.
"He thought he would have a chance at the women's wear but he didn't think he would get both.
"He's worked so hard, he kind of takes it in his stride."
Willie said he was aware of Jonathan's creative talent from a young age.
"He had always had a tendency when he was 11 or 12 he would have done little matchstick drawings and designed them," Willie said.
"We knew what he could do. Fashion design was his forte and he came to that decision, it wasn't us.
"We would have backed him in whatever he wanted and we backed him as all parents would do."
Willie said he knew that Jonathan would not be putting on rugby boots like his father.
"I knew pretty early on that he wouldn't," he said. "As far as I'm concerned, as long as he's healthy and happy, it didn't matter what he did.
"But he's certainly a global super star at the moment."
