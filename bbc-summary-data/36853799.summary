Gotze, 24, made 83 Bundesliga appearances for Dortmund before joining Bayern Munich in 2013.
The size of the deal is unknown, although reports have suggested it is in the region of £20m.
"I have since his departure in 2013, always hoped that he will one day return to us," Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told the club website.
Gotze helped Bayern to three Bundesliga titles, as well as scoring Germany's winning goal at the 2014 World Cup.
His move to Bayern for a reported 37m euros (£31.5m) was the most expensive German transfer at the time.
