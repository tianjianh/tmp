"At this stage, based on the evidence gathered, no formal action will be taken,'' said a statement by New South Wales police.
Photographer Kristi Miller complained to police about an incident outside a cinema on 23 August, saying she thought Gibson was "going to punch me".
The actor's publicist said the star was "satisfied" at the police decision.
Gibson's lawyer in Sydney, Christopher Murphy, was informed of the police decision not to press charges on Thursday.
"Mel Gibson has totally denied from the onset these disgraceful allegations,'' said a statement issued by publicists Rogers and Cowan.
"He is now satisfied that the police, after speaking to witnesses and reviewing CCTV footage and other evidence, have found there is no substance to the claim."
The Daily Telegraph's Miller, 39, claimed Gibson launched into a tirade after she took pictures of the actor and his 24-year-old girlfriend, Rosalind Ross, leaving an Israeli Film Festival screening at the Palace Verona Cinema in a suburb of Sydney on Sunday 23 August.
The Braveheart director, who fell out of favour in Hollywood after a series of public outbursts, is currently shooting World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge in Australia.
