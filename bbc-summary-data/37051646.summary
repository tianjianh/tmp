[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' part-time traffic commissioner will now be working full time thanks to Â£210,000 of Welsh Government funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nick Jones has been responsible since 2007 for licensing and regulating buses, coaches and good vehicles.
His previous part-time role also covered the West Midlands, but from October he will be dedicated to Wales with three bilingual support staff.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said there would be "increased and more effective engagement" with the industry.
"Infrastructure improvements across Wales, as well as our M4 around Newport projects and Metro proposals, provide an exciting opportunity to tackle some of our most longstanding traffic and infrastructure difficulties," he added.
The new Welsh Government funding will be added to Mr Jones's existing budget from the UK Department for Transport.
