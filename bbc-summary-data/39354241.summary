New Zealand leg-spinner Ish Sodhi hopes his stint playing in Nottinghamshire's T20 campaign this summer will lead to a longer stay in England.

The 24-year-old has played 41 international matches in all formats.
He has been particularly effective in T20, with 21 wickets at 14.47 and a strike-rate of a wicket every 13 balls.
"In the last year or so I have definitely been a lot more successful in the T20 stuff than in the other stuff," he told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"But in the last six months I have been finding my way in the four-stuff and one-dayers.
"In the future I would love to come over and play all the forms. At this stage the T20 is the main focus. It is still a wee, wee way away but I will continue to look to hone my T20 skills and try to be in tip-top condition when I come over."
Sodhi says playing in England is a "great opportunity" with the 2019 World Cup in mind.
"It's great to play at these grounds where I will potentially play a World Cup, which I am targeting," he said.
"It will be great to get used to conditions. The opportunity came up and I will try to grab it with both hands."
Sodhi will be the second of two overseas players at Trent Bridge, with Australian all-rounder Dan Christian returning after being a member of the side that won nine matches in a row in 2016 to reach T20 Finals Day.
"It's a fantastic competition and I am big fan of Finals Day," he added. "We get most of the live stuff back here. It's a great concept playing two T20 games in a day - it is not something we get over here.
"In T20 sometimes being instinctive and being on a roll, the quicker you do things the better."
