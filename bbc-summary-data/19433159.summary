The officers were executing a warrant at a house in Bordesley Green at about midnight, West Midlands Police said.
Three men, aged 21, 27 and 34, are being held on suspicion of conspiracy to possess a controlled drug with intent to supply.
Officers seized a "large quantity" of suspected Class A drugs, police said.
All 11 have since been released from hospital.
"Inquiries are ongoing to establish exactly what the liquid was, although early indications suggest it may have been petrol mixed with an illegal drug, possibly heroin," a police spokesman said.
Fire crews assessed the scene, in Mill Burn Way, and established there was no further risk posed by the substance.
The house remains cordoned off and a number of road restrictions have since been lifted, police added.
Both the officers and men arrested suffered sickness and breathing difficulties after being exposed to the substance.
West Midlands Police was supporting officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), who executed the warrant in relation to illegal drugs.
Officers from both Soca and the West Midlands force became ill, West Midlands Police said.
Ch Insp Lee Wharmby said: "Events such as this always raise concern in communities, but I want to be clear that this is about drugs alone and not connected to terrorism."
He said the men were taken to Heartland Hospital for treatment.
"There are no long lasting effects for anybody within the local community," he added.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said 12 decontamination staff were put on standby but not needed.
