[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shropshire primary schools shut due to snow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two primary schools have closed in Shropshire due to snow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brown Clee in Ditton Priors and Clunbury have shut, Shropshire Council announced.
The Met Office had predicted ice and isolated wintry showers easing, but more cloud in the afternoon with rain and strengthening winds reaching Church Stretton by the evening.
It said at night rain would quickly spread eastwards, becoming heavy at times, as winds reach gale force.
