Jessie Wallace and Shane Ritchie, who play an often unhappy pair in the BBC soap, will star in a six-part series to air next year.
Richie said: "Both Jessie and I are absolutely thrilled to be given this amazing opportunity.
"To have a whole drama focused around Kat and Alfie is a huge honour for us both and we just can't wait to start filming."
Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said on screen the two characters would temporarily leave Albert Square for a period of soul-searching and adventures in Ireland.
"In the next few weeks on EastEnders, viewers will witness several huge twists for Kat and Alfie Moon that will change their lives forever," he said.
"Now is the perfect time to take two of EastEnders' most beloved and enduring characters out of their comfort zone as they head to Ireland to search for answers to some very big questions."
He added: "My team here are very excited about creating a whole new drama that stands apart from EastEnders while taking our style of storytelling to a place of stories, myth, secrets and immeasurable beauty."
