RAF serviceman Corrie Mckeague went missing after a night out in Bury St Edmunds in September.
After a high-profile missing persons campaign, police revealed in March he may have ended up in a bin lorry.
About 4,430 tonnes of waste have been searched so far at a landfill site at Milton, Cambridgeshire.
On Monday, Suffolk Constabulary announced it would be continuing its search for the missing 23-year-old.
A police spokeswoman said: "The work is constantly being reviewed and, as the search team are still finding items from the right time frame that are identifiable as coming from the town, the search will continue on a week by week basis.
"Throughout the search officers have been working to understand exactly where waste was deposited and how it may have been spread out during the process.
"This week police will be bulk-moving further material to allow the work to continue."
The force said it had carried out further work based on the GPS data from the refuse truck which brought the waste to the landfill site.
This information, the spokeswoman said, meant the area being searched at the tip had been expanded.
