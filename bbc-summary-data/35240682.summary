[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth girls ate cat food and drank urine, court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three girls who were sexually abused by men visiting their prostitute mother ate cat food and drank their own urine, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jurors at Plymouth Crown Court were told that one of the girls tried to kill herself when she was aged seven.
Their mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was also said to have lashed out with "bamboo, belts and brushes".
She was jailed for five years for acts of cruelty between 1976 and 1988.
The woman, convicted on eight counts, worked as a prostitute from the family home. There she allowed visiting men access to her daughters who were then of primary school age, prosecutors said.
One daughter told the court that she and the others were given a bucket to use as a toilet, but had no water to drink, leaving them so thirsty they drank their own urine.
Social workers put the three girls and their brother into children's homes. On one occasion they had found them eating cat food.
Prosecutor Sean Brunton said the cruelty was "almost Victorian in its bleakness".
The girls' mother denied ten charges of cruelty and was cleared on two counts.
Raymond Williams, 60, formerly of Dovedale Road, Plymouth, who denied two indecent assaults on one of the girls in 1981 and 1982, was convicted and jailed for three years.
The jury heard a second man, Ralph Burns, 57, had been due to stand trial charged with rape but he died two weeks before the case started.
