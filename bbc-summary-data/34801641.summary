Large waves are expected to hit the Welsh coast over the next few days due to strong coastal winds, Wales' environment body has warned.

People in coastal areas, especially in Cardigan Bay, have been advised to be alert for flooding and to be prepared.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the threat is due to a combination of high tides and a strong wind.
Eight flood alerts were in place on Thursday evening but no warnings.
Scott Squires, from NRW, warned "some large waves could splash over sea defences".
Meanwhile, heavy and persistent rain is expected to affect Wales over the weekend, particularly in the north.
People travelling over the next three days have been told to take extra care and allow more time for their journey.
NRW said it will issue flood alerts and warnings if rivers "reach trigger levels".
