Three people have been charged in connection with an alleged attack on taxi drivers on the Isle of Wight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gina Alexander, 24, and Karin Alexander, 22, both of Priors Walk, Newport, have been charged with affray.
Conor Patrick, 22, of Edinburgh Road, Freshwater, faces the same charge. All three will attend Newport Magistrates' Court on 12 August.
It comes after a gang allegedly attacked three taxi drivers at a rank in Newport on 13 April.
The incident on South Street led to a boycott by firms who refused to service ranks across the town.
