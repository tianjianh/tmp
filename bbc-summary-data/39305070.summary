[SN]TITLE[SN]
Borders fox-hunting trial adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of two huntsmen accused of breaching Scotland's fox hunting legislation has been adjourned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Legal reasons meant no evidence could be led on the second day of the trial of John Clive Richardson, 66, and his 24-year-old son Johnny Riley.
The pair, both members of the Jedforest Hunt who live near Bonchester Bridge, deny deliberately hunting a fox with hounds near Jedburgh in February 2016.
The trial will resume at Jedburgh Sheriff Court on 27 April.
Deliberately hunting a fox with hounds has been illegal in Scotland since the introduction of the Protection of Wild Mammals Act 2002.
