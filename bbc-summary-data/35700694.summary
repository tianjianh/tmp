Aregawi, who won gold at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow and 2014 World Indoor Championships in Sopot, has requested that a B-sample is tested.
The Ethiopia-born Swede, 25, failed an out-of-competition test conducted by governing body the IAAF.
Agent Valentijn Trouw said Aregawi was "shocked and devastated" by the news.
In an interview with the BBC World Service, Trouw added that Aregawi does not know how the drugs got into her system.
