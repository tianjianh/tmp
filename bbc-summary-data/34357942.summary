Five-year assemblies too long, says Welsh Tory leader

The five-year gap between assembly elections is too long, Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies has said.

The poll was set for May 2016 to avoid a clash with the 2015 general election.
There have been suggestions the extended term has left ministers and AMs with too little to do, leading some to dub it a "zombie" assembly.
Mr Davies told BBC Wales five years was "a considerable stretch", claiming a shorter term would make democracy "fresh".
In 2011, the assembly's term was changed from four years to five years by the Westminster government to avoid future clashes with UK general elections - themselves now fixed every five years.
The assembly's five-year cycle was made permanent in the 2014 Wales Act, but control over the issue will pass to Cardiff Bay under new legislation due to be published in the autumn.
Mr Davies told the Sunday Politics Wales programme: "We're certainly going to be rolling our sleeves up and getting on with the work.
"But I do think to make democracy relevant, to make democracy fresh, I do think you need to shorten that term."
He added that there were also problems caused by the high number of AMs standing down next May.
"With the best will in the world, many people's minds wander when they are looking at what they are going to do after the election," he said.
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood told the programme the Welsh government was not "making the most of the opportunity that presents itself" with a five-year term.
Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said: "The Welsh government and Welsh ministers seem content to let us drift towards the election."
First Minister Carwyn Jones said the Welsh government had adapted to the five-year term as Westminster had done and Scotland would have to.
"There's a lot of legislation to get through before the assembly rises for the election," he said.
"From my point of view, it's never quiet."
