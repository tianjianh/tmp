More than 15,000 homes and businesses in just eight council areas were flooded in last winter's storms, a survey has revealed.

The research for the Local Government Association found that councils are still helping flood-hit homes recover.
Cumbria was the worst hit, it said. Calderdale, Lancashire, North Yorkshire, York, Leeds, Northumberland and Kirklees all suffered too.
The control of flood defence funds should be devolved, the LGA said.
The government should also bring in mandatory anti-flood requirements for new homes in building regulations, such as raised electrical sockets and wiring, ventilation brick covers, sealed floors and raised damp courses, it said.
A flood resilience review by the government into the winter storms outlined Â£12.5m for temporary defences such as barriers and high-volume water pumps at strategic areas.
Councils are encouraging people to check if they are at risk of flooding this year, to sign up to flood warnings and make sure their homes are prepared.
Martin Tett, LGA environment spokesman, said: "Councils are doing everything they can to protect households and businesses from the possibility of further devastating flooding this winter.
"Such was the severity of last year's storms, some councils, who have experienced significant reductions to their core funding, are still helping residents to recover even now."
He said devolving funding to local areas would support projects that reflected needs such as protecting key roads and bridges to keep residents and businesses moving.
"Councils know their local areas and are best placed to help families get back on their feet," he said.
"The government must be more flexible in its approach to flood funding."
