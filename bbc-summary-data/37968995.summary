It comes a day after those killed in the accident where named by the British Transport Police (BTP).
They were Donald Collett, 62, from Croydon, Philip Logan, 52, and Robert Huxley, 63, both from New Addington.
Those already named were Mark Smith, Dane Chinnery, Phil Seary and Dorota Rynkiewicz.
Bishop Jonathan Clarke of Croydon Minster read out the names during the cathedral's annual service of remembrance for the fallen in two world wars and in other conflicts.
The tram driver, Alfred Dorris, 42, from Beckenham, south-east London, is currently on bail.
He was arrested after the derailment on suspicion of manslaughter. Investigations into the crash are continuing.
A spokesman for FirstGroup, which operates the south London tram network for TfL said: "We can confirm that Alfred Dorris has worked for us since March 2008.
"Given the ongoing investigation we don't have anything further to add at this point."
After the service, Croydon Mayor Wayne Trakas-Lawlor said: it was an "incredibly sad day for Croydon".
"Croydon is a town in mourning and our thoughts and prayers are with those affected. May those who lost their lives, rest in eternal peace," he said.
The tram carriages were removed by accident investigators and taken away on the back of two lorries on Saturday morning.
All sections have now been taken away from the scene as the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) continues its inquiry.
Transport for London (TfL) said its engineers were making "good progress" with repairs to the tram track at the scene of the accident, but that services between East Croydon and Harrington Road, Addington Village and Elmers End would remain suspended on Monday.
TfL said it was not yet in a position to say when tram services would resume.
Families and friends of those who died have paid tribute.
The family of Mr Logan described him as "a true family man and generous friend to all, with a magnificently dry sense of humour".
"Phil was a man with more love, compassion and zest for life than words can express. He will be immensely missed by all that knew him", they said.
The family and friends of Mr Collett said he was a "well loved, funny and generous man, who could light up a room with his smile".
The family of Robert Huxley described him as "a larger than life character" and loving husband, father and grandfather.
In a statement they said: "This tragedy will have far reaching consequences and impact many people for a significant time. We are all heartbroken."
A group of up to 100 people walked to the site of the crash on Saturday carrying banners, flags and flowers.
Addressing mourners, one man said: "I've got a huge hole in my life which I've got to fill in and it's going to take to the day I die."
A crowdfunding website set up by Croydon Council in the wake of the derailment has so far raised more than Â£11,000 to help the families of the victims.
The family of Phil Seary, 57, from New Addington, said he was a "much loved wonderful son, faithful husband and a loving and doting father".
Mr Seary's daughter, Karina Mimms, said he was "a gentle giant... He had an absolute heart of gold and would do anything for anybody".
Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, from New Addington, was the only woman to die in the crash.
Simon Smith, chief executive of SSP UK where she worked, said the company "offered our heartfelt condolences to her family and we are doing all we can to support them at this difficult time."
Nineteen-year-old Dane Chinnery, from New Addington, was described as "a beautiful lad".
Barbara Dumbleton, a family friend, said the teenager "always had a smile on his face... he was absolutely lovely."
St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, said three patients remained in a serious condition following surgery.
Croydon Council said some had suffered "life-changing" injuries.
