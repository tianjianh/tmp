Scores of firefighters have tackled the blaze at a glass bottle manufacturing factory on Towngate Link in Cross Green Way, about a mile from the city centre.
The fire at Allied Glass's single-storey warehouse and bottle decoration unit, which is about 328ft (100m) long, started after midnight on Friday.
The company said 21 people were working inside when the blaze broke out and no-one was injured.
About 35 firefighters remain at the scene to dampen down the fire, which has been brought under control.

Operations Director Richard Summers said more than 10,000 pallets of glass had been "completely destroyed" by the fire.
"It's catastrophic. Everything's levelled to the floor. It really has taken the whole warehouse.
"It looks like the site will have to be demolished and rebuilt."
West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said the fire was still burning and it expected crews to remain on site over the weekend.
Group Manager Gary Clare said: "The building structure is now unstable and for that reason we cannot commit firefighters inside it so we are tackling the areas that are still burning from outside using aerial jets."
Mr Summers said he hoped the company could "maintain supply albeit not at the same level" at a temporary site.
An investigation has started into the cause of the blaze, and roads surrounding Cross Green Way have been closed.
