Fancy Bears hacking: Alistair Brownlee TUE file made public

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Double Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee has become the latest British athlete to have medical documents made public by hackers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Files show Brownlee was given a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for the drug acetazolamide, which helps glaucoma and altitude sickness.
Brownlee confirmed the drug was given in October 2013 "to treat altitude sickness while climbing Kilimanjaro".
The files of 19 other athletes were published by Fancy Bears on Monday.
A TUE allows an athlete, for medical reasons, to take a prescribed substance or have treatment that is otherwise prohibited.
British athletes must contact their national governing body or follow Ukad guidance before applying for a TUE.
