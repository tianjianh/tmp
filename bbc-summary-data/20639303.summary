McNulty, will lead the 19-strong GB team at next week's World Short Course Championships in Istanbul, wants to stay in charge of British Swimming's intensive training centre in Bath.
Furniss and Nesbit have the respect of every coach in Great Britain
"I love coaching day-to-day and I think we can achieve even more at Bath over the next four years," said McNulty.
"For me Bill Furniss and Chris Nesbit would both be ideal [as the new boss]."
Furniss guided Adlington to double Olympic gold in Beijing and two bronze medals in London.
For five years Nesbit was in charge of GB's successful programme in which swimmers were trained in Australia during Bill Sweetenham's time as GB swimming boss, and Nesbit also led England to 34 swimming medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.
Following the post-Olympic departure of previous head coach Dennis Pursley, British Swimming delayed the appointment of his replacement while a review was conducted into the sport's "disappointing" performance at the London Games.
The findings of the review, published earlier this week, stated that the British Swimming programme was "not broken", despite subsequent claims by Rebecca Adlington that the sport was an "absolute mess".
"They [Furniss and Nesbit] are guys who I have respected over the years," continued McNulty, whose views are backed by Adlington.
"For 20-30 years they have consistently produced great swimmers and they have the respect and clout of every coach in Great Britain."

Under McNulty's stewardship, British Swimming's Intensive Training Centre [ITC] at the University of Bath produced four London Olympians, including the country's best performer at the Games in Olympic silver medallist Michael Jamieson.
The head coach admitted he may be interested in the Great Britain role "in the future", adding that although he does not want the job at the moment he is excited about the prospect of gaining experience leading a full international squad in Turkey next week.
"I think it [being offered the role] is a reflection of what happened in the summer and I jumped at the chance because it's the next step up for me and I can't wait to lead that team out," McNulty told BBC Sport. "It's the chance of a lifetime."
In addition to Jamieson, other high-profile athletes competing at the World Short Course Championships include 2011 world silver medallist Hannah Miley, as well as London Olympians Francesca Halsall and Elizabeth Simmonds.
