Objections after Shami Chakrabarti nominated for peerage by Labour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jewish community leaders have criticised Jeremy Corbyn's decision to nominate the head of Labour's anti-Semitism inquiry for a peerage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shami Chakrabarti's inquiry reported in June that the party was not "overrun" by anti-Semitism.
Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said her report's credibility "lies in tatters" after she accepted the peerage.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn praised her "legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained."
Ms Chakrabarti said she was "honoured to accept Jeremy Corbyn's challenge".
The former director of civil liberties group Liberty said it was an "opportunity to help hold the government to account".
She also said: "This is a dangerous moment for our country and we share vital human rights values that need defending more than ever before in my lifetime."
Who is Shami Chakrabarti
She was the Labour leader's only nomination as part of David Cameron's resignation honours list.
Ms Chakrabarti was appointed to lead an independent inquiry into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone.
The review found there was evidence of "ignorant attitudes" but said the "Labour Party is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism".
In a statement posted on Twitter, the Chief Rabbi said: "Shami Chakrabarti has a proud record of public service, but in accepting this peerage, the credibility of her report lies in tatters and the Labour Party's stated intention, to unequivocally tackle anti-Semitism, remains woefully unrealised."
Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, said: "Shami Chakrabarti will bring great experience to Lords. But let's not pretend that a Labour peerage in these circumstances doesn't stink."
Marie van der Zyl, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said it was "beyond disappointing" that she had been offered a peerage by Labour "following her so-called independent inquiry".
And a statement from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said: "If anybody still took Shami Chakrabarti's report on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn's declared opposition to anti-Semitism seriously, this must be the final straw...
"Having promised to never send anyone to the House of Lords, that is exactly what Jeremy Corbyn has done in return for a clean bill of health."
But a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: "Shami Chakrabarti shares Jeremy's ambition for reform of the House of Lords.
"Her career has been one of public service and human rights advocacy.
"Her legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained from many ordinary Britons, will be a considerable asset to the House of Lords.
"Brexit will put many hard-fought rights at risk, so it is crucial that those equipped with the right skills are given the opportunity to hold this government to account."
Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson had called on the party to boycott the honours process amid criticism of David Cameron's use of his resignation list to recognise former Downing Street staff, Conservative donors and Remain campaign officials.
Before the official list was published on Thursday, Mr Watson told the Evening Standard: "Labour cannot legitimise this process by co-operating. Labour requires working peers, as do the other opposition parties, but we cannot allow an outrageous abuse of a prime minister's discretionary power to go unchallenged."
Several Conservative MPs have expressed reservations about some of the 46 names on the list - which were all approved by a committee independent of government.
Tim Loughton tweeted: "To have your resignation honours list leaked is unfortunate.
"To go ahead with it after such a public outcry about cronyism, chumocracy and bringing whole honours system into disrepute stinks, not least for those on list who actually deserve to be and previous worthy recipients."
But a former leader of the House of Lords has defended the decision to also create 13 new Conservative peers, saying an unprecedented number of Conservative members of the unelected chamber had retired since 2010, including 13 in the past year.
"150 peers departed since 2010 (43 Tories). Highest rate of exits since hereditary 'cull' because possible for peers to retire," Baroness Stowell tweeted.
She added: "It is a privileged opportunity to do, not a reward for having done. Look forward to welcoming new colleagues".
The new appointments mean the Conservatives will have one more life peer than Labour - 207 to 206 - but are still well short of an overall majority, partly due to the large number of crossbench members.
