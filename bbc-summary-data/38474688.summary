[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Bromwich Albion 1-2 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Ince scored a superb free-kick as Championship side Derby came from a goal down to knock Premier League West Brom out of the FA Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Albion went ahead 10 minutes before half-time when Matt Phillips curled a shot past goalkeeper Scott Carson.
But the visitors equalised after the break as Darren Bent found the top corner from 25 yards.
Ince then bent a free-kick between Boaz Myhill and his near post to delight the 5,300 travelling fans.
Derby goalkeeper Carson's career has been packed with ups and downs, as his manager Steve McClaren knows only too well.
McClaren's last match in charge of England saw Carson let in a soft shot from Niko Kranjcar in what turned out to be a costly Euro 2008 qualifying defeat by Croatia almost a decade ago.
He produced both the best and worst of his game as he faced one of his former clubs at The Hawthorns.
A casual pass out in the opening moments gifted a chance to Salomon Rondon, whose shot beat the keeper - only for a superb Richard Keogh clearance to prevent a goal.
Carson, though, more than redeemed himself with an outstanding save in the closing moments, tipping over Rondon's header from substitute Nacer Chadli's cross to preserve Derby's advantage.
