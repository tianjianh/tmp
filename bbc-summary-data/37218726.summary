Set in 1686, the story unfolds as a young bride is given a miniature replica of her own house, the contents of which seem to mirror real life.
Burton wrote the book over four years while working as an actress and as a PA in a City firm.
She said: "Short of actually being published, it's the best news I've ever had."
The author added: "It's an almost indescribable thrill to know the characters and story I invented in The Miniaturist are going to be given a new life in such an exciting way."
Kate Sinclair, executive producer for The Forge which will make the series, said: "I feel privileged to be making this for the BBC. Think Wolf Hall meets Tulip Fever."
The book, which was one of the fastest-selling debut novels in a decade, has been adapted by John Brownlow.
It has won numerous awards including Waterstone's Book of the Year and the National Book Awards Overall Book of the Year.
