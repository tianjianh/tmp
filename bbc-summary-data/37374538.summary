The 11m-tall structure is Belfast's highest positioned sculpture, overlooking the city from Cavehill Country Park.
Its official title is Origin, but if other pieces of public art are anything to go by, it won't be long before it earns a nickname - whether fond or less than flattering.
Here are some of the best-known.
Two large 37.5-m high globes dominate the Broadway roundabout in west Belfast.
Rise was the brainchild of Nottingham artist Wolfgang Buttress.
But local wags refer to the sculpture more affectionately as the 'Balls on the Falls'.
Beacon of Hope is a 15-m high sculpture on Queen Elizabeth Bridge overlooking the river Lagan.
Made from steel tubes and bronze-cast globe, it is the work of artist Andy Scott.
This impressive statue has various pet names, including 'Nuala with the Hula', 'The Belle on the Ball' and 'The Thing with the Ring'.
Spirit of Belfast is the work of New York artist Dan George.
Bang in the centre of Belfast's Cornmarket area, the sculpture is designed to illustrate the strength and shape of the city's shipbuilding past.
It's also known as 'Onion Rings' because of its resemblance to the popular snack.
The Spire of Dublin is a 121-m tall pin-like monument at the heart of the Republic of Ireland's capital city.
Dubliners aren't shy with their nicknames for people and places and it's no surprise there are several for the Spire, including 'The Stiletto in the Ghetto', 'The Pin in The Bin', 'The Stiffy on the Liffey' and 'The Rod to God'.
Dublin's bronze statue Molly Malone portrays a fictional fishmonger from a song that has become the city's unofficial anthem.
She's also rather irreverently known as 'The Tart with the Cart', 'The Dolly with the Trolley' and 'The Trollop with the Scallops'.
Antony Gormley's imposing 20-m figure is located near Gateshead in Tyne and Wear, England, and known locally as 'the Rusty Flasher'.
The design of the 200-tonne Angel was inspired by the North East's shipbuilding heritage, with her ribs mirroring the inside of a ship's hull.
Henry Moore's famous bronze statue once sought to beautify the concrete towers of London's Stifford Estate. Residents warmed to the sculpture by christening her 'Old Flo'.
The figure was created in 1957 by Henry Moore to reflect his wartime experiences of the Blitz in London.
