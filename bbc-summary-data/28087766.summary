The driver, an 18-year-old man, lost control of a blue Citroen C2 on the A4095 Curbridge Road at Witney at about 08:15 BST, police said.
The car then hit a man, in his 40s and three 14-year-old girls.
One of the girls died, another was seriously injured and the other escaped injury. The man sustained pelvic and leg injuries. The driver was arrested.
He has been released on bail until 10 August.
The road has been closed both ways, between Church View Road and A415 Ducklington Lane.
Insp Paul Winks said officers were yet to determine how the driver had lost control of the car.
"At the moment we're trying to gather forensic evidence from the scene, evidence from eye witnesses and any CCTV in the area," he added.
In a statement, Wendy Hemmingsley, head teacher at The Henry Box School in Witney, said it was with "deep regret" she had to report the death of a Year 9 pupil.
"The school community is deeply saddened by this news and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this difficult time," she said.
She added support was being offered to students and staff. St Mary's Church in the town has also been opened for "prayer and peace".
