Farmers, processers and retailers have held a protest at Stormont to highlight volatility in prices.

It was organised by the Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) and comes ahead of Monday's key EU farm ministers summit on the crisis in the industry.
Ian Marshall, UFU, said the turnout was "testament to the fears" of people in the farming industry.
Referring to politicians at Stormont, he said:  "For all their flaws we do have good representatives who care".
He told several hundred protesters that the UFU was "not political but it was practical" and he urged politicians to "do whatever it takes, we need you".
Stormont Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said the range of people at the protest "shows the depth of concern right along the supply chain".
"This mobilisation sends a powerful message to the European Commission, and indeed the British government, that we are not prepared to stand by and watch our most important industry collapse," said the Sinn FÃ©in assembly member.
The minister, who will attend a special European Agriculture Council meeting in Brussels on Monday, said: "We need effective action from Europe now to ensure we have a sustainable industry for the future.
"Europe cannot ignore the plight of farmers here. I will not let up in pressing the commission hard for swift and effective support for our most important industry."
Farmers have warned they will go out of business if they do not receive higher prices for milk.
They have held protests at supermarkets to show their frustration that they are currently paid less than the cost of production.
William Irwin, who is chair of the assembly's agriculture committee also raised the issue of supermarket margins. The DUP assembly member said a local vegetable farmer had told him he was getting 11p per kg for his carrots.
Mr Irwin said the same carrots were being sold for 65p a kg, and questioned if that was fair to the farmer.
