The 24-year-old was an integral part of the side that won promotion to League One in 2015-16, scoring 13 goals in 41 appearances in all competitions.
The Wales Under-21 international joined Rovers on a short-term deal last August after being released by Northampton.
"I'm delighted to be staying, we had a special group here last season and achieved something really amazing," Bodin told the club website.
"The club is back where it belongs now and on the up. I can't wait to get going in League One."
The club offered new deals to all but one of the first-team squad after clinching promotion of the final day of the season.
Defender Daniel Leadbitter signed a new two-year deal on Wednesday, but the club are still waiting for a decision from top scorer Matty Taylor.
"We've given him an offer that we think is very fair and pretty competitive, and it would be wonderful to see Matty stay with us," chairman Steve Hamer told BBC Radio Bristol.
"It's something that I would like to think he is thinking long and hard on.
"Maybe this period of radio silence that we are experiencing at the moment is an optimistic one. Let's see what happens."
