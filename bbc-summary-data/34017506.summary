The 21-year-old St Lucian played 31 league games during two loan spells at Tranmere Rovers last season.
Donacien played against Wycombe for Aston Villa in a friendly in July 2013.
"Janoi is an excellent young prospect and a very talented defender who already has good experience of playing at this level," said Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth.
"First-team football won't faze him at all.
"Injuries to Anthony Stewart and Danny Rowe in the last couple of weeks have really stretched the squad defensively and Janoi will be a big help to us over the coming month."
Donacien will join the squad as Wycombe host Dagenham & Redbridge on Saturday.
