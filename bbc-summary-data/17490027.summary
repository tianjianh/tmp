Twentieth Century Fox and the British Film Institute (BFI) are working to digitally re-master the film, directed by Hugh Hudson.
The film tells the true story of two runners who compete in the 1924 Paris Olympics despite religious obstacles.
It will be shown at more than 100 cinemas around the country from 13 July as part of the London 2012 Festival.
Starring Ian Charleson and Ben Cross, the film won four Oscars, including best picture, screenplay and music for Vangelis' acclaimed score.
Although the film is 31 years old, producer Lord Puttnam believes the message is still relevant.
"Chariots of Fire is about guts, determination and belief. At the heart of the film is the quest for Olympic glory, and I find it hard to imagine anything more likely to resonate throughout the country this summer," he said.

The BFI is allocating Â£150,000 of its lottery funding to support the film's release across the country, widening its reach beyond the London 2012 Festival.
The festival will also feature a new film by Bafta-winning Senna director Asif Kapadia - The Odyssey - which will explore the relationship between London and the Olympic games.
It is the last of four short films commissioned especially for the festival.
Directors Mike Leigh, Lynne Ramsay and Streetdance directing duo Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini are already confirmed as part of the project.
