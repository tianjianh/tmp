[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Construction at a site on the Borders to Edinburgh rail route was halted after a worker was seriously hurt while unloading sleepers, it has emerged.

The 49-year-old was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary last Tuesday after being struck on the leg.
Work on the site at Galashiels was suspended for the remainder of the week but resumed on Monday.
A spokesman for Network Rail said: "In terms of impact on the overall programme, it will be negligible."
He said it was not expected to have any effect on the timetable for delivery of the railway.
The spokesman confirmed that a worker had suffered a serious leg injury while working on the Borders Railway project at about 12:30 on 25 November.
"We are working closely with our main contractor BAM to support our colleague and his family," he said.
"The incident is currently under investigation and it would be inappropriate for Network Rail to comment on the circumstances of the incident further at this time.
"The project team took the voluntary decision to stand the site down for the remainder of the week to allow a full investigation and review to take place. However, our teams returned to work on Monday."
The HSE confirmed it had issued two prohibition notices to prevent contractors from using the equipment involved until safety issues were addressed.
It added that its investigation into the incident was ongoing.
Passenger services are scheduled to start on the line between Edinburgh and Tweedbank by September next year.
