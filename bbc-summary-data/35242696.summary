[SN]TITLE[SN]
University of Aberdeen's UCU staff back strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the University and College Union (UCU) at the University of Aberdeen have voted in favour of strike action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ballot was called over fears of forthcoming redundancies.
UCU said 74% of those who voted backed strike action, and 79% said they were prepared to take action short of a strike.
The university said it was disappointed, and aimed to continue talks with UCU officials.
Industrial action was called off in June after an agreement to prevent compulsory redundancies was reached.
