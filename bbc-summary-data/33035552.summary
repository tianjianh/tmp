£1.2m Aberystwyth bandstand completion delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work to build a new £1.2m bandstand on Aberystwyth's seafront is running two months behind schedule.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The original landmark, built in 1935, was demolished in January with an initial date of August given for the completion of the replacement.
But contractors have blamed problems with bad weather, high tides and difficulties with underground cables for the delay.
It is now expected to be completed by the end of October.
