Alvaro Negredo's double in Saturday's 2-2 Premier League draw with Leicester can kick-start a run of goals, says Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka.

Negredo, 31, ended an 11-game run without scoring to earn Boro a point against the champions - his first since the opening day draw with Stoke.
Boro, who are 15th in the table, extended their unbeaten away run to four games with the point.
"He will score more goals for sure," Karanka told BBC Tees.
"I know how important he is, how good he is and I knew he would score. Strikers need goals for confidence."
