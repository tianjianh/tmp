[SN]TITLE[SN]
Adam Maybury and family ran global drugs ring from Spain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A family ran a global drugs operation from a luxury villa in Spain under the guise of selling sport supplements.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Maybury, 28, led the business, which pretended to sell the supplements online but sent drugs through the post.
Maybury, from Staffordshire, worked with his mother, sister, cousin and best friend, on an operation that earned average monthly payments of Â£45,000 at its peak.
All five were sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the synthetic drugs were imported from Holland and then distributed around the world, including Japan, New Zealand and Brazil.
Marshall was responsible for dispatching the packages from Spain until he fell out with Maybury over money. Russell then took over Marshall's role.
Maybury's mother leased offices in Burntwood and opened and managed accounts, card processing facilities and companies to help import and supply drugs.
She sent a text to her son at one point saying: "I am getting a bit worried about all your dodgy dealings Adam just be careful x", the agency said.
Faye Maybury worked in the UK, running the group's websites and checking payments, while posting packages.
The conspiracy lasted from June 2011 to September 2014, the agency spokesman added.
