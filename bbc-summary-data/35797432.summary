Didcot Power Station collapse: Families of missing hold protest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The families of three missing workers feared trapped following a collapse at Didcot Power Station have held a "peaceful protest" at the site.

Two of the three families have previously criticised the rescue operation saying it has been too slow.
One person died and five were injured after half of the decommissioned Didcot A plant collapsed on 23 February.
Police and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said recovering the missing men remained the "priority".
Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, are still missing in the rubble.
Jade Ali has previously said she had been "left in the dark" about the search for her partner Mr Huxtable.
The 28-year-old set up an online petition to "get the three men out" which has so far been signed by more than 15,000 people.
Unfurling placards and fighting back tears, friends and family of the three missing men arrived in Didcot after long coach journeys from Rotherham and Wales.
Today is both a protest and a pilgrimage.
For some it's the first time they've seen, for real, the vast structure of Didcot A and the huge pile of rubble which came down almost three weeks ago.
Gazing at the wreckage, one woman told me it is utterly different to seeing the scene on television, another said to her daughter: "I told you it wouldn't be easy".
The grandchildren of Ken Cresswell wore t-shirts saying "bring our granddad home".
Hugs were shared between strangers from Yorkshire and Wales - people brought together in a common cause, all believing more could, and should, be done to find their loved ones.
John Howley, Mr Cresswell's uncle, also said there had been a "diabolical" delay in getting to the missing men.
During the protest, Mr Cresswell's wife Gail described the three missing men as "much loved".
"We've got to have them home, we need them home - they need out of this," she said.
"They're hardworking men who have worked down here all this time and this is the thanks they get, left under rubble all this time."
Mr Huxtable's 14-year-old niece Mollie Williams said: "It's heartbreaking to know your uncle is under there trying to fight for his life and nothing is happening."
In a joint statement, Thames Valley Police and the HSE said they were waiting for site owners RWE to "produce a plan for a safe method of working before the next stage of the recovery can begin".
"Once this is received and approved by HSE, emergency services are on hand to recover the missing men," it said.
"Preparation at the site, for the recovery, is taking place and will continue over the weekend."
RWE said it was providing an independent assessment "on the stability of the remaining structure".
The firm added it "recognises the impact this state of uncertainty must be having on the families concerned and that it is of paramount importance to respond to this tragic situation", and said it had offered to meet up with the affected families "next week when we have more information".
Police have previously said it was "highly unlikely" the missing men were still alive and that recovering bodies would take "many, many weeks".
Dave Etheridge, the chief fire officer working at the site, has also defended the handling of the rescue attempt.
He said the service was dealing with a "weakened" structure and needed to minimise the risk to rescuers.
Police and the HSE said they were "working hard to identity as soon as possible what caused the building to partially collapse, to provide answers and prevent such a tragedy happening again".
Specialist police officers "continue to support the families at this difficult time and we are providing them with regular updates on the progress", they added.
Part of the 10-storey building came down as it was being prepared for demolition on 23 February at 16:00 GMT.
The body of Michael Collings, 53, from Cleveland, North Yorkshire, was found following the collapse.
