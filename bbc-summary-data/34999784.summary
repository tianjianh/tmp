[SN]TITLE[SN]
King of Spain to make UK state visit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
King Felipe of Spain is to make a state visit to the UK next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The king, who will be accompanied by Queen Letizia, will stay at Windsor Castle during the visit, from 8-10 March.
It will be the first Spanish state visit to the UK since 1986.
Felipe, 47, acceded to the Spanish throne in June 2014 after his father, Juan Carlos, abdicated. It was the first royal transition in Spain since democracy was restored in the 1970s.
Juan Carlos, who had reigned for 39 years, won plaudits for his role in bringing back democracy but his image suffered when he went on a luxurious African elephant-hunting safari while Spain was suffering an economic crisis.
The royal family's reputation suffered further damage when accusations of tax fraud were made against Felipe's sister, Cristina.
Cristina, who denies wrongdoing, is due to go on trial in January.
