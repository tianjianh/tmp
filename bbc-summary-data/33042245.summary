Charity Oxfam has suspended operations with a call centre and a street fundraising organisation after allegations in a Sunday newspaper.

The Mail on Sunday claimed Listen Ltd staff used high-pressure fundraising techniques.
The Fundraising Standards Board (FRSB) said it was "deeply concerned" about claims in the story.
Listen Ltd said it trained employees in accordance with regulators' requirements and would investigate.
But other charities have also said they will probe the issues raised in the Mail on Sunday article.
Tim Hunter, Oxfam's director of fundraising, said: "We take the allegations contained in the article very seriously and have suspended all operations with both Listen Ltd and Street Academy, pending a thorough investigation.
"Oxfam carries out regular quality checks of fundraising calls on our behalf and insists on high standards of training and monitoring."
Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief executive, said street fundraising was an important income source.
He added: "We take any accusation of bad practice amongst street fundraisers employed by the Street Academy seriously, and undertake regular mystery shopping to make sure that they adhere to our strict code of practice and that of the Institute of Fundraising at all times.
"We will fully investigate this incident and take necessary action to make sure that we continue to maintain our high standards."
The FRSB said: "We are deeply concerned about the allegations that the Mail on Sunday has made. It is critical that fundraisers treat the public with respect, openness and honesty at all times.
"The FRSB will investigate these claims to establish whether any breach of fundraising standards has taken place."
