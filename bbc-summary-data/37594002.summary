[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 2-2 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth substitute Connor Smith scored a late leveller as the League Two leaders held promotion rivals Portsmouth at Home Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Smith smashed home from 15 yards in the 89th minute, soon after Pompey sub Danny Rose had scored a 25-yard screamer in off the underside of the bar.
Plymouth's Yann Songo'o stooped to head the leaders ahead on 20 minutes, converting Graham Carey's in-swinging free-kick from the left touchline at the near post.
Argyle should have doubled their lead in the next attack, but Jordan Slew's close-range shot was scrambled off the line by Carl Baker.
Portsmouth levelled when Conor Chaplin swept past Nauris Bulvitis down the left and teed up the unmarked Kyle Bennett, whose first-time shot found the roof of the net.
Paul Cook's side started the 100th dockyard derby brightly and Argyle's opener came against the run of play.
Carey came closest to scoring midway through the second half, beating Portsmouth keeper David Forde with a dipping 20-yarder which came back off the crossbar.
