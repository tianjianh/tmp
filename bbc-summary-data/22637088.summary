David Grimason, who lost his two-year-old son Alistair in 2003, has pressed for tighter controls on the trade of weapons for the past decade.
An international arms trade treaty has been approved by the UN.
Scottish Secretary Michael Moore will present Mr Grimason with the letter of thanks during a ceremony in Edinburgh.
The event will mark the successful negotiation of the treaty.
Alistair was killed during a gunfight at a cafe in the seaside village of Foca, Turkey, where the family were on holiday.
The toddler was asleep in his pram when an argument broke out at a nearby table and a man opened fire, killing the boy from East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire.
Mr Grimason, who now lives in Aberdeen, has worked with Oxfam, which is a leading member of the Control Arms coalition, to help bring about global change.
He spent the anniversary of his son's death last year at the UN in New York, attending the final negotiations for the international arms trade treaty.
The treaty was approved by member states of the United Nations General Assembly last month and opens for signature at a ceremony in New York on 3 June.
Mr Grimason said he immediately tried to educate himself on the illegal gun problem that existed in Turkey after Alastair was killed.
"I found that there was a massive problem," he said.
"There are around eight million hand guns in civilian possession and only about a million were licensed. We started a campaign against illegal armament in Turkey.
"From there I found out about the control arms campaign."
"My family have suffered from misuse of guns. My son suffered the ultimate injustice, he was two and a half years old and did not even know what a gun was".
