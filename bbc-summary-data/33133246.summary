He was only told on the day of the 2017 African Cup of Nations tie that the captain's armband had been given to Mathieu Dossevi for Sunday's 2-1 win.
The 31-year-old scored the winner but says he is unsure if he will play against Djibouti in September.
"For now, I don't know - I'll be here and I'll talk with the coach," he said.
"I need to know whether he really needs me in the team or not.
"I have been the captain for seven or eight years and then one morning I'm told I won't be the captain - that means that we can go to Djibouti and he will put me in the stands.
"So I'd rather quit the team than be sidelined or put in the stands there and I think this will be better for me and the team.
"We can change captains everyday if we are playing street games in Lom√© - but this is a national team.
"But what is sure I am going on holidays and allow me to enjoy my holidays before I decide."
He has said that if he decides to play again he does not want to captain the Hawks.
"From now on, I will never captain this team again," he added.
"To tell me on the day of the match that I will not captain the team then it is  very disrespectful"
Togo's new coach Tom Saintfiet however tried to play down the issue.
"I don't want to talk too much about this topic because I think that Emmanuel Adebayor is a natural captain for the team," the Belgian coach said.
"He does not necessarily need to have the captain's armband when he plays - he is the captain and the greatest Togolese player.
"He has played today as a great captain without armband.
"For me every player is like a captain - so we have eleven captains on the pitch and every player must be responsible as a captain.
"We may have a captain but you can only win a match with eleven players."
Saintfiet and Adebayor had also fallen out in the build-up to the match against Liberia when the striker was dropped from the squad for a friendly against Ghana.
The coach said the Tottenham player and two other players were axed as they had not attended all the training sessions nor stayed at the team hotel.
Adebayor for his part insisted that he had told the coach he wouldn't play in the friendly in the days before the match.
Both men seemed to have made amends before the Liberia match insisting "there was no problems at all."
The striker has taken several breaks from playing international football in the past, including in the wake of the terrorist attack on the Togo team bus at the 2010 Nations Cup finals in Angola.
