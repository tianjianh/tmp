America's first couple look very much in love as they pose for intimate pictures in Essence, a black women's lifestyle publication.
The president and first lady spoke about their legacy for October's special issue.
But it is the affectionate, gauzy images that have sent pulses racing on social media.
Commentators - apparently from across the political spectrum - have praised the Obamas' loving relationship.
Many social media users tweeted on the theme of #BlackLove, with quite a few Twitter posts complimenting Mrs Obama's physique.
The First Lady, who has been an outspoken advocate of fitness and healthy eating, said the couple are proudest of their impact on African-American children.
"I think when it comes to black kids, it means something for them to have spent most of their life seeing the family in the White House look like them," she said.
"It matters. All the future work that Barack talked about, I think over these last few years, we've kind of knocked the ceiling of limitation off the roofs of many young kids".
Asked about what memories he will take with him when he leaves the White House, President Obama spoke of time spent with his family.
"Some of my fondest memories of the White House are just being with the girls on a summer night and walking the dogs around the South Lawn, talking and listening to them, trying to get Bo [the dog] to move because sometimes it's hot", he said.
