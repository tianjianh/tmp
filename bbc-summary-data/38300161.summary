The work by artist Pip McGarry disappeared from his gallery at Marwell Zoo, near Winchester, Hampshire, overnight on Thursday.
They include a pencil sketch and 10 framed oils on canvas of animals such as Sumatran tigers, snow leopards and elephants.
Mr McGarry, the zoo's artist-in-residence for more than 17 years, said he was "devastated" by their loss.
"Painting is also my livelihood and it's a huge blow to lose these pieces, many of which were painted from photographs I've taken on safari in Tanzania and Botswana," he added.
Marwell Wildlife's chief executive James Cretney said the art sales contributed to the zoo's "extensive conservation work in the field".
Hampshire Constabulary said it was investigating and has appealed for information.
