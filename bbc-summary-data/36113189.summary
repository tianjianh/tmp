[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wiltshire police officer charged with fraud and forgery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has been charged with a string of fraud, false accounting and forgery offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Supt Andrew Carr, 47, currently suspended from his job at Wiltshire Police, appeared before magistrates earlier.
The 11 charges relate to his role as treasurer for the 7th Swindon Scouts and Orchid Vale PTA in Swindon between January 2014 and September 2015.
Mr Carr has been bailed to next appear at Bournemouth Crown Court on 26 May.
He was charged with four counts of fraud relating to the scouts and PTA where the proceeds of various fundraising events were not paid into bank accounts as required.
Another two counts of theft relate to falsifying documents for accounting purposes and five counts of forgery relate to writing out cheques in another person's name.
A 12th charge of forgery has since been withdrawn by the prosecution.
In October 2015 the matter was referred to the police watchdog, the IPCC and an independent investigation was undertaken by Dorset Police.
