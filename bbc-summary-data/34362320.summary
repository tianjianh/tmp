UKIP 'overexcited' about candidate selection in Wales

UKIP members in Wales are "overexcited" about candidate selection for the assembly election, a member of the party's ruling body has said.

Former Welsh UKIP candidates have warned against allowing high profile figures from outside Wales to stand in the most winnable seats.
Former Tory MPs Mark Reckless and Neil Hamilton are seeking nomination.
Caroline Jones, of UKIP's national executive committee, told BBC Wales final decisions had not been made.
Speaking at the party's conference in Doncaster, she said there was stiff competition for the regional list seats.
They are thought to offer UKIP a better chance of election than constituency seats due to proportional representation.
Ms Jones - who has put her name forward as a candidate next May - said there were limited places available for regional candidates.
"Everyone is contending for them with equal enthusiasm and some people are going to be disappointed if they're not selected," she told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme.
"I think there's overexcitement as to who will be selected at the moment and people are just surmising. Nobody knows anything - absolutely nothing."
While local branches will choose candidates for the 40 constituencies, the central party is responsible for selecting the regional list contenders.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage has insisted that representatives from the "national party and from Wales" will pick the regional list candidates.
The party's Welsh leader Nathan Gill said the aim is to select a team supporters could unite behind.
