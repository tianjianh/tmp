[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield United eased to victory at Shrewsbury as the hosts slipped to the bottom of League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All of the goals came in the second half with Billy Sharp netting twice and Dan Lafferty also on target for the in-form Blades, who are now unbeaten in their last nine league games.
Sharp fired United ahead a minute into the second half when he fired a 25-yard shot into the top corner of the net.
Mark Duffy's free-kick then came back off the crossbar and goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler did well to tip a long-range drive from Paul Coutts over before United doubled their lead in the 63rd minute.
Coutts delivered an inviting cross from the right and Lafferty headed powerfully high into the net.
Three minutes later it was 3-0 to the Blades as the lively Sharp popped up at the far post to fire in a corner.
United had earlier started brightly and almost took a 13th-minute lead, but a close-range effort from Sharp after Ethan Ebanks-Landell nodded down a corner was blocked on the line by Abu Ogogo.
Shrewsbury gradually came into the contest and both Ivan Toney and George Waring threatened before Olly Lancashire looped a header over the bar.
Shrewsbury, under the control of caretaker manager Danny Coyne for a third game, had to work hard to prevent further damage once United scored three times.
Joe Riley went closest to pulling one back when his 20-yard free-kick was pushed away by keeper Simon Moore.
