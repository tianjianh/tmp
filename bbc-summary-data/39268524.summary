Buchanan has played every Cobblers game since signing on a free transfer from Preston North End in May 2015.
The 30-year-old, who helped his side to the League Two title last season, is yet to score for the club.
"If I could get myself a goal that would top off everything," he said.
Buchanan, who began his career at Bury, had not played for previous club Preston for four months before he joined Northampton.
He has missed just 90 minutes of football since, when he was substituted at half-time in games against Leyton Orient in League Two and West Ham United in the Checkatrade Trophy.
"It will be a very proud moment," he told BBC Radio Northampton. "This is a short career and I want to get as many appearances as I can.
"As long as I'm fit I want to be selected."
Northampton Town manager Justin Edinburgh added: "The way he conducts himself, the way he trains and looks after himself is a great example to any young player."
