Documents being examined by German counter-terrorism police are said to reveal the identities of a large number of Arab and non-Arab fighters of so-called Islamic State (IS).

Most of the fighters are Arab, according to Qatar-based Syrian opposition website Zaman Al Wasl, which says it has obtained 1,700 files.
The files, believed to be recruitment questionnaires, appear to contain names, addresses and phone numbers of thousands of IS supporters from 50 countries.
Some of the non-Arab recruits, from Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Canada, Italy and France, are listed below:
Ahmet C - Suicide bomber
Kerim Marc B and Abdelkarim B -  Currently on trial in Germany.
