Benedict Cumberbatch announces engagement in The Times

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Benedict Cumberbatch has shunned modern communication methods to announce that he's got engaged to his partner, Sophie Hunter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The couple decided to tell the world about their plans in the births, marriages and deaths column of the Times newspaper.
It's thought they met making the film Burlesque Fairytales in 2009.
There were reports last month that he'd gone to Edinburgh to ask for her family's approval.
The notification method was popular years ago, so it's a bit of a shock that one of the world's most eligible men has used this method to announce he is now officially off the market.
That's led to broken hearts on Twitter.
But some people on Twitter were more interested in pointing out just how posh it all seems.
Some loved the fact that his mum is called Wanda.
Some people have used the outbreak of sadness and associated banter to remind the world that the actor can't say penguin.
If you missed this little Cumberbatch gem, it comes from a nature documentary which the actor narrated where he repeatedly failed to say the word.
It's been a sad day for Cumberbatch fans.
However, after seeing the news this fan realised it was time to get real.
