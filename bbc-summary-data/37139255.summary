[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 0-1 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jabo Ibehre scored his first goal of the season as Carlisle continued their unbeaten start to the League Two campaign with a victory at Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old netted the only goal of the game to bring Barnet's own undefeated start to an end.
Michael Raynes hit the bar from Nicky Adams' corner early on before the visitors' long-ball ploy paid dividends when Ibehre fired Keith Curle's side in front, turning home Adams' cross from the left in the 21st minute.
Adams almost had a goal for himself with goalkeeper Jamie Stephens tipping his attempted lob over the bar.
Eight minutes before the break the Cumbrians' goalscorer missed the chance to double his tally, heading wide from nine yards.
The hosts' best chance of finding an equaliser fell to Bondz N'Gala, whose shot was blocked in a goalmouth scramble after the interval.
Reggie Lambe forced Stephens into a good save low to his right before smashing a cross against the outside of the post after the hour.
Bees' top scorer John Akinde almost secured a point for the hosts late on as Mark Gillespie saved well with his feet.
