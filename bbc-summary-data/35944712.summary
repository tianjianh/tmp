Gregor Townsend says Glasgow Warriors' aim remains the retention of the Pro12 title as they prepare for a double-header away to Treviso and Zebre.

Warriors are currently sixth in the table ahead of Saturday's game in Italy against Treviso.
"The ambition is what it was at the beginning of the season - to get into the play-offs and look to win the Pro 12," said head coach Townsend.
"We are in a position where that is still achievable."
Glasgow, who are equal on points with Ulster and one behind Munster, have a game in hand over all of the teams above them.
"We know, if we win all our games, we are likely to be in the last four," said Townsend.
"We play teams above us as well after we take on Treviso and Zebre.
"So the ambition is there, the belief is there because we have seen the players do really well against top teams."

Warriors will stay on at an Italian training camp ahead of their rearranged match against Zebre next Friday.
Townsend admits the players are looking forward to their week away but insists they are entirely focused on getting the right results.
"Getting away for some of the players who have had a big few months - playing in the Six Nations - getting some nice weather in a fantastic country is nice after a long season," he added.
"But they are more looking forward to playing well and putting their hands up for selection in both games.
"We want to come back - with that Scarlets game to come - with a couple of good performances."
The trip to Scarlets is on 16 April, with a home game against Zebre to follow, while the regular season ends with a visit to current league leaders Connacht.
The top four teams will contest the play-offs, with the top two enjoying home advantage in the semi-finals, while the top six qualifying for the European Champions Cup.
