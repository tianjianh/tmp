A threatened strike by drivers who deliver Argos goods has been suspended, the union Unite said.

Drivers at Argos's main distribution centre had voted on Tuesday to strike for three days from 20 December.
The industrial action has now been called off, pending another union vote, after a pay deal was struck during talks.
An Argos spokesman reassured customers that it was "business as usual this Christmas".
The drivers work for Wincanton, a logistics firm used by Argos to make deliveries from its national distribution centre near Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire.
They had claimed Wincanton failed to pay holiday back pay for two years, amounting to an average of Â£700.
"I would like to thank our members for the solidarity they have shown during this dispute and we look forward to a positive relationship with the management at Wincanton going forward," said Unite regional officer Rick Coyle.
The Burton-on-Trent site supplies Argos's other warehouses that then deliver to Argos shops.
A Wincanton spokesperson said: "All industrial action has now been suspended pending a ballot on the terms of the agreement among Unite members, and at this important time of year, the Argos business will be unaffected."
Argos was taken over by Sainsbury's earlier this year.
