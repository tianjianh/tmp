[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The officer was attacked in Havelock Square in Swindon town centre at 13:15 GMT on Friday, Wiltshire Police said.
A man, 45, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assault. Whilst trying to restrain the man, another PC and a security officer were also assaulted.
The force is appealing for witnesses and said it is possible the attack may have been recorded on a mobile phone.
Police said the officer was taken to hospital as a precaution and has since returned to work.
Supt Gavin Williams said: "This was a nasty, unprovoked attack on a PCSO who was carrying out her normal duties in Swindon town centre.
"Fortunately, she only suffered minor injuries, however any attack on a member of police staff is totally unacceptable and the person responsible will be dealt with accordingly."
