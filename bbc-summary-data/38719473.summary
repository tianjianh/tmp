Young people in the area are being invited to participate in the Wilton Lodge project led by local artist and film-maker Dawn Berry.
Events manager Gordon Webber said it was an "exciting year" for the Hawick facility.
He said the aim of the scheme was to get a "youth perspective" on the life of the park.
"Lots will be going on with the usual events programme but also the addition of the new café, playpark and bridge," he said.
"There should be lots of material there to capture."
Project manager Ms Berry added: "We will provide the tools and guidance needed to film, edit and score the film but ultimately we want the input from the youth participants on what they want to see in the film and tell their story of the park's life."
A first information meeting for the project will take place on Saturday 28 January at 12:00 in the theatre at the Heart of Hawick centre.
