Rossco Stern, Charlie Hill and Gary Thoms carried out the attack after turning up uninvited to the Halloween party in Dundee.
A sheriff said CCTV footage of the attack was "one of the worst outbursts of violence" he had ever seen.
The trio were remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on 23 February.
A trial at Dundee Sheriff Court was told that the men had been thrown out of the party after sparking an argument.
The CCTV footage showed victims Liam Holt, Fraser Nicoll and Michael Craib being attacked as they tried to flee the attackers.
Mr Holt was seen being thrown to the ground before one of the gang repeatedly struck him on the head with a baseball bat while another, identified as Thoms, kicked his head.
Knives were seen being brandished and repeatedly used on the victims, who eventually escaped..
Pictures of Mr Craib's injuries showed a deep gash on his neck.
He told the court: "It was only just above my jugular.
"When I went back outside Liam was on the ground - I thought he was dead."
Jodie Feeney, who hosted the party, told the court: "Rossco Stern was shouting and screaming.
"He was saying 'I'm from Glasgow - I'll show you how it's done'."
Stern, 23, of Glasgow, and Hill, 33, of Dundee, admitted two charges each of assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement on the third day of their trial.
Thoms, 33, of Dundee, had denied a charge of assaulting Liam Holt to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement, but was found guilty by a jury.
Sheriff George Way deferred sentence for social work background reports.
He told the men: "It is perhaps one of the worst outbursts of violence I have ever had to witness through CCTV.
"It was sustained and brutal.
"You should be in no doubt that a custodial sentence of some length is at the forefront of my mind."
