Tony Blair defends advice to Colonel Gaddafi during Libya conflict

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tony Blair was not trying to "save" Colonel Gaddafi when he spoke to the dictator at the height of the Libyan conflict in 2011, he has told MPs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former prime minister confirmed he had "two or three" phone conversations within 24 hours with Gaddafi, having cleared it with David Cameron.
His aim was to get the dictator out of Libya "so that a peaceful transition could take place".
But he conceded that the Gaddafi regime was "not sustainable".
He defended his decision as prime minister to bring Gaddafi "in from the cold", saying it may have prevented so-called Islamic State getting chemical weapons.
As part of the process, Gaddafi renounced weapons of mass destruction, bringing to a halt programmes to develop nuclear and chemical arms.
During his 90-minute appearance before the foreign affairs committee, Mr Blair also said:
While in office, the ex-prime minister supported the West's rapprochement with the regime of Colonel Gaddafi and even visited him in Libya in 2004.
Libya renounced its nuclear weapons programme as part of an international agreement but the West's more accommodating relationship with the regime, which led to a number of commercial deals, came in for criticism after Gaddafi violently repressed a uprising during the so-called Arab Spring.
Mr Blair said the decision to engage with Gaddafi, who was accused of sponsoring terrorism in the 1980s, had been difficult but he suggested there was a "huge prize" as a result of trying to normalise relations, in terms of security co-operation, and other issues were "not left to one side".
"When I went to see him, Lockerbie, Yvonne Fletcher, were absolutely in my mind and part of the conversation," he said.
"But I felt ultimately the game was worth it and I do believe it was worth it but is not to say I approve of what he did before or how he ran his country."
Gaddafi was killed in 2011 after he violently quelled a popular uprising. Mr Blair's successor David Cameron made the decision to join an intervention against Gaddafi, which saw the UK, US and France launch airstrikes against his regime.
In light of Gaddafi's killing, Mr Blair was asked if he believed that the three countries had exceeded the auspices of a United Nations mandate authorising action to protect Libyan civilians who opposed the regime from the risk of a potential massacre in Benghazi.
Mr Blair said he was not willing to criticise David Cameron for acting in the way he did, adding: "Once you engage in a military action to protect people against a regime, the line between that and (regime change) becomes pretty thin and a certain point."
Although Parliament backed the UK's action at the time, MPs are more critical of the intervention now, saying little thought was given to post-conflict planning, to reconciling warring factions and building inclusive institutions after the collapse of the Gaddafi regime.
Libya has been beset by instability and violence since 2011.
Since 2014 the country has had two rival parliaments - an Islamist-backed one in Tripoli and an internationally recognised government in the east of the country - amid UN attempts to broker a single government of national unity.
Mr Blair, who was prime minister between 1997 and 2007, was the central figure in the UK's decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003 and has appeared twice before the official Chilcot inquiry into the invasion - whose report has yet to be published.
Critics of this, and subsequent interventions in Libya and now Syria, have warned that they have fuelled the rise of violent Islamist groups such as Islamic State but Mr Blair has remained a strong advocate of an activist approach.
Since leaving office, Mr Blair has remained an influential, if controversial, figure in the Middle East. He served as a Middle East peace envoy to the Quartet - the UN, EU, US and Russia - for eight years before stepping down earlier this year.
Conservative ministers have defended the Libya intervention, former foreign secretary William Hague recently telling MPs that he would back similar action again while acknowledging that Libya had not turned out as the government had hoped.
Ministers have pointed to closer co-operation with the Libyan authorities on matters of mutual interest in recent years.
Earlier this year, a Libyan man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder PC Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984.
