It looks like Twitter's changing and maybe, just maybe, it'll ease your #FOMO (fear of missing out).

The company's boss has outlined new plans for the social network.
One will let you see what you missed while you were offline, say sleeping.
"We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app," Twitter explained in a blog post.
Another new function could filter tweets, making the app more like Facebook by sifting through the content posted by your friends to find the pictures and jokes it thinks you will be most interested in.
This may be unpopular with the users who enjoy the chronological nature of the social network.
The change you'll see soonest affects direct messaging. It's not yet clear what the changes will be, but according to Twitter it has "several updates coming that will make it easy to take a public conversation private".
The first of these will begin rolling out next week: the ability to share and discuss Tweets natively and privately via Direct Messages.
Twitter says it will allow you to upload your own videos directly to the timeline by the beginning of 2015.
It also hopes to make it easier for people who are just joining the site by providing them with a ready-made list of people to follow.
Twitter described it as "an instant, personalized timeline for new users who don't want to spend time cultivating one on their own".
The company admitted that about 125 million people go to Twitter's homepage each month and decide not to sign up,
Twitter's new features were mentioned by boss, Dick Costolo, at an investor day.
The changes are important to Twitter's financial future, given the competition it faces from other social media companies, and the stock price rose after Mr Costolo spoke.
