Spector, 30, who was Blues' longest-serving player, making 179 appearances after signing from West Ham in 2011, mutually agreed to cancel his contract.
Fabbrini's loan spell runs until June, with a view to a permanent deal.
The 26-year-old had a loan spell with Blues in the 2014-15 season and signed for Â£1.5m from Watford in January 2016.
"I am a little bit disappointed and sad that Jonathan Spector will be leaving us," manager Gianfranco Zola said.
"He's going to go home and I wish him all the best."
