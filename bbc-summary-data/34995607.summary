[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 100 photographs taken by acclaimed poet Philip Larkin have gone on display at The University of Hull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The exhibition at the Brynmor Jones Library, where Larkin was librarian for 30 years, includes images of his female companions, friends and self-portraits.
It shows the poet, who took nearly 6,000 photos throughout his life, was an accomplished amateur photographer.
The university said it captured "a unique glimpse into Larkin's life".
The exhibition, which runs until 23 December, follows the publication of a new book by Richard Bedford looking at Larkin's photographic work.
It also features family snaps of his childhood, portraits of literary friends, as well as familiar views of Hull and the East Riding and other landscapes.
University Librarian Dr Richard Heseltine said: "As one of the university's most eminent librarians, Philip Larkin is a prominent part of the university's cultural heritage.
"It is an unmissable opportunity to come along to see another side of one of the most celebrated poets of our time.
"The photographs offer a unique glimpse into Larkin's life, his interests and even subjects which informed some of his poems."
