The Swans' new American owners have been locked in talks with the city's council which built the Â£27m venue.
The club and the Ospreys have played there since 2005, paying a nominal rent to the management company that runs it.
A 30-year lease could be sealed over the next few weeks allowing the club to explore more commercial opportunities.
That could include stadium naming rights and a possible expansion of the ground, which currently holds 21,000 spectators.
Swansea council leader Rob Stewart previously said Swansea Stadium Management Company (SSMC) - the body running the stadium, which is a partnership between the council, Swans and Ospreys - was "not fit for purpose anymore" following the success and growth of both clubs.
On the latest talks, he said: "We have had a series of very productive meetings and are getting close to a deal that works for everyone.
"I'm hopeful we can close that deal soon."
A Swansea City spokesman added: "Discussions are ongoing with the council. However there are still a lot of details to finalise.''
The Swans kicked off the new Premier League season at Southampton on Saturday, drawing 0-0.
