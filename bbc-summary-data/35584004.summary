Miami Beckham United (MBU), the ownership vehicle behind the proposed MLS team, has been seeking a financial partner for some time.
But sources close to the proposed deal say Qatar Sports Investment are just one of many interested groups.
Ex-England captain Beckham ended his playing career with PSG in 2012-13.
He will remain heavily involved in the project in the event of any sale.
Beckham has strong links to Qatar and recently defended its right to host the 2022 World Cup, along with Russia in 2018.
He said in December: "Whether it's corrupt or not, those countries have been chosen.
"People need to get behind that. It's all about bringing football to new countries. I think they should stick with it."
MBU have struggled to find a suitable site to build a stadium but are aiming to join the MLS in 2018.
In a statement MBU said: "As Miami Beckham United lays the groundwork for launching a world class soccer club in Miami, our team has attracted interest from a number of potential partners.
"David Beckham, Simon Fuller and Marcelo Claure are evaluating these possibilities, with the goal of bringing additional resources and international expertise that draws players, staff and fans from around the world.
"At the same time, we are performing due diligence on our stadium site as we move toward finalising the acquisition of two privately held properties and a third county-owned parcel over the coming weeks."
