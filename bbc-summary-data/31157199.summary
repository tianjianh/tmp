Almost 93,000 children were taking part in supervised tooth brushing at home through the Designed to Smile programme, 5,500 more than in 2013.
Latest figures from 2012 show 41.4% of five year olds in Wales suffering from tooth decay, down from 47.6% in 2008.
Chief dental officer David Thomas welcomed the "encouraging progress".
The scheme offers tooth brushing and fluoride varnish programmes for children up to the age of six through their schools and nurseries, with treatment and advice for older children who need it.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said children and young people were "seeing the benefits" of the programme.
