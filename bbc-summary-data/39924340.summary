The 54-year-old took over at Field Mill in November 2016 and guided the Stags to a 12th-placed finish in League Two.
Swindon boss Luke Williams left earlier this month after their relegation from League One.
Chairman John Radford said Evans was "fully committed" to the club and they would allow for "no distractions" as they look to win promotion next season.
He added: "I have refused Swindon Town permission to talk to our manager and work continues behind the scenes at our club as we put together a squad which we believe will be highly competitive in Sky Bet League Two next season.
"Steve has my full backing as we aim to fulfil the dreams of a town and its people."
Evans, who previously had spells with Crawley, Rotherham and Leeds, has already signed goalkeeper Conrad Logan and defender Zander Diamond for next season.
