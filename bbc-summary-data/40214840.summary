Polling stations closed at 10pm on Thursday night and teams of volunteers there raced to be the first to count up their votes.
Newcastle Central announced its result at 11:01pm.
It's always a big race to try and be first! Houghton and Sunderland South - a different constituency that's nearby - came in second place, nine minutes later.
