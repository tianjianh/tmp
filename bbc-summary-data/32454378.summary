About 10 cases of the viral liver infection have so far been confirmed in an area of the town that includes Old Park Primary School and Nursery.
Public Health England said the source of the outbreak was so far unclear.
The infection is often caused by poor hygiene or contaminated food and more commonly associated with Africa, India, South America and the Far East.
Dr Harsh Duggal, from the health protection team, said: "People with Hepatitis A can feel quite unwell, with symptoms including a raised temperature, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, dark urine, pale stools and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).
"In young children, however, symptoms may be hard to detect, so there is an increased risk of infection from children who appear well.
"We are therefore arranging immunisation against Hepatitis A for members of the school and nursery, to limit the risk of further infection."
The West Midlands team said it was working with Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust and Telford and Wrekin Council to advise the school on infection control measures.
