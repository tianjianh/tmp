Paris St-Germain 4-0 Rennes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paris St-Germain lost Edinson Cavani to injury as they moved three points behind leaders Nice by thumping Rennes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker seemed to strain a thigh in the process of lobbing in his team's second goal shortly before half-time.
Cavani had played a part in PSG's first goal, heading against the bar before Gelson Fernandes turned the ball into his own net.
Adrien Rabiot's powerful swerving shot made it 3-0, and Marco Verratti then volleyed in Hatem Ben Arfa's cross.
Unai Emery's side reduced the gap between themselves and Nice, who fell to a surprise 1-0 defeat at Caen earlier on Sunday.
