[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Noble, 43, had already admitted the lesser charge of causing the death of Chris Dennehy, 58, by careless driving on the A38 near Lee Mill.
But he was found not guilty of the more serious charge after a trial at Plymouth Crown Court.
Noble, of Horrabridge, Devon, will be sentenced at a later date after pre-sentence reports are prepared.
The court had earlier been told Noble had reached over for his mobile phone moments before he struck and killed Mr Dennehy, from Plympton, on 5 September last year.
His lorry was travelling 54mph along the straight road when the victim was struck by the nearside wing, said prosecutor Piers Norsworthy.
The victim was wearing a high-visibility jacket and a white helmet.
Mr Dennehy had worked at Tescos at Lee Mill for 35 years and rode to work daily.
