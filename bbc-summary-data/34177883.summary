Euro 2016: Wales 'feared' by opponents - Osian Roberts

Wales' opponents now "fear" them after their recent good form, according to assistant manager Osian Roberts.

Chris Coleman's side - top of Group B and unbeaten in eight qualifiers - need just one point from their final two games to secure a Euro 2016 place.
Roberts believes Israel's defensive display in Sunday's 0-0 draw in Cardiff is indicative of the effect Wales' success has had on opposition teams.
"That's what this group of players have earned now, that respect," he said.
"Teams are not going to be open and going toe-to-toe with us. That's because of the standards we've set and other teams fear us."
Wales are one point ahead of Belgium and five in front of third-placed Israel, with the top two guaranteed qualification.
Wales have risen to their highest Fifa world ranking of ninth, having been ranked 117th as recently as 2011.
Victory against Israel would have sealed the country's place at their first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup with two matches to spare.
But they were denied by a resolute Israel team who offered little in attack and were instead content to defend and hold on for a point.
Roberts added: "They came here and changed their shape to frustrate us because of the respect opponents are now showing us."
