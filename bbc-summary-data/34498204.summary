Gordon Strachan says there is "no time limit" for him to decide on his future as Scotland coach.

Strachan will take time after Sunday's match against Gibraltar to decide if he will renew his contract before the upcoming World Cup qualifying campaign.
The Scottish FA has already indicated a desire for Strachan to remain in post.
"There's two or three people I need to speak to and make sure everything's clear and then we'll take it from there," he said.
"I've always said 'wait to the end of the [Euro 2016 qualifying] campaign' but don't expect me to be speaking right after the game.
"There's no time limit on it but I've got to say it's been - it is - an incredible experience.
"It is a job that makes you so proud and I know during the campaign there have been many performances that have made the nation happy."
Scotland missed out on a Euro 2016 play-off place after drawing 2-2 with Poland in Glasgow on Thursday.
And Strachan hinted that a number of squad players will get an opportunity in Faro on Sunday.
"There have been players with us for a year who would have loved to have had more time on the playing surface," he said. "Unfortunately for them it's not materialised.
"So we've got to try and get them some time and that would have happened no matter the opposition because I think some of these guys need to be rewarded.
"It's hard work when you're not picked, when you're away from your family for 10 days to get no tangible reward in terms of playing. So it's nice to give them a pat on the back and get a chance to see them playing for myself."
Of the players who dropped out of the squad ahead of the trip to Portugal, Jordan Rhodes has a medial ligament problem, fellow striker Leigh Griffiths injured a calf in the half-time warm-up on Thursday, while midfielder James McArthur's wife is expecting a baby imminently.
