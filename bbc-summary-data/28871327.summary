A woman suffered leg fractures and was airlifted to hospital after the crash at about 15:45 BST.
Two carriages came off the track as the train - carrying 155 passengers - was coming into the park's main square, a spokesperson said.
Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said five people, described as "walking wounded", were treated at the scene of the accident.
The train's rear carriage went on to its side and the other remained upright, leaving the other carriages on the track.
Lisa Mowe from Coventry, who was on the train with her 15-year-old son Hadley and his friend Jason Thomas, said it was "a horrible experience".
"People on the train were helping others to safety," she said.
Hadley Mowe said: "It was quite scary as people were very distressed.
"Jason and I helped get people out of the carriages by pushing up the train which had fallen off the rails.
"Everyone worked together to help each other. I was just relived that my family were OK."
Mrs Mowe's mother and her husband Derek were also on the train and helped a little boy out of the carriage which came off.
She said she believed a young girl had got her leg trapped and a woman was knocked unconscious in the incident.
The injured woman was flown to Bath Royal United Hospital, a fire service spokeswoman said.
Insp Alan Webb of Wiltshire Police said Longleat staff acted "in a highly professional way" and were "very efficient in dealing with the emergency services".
The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and a meeting with police has been scheduled for Thursday, Insp Webb confirmed.
In a statement, the park said: "Staff are currently undertaking a thorough investigation into what caused the incident and the railway will remain closed during this time."
