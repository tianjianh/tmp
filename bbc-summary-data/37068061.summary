[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solihull Moors 3-2 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull super-sub Harry White scored a dramatic late winner in a 3-2 win at home to Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decisive goal came when Liam Daly's long ball forward was nodded down by Andy Brown and White fired home to secure the three points in the 84th minute.
The Moors had led early on when Brown bundled the ball home. Will Hatfield scored a spectacular equaliser as half-time loomed, the ball going in off the underside of the crossbar.
Three goals lit up the final 15 minutes. Adam Boyes put Guiseley in front as he latched on to a long punt upfield, but the hosts levelled shortly afterwards when Brown headed home his second. White's late intervention then sent the Damson Park faithful into raptures.
