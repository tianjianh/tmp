Football League: Five things you may have missed on Saturday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two hat-tricks, one conventional and one slightly more unusual, feature prominently in our round-up of Saturday's Football League action.

There is also room for a new manager's fine start, protesting fans at a Championship struggler and mixed emotions for Carlisle on their return to Brunton Park.
Cardiff's Anthony Pilkington found the net three times in his side's 2-2 draw with Rotherham in the Championship.
Unfortunately for the former Norwich winger, the second of his unusual hat-trick was scored at the wrong end.
Pilkington, 27, had only scored three goals all season before Saturday's game.
I wonder if he took the match ball home?
Sam Winnall showed Pilkington how it should be done, netting three goals at the right end as Barnsley thrashed Rochdale 6-1 in League One.
In-form Winnall, 25, has scored eight goals in his last four league outings.
"He's got everyone to sign the ball, but what he doesn't realise is that we've got to charge him Â£40 for it," joked manager Lee Johnson.
He told BBC Radio Sheffield: "He loves it when he scores, he lives to score goals and I'm sure he'll enjoy his evening."
Winnall's hat-trick ensured a miserable return to Oakwell for Rochdale boss Keith Hill, who managed the Tykes between June 2011 and December 2012.
"If I'm too hard on the players after that type of result, it could have a double negative [effect]," Hill told BBC Radio Manchester.
"There are enough negatives in today's performance and result to last the season. If I go too heavy on the players, it could break them for the rest of the season.
"Hopefully, as the season progresses, it's a result we can put in isolation and learn from."
These are unhappy times at Charlton Athletic.
The Addicks were second from bottom of the Championship after losing 5-0 and 6-0 in their two outings before hosting Blackburn on Saturday.
They took the lead against Rovers - the first time they had done so in a match since 15 December - but in the end they had to settle for a 1-1 draw at The Valley, extending their winless run to 11 games.
After the match, there were more protests from supporters against owner Roland Duchatalet, with Addicks fans questioning the turnover of managers in south-east London and voicing concern over the Belgian's long-term strategy for the club.
Faced with dropping into the third tier, the days of steady mid-table Premier League finishes under Alan Curbishley must feel like a lifetime ago.
It's played one, won one for new Leyton Orient manager Kevin Nolan.
The 33-year-old was appointed as player-manager of the League Two side on Thursday and the former Bolton, Newcastle and West Ham midfielder began his reign with a 2-0 win at Wycombe on Saturday.

Nolan, who has not played a first-team game since August, named himself on the bench at Adams Park but was not required on the field as goals from Jay Simpson and Calaum Jahraldo-Martin earned a second victory in 11 games for the O's.
"It feels great," Nolan told BBC Radio London. "A clean sheet and two well-taken goals.
"The lads responded to everything I've asked of them over the last 48 hours so I'll be going home on the bus really pleased."
On Saturday, Carlisle United supporters ended a wait of almost two months to see their team play at Brunton Park.
The Cumbrians' home ground was severely damaged by flooding in December, which led to Keith Curle's side playing "home" fixtures at Preston, Blackburn and Blackpool while the stadium recovered.
Carlisle were back on home turf - newly laid turf, at that - against York but the fairytale homecoming failed to materialise, as the visitors, League Two's bottom club, scored a late equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw.
"There's been a lot of work gone on behind the scenes by a lot of people who haven't got the credit and probably think they don't get noticed," manager Curle told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"I can honestly say for myself that I do notice the people who have worked extra hard."
