Samantha Thomas, who had just turned 29, died at a flat on Shakespeare Road, St Dials, Cwmbran, despite neighbours' desperate attempts to save her.
A 49-year-old man, rescued from the apartment and treated at Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital for smoke inhalation, was arrested.
The remaining three flats in the block have been evacuated.
The fire broke out on Tuesday at about 06:40 BST.
Neighbour Gaynor Haines said: "I could hear these terrific screams and I looked out the bedroom window and it was just flames. Dreadful.
"Everyone's in shock, in shock, because we all knew them."
Another neighbour, David Leedham, 20, tried to help Ms Thomas escape.
He said: "The flat was engulfed in flames and she was on the balcony. We tried to reach her with a ladder but couldn't get there."
More than 30 firefighters from Cardiff and Newport rushed to the one-bedroom first floor flat where they tried to get the blaze under control.
They entered the apartment using breathing apparatus and rescued the man who was taken to hospital.
Senior officer Ian Greenman said: "I wish to extend my sympathies on behalf of South Wales Fire and Rescue Service to the family and friends of the individual who sadly lost their life today."
The block of flats had to be evacuated following the blaze and the neighbours are being provided with alternative accommodation.
Duncan Forbes, chief executive of Bron Afon, which owns the flats, said: "Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the woman who died this morning.
"We have found alternative accommodation for seven residents who were evacuated and will be offering any help needed by the police and fire service in their investigation."
Officers want witnesses to call 101.
