Fly-half Rhys Patchell says he is ready to grasp his opportunity after another late call up for Wales.

The 24-year-old joined up with the squad last week for the Tests against Tonga and Samoa following injury to Exeter full-back Phil Dollman.
The Scarlets player, who was also a late addition to the Wales squad last summer for Tests in New Zealand, is hoping to add to his four caps.
"I'm making a habit of this," Patchell told BBC Wales Sport.
"But everyone wants to be a part of the Welsh setup so it's a real pleasure to be involved no matter how the call comes.

"We're training twice a day so there are plenty of opportunities to persuade the coaches you deserve to play."
Patchell impressed  at fly-half for Scarlets as they won the 2016-17 Pro12 title, but won the last of his four international caps at full-back in defeat to the All Blacks in Dunedin in June 2016.
He says he is willing to play in any position if called upon by tour coach Robin McBryde.
"I'd play prop if asked but I've been really fortunate to learn from Stephen Jones [Scarlets attack coach] at fly-half," added Patchell.
"We had a great run-in at the end of the year and a lot of the boys on this tour are from the Scarlets. We played some attacking rugby with ball in hand so there's confidence after playing that sort of brand.
"Hopefully that transfers and helps us play this expansive game plan we're trying to play with Wales."
Wales face Tonga at Auckland's Eden Park on 16 June as part of a double header also featuring New Zealand against Samoa.
Wales then travel to Samoa for a Test in Apia on Friday, 23 June.
