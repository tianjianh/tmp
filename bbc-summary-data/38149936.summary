After Michael Young and Quins' Rob Buchanan traded tries, scores from Juan Pablo Socino and Mark Wilson gave the hosts a 21-8 advantage at the break.
Socino's second extended Newcastle's lead but a brace from Karl Dickson brought Quins to within four points.
Tries from Evan Olmstead and Marcus Watson secured victory, but the visitors grabbed two bonus points with Tim Visser's late converted try.
Both sides capitalised on periods of poor defending, with Newcastle losing focus to allow Quins to come back from 26-8 to make it 26-22 with 20 minutes to go thanks to Dickson's quick brace.
However, Dean Richards' Falcons rallied to secure back-to-back league wins for the first time since February.
Newcastle's fifth victory in 10 Premiership games matches their tally from last season and they move level on points with sixth-placed Harlequins.
The south-west London side are yet to win away from home in the top flight this season.
Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards:
"The side's evolving.
"When you look at who we've got out injured it probably gives you an idea of the strength in depth we've got within the squad now.
"The key people who have come in, like Niki Goneva and Evan Olmstead, are playing outstandingly well and Juan Pablo Socino is playing better than ever.
"I'm delighted with the six tries. There were some absolute pearlers in there."
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston:
"We're clearly not being competitive enough on the road.
"Until such time as we sort that out, we're going to find ourselves slightly frustrated during the course of the season."
