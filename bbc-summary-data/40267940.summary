David Stockdale: Birmingham City to sign Brighton and Hove Albion keeper on 1 July

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City will sign goalkeeper David Stockdale from Brighton and Hove Albion on a three-year deal once his contract expires on 1 July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stockdale, 31, helped Albion win promotion to the Premier League for the first time last season, conceding only 40 goals in 45 appearances.
He was named in both the EFL and the Professional Footballers' Association Championship teams of the year.
Brighton had offered Stockdale a new deal at the Amex Stadium.
Fellow keepers Adam Legzdins and Tomasz Kuszczak signed new contracts this summer, while Blues under-23 goalkeeper Connal Trueman also extended his stay at St Andrews.
After joining Fulham from Darlington in June 2008, Stockdale spent much of his time on loan with spell at Rotherham, Leicester, Plymouth, Ipswich and Hull.
However, it was at Brighton where he established himself as first choice ahead of Casper Ankergren and most recently Niki Maenpaa - and after helping the Seagulls to the play-offs in 2015-16, he achieved a runners-up place in the second tier last season.
