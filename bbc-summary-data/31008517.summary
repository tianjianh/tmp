It is set to be a very busy year for Nick Jonas.

He's releasing a brand new solo album, touring with Iggy Azalea in the US and still starring in Kingdom as an MMA fighter.
Now he's announced that he'll be starring in Ryan Murphy's new Fox mini-series Scream Queens and Nick says filming for that kicks off in March.
He will be appearing alongside the likes of singer Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle from Glee.
Also starring in the show will be Emma Roberts and Jamie Lee Curtis.
Scream Queens is being described as a comedy-horror, where a murder on a college campus throws everything into turmoil.
"As an actor I was trying to find projects that I was passionate about and that would help me to grow," he said.
"Kingdom is a really serious dramatic role. I play Nate Kulina on that show.
"So we were looking for something that would break that up a little bit, on the comedy side. So this is a darker comedy.
"Ryan Murphy is obviously a creative genius and has had major success in the last couple of years, whether it's Glee or American Horror Story.
"So I think this will be another success story."
Nick's new single Jealous is due out at the end of February and has already clocked up some impressive hits on YouTube (more than 31 million views) and Spotify (more than two and a half million streams).
Call us cynical, but it may have to do with him ditching his purity ring and flaunting his six pack at every given opportunity.
