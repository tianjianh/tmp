[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peter Andre branded 'unsatisfactory witness' by judge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peter Andre has been deemed an "extremely unsatisfactory witness" by a High Court judge in a case involving the production of his reality TV show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Andre told ITV2 and the court he had received death threats on Twitter from Neville Hendricks, who produced his TV shows, after the pair fell out.
ITV cut ties with Mr Hendricks, claiming breach of contract.
But the High Court rejected the death threat claims and said ITV2 must pay "substantial damages".
Mr Hendricks' company, Mr H TV, produced Mr Andre's The Next Chapter series and Here To Help, along with Kerry Katona's reality projects, working closely with the singers' manager Claire Powell, head of CAN Associates.
Ms Powell and Mr Hendricks' had what was described as an on-off relationship, sharing a son together, before an acrimonious split in 2011.
Ms Powell's relationship with Kerry Katona also broke down, amid false rumours she was having an affair with Mr Hendricks. He believed the rumours were being spread by Ms Powell.
Around he same time, Mr Hendricks set up a Twitter account from which tweeted or engaged in conversations giving intimate details of Mr Andre and Ms Powell's private lives "in the most scurrilous and vitriolic terms," said the judge.
Mr Andre's solicitors wrote to Mr H TV, saying he "wanted no further dealings" with the company.
The judge said the letter was "almost certainly" responsible for ITV2 terminating its agreement with the production company.
ITV2 also wanted to terminate its contract over a proposal that Kerry Katona would appear on Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 5, claiming it breached an exclusivity clause.
Mr Justice Flaux called Mr Hendricks "an honest witness" and a respected producer of a "particular genre of television, which in a very real sense, he had devised".
He also dismissed Mr Andre's accusations that the tweets constituted a real threat, although they were "offensive and expressed in foul language".
The suggestion that "a grown man in the position of Mr Andre was genuinely scared by what was said in the tweets has to be viewed with considerable scepticism," said Justice Flaux.
"I consider that Mr Andre and Ms Powell used the tweets as a pretext, first to justify refusing to start filming Peter Andre: The Next Chapter series five and second to put illegitimate commercial pressure on ITV2 to terminate its contract with the claimant and use another production company," he said.
He said it was ITV2 that was in breach and not Mr Hendricks, who was seeking damages for lost profits of up to Â£7m.
