Alison May Conroy and Valerie Ann Olton died in the crash, which happened near Fethiye, in the south-west of the country, the Turkish Ministry of Tourism and Culture said.
A further two Britons remain in hospital.
Reports suggest an open-top vehicle crashed into a telegraph pole as the group returned from a day trip.
The Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance.
A spokesman said: "We can confirm the deaths of two British nationals in an accident in Turkey on 23 June. Two other British nationals were hospitalised."
Also in the vehicle were three Turkish nationals, who were injured.
It is believed the party were returning from a trip to the Saklikent Gorge - a canyon in the mountains about 27 miles (44 km) from the town of Fethiye and 310 miles (500 km) south west of the Turkish capital Ankara.
In a statement, the ministry said it took such accidents very seriously "and is taking the necessary action to have it thoroughly investigated by the relevant authorities."
