Rio 2016 Olympics: Just how Great were Britain?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain smashed their medal target for the 2016 Olympics, achieved a succession of notable 'firsts' and caused a major stir by finishing second in the table, above global powerhouse China.

Of the 366 athletes that went to the Rio Games for Team GB, 130 of them - just over 35% - returned with a medal, including every member of the 15-strong track cycling team.
BBC Sport looks at Britain's Brazilian exploits in detail:
GB's tally of six golds continued their amazing success in track cycling, in which they have won 20 of the 30 golds on offer over the past three Games.
Of those wins, 12 have come in individual races - to Sir Chris Hoy (3), Kenny (3), Trott (2), Victoria Pendleton (2), Sir Bradley Wiggins and Rebecca Romero.
Such success has made cycling GB's top sport by a wide margin, with 25 golds from the past five Olympics, almost double the amount rowing - Britain's second-best sport over the period - has collected.
Rowing was GB's best-funded sport in the last Olympic cycle, awarded £32.6m by UK Sport. Cycling was second, receiving £30.2m.
UK Sport spent £274.5m of National Lottery money funding Olympic sports for the Rio Games and set a comprehensive list of medal targets for each one.
Despite winning three golds and two silver medals, rowing fell one short of its minimum medal target of six for Rio 2016.
It was one of two sports that failed to live up to expectations, with GB's modern pentathletes failing to win a medal after being set a minimum target of one.
Cycling exceeded UK Sport's goals for Rio, winning 12 medals - six of them gold - to beat the maximum target of 10 it was set.
Three other sports - diving (target maximum 2; actual 3), gymnastics (5; 7) and swimming (5; 6) - beat the targets they were set.
In 1996, GB won a solitary gold, with Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Matthew Pinsent winning the men's coxless pair in Atlanta.
The advent of UK Sport's National Lottery-funded World Class Performance Programme in 1997 was the first step in helping Britain achieve extraordinary success in subsequent Olympics.
In 2006, the year after London won the right to host the 2012 Games, UK Sport became responsible for all performance funding, which is reflected in figures that have risen from just under £60m for Sydney to the current total for Rio.
