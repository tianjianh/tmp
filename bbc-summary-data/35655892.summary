Six Nations 2016: Dan Lydiate may change tackle style

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flanker Dan Lydiate may consider changing his chop-tackle technique after being shown a yellow card in his last appearance before returning to Wales' Six Nations starting team.

Romanian referee Marius Mitrea judged he had not used his arms in a tackle during the Ospreys win over Edinburgh.
"If it's something that I'm going to get picked up on, then it's something that I'm going to change," he said.
"I was quite surprised, but the ref made a call."
Lydiate was named Six Nations player of 2012 for his defensive efforts in Wales' Grand Slam triumph, often thwarting attacking threats by tackling opponents at ankle height.
But after his yellow card, Lydiate would like clarification on his style of tackling.
He [the referee] said straightaway 'no arms' but I tried to make contact with my arms," he explained.
"I don't go out there to try to flip people or anything like that.
"In other games that would have been seen as a great tackle behind the gain-line, so I thought it was a strange call.
"If I get a chance again I will quiz him (Mitrea) about it because if it's something that's going to cost me ten minutes in the bin, I'm definitely going to have to change things.
"I work on my tackling a lot, not just chop-tackles. I don't know if it was the right call."
Wales centre Jamie Roberts feels Wales need a 20-30% improvement to beat France.
"They are coming on the back of two victories and a confident French team is a dangerous one," said Roberts.
Roberts warned that Wales will face some big-hitting forwards at Principality Stadium.
"The game has changed. French flair is rarely seen now, certainly domestically in the Top 14 because it is a very physical league and some of the forwards are huge.
"That is what is coming on Friday night."
