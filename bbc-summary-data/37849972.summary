The officer was attacked after stopping a Peugeot van in Westmorland Avenue, Cleveleys, at 10:00 BST, Lancashire Constabulary said.
He suffered injuries to his abdomen and face and was airlifted to hospital, the force said.
A 39-year-old man from Blackpool has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody.
The officer's injuries are not thought to be life-threatening, the BBC understands.
Following the attack, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales said "more must be done" to protect officers on duty.
Posting on Twitter, Steve White said officers from the force had recently raised the "issue of their safety and protection" with him.
"Thoughts and prayers are with the officer and their family," he said.
