The 27-year-old midfielder signed a one-year deal to become the Fir Park outfit's fifth summer arrival.
"The vision he set out was very exciting, with a great group of guys and a good family club but with great ambition," Rose told MFC TV.
"I can't wait to get going and give my all for the club."
Rose spent one season with Coventry, where he played alongside another of Motherwell's summer signings, midfielder Gael Bigirimana.

An Australian midfielder, Rose arrived in the UK after spending three seasons in the MLS with the Seattle Sounders.
"I can't wait to play here in front of our fans and give my all for the club," Rose added.
"I'm looking forward to working with Stephen Robinson."
Robinson and Bigirimana are part of a squad overhaul by Robinson, with goalkeeper Trevor Carson, attacking midfielder Craig Tanner and striker Alex Fisher also moving to Fir Park.
Robinson is keen to strengthen his squad further, and hopes to add another goalkeeper to the squad, as well as recruiting more defenders.
"I'm delighted that we've managed to secure the signature of Andy Rose, he's yet another fantastic coup for the club and one of my primary targets," the Motherwell manager said.
"Andy not only brings a physical presence to the middle of the park but he brings energy and drive and I'm very encouraged by the squad we're building here this summer."
"We've also secured the signing of a left-sided defender who has Championship and League One experience and will do pre-season with us before we announce the signing."
