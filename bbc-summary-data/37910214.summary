William McCance, 57, from Baillieston, first abused the girl at a house in the city when she was aged nine in 1984 and continued until 1991.
McCance was also convicted of sexually abusing the girl's brother when he was aged between seven and eight.
The High Court in Glasgow heard the girl only revealed her ordeal years later when she contacted the NSPCC.
In evidence, her brother denied making up stories about McCance, who ran a car parts shop in the city.
He said: "I've spent my life trying to forget what he did to me."
Judge Lord Burns heard how McCance still protested his innocence.
In a pre-sentencing report, McCance claimed the accusations came as a "shock" and that he had "no idea why they made these allegations".
But Lord Burns told him: "These activities have caused incalculable harm.
"You accept no responsibility and show no remorse."
An NSPCC Scotland spokesman said the sentence would hopefully "send out a strong message that these types of offences will not be tolerated".
The spokesman added: "McCance's despicable crimes will have had devastating effects on his young victims.
"It is right that McCance has been brought to justice for his past actions as a result of the enormous bravery of the victim who contacted the NSPCC helpline.
"Child abuse allegations must always be pursued. It is crucial victims of abuse have the confidence to speak out knowing that their allegations will be fully investigated no matter how long ago the offences took place.
"We hope this case will also encourage others to speak out knowing they will be listened to, believed, and provided with appropriate advice and support."
