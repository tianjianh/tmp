The 57-year-old actor and comedian is working with CBS Television Distribution on the format, which will air from autumn 2013.
The Emmy Award-winning Arsenio Hall Show ran from 1989 to '94 and featured guests from Bill Clinton to Hall's Coming to America co-star Eddie Murphy.
His TV comeback follows his recent win on Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice.
When Hall's original show premiered, it was a surprise hit in the US late-night slot that had long been dominated by Johnny Carson's Tonight Show.
His programme regularly featured up-and-coming rappers and stars such as director Spike Lee, comedian Bill Cosby and boxers Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield.
Its place in history was secured in 1992 when then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton played Heartbreak Hotel on the saxophone.
Hall's acting credits include regular appearances on Martial Law in the late 1990s and a variety of roles alongside Eddie Murphy in 1988 comedy Coming to America.
Speaking to the  
          LA Times
, Hall admitted the US late-night TV market was crowded, with his competition set to include The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
"I know there are a lot of shows, but I think there's a space for my show," he said. "In the end, I'm a comic, and nothing fits the talk show mode like a stand-up comic."
Hall also revealed he could revive his trademark "Dog Pound", which saw his studio audience greet their host by pumping their fists and barking.
