Josh Bowden put the hosts ahead before Joe Wardle and Aaron Murphy went over to give the Giants the lead.
Liam Watts and Jamie Shaul put Hull in front but Danny Brough cut the hosts' half-time lead to two points.
Shaul scored his second try in between Danny Houghton and Curtis Naughton scores as Hull rounded off the win before Jermaine McGillvary's late try.
Hull rise to fourth in the table, two points behind leaders Warrington, while Huddersfield's ninth defeat of the season left them bottom with only two points.
Gene Ormsby, who joined Huddersfield on a one-month loan from Warrington this week, would have extended the Giants' early lead if his try had not been disallowed for a forward pass.
Despite limiting Hull's lead at the break, Huddersfield's task was made harder when Brough was sin-binned for dissent soon after Houghton went over.
Marc Sneyd kicked six out of six attempts at goal before his drop-goal just before full-time rounded off a comfortable night for Hull.
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford: "The way we are playing, we have shown we can put points on the table.

"It's a cliche, but you've not seen the best of us. There's a lot of improvement there and we're just happy to be picking up points.
"I'm over the moon with tonight. We had to work for it. It was never going to be spectacular and I'm really pleased."
Huddersfield Giants head coach Paul Anderson: "I thought we threw some decent stuff at them for 40 minutes.
"We gifted them 18 points in that first half. After that, there are some big human beings in that Hull team, we were down to 12 and that never helped.
"It's tough at the moment. It's not about big plans or systems. It's about effort and we need to stick together and keep doing that.
"We have to realise we have some very good rugby players in this team and it's my job to get the best out of them."
