[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey paramedic suspended over 'failed' 999 call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paramedic has been suspended for 12 months for failing to follow up an aborted 999 call from a man who was later found dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A health committee found that Jason Garnham told a call handler to "stop panicking" when they asked if they should keep calling the man back.
Alan Hamilton, 65, phoned the St John Ambulance on Guernsey at 18:13 on 9 July 2014, but the call was cut off.
There was no suggestion the failings contributed to the man's death.
Mr Hamilton was found dead in the groundsman's hut at King George V playing fields at 07:40 the following day.
An inquest found he died from ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrest and complications with diabetes, according to the Guernsey Press.
Matthew Kewley, representing the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), said that ambulance control assistant Ms Crocker took the short call and attempted to call Mr Hamilton - referred to only as "patient A" during the hearing held in Southampton, Hampshire - back twice but was unsuccessful.
He said: "Ms Crocker's evidence is that she asked the registrant [Mr Garnham] whether she should carry on trying patient A's number but was told by the registrant to 'stop panicking'.
"There is a significant factual dispute between Ms Crocker and the registrant. The thrust of the registrant's case is that he categorically stated to Ms Crocker that she needed to document the call in the relevant documentation."
A HCPC spokeswoman said: "Jason Garnham has been suspended from the HCPC register for a period of one year on the grounds of misconduct. All allegations were found to be proved."
The HCPC register is published to provide a list of health care professionals that meet the organisation's standards.
