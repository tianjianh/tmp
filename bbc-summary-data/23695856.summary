Challenge Cup final: Gareth Ellis gives the lowdown on Hull FC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC face Wigan Warriors in Saturday's Challenge Cup final hoping to get their hands on a first piece of silverware since 2005's success over Leeds and, in doing so, put an end to their record of never having won at Wembley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Rhino Gareth Ellis will be hoping to skipper the side to glory in his first season at the KC Stadium since his move from NRL side Wests Tigers.
The England international gives BBC Sport the lowdown of the players Peter Gentle will be sending into battle on Saturday, including the man they call 'the Ogre':
2. Jason Crookes: Wing
It's been a tough year for Jason as he has had to wait very patiently for his chance, but now he has the opportunity to take it and in no better circumstances.
He is a good player so it's great we can bring in somebody of his calibre.
4. Kirk Yeaman: Centre
Kirk is one of our impact players who could change this game for us.
He won the cup in 2005 with Hull and scored two tries in the final at Wembley in 2008. He is a big-game player and really looking forward to this weekend.
5. Tom Briscoe: Wing
I've known Tom for a number of years playing with him for England, thankfully he's started to talk a bit more now.
He is a very understated person, but a superb rugby league player. He is very quick, but it's his strength and power that are his real assets.
6. Daniel Holdsworth: Half-back
In his first season at the club, DJ is a crucial player for us, he really steers the team around.
His kicking game is up there with the best in the competition and we'll need a big performance from him on Saturday.
8. Mark O'Meley: Prop
There is no-one looking forward to this more than Mark. He's played at the highest level, including in an NRL Grand Final and State of Origin matches and this completes the set.
He's relishing the opportunity to play at Wembley and I think you'll see exactly why we call him 'the Ogre'.
9. Danny Houghton: Hooker
'Mint' was another player that missed out on Wembley in 2008, but he's used that as a motivation to build a superb career since.
He is the heartbeat of our team and gets us on the front foot. He's made more tackles than any other player in Super League this year, his effort is unreal.
10. Andy Lynch: Prop
Andy never takes a backwards step and will play a big role for us. He is a natural leader and someone we all look up to.
Like the rest of the team, Wembley is a really big occasion for him and it's something he'll relish with it being the first final of a great career.
12. Danny Tickle: Second row
'Ticks' is Mr Consistency for us. He rarely has a bad game and his goal kicking ability can win us matches on its own.
He's always wanted to win a cup with Hull and this is his chance now before he leaves at the end of the season.
13. Joe Westerman: Loose forward
He's been like a kid in a sweet shop this week, he's really excited. For Joe, playing at Wembley is everything he has worked for and now he has a chance to realise that dream.
He is a very talented player and another individual that could have an impact on the game for us.
14. Richard Whiting: Second row
There's probably nobody more deserving of playing in this final than 'Stilts'. He works tirelessly for the team in any position, including moving to full-back in the semi-final.
He missed out on Wembley in 2008, so this will be special for him.
16. Richard Horne: Half-back
Horney has been around for years and consistently at the top of his game. He won the cup in 2005 and made a brave comeback from a near career-threatening neck injury for the final in 2008.
He's rolled back the years this season with some superb performances and now back fit will make selection extremely difficult for the coach.
17. Liam Watts:  Prop
Wattsy is probably the joker in the pack that keeps us all on our toes and you need characters like that in weeks like this.
On the field though, it's a different story. He is a powerful and mobile forward who has very good skills for a big man.
19. Jay Pitts: Prop
Jay deserves a lot of plaudits. He quietly goes about his businesses with little fuss or acknowledgement, but his performance in the semi-final was one of his best games for the club.
He is another workhorse that will graft until his body can't take anymore.
21. Chris Green: Prop
As a young lad from Hull, Greeny has the chance to make a name for himself in Hull FC folklore. His try at Magic Weekend kicked things off and we're still hearing about it from him now.
He's a huge man who's actually very quick and mobile for his size and he has some good years ahead of him at Hull.
23. Ben Crooks: Centre
Ben is probably favourite for Young Player of the Year. He has made a stunning impact this season and is our leading try scorer.
He has everything going for him to become one of the club's all-time greats and follow in the footsteps of his dad, Lee, a Challenge Cup winner himself with Hull.
29. Jamie Shaul: Full-back
One of our quickest players, Jamie has a real chance to shine.
He's stepped up to cover our injured full-back Shannon McDonnell and not put a foot wrong. He knows where the try line is too.
33. Aaron Heremaia: Hooker
Azza is a great player and has a great story. Five years ago he had given up the game and now he is at Wembley. That is the perfect reward for his hard work to get back to this level.
He tends to come off the bench for us and really lift the intensity in our play, watch what he can do on Saturday.
34. Jacob Miller: Scrum-half
Jacob played with me at Wests Tigers in Australia and I knew he would be a hit in England. He has all the attributes to be a great half-back over here and is already showing the quality he possesses.
This might well be a game where he shows everyone what he is about.
