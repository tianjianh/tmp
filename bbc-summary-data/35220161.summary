Abercynon-born Roberts played for Swansea Town and Northampton before joining Arsenal in 1969.
He spent more than three years in north London and was a member of the Gunners squad that won the league and cup double in the 1970-71 season.
Roberts also played for Birmingham City, Wrexham and Hull and won 22 caps for Wales between 1971 and 1976.
The centre-half was part of the Wales squad that reached the quarter-finals of the 1976 European Championship.
Two years later, he helped Wrexham to win the Third Division and the Welsh Cup.
"Everyone at the Racecourse would like to pass on their sympathies to John's family and friends at this sad time," said a Wrexham statement.
Former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson described him as a "gentle giant and lovely friend" who "played a crucial role" in the double winning season.
