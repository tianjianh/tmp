Wales were missing senior players including talisman Gareth Bale and Arsenal star Aaron Ramsey but did give an encouraging account of themselves.
The Dutch led at half-time through Arjen Robben's goal after the Bayern Munich winger stabbed in a rebound.
Robben also created the hosts' second, crossing for substitute Jeremain Lens to score from close range.
Without the attacking talent of the injured Bale and Ramsey, rested for the trip to Amsterdam, Wales had to rely on Simon Church to lead them in attack.
The Charlton Athletic striker did not see much of the ball in the early stages as the Dutch pinned Wales back in their own half.

23 June: v Chile, Sao Paulo
Wales boss Chris Coleman was also without skipper Ashley Williams, plus fellow defenders Ben Davies and James Collins.
But that allowed Hull City's James Chester to win his first cap, forming a new central defensive partnership with Danny Gabbidon, recently released by Crystal Palace.
After early chances for Robin van Persie and Robben, Wales settled and driven on from midfield by Liverpool's Joe Allen, leading his country for the first time, started to pose some problems for their hosts.
Neil Taylor released Church down the left and he showed his pace to scamper clear before sending an inviting low ball across the area, which needed a good interception from Bruno Martins Indi.
Robben finally broke Wales' resistance when Van Persie's shot was parried by Hennessey but fell kindly for the winger to poke home.
Van Persie was close to making it 2-0 before half-time as he opened up his body but diverted Daryl Janmaat's right-wing cross just past the post.
The Manchester United striker was withdrawn at half-time with a minor groin problem by Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal, who will be his club manager at Old Trafford next season.
Van Gaal must now hope that Van Persie will be fully fit for the World Cup match with holders Spain on Friday, 13 June.
Lens replaced him up front for Netherlands but it was Robben and Sneijder who continued to impress.
Coleman also sent on George Williams for his first cap and the Fulham youngster almost made a spectacular start to international football.
The winger slalomed through three Dutch defenders and only a last-ditch tackle from Ron Vlaar stopped Williams from shooting.
But just as Wales were harbouring hopes of getting something out of the game, the Dutch picked them apart to double their lead.
Sneijder collected a loose ball in midfield and with his second touch sent the ball inside Neil Taylor to find Robben.
The winger laid the ball across the face of goal as Lens arrived at the far post and the Dynamo Kiev striker sidefooted into the net.
Despite the defeat, Coleman can be encouraged by Wales' performance and by debuts that suggest there is a growing depth to his squad as they prepare for September's Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.
