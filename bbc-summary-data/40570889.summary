Konta beat second seed Simona Halep to become the first British woman to reach the semi-finals since 1978.
"It is important to give Judy Murray, who is head of the Fed Cup team, a lot of credit for kind of moulding this player," Tarango told BBC Scotland.
"She is an up-and-comer and I like her attitude of winning a match at a time."
Konta, seeded sixth at Wimbledon lost the first set against her Romanian opponent but fought back to win 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) 6-4.
In reaching the last four, the 26-year-old matches Virginia Wade's feat of 39 years ago.

"Judy Murray has really been a great influence on her," said Tarango, who won 14 doubles titles.
"She has a lot of poise off the court and I think that is starting to translate on the court.
"Every player has talent, but it is how you mould that player and the LTA are doing a great job of getting the right people in there and recruiting the right players."
Konta admits to her love of the sport coming ahead of developing too many friendships as a child in Australia.
At 14, she spent four months away from her parents at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Barcelona.
"She has battled through a lot of adversity as a younger kid and now she's starting to see those fruits," said Tarango, former coach of Andre Medvedev and Maria Sharapova.
Konta will play the five-time champion Venus Williams on Thursday with a final place at stake.
"[At this stage,] anybody has a chance to win and she has been saying that the whole tournament," said Tarango of her chances of winning the women's singles.
"You get a couple extra points a set by being the home favourite and that could be a big difference at this stage."
