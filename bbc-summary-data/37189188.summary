The boy, who cannot be named, had admitted attacking his nine-year-old sister on two separate occasions between February and March.
He was later found with "images" on his mobile phone but these were not described in court.
Sentencing, District Judge Diane Baker said his actions were "so serious and so damaging to your little sister".

"I know a lot about what has happened in your life and your mum's life in the past and the difficulties you faced," she said at Bodmin Magistrates' Court.
The boy, who lives in Cornwall, was convicted of two counts of rape and was given a 12-month referral to a youth offending panel.
He was also ordered to pay a Â£15 victim surcharge and given a notification requiring him to register with the police for 30 months.
Ms Baker said he would have received a detention sentence if he had been older.
Defending the boy, Jodie Leonard said: "He is due to start at school again. I asked him how he is getting on. He is working really hard."
