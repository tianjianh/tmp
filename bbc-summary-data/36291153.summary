Senior managers and staff at Tata Steel UK's Deeside plant say they remain upbeat for its future.

The steel giant confirmed earlier this week that seven bidders want to buy the UK operations.
But while much of the focus has been on the loss-making Port Talbot steel production plant, other sites are turning a profit - including Shotton.
One of Tata Steel's UK directors visiting the plant on Friday said she was confident it had "a strong future".
"This business is all about the construction sector - a really important sector for the UK and for us as a company," said Deirdre Fox, UK strategic business development director for the steel giant.
"We have a list of seven companies who have declared their interest in buying us as a whole entity. That's a good number and it's a real testament to the value that this company represents."
Shotton plant focuses on specially colour coated steel, composite steel panels and galvanised flooring systems.
Its products can be found across the world - in Wales at the Principality and Cardiff City stadiums, at Manchester United's Old Trafford ground, even in the flooring of the London Shard building.
"On a day-to-day basis, the guys here are focused on delivering to our customers," added Ms Fox.
"With customers - and the reputation that we have - out future looks very strong."
