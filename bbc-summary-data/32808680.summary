A witness told the BBC the soldier was hit by accident after police starting shooting at demonstrators.
Protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza's third-term bid have continued despite a ban.
There have been weeks of tension in Burundi after Mr Nkurunziza said he would be a candidate in June's election.
The shooting happened in the Nyakabiga district of Bujumbura. Police eventually withdrew from parts of the neighbourhood leaving the army to restore order, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports from the city.
There has not been an easy relationship between the army and the police, with the police resenting the army's tolerant attitude towards the protests, our correspondent says.
Last week, there was a failed coup against Mr Nkurunziza - senior officials from both the army and police have been arrested and accused of involvement.
Earlier, Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza postponed parliamentary elections due on 26 May for 10 days.
He made the decision after a recommendation from the electoral commission, a spokesman said.
Mr Nkrunziza has been under pressure to delay June's presidential election, but there has been no mention of that.
The African Union and the EU have called for a postponement of the presidential vote and said there should be dialogue to ease the tension.
Mr Nkurunziza has so far rejected that demand, saying the election will go ahead as planned.
Mr Nkurunziza's critics say the third term contravenes the constitution, which requires him to step down after two terms.
They reject a ruling of Burundi's Constitutional Court that Mr Nkurunziza's first term does not count because he was elected by parliament and not voters.
The UN refugee agency says that more than 105,000 people have fled Burundi into neighbouring countries since the conflict started.
Mr Nkurunziza, a former rebel leader, has been president since 2005.
