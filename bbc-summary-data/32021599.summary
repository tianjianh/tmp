Hawick museum Maori war flag's fate to be decided

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are to meet to decide whether a Maori war flag held in the collection of a Scottish Borders museum should be repatriated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A museum in New Zealand has made an official approach to Hawick museum for the flag, taken from a Maori tribe by Crown forces during a battle in 1865.
The bid is supported by descendents of key figures involved in the Battle of Omaruhakeke.
Members of Scottish Borders Council will be asked to approve the move.
The request for the flag by Wairoa Museum in Hawke's Bay on New Zealand's North Island was accompanied by four letters from descendents of Maori leaders.
They said the return of the flag could be a powerful symbol for the resolution of 160 years of social, economic, political and spiritual turmoil for the Maori people in that area of New Zealand.
Councillor Vicky Davidson has already said there was "no good reason" for the flag to be part of the local museum collection.
Scottish Borders Council's executive committee will decide whether or not to return the flag to New Zealand.
