Figueroa's 176kg lift in the clean and jerk meant Indonesia's Eko Yuli Irawan (312kg) was forced to settle for silver, as both men improved on the medals they won at London 2012.
Kazakhstan's Farkhad Kharki won the bronze medal with a total of 305kg.
Chinese favourite Chen Lijun missed out, failing to register in the snatch.
