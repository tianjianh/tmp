[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The locally-recruited regiment was exercising a right to parade granted with freedom of the borough last year.
The Rifles was formed in 2007 by the amalgamation of four Light Infantry and Rifle regiments of the Light Division.
Regimental secretary for Durham Maj (retired) Chris Lawton said the "strong relationship between The Rifles and the people of Hartlepool" was highly valued.
"Many riflemen serving today have their roots in the North East and Hartlepool in particular," he said.
