"Mad" or "Black Friday" is one of the busiest nights of the year as it marks the start of the festive season for many who are finishing work.
A triage unit will be set up in Cardiff city centre, Swansea has a help point and Wrexham's welfare centre will open.
The Welsh Ambulance Service said it took 800 calls last year.
On a typical Friday night it receives about 630 calls.
"Parties and get-togethers are a big feature of this time of year which in turn puts pressure on ambulance crews and clinical contact centre staff," said Gordon Roberts, the trust's interim assistant director of operations.
"It's easy to forget how much alcohol you have consumed when you're enjoying yourself, but while we are dealing with alcohol-related incidents, we could be delayed in treating someone whose situation really is life or death.
"We are not killjoys but we are asking the public to drink responsibly and enjoy themselves safely."
Wales' four police forces have been carrying out a campaigns throughout the festive period.
South Wales Police said officers would have a "visible presence" in Swansea.
Supt Jane Banham of North Wales Police said: "We know from experience that at this time of year some people will come to harm due to alcohol excess and it is the emergency services and local councils who are left picking up the pieces.
"We make a significant contribution to keeping our town centres safe so people can enjoy a good night out.
"But we must get the message across that people need to take greater responsibility for themselves and their friends to reduce the likelihood of them being injured, becoming a victim of crime, or being involved in violence through excessive drinking."
