Matt Dixon: North Ferriby United sign former Hull midfielder after York City exit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League club North Ferriby United have signed former Hull City midfielder Matt Dixon following his departure from York City on 3 February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old played in 13 league games for fellow-strugglers York earlier this season, before leaving the league's bottom club by mutual consent.
He had joined the Minstermen on an 18-month contract in January 2016.
North Ferriby are 23rd in the table, three points adrift of safety and one above York, who have a game in hand.
