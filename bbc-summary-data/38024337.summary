Dalian Atkinson, who played for clubs including Aston Villa and Ipswich Town, died aged 48 in August following the incident in Telford, Shropshire.
His funeral will be held on Saturday.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating and two West Mercia police officers are under criminal investigation.
Mr Atkinson's siblings said they want the funeral to be a celebration of his life but expressed frustration at not knowing "why such force was used" by police.
In their joint statement, Mr Atkinson's family said he had struggled to come to terms with a serious illness affecting his kidneys during the last six months of his life.
His sister Elaine said: "The way that he died while he was so vulnerable casts such a dark shadow over everything.
"Every day is filled with agony and frustration because we still do not know what happened nor understand why such force was used on him."
His siblings described him as "a kind, caring and protective brother" who "always brought life and energy to family gatherings".
They said it was "heart-breaking" to see his health deteriorate with pneumonia, "leaving his light and energy significantly reduced".
His family said he had spoken to his sister Otis on the evening before he died.
They said Mr Atkinson told her: "All I ever wanted was to make people happy.
"I played football the way that I did because I wanted to entertain.
"I wanted everyone to go home with smiles on their faces."
The Taser was used on the former Sheffield Wednesday player outside his father's house on 15 August.
He went into cardiac arrest on his way to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
