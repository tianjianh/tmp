New £10m Willesden Green library and art space opens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £10m library and community space has opened in north-west London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Library at Willesden Green in Brent boasts 40,000 books, an art gallery, exhibition area and performance space.
Developers Linden Homes re-built the 1980s part of the library, which was deemed "inefficient", while incorporating elements from its Victorian heritage.
The council funded the library by working with developers and selling adjacent land for new homes.
In 2011 Brent Council was taken to the High Court by local campaigners over its decision to close six of the borough's libraries in a bid to cut council spending and help it save £104m.
Winning its legal battle the authority closed libraries in Kensal Rise, Barham Park, Tokyngton, Preston, Cricklewood and Neasden.
