The seamer suffered a shoulder injury while playing for Netherlands against Hong Kong in the Intercontinental Cup in February, 2017.
Van der Gugten, 25, returned to Australia for treatment and assessment.
He arrived in Wales in March in preparation for the county season.
The paceman, who was born in New South Wales, claimed 82 wickets in all formats in his debut season and won Glamorgan's 2016 player of the year.
"We've been really pleased with Timm's progress and return to training," said Glamorgan physio Mark Rausa.
"Shoulder injuries can be difficult to heal, especially for fast bowlers.
"But the work Timm has put in with his rehabilitation has meant he has recovered ahead of schedule.
"We expect he will be available for selection ahead of the first county championship match of the year."
