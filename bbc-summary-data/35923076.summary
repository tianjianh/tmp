Two people have been killed and two others injured in a "stabbing" in a house in Canterbury.

A man believed to have known the victims was arrested at the house in Dickens Avenue shortly after 19:30 BST on Tuesday.
Kent Police said two people had suffered fatal wounds and two others were taken to hospital.
Neighbour Rab Hendry told the BBC he helped treat one man, aged in his 20s, who had been stabbed in the stomach.
"I saw two lads, I believe they were brothers, and the oldest one said his brother's been stabbed in the stomach.
"I got him to the ground and saw the wound was opened right up. I put tea towels on him and put pressure on it until [paramedics] came."
Mr Hendry said the "boy was panicking" and "white as a sheet" so he kept talking to him to try to calm him down.
Another resident, who gave his name only as Jamie, said he saw a woman lying in the doorway of the house and what looked like the body of a man further inside.
He said police carried out CPR to try to revive them but he understood they had died.
The man being held by police was arrested at the scene in Dickens Avenue. Kent Police said it was thought he and the victims knew each other.
Residents described their shock at the killings taking place in such a "quiet area".
Charlotte Bunn, 83, who lives opposite the house where the killing took place, said people often lived there for "one or two years then move on".
"I only knew the people who lived there to say hello to when out in the garden or walking in the street. They seem all right. I can't find any fault.
"It's a quiet area. All the time I have lived here I have only had trouble once," said Ms Bunn.
Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, thought the property may have had people placed there by the authorities.
The area around the house was cordoned off and serious crime officers were called to the scene.
Experts in forensic investigation visited the property in Dickens Avenue, with a forensic tent being set up outside the front door.
Kent Police said they were in the process of contacting the next of kin of the victims but formal identification had not yet taken place.
Detectives are currently trying to "establish the circumstances" of the incident, according to a spokesman.
