Northants batsman Ben Duckett says he wants to stay with the county "for life" after being called up by England.

The 21-year-old is in the Test and one-day squad for the Bangladesh tour after scoring heavily this summer.
"It's always in the back of my mind when people say you can't play for England in Division Two," he said.
"All I have to do now is try to perform and do well, but my ideal career would be to play for Northants for the rest of my life and play for England."
Talks are believed to be ongoing between Northants and Duckett's father concerning a new contract at Wantage Road as his current deal expires at the end of next season.
The left-hander is one of three uncapped players in England's Test squad for the tour, alongside Surrey all-rounder Zafar Ansari and Lancashire opener Haseeb Hameed.
Duckett, who has played for England Lions, admits he is "not sure why it's clicked" for him this season, but wants to carry his form into the international game.
"The first thing for me it to get into the side. If I am selected the main thing for me is to play the way I've played all summer, play my natural game," he told BBC Radio Northampton.
"I don't like to set targets, so this summer I haven't really had goals, but every time I go out to bat I want to score 100.
"I think that will be the same if I've got an England or Northants shirt on. Hopefully I can surprise myself even more."
