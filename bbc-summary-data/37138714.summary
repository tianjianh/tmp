[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottingham Forest 3-1 Leeds United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pajtim Kasami and Damien Perquis scored their first goals for Nottingham Forest as the hosts maintained their 100% home record with a deserved victory over Leeds United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kasami's calm sidefooted volley from a corner put the Reds ahead at the break.
And Perquis made it 2-0 with a downward header from another corner.
Kalvin Phillips' superb free-kick gave Leeds hope but, after a nervy spell, Oliver Burke's fourth goal this season wrapped up victory in injury time.
Burke scored with a delightful low finish from a tight angle to lift the tension among the home fans and take Forest's goal tally to 11 goals from three games at the City Ground.
Leeds barely threatened until the final 10 minutes but could easily have found themselves level, with Marcus Antonsson forcing a fine low save from goalkeeper Stephen Henderson and Phillips volleying over.
However, Forest were good value for their victory following a solid first-half which saw Chris Cohen, Henri Lansbury and Kasami on top in the central midfield battle.
Perquis' header doubled the lead given to them by Kasami's strike and seemed to have ensured the win.
The Reds then briefly lost their way after a sweet 20-yard effort from substitute Phillips had made it 2-1, but Burke's late, late finish took them up to sixth place in the Championship.
REACTION: Leeds United manager Garry Monk speaks to BBC Radio Leeds
Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier:
"I don't know if it was the best we have played, but it was a serious challenge for us. It was a tough game and a tough team to play at home so I am very happy with the win and also with the mentality of the squad.
"We needed to be strong defensively and also have the capacity to score goals to win the game.
"We were more solid as a side and that was the target. The target is to be more solid defensively, but also to still play offensively.
"We have to find a good balance and this was a good performance on that front. The balance was much better."
Leeds boss Garry Monk:
"We gifted them two soft goals, which made it difficult. In general play we were the better team.
"From the 46th minute they were wasting time, they looked nervous when it came to holding on to their 1-0 lead. But we never really pushed them back.
"We needed to be more clinical, we needed to take our chances. We conceded soft goals and Forest did nothing in general play otherwise.
"If not for the goals we conceded we would have won the game, definitely."
