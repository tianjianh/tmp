[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two more men have been found guilty of murdering another man who was shot outside a Greater Manchester pub.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieran McGrath, 26, was shot after leaving the Sheldon Arms pub in Ashton-under-Lyne on 4 October 2014. He drove to a police station but died later.
The man who orchestrated his killing, Anthony Henry, 32, was found guilty of murder on Friday.
Troy Beckford, 24, and Jace Smith, 31, were convicted after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
The jury was unable to agree in the case of two other men, Remi Adams, 34 and Scott Chapman, 27, also charged with murder.
Mr Adams was found not guilty of possessing ammunition without a certificate.
A woman, Bretony Gallimore, 24, was found guilty of assisting an offender.
The gun used to kill Mr McGrath was the same gun used to kill Manchester shopkeeper Pragaret Singh three weeks later. Police believe the firearm was passed between criminals.
Mr McGrath was shot after leaving the pub at about 22:25 BST.
Anthony Henry had tracked Mr McGrath's Audi S3 and watched his movements on an iPad, the trial heard.
After being shot, the 26-year-old drove away from the scene to a nearby police station but died after collapsing near the front door.
He died from a single gunshot wound, a post-mortem examination found.
No witnesses to the attack have come forward.
