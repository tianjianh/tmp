Oxford father and daughter who forced man to work jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father and daughter who made a "vulnerable" man carry out forced labour for up to five years have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicholas Iliff was forced to clean up dog mess and tie the shoelaces of his captors in Oxford.
Christopher Joyce, 81, and daughters Mary Joyce, 60, and Helen Collins, 45, all of Redbridge Hollow were convicted after a trial.
Mr Joyce and Ms Joyce were both jailed for 21 months.
Collins received a seven-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay Â£2,000 in compensation.
All three were convicted in June of forced labour offences after a four-week trial at Oxford Crown Court.
They were convicted of conspiracy to defraud Mr Iliff of benefits at a trial at the same court in November last year.
Mr Joyce and Ms Joyce were jailed for 21 months for the forced labour offence and 21 months for conspiracy to defraud, to be served concurrently.
Thames Valley Police said between April 2010 and February 2015, 52-year-old Mr Iliff lived in a brick shed that was "unfit for human habitation", on a travellers' site.
A spokesman said he was made to do heavy manual labour, working for more than 12 hours at a time, for which he was paid Â£5 a day.
The defendants were collecting his benefits, a total of Â£139,000 from 2002 to 2015.
Police said Mr Iliff sustained injuries from the work, including dislocating his shoulder five times, and would be beaten if the defendants were unhappy with his work.
When he tried to leave he was threatened or brought back to the site forcibly, police said.
Timothy Joyce, 45, who also lived on the site, was jailed last year after he admitted affray, fraud and making a person carry out forced labour.
