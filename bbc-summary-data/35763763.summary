Network Rail said flooding on train lines around Daventry, Rugby and Wolverton delayed services between Birmingham New Street and London Euston.
Trains on the West Coast Mainline also ran at reduced speeds due to heavy flooding.
Rose Plumbley, headteacher of Leamington Hastings C of E Academy in Rugby, said many pupils and staff had not managed to get into school.
"We're in the Leam Valley and it's flooded on both roads into school," she said.
"Some pupils did manage to get in but it became very clear that many weren't going to make it in. We decided to close so that the children can get home in daylight safely."
Firefighters rescued drivers from stranded vehicles in Great Alne, Wolston, Baginton and Princethorpe.
There were also reports of cars stuck in Kenilworth Ford.
