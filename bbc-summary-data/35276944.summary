Last September, the Wimbledon winner and current BBC Sports Personality of the Year said he would donate £50 every time he hits an ace on court.
His donations were added to by his sponsors, tennis associations and fans.
Murray created the scheme following the repercussions of the conflict in Syria and said: "It's amazing that we've been able to raise so much."
The Dunblane-born star, who led Britain to Davis Cup glory last year, added: "I remember watching the news last summer and deciding I wanted to do something to help some of the millions of children whose lives have turned upside down by the situation in Syria.
"I'm very grateful to my sponsors and fans for their help in this - I couldn't have done it without them. I know how hard Unicef are working to support these children, and millions of others around the world and I'm proud to have been able to help."
Murray's sponsors Standard Life and Under Armour, along with the Lawn Tennis Association and The Association of Tennis Professionals, matched every £50 donation from the tennis star, and Standard Life employees also participated in fundraising.
Unicef said the donation will allow the organisation to provide over 16,000 children with blankets.
David Bull, Unicef's UK Executive Director, said: "All of us here at Unicef UK are incredibly grateful to Andy for his continued support. Almost five years into the conflict, Syria remains one of the most dangerous places to be a child and millions of children have lost loved ones, homes and schools.
"Their world has been turned upside down by the conflict and humanitarian needs are becoming ever more urgent. The support of Andy, his fans and the wider tennis community will help us provide support for children who have lost so much."
