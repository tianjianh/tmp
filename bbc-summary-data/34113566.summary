Lennon, 28, who was on loan at Goodison Park last season, joins for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal.
Mori, 24, who signed for £9.5m on a five-year deal, passed his medical last week at Goodison Park but had been waiting for a work permit.
Everton have turned down three bids from Chelsea for centre-half John Stones, the last of which was £30m.
Lennon made 14 appearances and scored two goals for Everton after joining on loan in February.
He was out of contract with Spurs at the end of the 2015-16 season after being frozen out by Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino.
Everton manager Roberto Martinez said: "He had a major role in the second half of our season and we're looking forward to Aaron kicking on and continuing to enjoy his football, as well as being the productive player we know he can be.
"He is well-respected in the dressing room, his experience in the Premier League is immense and he will immediately add to our squad and to the ambition we have as a club."
Mori joined River Plate in 2008 as a youth player and made 108 appearances, scoring 10 goals.
He has one international cap for Argentina, making his debut in March when his side beat El Salvador 2-0 in a friendly match.
"Everton did everything to bring me over and I wanted to come. They have a lot of good players so I'm very happy to be here," said Mori, a centre-half.
"When I heard about Everton's interest, I didn't think twice and I'm going to give it 100% every time I go out there to play."
BBC Sport's South American football expert Tim Vickery told BBC Radio 5 live: "I would love to be wrong about Ramiro Funes Mori. But the only really good thing I can say about him is that language is not going to be a problem.
"That's important for defenders, because defending is nothing if it's not collective. When Argentina's economy tanked in 2001, Mori's family relocated to Dallas, Texas. He grew up there and speaks very good English as a result.
"He's left-sided and he can play left-back as well. But I don't think he has the quality, the physicality or the pace to survive in the Premier League."
And BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty says the move is a "gamble".
"The Mori figure is one that may raise a few eyebrows as the deal has recently been touted as being worth £5.5m then £6.25m - but nothing as high as £9.5m," he said.
"It represents a gamble, at that stated price certainly, for a defender who, according to reports from South America, may take some time to adapt to the pace and tempo of the Premier League."
Tim Vickery tells BBC Radio 5 live that Mori 'won't survive in the Premier League'.
