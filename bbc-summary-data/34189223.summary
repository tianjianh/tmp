[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An airline has introduced a new compassionate travel policy on its 19 Scottish routes following a campaign on social media criticising its air fares.

Loganair is offering a 50% discount to eligible customers who need to make bookings at short notice because of a family emergency.
These include travel to funerals of an immediate family member.
Loganair said the new policy was developed in partnership with two Shetland-based campaigners.
Scott Preston and James Stewart started a campaign on Facebook calling for reduced fares and greater flexibility in booking travel on Loganair's routes.
Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney councils backed the campaign.
The discounted fares can be applied for when there has been a bereavement, critical unexpected illness or in-patient treatment involving an immediate family member.
Loganair chief executive Stewart Adams said: "With the introduction of this policy we believe Loganair is now offering a comprehensive compassionate fare unique in the UK airline industry.
"More importantly, we are confident the reduced fares will be of great benefit to our customers in circumstances of bereavement and critical illness - the very times they need assistance most.
"The compassionate fare policy is the direct result of weeks of constructive collaboration between the airline, Scott Preston and the volunteers of the Facebook page campaign."
An application form has been made available on Loganair's website for people who want to use the discount.
