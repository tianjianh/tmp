Two males have been arrested following the incident at Ty Nant Cat Sanctuary in Cymmer at 19:50 BST on Saturday.
A sanctuary spokesman said: "All our hard work and love that we have shown these cats has been devastated."
An online fundraising page set up on Sunday raised more than Â£3,000 in just four hours.
Writing on the sanctuary Facebook page on Saturday, the spokesman said: "Our room that we have our older cats reside in has been broken into and most of the cats that we had there are now missing/stolen.
"One cat was found killed in the lane, and only one other has been found and returned."
They added: "We have to work together through this nightmare."
South Wales Police confirmed the arrests and said the males are currently in police custody.
They also appealed for any witnesses to contact them on 101.
