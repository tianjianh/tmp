Staffline bought Brightwork, which runs offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh, for an undisclosed sum.
Brightwork specialises in temporary and permanent jobs in the drinks, warehousing, manufacturing and distribution sectors.
Staffline said the acquisition was part of a drive to develop its business in Scotland.
Staffline chief executive Andy Hogarth said: "We have been increasing our capability in Scotland in recent years and this acquisition will accelerate the growth of both businesses as it provides scale, as well as greater geographic coverage and value-added services.
"We can offer our clients a greater national service."
Staffline, which was established in 1986, specialises in logistics, e-retail, manufacturing, driving, food processing and white collar recruitment.
Its portfolio of more than 1,600 clients includes major supermarket chains, logistics and distribution centres and customer service organisations.
