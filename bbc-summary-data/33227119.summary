[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man was attacked with a hammer and 12in machete in a racially-motivated revenge assault for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zack Davies, 26, from Mold, Flintshire, followed Dr Sarandev Bhambra into Tesco in the town and carried out a "brutal and unprovoked attack".
Mold Crown Court heard the trainee dentist's hand was almost severed from his arm.
Mr Davies denies attempted murder but admits wounding with intent.
The jury was told Dr Bhambra was walking down an aisle in the store on 14 January when he felt a "huge blow" from the 30cm blade to the back of his head.
He tried escape but Mr Davies attacked him again.
Dr Bhambra suffered severe and life-changing injuries, the court was told.
He said former soldier Peter Michael Fuller saved his life when he intervened during the attack.
Mr Fuller told the court he saw an Asian man crouched down on his knees while another man hit him with a machete.
The pair ran towards him and, as the attacker approached, Mr Fuller said he stood in the middle of the aisle, put his hands up and shouted: "Stop, this is madness, I am ex-forces."
Mr Fuller said the man's demeanour changed and he started to engage with him.
He put the weapons down and the pair spoke until the police arrived.
Mr Fuller described the attack as one of the worst incidents of violence he has ever seen.
Sion ap Mihangel, prosecuting, said Mr Davies identified Dr Bhambra because of his race and his "Asian appearance".
He told the court: "This attack was racially motivated... as the attack was taking place he was shouting words such as 'white power', 'this is revenge' and 'this is for Lee Rigby'."
Mr Davies told police it was "a moment of madness" and he never intended to kill Dr Bhambra.
He said he heard voices telling him to follow and attack the victim.
Dr Bhambra said, had he lost consciousness, Mr Davies would have "hacked me to pieces".
Fusilier Rigby was murdered in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013.
Two men, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, were jailed for life in February 2014 for hacking the soldier to death.
The court heard items associated with white supremacy and Nazism were found at the defendant's home, including banners, swastika badges and Combat 18 stickers.
Mr Davies told police he was a member of a far-right organisation, but had acted alone at the supermarket.
The jury was told Mr Davies was expelled from school at the age of 11 or 12 after taking a knife onto the premises to attack a classmate.
The trial continues.
