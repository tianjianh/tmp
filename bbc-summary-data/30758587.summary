The visitors led 2-0 inside 10 minutes through Sam Smith's superb finish and Tony Gray's close-range header.
And when Connor Jennings was dismissed for a late tackle on Godfrey Poku on 30 minutes, Wrexham faced an uphill task.
The Bucks confirmed the points with Gray's emphatic finish and centre-half Neill Byrne's unopposed header which had the home fans streaming home with still 20 minutes left to play.
Telford are now unbeaten in five games under new manager Steve Kittrick to five, their second straight Conference away win lifting them to within a point of second-from-bottom Nuneaton - nine adrift of safety.
Wrexham slip to 16th place, 10 points adrift of the play-off places and with pressure mounting on manager Kevin Wilkin.
Wrexham manager Kevin Wilkin:
"Telford - scrapping and battling for their lives - got in our faces and there was a real hangover from the Stockport game when we won 6-1.
"They didn't allow us to move the ball around, they got the ball in good areas and stretched us.
"That's not good enough. I'm accountable and I'm responsible for that. You set the players up, ask them to do a job and they haven't done that."
AFC Telford  manager Steve Kittrick told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"I don't think the sending off had an impact on the game. We fully deserved to win. It was a vibrant performance. If we get points on the table, we will be closer to what we want to do.
"It's great see the change. I wanted the players to play high up the field as we have nothing to lose. They have all put a shift in and it's great to see a smile on everyone's face.
"The players just needed a bit of belief. Players have a point to prove when you're bottom of the table. They all have excellent CVs and want to be playing at the highest level they can."
