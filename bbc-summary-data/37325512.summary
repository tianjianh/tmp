Wycombe Wanderers 1-0 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dayle Southwell's first-half goal was the difference as Wycombe Wanderers edged past Stevenage at Adams Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Chairboys, searching for their first league victory since 13 August, showed promise in a quiet opening period to the game with Michael Harriman's free-kick producing an excellent save from Jamie Jones.
The hosts then went close again with Southwell failing to convert a gilt-edged chance on the stroke of half-time.
Southwell however went from villain to hero moments later as the forward tapped home Sam Wood's cross in the third minute of first-half stoppage time.
Both sides upped the tempo in the second half and a strong midfield battle ensued, but the Chairboys were able to resist Stevenage with Andrew Fox spurning the best opportunity for the visitors.
Indeed, though the Boro dominated the latter stages of the game, a barrage of long balls came to nothing as the home side saw the game out to record their second league victory of the season.
