The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said it was "a unique strategic opportunity" to hold the event in the United States for the first time.
IAAF chief Lamine Diack said the decision was taken "in the interest of the global development of our sport".
Eugene missed out on the 2019 event.
Doha in Qatar was awarded that championships, but a recent presentation to the IAAF persuaded the governing body the American city is capable of staging a major event.
Diack added: "In granting the championships to Eugene the IAAF Council have made a clear choice on a strategic decision that enables us to take advantage of a unique opportunity that may never arise again.
"It will see public authorities, the private sector, the national Olympic Committee, NBC and a particularly enthusiastic public joining forces."
Eugene has strong links to sportswear giant Nike.
The company's co-founder Phil Knight - the 35th-richest person in the world - attended the University of Oregon in the city and has helped fund buildings at the campus. Nike's other co-founder, Bill Bowerman, was an athletics coach at the university.
Nike also sponsors the city's IAAF Prefontaine Classic, which is part of the Diamond League calendar.
The 2007 World Championships, held in Osaka, Japan, were also awarded without a bidding process.
