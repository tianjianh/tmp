'Say yes Madonna,' begs wrestler Grado, over use of Like a Prayer

He's one of the biggest personalities in Scottish wrestling and that's in no small part down to his entrance tune.

Grado, whose real name is Graeme Stevely, walks up to the ring accompanied by the song Like a Prayer by Madonna.
But now the singer has denied permission for the wrestler from North Ayrshire to use the track in a US broadcast of one of his matches.
So Grado is on a social media campaign to get her to change her mind.
"This Friday on American telly I was getting the go-ahead for my match with Al Snow from The Hydro [in Glasgow] to be shown in full, with the Like a Prayer entrance - I was over the moon," he explains on his Facebook page.
He understood that TNA (Total Nonstop Action) Wrestling had negotiated with "several important publishers" to get the rights.
But on Wednesday he received an email saying that use of the tune had been "denied on behalf of Madonna".
"Now I get the feeling there is no way, she was on the blower talking about some daft Scottish wrestler about using her choon on the TV," writes Grado.
"[That] is why I want to try and reach out to her Madge herself and to let her know how much the song means to myself and the wrestling world."
Since he posted his plea online, #SayYesMadonna has become a top UK Twitter trend, while his Facebook post has attracted 1,400 shares.
In a YouTube video Grado tells the singer that he, his sister and his mum are all fans of Madonna.
"I know you've got a wee bit of a problem yourself with the BBC right now. I could maybe try to help you with that as well. We could stick together," he jokes at one point, referring to BBC Radio 1's decision not to playlist her latest track.
The show, which features Grado taking on Al Snow, will be on Challenge in the UK this Sunday at 9pm, however this broadcast is also affected by the decision not to allow Like a Prayer to be played.
The singer has yet to comment on the decision to stop Grado from using her track.
Newsbeat has contacted representatives for the musician, but has yet to receive a statement.
In addition to his professional wrestling, Grado has recently gained roles in the BBC Scotland television programmes Scot Squad and River City.
