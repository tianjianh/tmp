2016 Confederation Cup: TP Mazembe to play Mouloudia Bejaia in final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DR Congo's TP Mazembe and Algeria's Mouloudia Bejaia both edged into the final of the Confederation Cup on the away-goals rule.

Mazembe were held to a 0-0 draw by visiting Confederation Cup holders Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia on Sunday in the second leg of their semi-final to make it 1-1 on aggregate.
The 2015 African Champions League winners progress thanks to the goal scored in the first leg by Ivorian Roger Assale in Tunisia.
Mouloudia Bejaia progressed after they earned a 1-1 draw in Morocco against FUS Rabat after a goalless first leg.
Defender Mohammed Nahiri scored his fifth of the goal the campaign for Rabat after 73 minutes when he scrambled the ball home from close range.
Rabat were on the verge qualifying for the finals when they failed to deal with a free-kick into their area and Faouzi Rahal bundled the ball over the line for the crucial away goal.
The final will be held over two legs in October and November.
