What is Hanukkah the Jewish festival of lights? Newsround's guide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In the UK, and all around the world, adults and children are celebrating the Jewish festival of lights, called Hanukkah.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It lasts for eight days - this year it's from the 6th of December until the 14th.
The word Hanukkah means 'rededication' and celebrates one of the greatest miracles in Jewish history.
What's the story of Hanukkah?
The festival reminds Jews of a time over 2500 years ago when the Jews won a battle against the Greeks to practise their religion freely.
The Greeks had banned all Jewish rituals.
To celebrate, an oil lamp was lit in a Jewish temple. There was only enough oil to burn for one day - but miraculously it burned for eight days.
This is why the Hanukkah festival lasts for eight days and why light is really important in the celebration.
How is it celebrated?
Hanukkah is a fun time for children - gifts and Hanukkah money are given.
Some families give a small present on each of the eight nights of Hanukkah.
Children and adults play with a spinning top called a dreidel - a cube-shaped dice has a Hebrew letter on each side.
To begin the game, each player has 10-20 objects, often raisins or sweets. Each person puts one object in the middle and takes a turn at spinning the dreidel.
The letter that the dreidel shows when it has finished spinning determines whether they win or lose.
The holiday is also celebrated by lighting an eight-branched candlestick called a Menorah, one candle a night.
Hanukkah food
Hanukkah is a great time for eating delicious food.
Some dishes have special significance, such as latkes (a kind of potato fritter), pancakes and doughnuts.
This is because they are fried in oil and so Jewish people remember the miracle of the oil lasting eight days in the temple.
