[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burry Port harbour area regeneration project on hold

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major regeneration project for the area around Burry Port harbour has been put on hold, following intervention by the Welsh government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carmarthenshire's planning committee was due to consider six applications to develop several hundred new houses.
But head of planning Eifion Bowen said the Welsh government has been asked to "call in" the application.
The Welsh government said the move had been taken to give ministers more time to consider the requests for call in.
The plans also include leisure facilities and a new Welsh-medium primary school.
