Devon rail line cut off by floods reopens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The flood-hit main railway line into Devon and Cornwall has reopened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work to restore the track after it was severed by floodwater was well ahead of schedule, Network Rail said.
The line was breached in several places at Cowley Bridge just north of Exeter at 23:30 GMT on Monday, causing widespread disruption to travellers.
Engineers have been working round the clock to repair the track which was washed away by flood waters from the River Exe.

Extra staff were brought in to repair 90 signals, and 800 tonnes of ballast has been used to shore up the track.
Both the main line to London and the Tarka line between Exeter and Barnstaple will be back in action.
Network Rail had originally planned for it to reopen at 04:00 Thursday.
