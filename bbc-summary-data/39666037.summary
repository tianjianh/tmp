Atkinson, 19, clinched gold in the women's 200m butterfly, adding to the 50m title she won on Wednesday.
Her winning time of 2 minutes 7.06 secs also secured a consideration time for this summer's World Championships and smashed the Manx record.
"I knew I felt good and it's great to set a time for Budapest," she said.
Her winning time in Thursday's final would have placed her fifth in the women's 200m butterfly final at the Rio Olympics.
Alys Thomas, representing Swansea Aquatics, finished 0.81 seconds down in second with Emily Large third.
Earlier in the week, Atkinson became the first Isle of Man-born swimmer  to become British champion by claiming the 50m title.
The Loughborough University student said: "It feels amazing. I was so determined after the 50 to get the 200 and I've still got the 100 on Sunday.
"Going fast in the 50, which isn't my main event, gave me loads of confidence in the 200 - I feel great."
She will attempt to add the 100m title to her collection on Sunday.
