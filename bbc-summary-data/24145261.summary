Tommy Robinson and his friend had been in the London department store on Monday when they were declined help.
Selfridges said the staff member was suspended for violating company policy.
A spokesman said everyone was welcome in the store "regardless of political opinion".
However, they said the staff member, who is expected to return to the shop floor this week, would not face any further action.
After the incident the pair were offered a complimentary meal.
The spokesman said: "If something happens against company policy you need to investigate it.
"The assistant has worked for Selfridges for seven years with an unblemished record and he accepts what he did was wrong."
