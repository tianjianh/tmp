[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Construction has begun on a new Remembrance Centre at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

The Â£15.7m development should be completed by late 2016 and allow the arboretum to host up to 500,000 visitors a year.
The charity has already raised over Â£10m towards the works, which will see the cafe and reception area improved.
The Duke of Cambridge, a patron of the project, said: "Those who visit deserve to be looked after when they are here."
His words were read by actress Dame Penelope Keith, a member of the Arboretum's fundraising Appeal Council, at a ground-breaking ceremony at the site in Alrewas.
The 150-acre (61 hectare) site remembers contains more than 300 memorials dedicated to all the armed forces, emergency services and civilians.
