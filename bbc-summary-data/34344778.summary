Do Met Police apologies signal new 'touchy-feely' approach?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Met Police has issued two apologies over high-profile mistakes. Has it become more willing to admit when it gets things wrong? Or does it signal a new "touchy-feely" approach for the heavily-scrutinised force?

This week saw the latest in a string of apologies from London's police force.
Brothers Christopher and Andrew Hilliard were sent a written apology after they were acquitted of committing violent disorder at a 2010 protest.
Separately, Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe personally apologised to the family of 18-year-old Alistair Calvert after the Met wrongly "inferred" his death from natural causes was linked to consuming nitrous oxide and alcohol.
A Met Police spokesman said there had been no change in policy and guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council has long endorsed public apologies.
"There's always been a policy where we apologise when we get things wrong," he said.
"It's in our code of ethics."
But experts said we're in an era of "empathise, sympathise, apologise".
Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation, said the number of apologies had increased.
"By definition we are apologising more - as we didn't use to apologise before," he said.
But he put the readiness to admit mistakes down to a culture change. It was, he said "a different era" when he joined the police about 20 years ago.
Syria runaways
In March, Sir Bernard said sorry to the families of three girls feared to have travelled to Syria to join so-called Islamic State. A letter intended for the girls' parents telling them a friend of the teenagers had fled to Syria in 2014 never reached them.
Nordell Edmondson's unlawful arrest
In September last year, the Met apologised and paid Â£45,000 in damages to black motorist Nordell Edmondson, who launched a civil claim for race discrimination and assault during an unlawful arrest. He claimed he was struck with batons. Scotland Yard settled out of court.
Cherry Groce shooting
In March last year it was reported Commander Neil Basu had apologised to the family of Cherry Groce, who was shot at home in 1985 by officers looking for her son [he was never charged]. The incident sparked the Brixton riots.
Ms Groce was left paralysed from the waist down, and remained in a wheelchair until she died in 2011.
Sir Bernard apologised "unreservedly" for the shooting and the time it had taken to say sorry.
He said it was "inexcusable" the force had taken so long to acknowledge the police raid that led to her shooting had been inadequate.
Gareth Thompson, senior PR lecturer at the London College of Communication (UAL), said "blustering" - promising to establish the facts in the hope the press would lose interest - used to be the common approach.
"The Met and other institutions have found it's the new way to make things go away quickly and economically - to empathise and sympathise on a touchy-feely emotional level," he said.
Mr Marsh, agreed, and said there is greater scrutiny and information exchange in the modern day.
"If it's been examined correctly and we've been found wrong we should hold our hands up," he said.
"But there is a feeling we are damned if we do and damned if we don't.
"We are fed up as a police force of being criticised for everything."

"Sorry" doesn't seem to be the hardest word for the UK's biggest police force at the moment.
The Met - under Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe - wants to show it's willing to put its hands up when it's at fault.
It's all about trying to restore the public's trust - trust lost following recent allegations that undercover officers spied on Stephen Lawrence's family, the cover-up over "Plebgate", and the claim that police turned a blind eye to - or were even complicit in - historic child abuse.
Many of the things the Met has apologised for recently have been actions carried out in a different decade, but the apology to the family of Alistair Calvert shows what the Met does - and says - in the present day is open to more scrutiny than ever before.
