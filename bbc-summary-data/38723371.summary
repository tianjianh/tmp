On the first day of his trial, Welsh, of Short Lane, Feltwell, admitted having an explosive substance, making the devices and posting them through the letterbox on 27 January 2016.
He pleaded not guilty to doing an act with intent to cause an explosion. The charge will lie on court file.
The court heard when police searched Welsh's home, they uncovered a stash of chemicals which could be used to make bombs.
He had made the devices months before and had been spoken to by police about setting off explosions in his garden in the past, it was heard.
The court heard there were concerns about Welsh's mental state and he had been in dispute with doctors before the incident.
Judge Mark Lucraft QC ordered two reports - one psychiatric and the other from the probation service on Welsh's potential dangerousness - ahead of sentencing.
