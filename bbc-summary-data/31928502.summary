[SN]TITLE[SN]
Winchester Cathedral roof frame lift postponed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An operation to lift a 27-tonne frame on to the roof of Winchester Cathedral has been postponed because the crane did not have enough counterweights.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The frame was due to be hoisted up in sections by a 200-tonne crane on Tuesday morning.
Hundreds of people had gathered to watch but experts decided more counterweights were needed, which had to be transported from Bristol.
It is hoped the lift will begin on Wednesday morning, weather permitting.
The operation is part of a project to conserve and restore lead work on the east end of the roof.
It is part of a larger Â£20.5m scheme, which includes new exhibition spaces in the south transept and the refurbishment of the Learning Centre.
