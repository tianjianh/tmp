[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on restoring an old railway tunnel to be part of a north Wales coast to Snowdonia path is nearing completion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lon Las Ogwen path in Gwynedd will soon be rerouted through an old 2,600ft (800m) railway tunnel between Bethesda and Tregarth, known as Tynal Tywyll.
After closing the LNWR branch line to Bethesda in 1962, the tunnel was shut.
But the Welsh Government and Gwynedd Council have funded restoration and it will re-open this month on the 11-mile path between Bangor and Bethesda.
Arfon AM Sian Gwenllian joined a group of enthusiasts to be given a preview of the new route.
Since the Lon Las Ogwen path was opened, cyclists and walkers have been forced to walk along the main A5 road for a mile-long detour and it is estimated that as many as 100,000 journeys are made on it every year.
Gwen Griffith, who represents Tregarth on Gwynedd Council, said: "There has been real desire locally to see the tunnel reopening and we're very pleased that the work is coming along on the project."
