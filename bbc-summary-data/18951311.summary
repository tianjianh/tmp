Nato said the gunman had been in Afghan security force uniform and was shot dead after attacking the contractors. Local officials said he had worked for the regional police command.
The British contractor killed was Dave Chamberlain, of Westgate-on-Sea, Kent.
His family paid tribute to "a loving father, husband, son and brother" who died "doing the job he loved".
"He enjoyed life to the full, and all will miss his exuberant personality," they said in a statement.
His death had "left a great hole in our lives", the statement added.
Afghan officials said on Sunday that the gunman in Herat had also injured the contractors' Afghan translator.
The BBC's Bilal Sarwary, in Kabul, said hundreds of Afghan recruits from several western provinces had joined the national police at the Herat base.
Some of the recruits came from remote areas where Taliban insurgents were in control, he said.
On Monday, local officials said an Afghan National Army soldier also shot and injured two US soldiers in the northern province of Faryab on Monday before being killed.
They said the shooting took place inside headquarters in the district of Ghormach - home to a joint ANA and ISAF base.
Five Nato service members were also killed in roadside bombings over the weekend.
