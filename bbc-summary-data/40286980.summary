Birmingham City have made a contract offer to former Chelsea and England captain John Terry, according to Blues boss Harry Redknapp.

The 36-year-old left the Premier League champions at the end of the season after making 717 appearances and winning 13 major trophies in 22 years.
However, the centre-back only featured 14 times for Chelsea in 2016-17.
"We've made him a good offer and we have done the best we can," Redknapp told TalkSport.
"It's up to John now, but we would love him at Birmingham."
Terry is Chelsea's third-highest all-time appearance maker, behind Ron Harris and Peter Bonetti, and holds the club record for appearances as captain.
But he only started two Premier League games after September last campaign as manager Antonio Conte preferred Gary Cahill, Cesar Azpilicueta and David Luiz as his three centre-backs.
Redknapp recently linked up with Terry for Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick's testimonial match, with Terry captaining Redknapp's All-Stars.
He could become Redknapp's second signing as Blues boss, following the arrival of goalkeeper David Stockdale on a free transfer from Brighton on Tuesday.
