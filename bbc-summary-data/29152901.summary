Police were called to the One Stop shop in Charlotte Street, Ilkeston, at about 05:35 BST.
Soon after they received calls to say two men had been stabbed at a house in the same street.
A man in his 30s, named locally as Paul Averill, died at the scene and a 23-year-old suffered life-threatening injuries.
A third man, also 23, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and suspicion of wounding.
Police said they were treating the stabbings and armed robbery as two separate investigations.
Friends of the murdered man told BBC East Midlands Today he had a young daughter and worked at E.On in Nottingham.
"Such a tragic loss, so unfair," said Ben Foulding.
BBC Radio Derby reporter Rob Watts said the main police activity centred around two houses in Charlotte Street, one of which appeared to be empty.
Supt Gary Parkin said officers had been dealing with the armed robbery at the shop when they were called to a nearby house 10 minutes later.
"In that address we discovered that there had been a violent incident and found one man deceased," he said.
"The incidents were in very close proximity to each other but we are keeping a very open mind to whether they are connected."
He said officers from the East Midlands Major Crime Unit were on site investigating and officers would be questioning the man in custody.
Residents Julie and Craig Eaton said they were woken up by loud banging.
"We shot out of bed because it sounded really close," they said.
"There were eight police cars and ambulances with lights flashing everywhere.
"It's not something you expect to wake up to. It's worrying that something like this can happen right opposite you."
Mr Eaton said the shop had been targeted by armed robbers at least three times in the last year.
Neighbour Gill Ferguson said forensics officers had been in and out of the house all morning.
She described the property as "unkempt" looking and said she did not know the family who lived there.
"Recently, someone has cut the grass and the fence has been repaired but for much of the last seven years it's been unkempt," she said.
"The shop has been unlucky, because it's been raided two or three times recently, and every time they go for the cash machine inside."
The injured man was was taken to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.
A number of roads in the area have been closed while investigations are carried out.
Charlotte Road is shut, as are stretches of Heanor Road, Cotmanhay Road and Norman Street.
