Wales' record goalscorer Ian Rush does not think Chris Coleman will sign a new contract as Wales manager until after Euro 2016.

The 45-year-old's deal ends after the Euros but he is yet to agree anything with the Football Association of Wales.
Coleman said in March that he and the FAW were "apart" during talks, while in April they improved their offer to him.
But Rush does not think it is important enough to be sorted before their first game against Slovakia on 11 June.
"I don't think it'll affect things if he doesn't sign," said Rush, who scored 28 goals in 73 caps for Wales in a 16 year period.
"Look at [Antonio] Conte now, he's going to Chelsea and if Italy don't do well they'll most probably blame that.
"I don't think that's the case with Chris and Wales. I think if anything is going to be done, I think it'll be done after the Euros."
Coleman has been linked with the vacant manager's job at Aston Villa whilst there has also been speculation hometown club Swansea City could be interested if they decide not to retain head coach Francesco Guidolin for next season.
The former Fulham and Coventry City boss indicated he wants to stay on for the World Cup campaign which starts in September, following the conclusion of Wales' first international tournament for 58 years.
"We'd all like him to [sign a deal before the tournament] and it would give everyone a boost but if he doesn't, let's get on with the Euros and see what happens after," Rush continued.
"It gives everyone an incentive. If they want Chris to stay and the team is winning there's only one thing they can do, he's got to stay."
