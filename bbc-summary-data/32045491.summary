[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public Health England (PHE) said the unnamed pupil at Teign School in Kingsteignton was receiving treatment and "recovering well."
TB is a bacterial infection which usually affects the lungs. It is passed on through coughs and sneezes among people who have been in close contact for some time.
This follows another case at Westlands School earlier in March.
PHE is offering TB screening to pupils and staff that shared lessons with the infected pupil.
Dr Sarah Harrison, Deputy Director of Health Protection for Public Health England in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset said the people most at risk were family members.
"First and foremost, it is important to stress that TB is difficult to catch. The people who are most at risk are those living in the same household.
"It is important to remember that TB is normally a curable infection which can be treated effectively with antibiotics, particularly if found early."
Mark Woodlock, head of Teign School, said he is working with Public Health England to identify and screen pupils and staff.
He said: "It is never pleasant to share news that a member of our community is unwell and I wish our student a speedy recovery."
NHS England said that in 2013, there were 7,290 cases of TB reported across England - about 13.5 cases per 100,000 of the population.
The UK has the second highest rate of TB among western European countries and rates are nearly five times higher than in the US.
