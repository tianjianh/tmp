BBC pundit Alan Hansen was not alone in struggling to comprehend Germany's 7-1 destruction of Brazil in the World Cup semi-final.
From the five goals in 19 devastating first-half minutes, to the sixth and seventh in the second half, it was a truly remarkable and shocking night.
Here is that amazing story told through goal-by-goal video clips (UK only) and the reactions of the Match of the Day punditry team as the enormity of what was happening unfolded.

Alan Hansen: "Mats Hummels moves Dante as the corner comes in. David Luiz loses Thomas Muller and gets blocked by Miroslav Klose in a well-worked corner, but again Brazil should do better."
Alan Shearer: "That is worked on the training ground. That does not just happen on the night."
Rio Ferdinand: "I would not be happy to concede a goal like that but you have to admire the attacking play."

Alan Shearer: "Klose is in the right place at the right time. He gets a little bit of luck because of the lack of reaction from Marcelo, who is having an absolute nightmare."
Alan Hansen: "There are about 26 defensive mistakes by Brazil in the build-up to that goal. Right from the start, they do not close down quickly enough on the left-hand side and, when it comes across, Fernandinho misses it. The two centre-backs are out of position and Marcelo is about 15 yards behind them."

Rio Ferdinand: "Germany looked like they were almost embarrassed to be scoring because it was coming too easy. They came down the left again and Marcelo looks like he does not want to be defending at all. There are lots of defenders in there but nobody is taking responsibility to pick anyone up."

Alan Hansen: "If the third goal was bad, what about this one? This is right from the kick-off. We were talking about David Luiz and how he has got to step up to the plate."
Rio Ferdinand: "Germany have punished every mistake. It seems like Thiago Silva is the glue in the Brazil back four and keeps everyone together, because Marcelo has played like a left-winger, even at 5-0 down. Nobody is bringing him back."

Alan Hansen: "This is David Luiz's fault again. He comes running 15 yards in front of the other centre-back and jumps out of the tackle. We said before the match that David Luiz is the captain, supposed to be the leader, but he has abandoned ship I am afraid. He has disappeared."
Rio Ferdinand: "That is embarrassing. When you do that, you are leaving your team-mates in the lurch. As a centre-half, he has to win the ball there."
Alan Shearer: "When you are 4-0 down, you cannot pull out of that tackle."
Half-time
Rio Ferdinand: "I remember playing for Manchester United against Liverpool at Old Trafford when they beat us 4-1 a few years ago and I remember Paul Scholes turning round at about 4-0 and saying 'listen, no more goals'. I don't see anyone in this Brazilian team doing that. You need someone to say 'look, we cannot be embarrassed anymore here'."
Juninho: "Scolari must protect the team. Don't think to win the game, just concentrate on not conceding more goals."

Alan Shearer: "It was no surprise that the goal came down Brazil's left-hand side because Marcelo was as poor as David Luiz was. He lets Philipp Lahm in too easily. Luiz is standing still and does not have a clue what is going on around him. Andre Schurrle shows good movement and a very, very good finish."
Alan Hansen: "There are six or seven Brazil defenders in their area but no reaction from any of them."

Rio Ferdinand: "It was another elementary error - a simple run behind from a throw-in and David Luiz does not even track Andre Schurrle as he runs into the box. But it was an unbelievable finish. To score a goal like that at a World Cup is what dreams are made of, and he is living that dream right now."
Danny Mills: "Germany will be a little bit disappointed. But the cheers from the home fans were ironic cheers. It isn't even a consolation goal."
Gary Lineker: "This was not just one of the game's super-powers beating a smaller nation, this was Brazil for crying out loud, a Brazil side hosting the World Cup for the first time in 64 years. Germany's elation is matched by Brazil's desolation. We have seen something truly astonishing."
Alan Hansen: "The tears on the Brazilian players' faces sum it up and it was one of the worst performances I have ever seen."
Alan Shearer: "I would be concerned that some of the Brazil players might never recover from this."
Rio Ferdinand: "Germany have been showing some glimpses of this in previous tournaments. They have got to go on and win this tournament now because this performance counts for nothing otherwise."
Juninho: "I don't think some of the players will be back to wear the Brazilian shirt again. Germany taught us how to play football and we have to learn from that. We need to take a step back and see what is wrong with Brazilian football."
Tim Vickery: "The players who lost in the 1950 World Cup final to Uruguay have never been able to forget that defeat. It is going to be even worse for this team because this is the biggest humiliation in the history of Brazilian football.
"Brazilian football is operating ludicrously short of its potential. It's been resting on its laurels, pointing at its five World Cup wins and saying everything's fine. It isn't fine. Germany have given us a lesson, regrouping after their 5-1 defeat to England in 2001. Brazil need to do the same thing."
