A Lamborghini driver has had his car seized by police - even though they could not catch him speeding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called after reports the Â£180,000 supercar was being driven too fast around Newport.
Traffic officers did not catch the 25-year-old driver speeding in his bright green Lamborghini Huracan - which can go 0-60mph (97km/h) in 2.5 seconds.
But police said he was driving in an "anti-social manner" and confiscated the Italian supercar.
The driver was given a legal warning which meant the car, which has a top speed of 202mph (325km/h), was seized by police on Wednesday night but handed back the following day.
A spokeswoman for Gwent Police said: "The driver was driving in an anti-social manner - speed not recorded but was excessively speeding in a built-up area."
The man was warned his car could be seized again if he is caught for a second time.
