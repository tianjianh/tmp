[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pat Hickey: former OCI president has bail paid by ANOC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) has loaned former Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) president Pat Hickey money to pay his bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Hickey has remained in Brazil after being arrested on suspicion of alleged illegal ticket touting at Rio 2016.
He has denied all allegations made against him.
He was released almost two weeks after his arrest in August but his passport was retained.
In November a judge in Brazil ruled that Mr Hickey was to be given back his passport and permitted to leave the country for medical reasons on payment of a â‚¬410,000 bond.
Last month, the OCI ruled out paying the bond for Mr Hickey.
ANOC said it made the temporary loan to Mr Hickey on humanitarian grounds.
The decision was unanimously approved by ANOC president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, and all ANOC vice presidents, via a postal vote on 20 November.
The body said the payment was "made as a temporary loan so that Patrick Hickey could meet his bail requirements and return to Ireland where he can receive medical treatment for a heart condition.
"The terms of the temporary loan make it clear that it must be repaid  to ANOC in full," it said in a statement.
"For legal reasons, all other terms and conditions surrounding this bail payment will remain confidential."
