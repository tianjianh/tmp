The Cypriot full-back cut in from the left to fire low shots past Ofir Marciano from the edge of the box.
Hibs, with Efe Ambrose making his debut at centre-back, struggled to create chances in the first half and missed opportunities in the second.
Saints have won four straight games in all competitions, while Hibs have not tasted victory in four league matches.
It is Neil Lennon's side's first defeat since 2 December, ending an unbeaten stretch that reached 13 games.
Martin Boyle and substitute Grant Holt had the Leith men's most glaring chances when already 2-0 down, but a combination of bad finishing and good goalkeeping by Billy O'Brien denied them a way back into the contest.
St Mirren's lead was deserved and the opening goal came after Kyle Magennis had already cracked the crossbar with a volley for the hosts.
Demetriou, a 25-year-old signed in January, scored his first Buddies goal when composed play from Stephen McGinn was followed up by a fine defence-splitting pass by Stevie Mallan, which allowed Demetriou to shoot low at Marciano's near post.
Ambrose's debut had been a tentative one as he attempted to get back up to the pace of competitive matches, and less than a minute had elapsed in the second half when Demetriou struck again.
This time Lewis Morgan fed him and his right-footed, low shot went in off the post.
The game had been billed as a battle between two midfield brothers - St Mirren's Stephen McGinn and Hibs' John McGinn - and the Buddies are certainly benefitting from the former's quality and captaincy in the middle of the pitch.
Indeed Saints might have won by more if Cammy Smith had not been spurned by Marciano, and Morgan was more accurate with another shot from 16 yards.
St Mirren manager Jack Ross: "The calibre of the opposition shows how good we had to be tonight. We didn't just win the game, I thought we were excellent, created opportunities both halves, and thoroughly deserved the win.
"I played with Stephen McGinn the first time he was here - that's the only reason we got him back, because of our relationship, he wanted to play for me and this club. I don't think he should be playing in the Championship.
"He's been outstanding, and in terms of him taking on the responsibility of the captain's armband, it's clear to see how much he's thriving on that. He's got a real desire to drag this club forward."
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "St Mirren thoroughly deserved to win - the hungrier team won, so I've no complaints. We've been on a very good run, but we're stepping off the gas a little bit, and you can't do that.
"We give them all the warnings before the game and they still didn't respond. All the 50-50s, second balls went to St Mirren because they wanted it more. It happens, it hasn't happened very often, it's a game gone, and we're giving other teams encouragement. We have to resurrect it very quickly and get back to where we were a week ago.
"That was the poorest we've played this season. We didn't look ready for the fight, and St Mirren were excellent - the best performance any team's played against us this season."
