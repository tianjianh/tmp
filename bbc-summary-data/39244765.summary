They said would they would crack down on anyone intent on disorder, vandalism or drinking too much.
The fourth Celtic-Rangers clash of the season kicks off at midday.
Road works in Glasgow could affect those travelling to the match and fans have been advised to plan ahead.
Ch Supt Brian McInulty said: "Although the majority of supporters attending these matches are well-behaved and enjoy the game, there is often a minority who are intent on drinking too much alcohol and engage in criminal behaviour such as vandalism, disorder or offensive behaviour.
"There are still a number of road works in place on the M8 and M74 which may impact on those travelling to the stadium.
"Plan your outing in advance, know your travel plans, drink responsibly and be aware of any restrictions on what you can bring into the stadium such as pyrotechnic devices.
"Let's keep this match focused on the football so that supporters can enjoy a safe match."
British Transport Police also said it would have a "highly visible" presence to deter crime and antisocial behaviour on trains and at stations.
