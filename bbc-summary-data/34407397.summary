Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will face no disciplinary action after the Football Association cleared him of making discriminatory comments towards former club doctor Eva Carneiro.

The FA studied footage from the 2-2 draw with Swansea on 8 August after a member of the public made a complaint.
Carneiro and head physio Jon Fearn were criticised by Mourinho for treating Eden Hazard with the side a man down.
The 42-year-old had her role downgraded before deciding to leave the club.
She is now considering her legal position.
The FA said it asked an independent academic expert in Portuguese linguistics to analyse the footage of the incident, in which Mourinho is seen making a verbal gesture.
"Both the words used, as translated and analysed by the independent expert, and the video evidence, do not support the conclusion that the words were directed at any person in particular," it added in a statement.
Carneiro and Fearn went on to the pitch to treat midfielder Hazard in the closing stages of the draw with Swansea on the league season's opening weekend.
It meant Hazard had to leave the field before rejoining play, leaving the Blues temporarily reduced to nine men following goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois' earlier red card, and Mourinho said the duo had been "impulsive and naive".
Carneiro lost her place on the bench and was no longer allowed to attend matches or training sessions.
Two days after the incident, she posted a message on Facebook thanking the public for their "overwhelming support".
Mourinho stood by his decision to remove her from her role, adding he had a "good relationship" with his medical staff.
Heather Rabbatts, the FA's only female board member, was vocal in her support of Carneiro, who she said had acted "properly".
"Her departure raises a serious question on how players are safeguarded if their medical support is compromised," she said.
The Women in Football group said Carneiro was highly respected and it was "bitterly disappointed" about her departure.
"We believe it is appalling that her professionalism and understanding of football were subsequently called into question by manager Jose Mourinho and it threatened to undermine her professional reputation," said a spokesperson.
"We also believe that Dr Carneiro's treatment and ultimate departure from Chelsea FC sends out a worrying and alienating message to the already small numbers of female medical staff working in the national game."
Meanwhile, the Football Medical Association said it was "disappointed" after its efforts to negotiate a return to Chelsea for the ex-club doctor failed.
Chelsea have said they do not comment on internal staffing matters.
