[SN]TITLE[SN]
Birmingham City 1-2 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Ince scored an injury-time winner at St Andrew's as Derby County manager Gary Rowett earned victory on his first return to former club Birmingham City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ince raced clear in the 91st minute to lob advancing keeper Tomasz Kuszczak, a result that keeps Derby within seven points of the Championship play-offs.
Derby led after three minutes when Jacob Butterfield's shot bounced in off the luckless Kuszczak's back.
Blues levelled after 69 minutes through Che Adams, but the Rams stole victory.
Birmingham, who remain 18th, six points clear of the relegation zone with five games to play, were just outside the play-off places on goal difference when Rowett was sacked in December.
But City have now won just twice in 22 matches, in all competitions, since Gianfranco Zola was appointed as Rowett's successor.
The return of the popular Rowett, who also represented both sides in his playing career, was always to prove an awkward afternoon for the hosts. And they faced an uphill battle when Butterfield's early left-foot shot hit the post before cruelly rebounding in off City goalkeeper Kuszczak.
After having a goal disallowed for a foul on Derby keeper Scott Carson when Lukas Jutkiewicz forced the ball into the net from a corner, Blues eventually got back on level terms.
From Craig Gardner's right-wing corner, Ryan Shotton got up and Adams arrived at the far post to score his first goal at St Andrew's since November.
But Derby had the last word when, with the Blues defence caught flat-footed, Ince ran through to latch onto Rams keeper Carson's excellent long clearance.
Although Sheffield Wednesday's Saturday evening win against Newcastle stopped the Rams narrowing the points gap to the all-important sixth place, the Rams climbed a place to eighth, stretching their unbeaten run since Rowett took charge of Derby to 10 points from four matches.
Birmingham City manager Gianfranco Zola:
"We are making it so difficult for ourselves. The way we are playing we do not deserve to be where we are. But the way we are conceding goals is a real brain-killer.
"The result was almost impossible to take. It was very painful considering we scored a fair goal and had a penalty which was not given.
"But we came back and looked like winning but to lose a game in this manner was very difficult. We have to understand that in a season of adversity we cannot lose our concentration for a second.
"I warned the players that the only way Derby could cause us a problem was from set-pieces and corners. Everyone was aware of this but in the last minute we went looking for the winner and it was Derby who scored."
Derby County manager Gary Rowett:
"It was a difficult game for everyone, certainly from my point of view. If I am really honest I didn't want this game because there was so much focus on me coming back.
"I have tried to keep my dignity. It was not my decision to leave. But I've shown I can win games. Derby had won one in nine games when I joined. Now we have won three in four.
"We started well but then became a little sloppy. When it was 1-1, I could not have complained but they switched off in the last minute. The only real moment of quality in a poor game was when Scott Carson spotted Tom Ince. It was a wonderful ball, Ince gambled and scored.
"This is where we have the quality. We showed it then but we will have to be better if we are to win more games."
