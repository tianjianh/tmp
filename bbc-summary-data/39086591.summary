[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 3-0 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Godden scored twice as in-form Stevenage boosted their League Two promotion hopes by breezing past Notts County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Godden's double sandwiched Jack King's strike as the hosts earned a seventh win in eight games.
Boro are now sixth in the table, three points behind third-placed Carlisle, but County drop down to third-from-bottom, five points ahead of Leyton Orient.
Stevenage led in just the third minute after a corner was taken shot to Steven Schumacher, whose cross gave Godden the simple task of heading into the top corner.
Veteran goalkeeper Chris Day, in the side due to Jamie Jones' suspension, maintained their lead by first sharply saving Shola Ameobi's header then Jon Stead's rebound.
The hosts doubled their advantage on the hour as Godden flicked on a long ball into the path of captain King, who finished calmly into the bottom corner.
Two minutes later the match was finished as a contest as Ben Kennedy played Godden through and he held his nerve to strike his 20th goal of the season.
