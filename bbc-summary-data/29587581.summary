The knee-length knickers were one of a number of lots to go the hammer at the sale at Westernhanger Auctioneers near Folkestone in Kent.
The auctioneer said the overseas buyer of the "very large" underwear wished to remain anonymous.
A pair of silk stockings, also worn by Britain's longest-serving monarch, sold for £1,100.
Auctioneer Michael Hogben said: "The items are very large.
"She wore them towards the end of her life when she had eaten a lot more than most people could afford to."
He said the bloomers were from about 1890.
He added: "When Queen Victoria died she gifted a lot of her under-linen to her loyal servants.
"These bloomers have been in a Kent family for more than 80 years.
"These are some of the most interesting items I have auctioned in my 40-year career."
