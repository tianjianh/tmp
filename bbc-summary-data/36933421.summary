A pre-season game between Leyton Orient and Gillingham had to be abandoned after a serious injury to Gills midfielder Lee Martin.

The 29-year-old, who joined the League One side from Millwall earlier this summer, suffered a suspected dislocated or broken left ankle.
He was hurt after landing awkwardly 13 minutes before full-time, and the game was called off soon afterwards.
"Our thoughts are with Lee," said Gillingham manager Justin Edinburgh.
"We hope that he makes a quick recovery," Edinburgh added of the former Manchester United youngster, who had come on at half-time in place of Bradley Dack.
First-half goals from Jordan Bowery and Jay Simpson had put League Two side Orient 2-0 up when the game was abandoned.
Martin is the third Gillingham player to be injured during pre-season, with defender Bradley Garmston and midfielder Aaron Morris both out of action with knee injuries.
