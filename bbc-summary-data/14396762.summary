[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rikki Clarke equals outfield catch world record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire's Rikki Clarke equalled the first-class record of seven catches for an outfielder in an innings but Lancashire took control on day three.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts reached 374-9 with Paul Horton, Stephen Moore, Mark Chilton, Steven Croft, Karl Brown, Tom Smith and Sajid Mahmood all snared by Clarke.
Croft reached 122 as Lancashire built up a lead of 283.
Clarke, who shares the achievement with Micky Stewart and Tony Brown, is one off the match record of 10.
Stewart took seven catches for Surrey against Northamptonshire in 1957 while Gloucestershire's Brown also got into the record books against Nottinghamshire nine years later.
The match record of 10 was set by Wally Hammond in 1928.
Resuming on 32-0 Lancashire, who were 84-3 in mid-morning, will go into day four holding the edge over Warwickshire after being helped by a fourth-wicket stand of 208 by Croft and Brown (91).
BBC Radio Lancashire's Liam Bradford:
"Lancashire have grasped control of this County Championship game thanks to two wonderful innings from Steven Croft and Karl Brown.
"Croft put on 122 and Brown 91, as well as a partnership of 208 runs to take Lancashire from a disadvantaged position to being in control of this game.
"A first innings deficit of 91 has been wiped out and Lancashire go into day four leading by 283. Whether that's going to be enough to see them win this game remains to be seen.
"We'll just all have our fingers crossed for some good weather and the Lancashire fans can cross theirs for plenty of wickets."
BBC Coventry & Warwickshire's Clive Eakin:
"What a terrific day's cricket in front of a decent crowd at Aigburth. Lancashire are favourites to win with a lead of 283 but Warwickshire aren't out of it and showed some competitive spirit in getting back into the game.
"And it's not every day that you see a first-class world record equalled. Of Rikki Clarke's seven slip catches, the second to dismiss Stephen Moore stands out. It was an absolute blinder.
"Warwickshire need to make sure the final Lancashire pair don't add to the lead in the morning. The Bears will be encouraged to have seen the pitch flatten in the sun but they could struggle if Gary Keedy gets turn on the final day."
