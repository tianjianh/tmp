Ghana edged out South Africa 1-0 to win the third-place play-off at the women's Africa Cup of Nations.

Linda Eshun scored the winner on 49 minutes when she headed the ball home from close range following a corner.
In the first half South Africa had the best chances but Refiloe Jane headed over and another header was well saved by Ghana keeper Patricia Mantey.
Banyana Banayana also failed to equalise when Andisiwe Mcgoyi put a simple chance over the bar.
Unlike in 2014, this match did not offer the prize of a Women's World Cup place.
And in the end South Africa had to settle for fourth place - just as they did two years ago - while Ghana claimed a first bronze medal since 2004.
