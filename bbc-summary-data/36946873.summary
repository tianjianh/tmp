Signing Swansea's Ashley Williams for £10m would be "great business" for Everton, according to Pat Nevin.

The Wales and Swans captain is reported to be close to agreeing a move to Goodison Park after eight years at the Liberty Stadium.
A spokesman for the Welsh club declined to "comment on speculation" about the 31-year-old central defender.
Former Toffees winger Nevin told BBC Wales: "I don't think many Evertonians would say no to Ashley Williams."
He added: "What's not to like? He understands the game, he has real bravery and is a real leader as well.
"Everyone is looking for a dependable centre half and he's one. I've heard £10m - that would be great business for Everton."
Williams is halfway through a four-year contract at Swansea.
The Wolverhampton-born defender has played more than 300 games for the Swans since joining for £300,000 from Stockport in March 2008.
He has not taken part in any pre-season matches after being given an extended break after captaining Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
Comments by manager Francesco Guidolin did little to quell rumours following Swansea's 4-0 win over Wolves on Saturday, 30 July.
"Ashley is very important to us but I don't know what the situation is," he said.
Former Wales team-mate Danny Gabbidon, speaking on Radio Wales, said: "It doesn't look good for Swansea fans, I think he's probably going to be going."
Williams was linked with a move to Goodison during the summer of 2015 - a time when Everton's England international John Stones was being linked heavily with Chelsea and Manchester City.
With fresh rumours regarding Stones' future, new Everton manager Ronald Koeman could need a new central defender.
The reported interest in Williams comes at the same time as rumours West Ham are poised to make a £20m bid for Swansea's Ghana international striker Andre Ayew.
Ayew was Swansea's top scorer last season with 12 goals in 35 Premier League appearances.
The Liberty Stadium club have already seen three forwards depart this summer with Portuguese striker Eder joining Lille, Italian Alberto Paloschi going to Atalanta and Frenchman Bafetimbi Gomis signing for Marseille on loan.
Swansea have not yet brought in a new striker during the summer transfer window.
Former Wales striker and BBC Wales pundit Iwan Roberts says he is worried about the transfer policy.
"If these rumours are true I would think Ashley's head would be turned at 31 to go and play for a big club - but for £10m he's irreplaceable," he said.
"You could see Ashley leaving and there's a big question mark over Ayew. I can't see Swansea turning £20m down when they got him on a free transfer.
"There's only two weeks to go - there's a lot of work to be done at Swansea City and I am worried for them."
