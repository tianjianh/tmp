The world number five led 4-1, but breaks of 92, 74, and 56 got Scotland's Maguire level at 4-4.
Trump edged back ahead in the ninth and a Maguire error in the 10th let the Englishman in to seal a second-round tie with Neil Robertson or Marco Fu.
Barry Hawkins beat Joe Perry 6-3 to book a meeting with Mark Allen.

With the first six frames shared, Hawkins rolled in an 81 to edge back into a lead he would not relinquish to claim his first ever win at the tournament.
The world number eight will meet Trump in the last four if both win their respective quarter-finals.
For Trump, an appearance in the last eight is his first at this tournament for three years.
"I just tried to stay calm," Trump, who won two frames on the final black, told BBC Two. "I was very nervous at 4-4 because I've not had a good last few tournaments and my confidence was very low.
"For me, it's an amazing win. My game is attacking, but everything in my head was negative. My lack of form has put pressure on because I was used to going out there and expecting to play well.
"I've played every day over Christmas - that's the first time I've ever done that - and I think that's what got me through in the end.
"I've always enjoyed myself off the table, but now I'm at an age when I don't enjoy going out as much. Now I can give snooker four or five years of complete dedication and see what happens."
