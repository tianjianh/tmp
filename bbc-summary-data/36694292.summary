The 30-year-old was a free agent after leaving Championship side Leigh Centurions in May.
Chase left the Tigers in 2014 for Salford, when his impressive form earned him England recognition.
"I've been thinking about my Cas days, as those were the times when I was really happy," he said.
"When the opportunity came up to come back to this great club I took it with both hands, I wasn't going to let this opportunity slip away from me.
"It's like coming back home for me, I love the people here. This move is purely about the badge and the way it made me feel when I played for it."
New Zealand-born Chase won the 2011 Man of Steel while at Castleford, also earning his 11 England caps during a four-year stay.
He scored 15 tries in 42 games for Salford but had has his contract terminated following a "disciplinary procedure."
"I am really pleased to be able to add to our squad at such a crucial stage in the season," added head coach Daryl Powell. "Rangi is a high quality player who knows so much about Castleford Tigers and what it means to play for this club."
