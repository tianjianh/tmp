American Daniel Berger leads at 15 under par after carding an eight-under 62 on Saturday, two strokes off the course record in Cromwell, Connecticut.
Knox, who shot 64, is in a three-way tie for second, and chasing a second PGA Tour win after victory at the World Championships in Shanghai in November.
"I always tell myself, don't be scared to play well," said the 31-year-old.
South Africa's Tyrone van Aswegen and American Russell Henley are also at 12 under.
England's Paul Casey, who lost in the play-off in Connecticut last year, carded a four-under-par 67 to move to nine under for the tournament.
