Mr Roberts, the husband of Cynon Valley MP Ann Clwyd, had been treated for multiple sclerosis.
Ms Clwyd had recently highlighted his case - and those of her constituents - when raising questions about the standard of care services in Wales.
It is understood Mr Roberts, who was also an ITV executive, died on Tuesday morning.
Rhodri Talfan Davies, director of BBC Cymru Wales said: "We are saddened to hear about the death of Owen Roberts, who led radio and TV news teams here at BBC Cymru Wales as head of news and current affairs in the 1970s.
"He was also a distinguished producer with a particular commitment to Wales and its people.
"Our condolences are with his wife and family at this sad time."
