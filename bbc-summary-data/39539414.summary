Hamilton 1-1 Ross County: Accies to contest Giannis Skondras red card

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Martin Canning says Hamilton Accies will appeal against the red card issued to Giannis Skondras in the 1-1 draw with Ross County.

The Greek left-back was dismissed before half-time for a foul on Ryan Dow just inside his own half.
"I've just seen it back and it isn't a red card," Canning told BBC Scotland.
"Giannis has gone for the ball along the ground and I think it looks worse than it is because of the speed they are both going at."
Canning felt there was "absolutely no intent" from his player to hurt Dow.
"It's just unfortunate for Skondras that Ryan is quick and he's just got a wee toe on it before Giannis can get there.
"Referees have got a hard job with things happening at that speed, but we seem to be on the wrong end of a few decisions.
"I spoke to the referee and he was quite convinced it was [a sending off]. I hate being critical of them because it is a difficult job, but what I can't keep on doing is standing here after we've had decisions go against us that costs us, and keep on defending them [referees], because we need to start getting them right for us.
"Ultimately, there's a lot at stake here. It's potentially cost us two points and it could have cost us more."
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre had sympathy with his Hamilton counterpart over the decision.
"It's not a sending off and they've been very unfortunate with that," he told BBC Scotland.
"I think in terms of our overall play, I'm disappointed we've not picked up three points but Accies deserve a lot of credit as well.
"We've been down to 10 men three or four times this season and we've won two of those games. It's really difficult against 10 men because they sit in. Sometimes you can get lured into committing too many players and then get hit on the counter-attack."
