Champions League: Premier League sides await last-16 draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City are in Monday's draw for the Champions League last 16.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Britain's three remaining sides in the competition have reached this stage for the second successive season, with champions Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona also still in.
The draw takes place at 11:00 GMT in Nyon, Switzerland.
Liverpool, who failed to qualify, join Celtic, Everton and Tottenham in the following Europa League last-32 draw.
Chelsea will be in pot one after winning their group, while Manchester City and Arsenal join the group runners-up in pot two.
No teams that progressed from the same group or are from the same country can be drawn against each other, so among the sides Jose Mourinho's side could meet are Serie A champions Juventus and French champions Paris St-Germain.
Manchester City, who won 2-0 at Roma on Wednesday to qualify, and Arsenal's list of potential opponents include La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, and Barcelona.
The Gunners could also be drawn against Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich, who topped Manchester City's group.
Liverpool, Tottenham and Celtic could face difficult ties in the last 32 of the Europa League after not being seeded for the draw.
Tottenham and Celtic were second in their Europa League groups while Liverpool dropped down from the Champions League after finishing third in their group.
That leaves Everton as the only seeded British team in the draw for the last 32, joining the likes of Inter Milan, Napoli and Zenit St Petersburg.
The Toffees could potentially be drawn against Celtic in an England v Scotland tie.
The draws will be covered live by the BBC Sport website.
