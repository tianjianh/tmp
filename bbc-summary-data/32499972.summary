The crime drama's creator Chris Chibnall is from the area and said the story "was written as a love letter to the scenery of the Jurassic Coast".
Walkers can visit locations filmed around West Bay and walk in the footsteps of the lead characters played by David Tennant and Olivia Colman.
The trail is available from all West Dorset Tourist information centres.
Visitors can start off by walking up West Cliff, then head down to the Jurassic Pier and harbour before visiting a range of buildings used as the Broadchurch police station, cafe and newsagents.
Also on the trail is a visit to the riverside home of Tennant's character DI Alec Hardy, a cliff hut used in a murder scene and the beach huts used throughout Series Two of the ITV drama.
It ends with a visit to East Pier and Harbour Cliff Beach, the opening scene of a murder in the first episode.
Mr Chibnall said: "The landscape informs the drama: the cliffs, the sea, the beach were all key elements of the story."
Rachel Symes, a West Dorset district council tourism marketing officer, said: "The series has generated a large amount of interest in the area and this trail provides visitors with all they need to discover the stunning backdrop to the drama."
