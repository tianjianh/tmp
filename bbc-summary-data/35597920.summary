[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A steam train operator has been banned from running its rail services on the UK's mainline railway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said it had safety concerns over the West Coast Railway Company (WCRC).
It follows an incident last March in which a locomotive stopped across a busy main line railway junction near Royal Wootton Bassett.
WCRC managing director Patricia Marshall said she was "disappointed" with the ban.
She added: "West Coast Railways will continue to work closely with the ORR to demonstrate that it can continue operations on the National Network in a safe and proper manner."
WCRC and a driver are facing criminal proceedings after allegedly breaching health and safety laws.
Last March safety equipment was allegedly bypassed on the Tangmere locomotive, which caused it to pass a signal at danger.
A high-speed train had passed over the junction less than a minute before.
The ORR said a number of incidents leading to safety concerns had occurred since the incident, despite the company being warned to improve safety.
It has issued a prohibition notice, which prevents WCRC - based in Carnforth, Lancashire - from operating trains.
Ian Prosser, HM Chief Inspector of Railways at ORR, said the decision to revoke the company's safety certificate had "not been taken lightly".
"However, my concerns about West Coast Railway Company's lack of appreciation of the seriousness of a collective range of incidents over the last year, coupled with ORR's concerns on the company's governance, regrettably make this prohibition necessary.
"These failings create a significant risk to operations on the mainline network.
"We want to encourage successful business operations on our railways and hope WCRC will be able to put in place steps to ensure fit and proper safety management with a view to resuming operations.
"Our inspectors stand ready to work with the company to support and advise as it strengthens its approach to safety."
