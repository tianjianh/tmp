Newport moved of the League Two drop zone for the first time since November 2016 after a sixth win in 10 games.
County are two points clear of Hartlepool United with two games remaining.
"We're under no illusions, our feet are firmly on the ground," midfielder Labadie told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"We know there's a lot of work left to do. We've got to go into the next two games as we have the last six or seven.
"We're really confident and enjoying our football at the moment. It's a happy environment."
Newport were 11 points adrift of safety when Mike Flynn replaced Graham Westley as manager in March.
Four wins out of their last five games, including Saturday's 1-0 win over Accrington Stanley, have seen Flynn's side move above Hartlepool United.
The Exiles could secure Football League football for another season if they win at Carlisle United on Saturday, 29 April.
