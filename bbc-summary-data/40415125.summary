Tour de France 2017: Stage-by-stage guide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome is looking to win a fourth Tour de France title and third in a row.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The three-week 3,540km (2,200-mile) race started in Germany with a 14km individual time trial. It ventures through Belgium and Luxembourg before heading into France.
The route takes the 198 riders down the eastern side of France to the Jura mountains in the opening week before a rest-day transfer across to the Dordogne in the west.
Two days in the Pyrenees mountains will dominate the second week, while the third week is all about the Alps and what race organisers will hope is a decisive 22.5km individual time trial on the penultimate stage.
Former British cyclist Rob Hayles, who will be BBC Radio 5 live's expert summariser, offers his guide to each of the 21 stages...
Winner: Geraint Thomas (GB/Team Sky)
Report: Thomas wins to claim first yellow jersey
Thomas produced a stunning time trial to win the opening stage. The Team Sky rider was not considered among the pre-stage favourites but covered the course in 16 minutes four seconds to claim his first Grand Tour stage and pull on the yellow jersey for the first time. Thomas' team-mate and defending champion Chris Froome finished sixth and gained an early advantage on his general classification rivals. Overall contender Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) was forced to abandon after crashing heavily into a barrier in wet conditions.
Winner: Marcel Kittel (Ger/Quick-Step Floors)
Report: Kittel wins sprint finish, Froome crashes
Kittel powered home in a star-studded sprint finish to take the stage in Liege. Geraint Thomas held on to yellow by coming home safely in the peloton but there was a scare for Team Sky team-mate Chris Froome, who crashed in the wet 30km from the finish. He resumed and finished the stage in 37th.
Winner: Peter Sagan (Svk/Bora-Hansgrohe)
Report: Sagan wins sprint, Thomas stays in yellow
World champion Sagan showed remarkable composure to win stage three, triumphing in an uphill sprint after his foot had briefly come loose. Britain's Geraint Thomas continues to lead the race after finishing two seconds adrift, alongside defending champion Chris Froome and the other race favourites.
Winner: Arnaud Demare (Fra/FDJ)
Report: Cavendish crashes heavily as Demare wins
Britain's Mark Cavendish accused world champion Peter Sagan of elbowing him as he crashed heavily in a sprint finish on stage four of the Tour de France. The two collided on the sprint finish into Vittel as they competed for the stage win. Arnaud Demare went on to win the stage, becoming the first Frenchman to win a bunch sprint at the Tour since 2006.
Winner: Fabio Aru (Ita/Astana)
Report: Froome takes race lead from Thomas
Italian Fabio Aru made the decisive break a couple of kilometres from the summit La Planche des Belles Filles to move up to third overall. But Chris Froome put more time into his other rivals by finishing third to swap places with Team Sky team-mate Geraint Thomas at the top of the standings.
Winner: Marcel Kittel (Ger/Quick-Step Floors)
Report: Kittel dominates sprint as Froome retains yellow
On a blisteringly hot day, with temperatures on the road reaching 37C, Marcel Kittel sprinted to his second stage win of this year's Tour as the general classification contenders took it easy in the peloton. Kittel edged out Arnaud Demare to win an 11th Tour stage.
Winner: Marcel Kittel (Ger/Quick-Step Floors)
Report: Kittel denies Boason Hagen by 6mm
Marcel Kittel equalled Erik Zabel's German record of most Tour stage wins with his third on this year's race and 12th in total. It took several minutes for the Quick-Step Floors rider to get the nod but he was judged to have beaten Edvald Boasson Hagen by just 6mm. It was a quiet day for the general classification riders with no changes in the standings.
Winner: Lilian Calmejane (Fra/Direct Energie)
Report: Calmejane solos to victory as Froome retains yellow
Lilian Calmejane delighted the home fans with a second French victory on this year's Tour after attacking on the final ascent and soloing to victory across the 12km plateau to the finish. His win followed a brutal opening two hours of racing with repeated attacks as riders tried to get in the break. Chris Froome said it was "an intense" day as he retained his race lead.
Winner: Rigoberto Uran (Col/Cannondale-Drapac)
Report: Uran wins brutal stage as Porte & Thomas crash out
Rigoberto Uran outsprinted a select group of general classification riders, including Chris Froome and Romain Bardet, to win a tortuous day in the Alps that featured seven climbs. The Colombian pipped Warren Barguil on the line, with Froome finishing third to pick up four bonus seconds and extend his overall lead. However, the Team Sky leader lost super-domestique Geraint Thomas, who broke his collarbone in a crash. Australia's Richie Porte, one of the pre-race favourites, also crashed out in a 72km/h accident on the descent of Mont du Chat.
Winner: Marcel Kittel (Ger/Quick-Step Floors)
Report: Kittel sprints to fourth stage win
The race resumed after the first rest day and once the lengthy breakaway by Elie Gesbert and Yoann Offredo was reeled in on the outskirts of Bergerac, the stage was always going to end in a sprint finish. German Marcel Kittel powered past his rivals to claim his fourth stage win of this year's race, his 13th in total. It took him one beyond Erik Zabel as the German with the most Tour de France wins.
Winner: Marcel Kittel (Ger/Quick-Step Floors)
Report: Kittel claims fifth stage win of 2017
A three-man breakaway of Frederik Backaert, Maciej Bodnar and Marco Marcato attacked early on, with the peloton content to let them go before reeling them in later. However, just as the bunch were about to catch the leading group, Bodnar attacked and stayed out in front until the final 250 metres when he was finally swept up. At that point, German Marcel Kittel underlined his dominance in sprint finishes by easily claiming his fifth stage win of this year's race.
Winner: Romain Bardet (Fra/AG2R La Mondiale)
Report: Froome loses yellow to Aru as Bardet wins
On a thrilling first day in the Pyrenees, a group of 12 riders broke away before Britain's Steve Cummings left the rest behind with around 30km to go. Team Sky controlled the tempo on the front of the peloton, catching Cummings in the final 10km and looking to set up leader Chris Froome. However, a brutal summit finish in Peyragudes saw Froome crack inside the final 500m, with Romain Bardet winning the stage and Fabio Aru gaining enough time to take the yellow jersey.
Winner: Warren Barguil (Fra/Team Sunweb)
Report: France's Barguil wins on Bastille Day as Froome stays second
The shortest road stage of this year's Tour saw plenty of attacking early on before Alberto Contador and Mikel Landa broke clear with 60km remaining. The Spanish pair were joined by Nairo Quintana and Warren Barguil on the final climb before a rapid descent into Foix. Barguil proved strongest in the sprint finish, becoming the first Frenchman to win on Bastille Day since 2005. Behind, Chris Froome marked all the attacks by the other overall contenders but did not gain any time on Fabio Aru, who retained the leader's yellow jersey.
Winner: Michael Matthews (Aus/Sunweb)
Report: Matthews wins stage as Froome reclaims yellow
A stage that in one sense ended as many predicted - with a sprint finish contested between eventual winner Michael Matthews and Belgium's Greg van Avermaet. But in another, it had a very unexpected conclusion, with Chris Froome taking the yellow jersey off Italian Fabio Aru after a dramatic charge up the short but punchy finish in Rodez. Froome, who lost yellow at the end of stage 12, turned a six-second deficit into an 18-second lead.
Winner: Bauke Mollema (Ned/Trek-Segafredo)
Report: Froome recovers to retain yellow jersey as Mollema wins
A hilly stage saw a large breakaway group go up the road, from which Dutch rider Bauke Mollema attacked with over 30km to go, staying clear to claim his first Tour stage win. Behind, Romain Bardet and his AG2R La Mondiale team-mates put Chris Froome under pressure on the lower slopes of the Col de Peyra Taillade, distancing the race leader. Around this point the Team Sky rider also had a mechanical problem that forced him to swap his rear wheel with team-mate Michal Kwiatkowski, falling almost a minute behind his rivals. However, with the help of his team, Froome chased back and caught the group of favourites before the summit to ensure he retained the yellow jersey at the end of the stage.
Winner: Michael Matthews (Aus/Sunweb)
Report: Matthews takes second win as Froome retains lead
Michael Matthews and his Sunweb team-mates drove the pace on the first climb and quickly dropped struggling green jersey leader Marcel Kittel, who never caught back on. Australian Matthews took 20 points at the intermediate sprint and 30 points at the finish as he claimed his second win of the Tour and closed the gap to Kittel in the points classification to 29 points. Crosswinds in the final 20km fractured the leading group, with Ireland's Dan Martin caught behind and losing time, but Chris Froome safely held on to the yellow jersey.
Winner: Primoz Roglic (Slo/LottoNL-Jumbo)
Report: Froome extends lead as Roglic wins stage
It was a fascinating stage that took us up to the highest point in the Tour this year - the Galibier at 2,642m. By that stage green jersey wearer Marcel Kittel had abandoned after crashing 20km into the 183km from La Mure to Serre-Chevalier. Slovenian Primoz Roglic won his maiden Tour de France stage after powering away towards the top of the Galibier and holding his nerve - and the advantage he had built - during a thrilling descent to the line. It was happy days for Chris Froome too, who finished third and added nine seconds to his lead.
Rob's guide: A first finish at the summit of the Col d'Izoard promises to be sensational. There could well be two races going on. The one for the yellow jersey and, with double points on offer, the one for the King of the Mountains. This will be the 35th ascent of the legendary Alp and it could be crucial to determining the winner.
One to watch: Pierre Rolland. The Frenchman won the white jersey as best young rider in 2011 but hopes he would be the first home rider to win the race since Bernard Hinault in 1985 have long faded. He loves the high mountains though and at 30 years old knows opportunities to add to his two Tour stage wins are fast running out.
Rob's guide: The race tumbles out of the Alps and heads southwards towards the Mediterranean on the longest stage of the race. Will the sprinters be bold enough to ask their teams to ride for them in the hope of setting up a sprint finish? Or will everyone be too tired to care and allow a breakaway to succeed? Or will a puncheur use the Col du Pointu to ride clear? I reckon it could be the latter.
One to watch: Steven Cummings. The Briton has won stages in each of the last two Tours, could he make it a hat-trick?
Rob's guide: Race organisers will be hoping that Chris Froome needs to make up time on some on his rivals because if he arrives in Marseille with any kind of advantage, it is race over. A bit of a hill two-thirds of the way into the test is not stiff enough to create any significant gaps. If nothing else, it should provide good images for the television.
One to watch: Chris Froome. Will this be a lap of honour around Marseille for the Team Sky leader? If it is, don't back against him extending his advantage and chalking up another stage win.
Rob's guide: And so to the now traditional early evening dash round Paris. The jerseys will have been decided and champagne will have been sipped on the road in from Montgeron - where the Tour de France started in 1903. Tommy Voeckler may well be allowed a lap out front on his own in recognition of his efforts before the serious racing begins for a coveted stage win on the Champs Elysees.
One to watch: Andre Greipel. The German is chasing a third successive victory on the cobbles. He has won a stage on every Grand Tour he has ever raced in. Will he still be searching come Paris?
Yellow - the coveted maillot jaune is worn by the rider who has taken the least cumulative time to complete the race after each stage and thus the overall Tour winner. The winner receives 500,000 euros (£440,000).
Green - worn by the leader of the points classification. The maillot vert rewards consistently high finishes with points being awarded for intermediate sprint and end-of-stage placings. The winner receives 25,000 euros (£22,000).
Polka dot - the maillot a pois is worn by the 'King of the Mountains'. Points are awarded on categorised climbs with the harder ascents offering more points. The winner receives 25,000 euros (£22,000).
White - the maillot blanc has been awarded every year since 1975 and is open to riders aged 25 and under. If a rider is leading any other classification, that jersey takes precedence. The winner receives 20,000 euros (£17,600).
Each stage winner receives 11,000 euros (£9,680).
There is a 'most combative rider' prize, selected each day by a jury of four cycling experts. The rider is denoted by a red number on the following stage and the race's most combative rider - super-combatif - is decided after the final stage and awarded 20,000 euros.
There is also a 50,000 euro (£44,000) prize for the best team performance, which is calculated by adding up the times of the first three riders on each team.
