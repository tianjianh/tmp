[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sir Moir Lockhead named new National Trust for Scotland chairman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) has announced that Sir Moir Lockhead is to succeed Sir Kenneth Calman as chairman when he retires next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Moir is a former chief executive of the transport operator FirstGroup.
He led a management and employee buyout of the company, formerly Grampian Regional Transport, in 1985 before steering it to become a Â£6bn business employing almost 130,000 people.
Sir Moir said: "I am relishing the chance to join this wonderful charity."
NTS is the country's largest conservation charity and cares for 129 properties.
Sir Moir said: "Heritage means a great deal to me - I am fascinated by the stories of people and places and how we were all shaped by our environment and our past.
"Ken Calman will be a hard act to follow. He has guided the trust away from its most difficult of times and established the foundations for an assured and vibrant future.
"I look forward to building on his achievements, and those of many dedicated volunteers and staff, and helping the trust to reach a new level where it will earn its rightful place in the hearts of all Scots and all who care about Scotland."
Sir Moir, whose family has a cattle farming estate in Aberdeenshire, was awarded an OBE in 1996 for services to the bus industry and knighted in 2008.
He was awarded the VisitScotland Silver Thistle Award in 2010 for outstanding services to the tourism industry in Scotland.
The trust said Sir Moir would lead the charity as it sets out "a new vision and strategy" for its long-term future.
Lesley Knox, chairwoman of the trust's nominations committee added: "Sir Moir's record of leadership, his ability to motivate staff and volunteers and his wide experience of business, academia and not-for-profit organisations will be of enormous benefit to the National Trust for Scotland.
"He has a reputation for making things happen and will be the ideal appointment to the role of chairman as the National Trust for Scotland gears up to take on the challenges of conserving and promoting the best of Scotland's past for the needs of the future."
