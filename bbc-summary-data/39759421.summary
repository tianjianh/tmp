Tottenham v Arsenal: Arsene Wenger wants fight in derby match

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsene Wenger says his Arsenal players have been "shocked" by some of their results this season, but insists his squad are capable to fight in Sunday's north London derby against Tottenham.

Arsenal are sixth in the Premier League and five points behind Manchester City in fourth, with six games to play.
The Gunners boss described February's 5-1 loss to Bayern Munich and the 3-1 defeat by Chelsea as "big knocks".
"We were a bit like a boxer who got put on the floor twice," he said.
"We lost and people interpreted that as them not caring," added the 67-year-old Frenchman.
"No. Maybe it's because they care very much that we were like that - shocked. We were shocked.
"I think the players care. The players have a good mentality. I love the attitude of this team. There's a good atmosphere compared to one or two months ago."
Of Wenger's 49 north London derbies, his Arsenal side have won 22, drawn 20 and lost seven, but Tottenham are unbeaten in each of their past five league games against Arsenal.
Mauricio Pochettino is the first Tottenham manager to remain unbeaten in his first five top-flight north London Premier League derbies.
