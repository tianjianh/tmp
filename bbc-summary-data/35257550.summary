The story of George McBride and Winifred Carney is being retold as historians prepare to mark the centenaries of the 1916 Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme later this year.
George, a Protestant from the Shankill Road in Belfast, was a member of the unionist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), who joined the Army and survived the Battle of the Somme in 1916.
Winifred, a Catholic from a County Down, helped to the set up an organisation called Cumann na mBan (League of Women), which was known as the women's IRA.
During the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, she was a secretary to one of the rebel leaders, James Connolly, and played an essential role in communicating orders.
The pair later met through their shared interest in socialism, as BBC Newsline's Donna Traynor reports.
