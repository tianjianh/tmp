The Australian prime minister said the US relationship would remain "strong and intimate" because it was based on "enduring national interests".
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said "the American people have spoken", but did not renounce his previous criticisms of the US president-elect.
Far-right Senator Pauline Hanson toasted Mr Trump's win with champagne.
Speaking soon after the result, Mr Turnbull acknowledged on Wednesday that many Australians had been confronted by the intensity of the US campaign.
"Politicians and governments, congressmen, senators, prime ministers and cabinets, will come and go, according to the will of the people of Australia and the United States," he said.
"But the bond between our two nations, our shared common interests, our shared national interests, are so strong, are so committed that we'll continue to work with our friends in the United States through the Trump administration."
The Australian prime minister congratulated Mr Trump in a phone call on Thursday.
Mr Shorten, who described Mr Trump as "barking mad" in May, said he respected the decision of American voters.
"Australians should also know our alliance with the United States has grown and thrived for seven decades â€” no matter who's in charge," Mr Shorten said in a statement on Facebook.
However, he said he would continue to call out discrimination against women and minority groups.
Meanwhile, Mr Trump's election victory was openly celebrated by Australia's far-right politicians.
One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, a prominent voice for anti-immigration, said she was "thrilled" with the result.
"He wants America for Americans, the same as I want Australia for Australians," she said.

Senator Cory Bernardi, from the right wing of the ruling Liberal Party, said Mr Trump's rise served as warning to the political elite.
"The movement against the establishment political parties, who have consistently and wilfully ignored the mainstream majority in favour of their own power and self-interest, is moving across the globe," he said.
The result prompted speculation it could unravel a controversial trade pact that would open up new markets for Australian beef, wheat and dairy.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership was a major part of Mr Obama's "pivot to Asia" - cementing US influence across the region.
However, Mr Trump made opposing the agreement a key feature of his campaign, and it remains unclear whether the deal will be ratified.
