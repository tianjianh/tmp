Kyrgios, 20, hit 17 aces in a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) victory as he finished the week without dropping a set or losing a single service game.
The world number 41 beat top-10 players Richard Gasquet and Tomas Berdych in the quarter and semi-finals.
"I think I served really, really well again," said Kyrgios.
He has already made it to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon and the Australian Open, but the closest he had got to landing a title was reaching the Estoril Open final in 2015.
"I played my first final last year and was looking for my first title," said Kyrgios, who returned in Marseille after an elbow injury.
"I didn't really expect to win this title this week after having a couple of weeks off, but from the first round I started playing really well and just gained confidence as I kept winning matches."
Britain's Colin Fleming and Israel's Jonathan Erlich lost 6-2 6-3 to Mate Pavic of Croatia and New Zealander Michael Venus in the doubles final.
