Prince has left the internet and nobody knows why

Prince's official Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts have been deleted.

Music videos from his YouTube account have also disappeared but no-one from his media team will say why.
So what's the deal with the music legend's apparent digital blackout?
It's got social networks chattering with some comparing him to a moody teenage and labelling him "the artist formerly known as relevant".
Others said the star, who played secret gigs in London earlier this year, is just repeating old tricks.
So we've taken a look at Prince's previous fights with the internet.
In 2007, Stephanie Lenz posts a YouTube clip of her children dancing around her kitchen.
Unfortunately for her, the music playing in the background is Prince's Let's Go Crazy.
Prince's then record label, Universal, orders her to take it down, arguing it is copyright infringement.
She removes it temporarily but then puts it back up, arguing that it is fair use. The case is still ongoing, seven years later...
At the 2008 Coachella Music Festival, Prince performs a cover of Radiohead's Creep.
Everybody loves it, including Radiohead.
But then Prince forces YouTube to remove video captured by fans during the performance.
Radiohead's frontman Thom Yorke says: "Really? He's blocked it? Surely we should block it. Well, tell him to unblock it. It's our ... song."
Days later, YouTube reinstates the videos.
In a 2010 interview, Prince announces: "The internet's completely overâ€¦ The internet's like MTV. At one time MTV was hip and suddenly it became outdated. Anyway, all these computers and digital gadgets are no good. They just fill your head with numbers."
In January 2014, Prince starts a $22m lawsuit against fans who posted links to copyrighted material of his concerts on Facebook.
He later drops the case, after the fans remove the links, and tells the BBC "nobody sues their fans".
Having finally joined Twitter and Instagram in the last two years, Prince caps his social media presence by joining Facebook in October.
He holds a highly anticipated Q&A but of the 4,000 questions he gets from fans, he answers just one - on the topic of sound frequencies. Random, oh yes.
Prince has even been awarded the dubious title of "Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award" by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US internet civil liberties group, for the number of "take down notices" he has issued to various websites over alleged copyright infringement.
