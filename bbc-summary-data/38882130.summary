Det Supt Tom Chisholm said the area had been searched at the time of the crash but the driver was not found.
"Following enquiries, we discovered that Mr Mirza's family have had no contact with him since then, so specialist officers have been in the area over the past two days carrying out searches," he said.
"Yesterday evening (Sunday) the search team discovered the body of a man in an inaccessible area of waste ground. The body has not been formally identified but family liaison officers have notified Mr Mirza's family and are supporting them."
