Chris Paisley is one shot back alongside France's Alexander Levy, with Richard Bland on 14 under.
Chris Hanson dropped off the pace at 11 under par, while Ryder Cup rookie Matt Fitzpatrick reached 13 under.
Lengthy weather delays on the opening two days meant the field completed their third round on Sunday.
Masters champion Willett, who was playing with fellow Englishmen Paisley and Hanson, has had just one bogey in his 54 holes so far.
Seven of the European Ryder Cup team, which includes Willett, have been competing in Monza as they prepare to take on the United States at Hazeltine in Minnesota from 30 September to 2 October.
The other Europe players still in contention are Martin Kaymer of Germany, Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello and Englishmen Andy Sullivan and Chris Wood.
England's Lee Westwood missed the cut.
