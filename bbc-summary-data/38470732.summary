A host of Paralympians also receive honours, including 11-times gold medallist dressage rider Lee Pearson who receives a knighthood.

Murray said he could not get used to the knighthood, adding: "I feel more still like Andy Murray, [that] feels obviously more normal to me but it's obviously a big honour and happy with that, a nice way to finish or start the New Year."

Women make up just over half of those being honoured.
Television presenter and campaigner Lynn Faulds Wood has turned down an MBE, saying the honours system is "not fair". Hillsborough campaigner Prof Phil Scraton refused his OBE as a protest.
Rio 2016 was Britain's most successful Olympics ever, and many of Team GB's stars are recognised with an honour.
Farah, 33, said: "I'm so happy to be awarded this incredible honour from the country that has been my home since I moved here at the age of eight."
Rower Katherine Grainger - the first female Olympian to win five medals at five Games - said becoming a dame would be "something to live up to", while Laura Kenny - the country's most successful female Olympian - and husband Jason are both appointed CBE for services to cycling.
A second married couple who won gold in Rio - hockey captain Kate Richardson-Walsh and her wife and teammate Helen - are appointed OBE and MBE respectively.

Equestrian gold medallists Nick Skelton and Charlotte Dujardin, swimmer Sascha Kindred and para-equestrian Sophie Christiansen are made CBE, while boxer Nicola Adams, cyclist Katie Archibald and cyclist Jody Cundy are appointed OBE.
The long list of athletes appointed MBE includes the entire gold medal-winning GB women's hockey team, swimmer Adam Peaty, wheelchair tennis champion Gordon Reid, sailor Saskia Clark and para-athlete Kadeena Cox.
Cox, who competed on the athletics track and in the velodrome at the Rio Paralympics, said her parents were "just massively proud" of her.
"They're proud of everything I've done I think - they were proud of the fact I was just sat on a plane going to Rio, let alone all the stuff that's come with it," she said.
Double gold medal-winning gymnast Max Whitlock is also appointed MBE, and said: "It is a great feeling now to see it on the name card - the three letters after my name - and it gives me a lot of motivation."
Elsewhere in the world of sport, Chris Coleman is appointed OBE for services to football in recognition of leading Wales to the Euro 2016 semi-finals. There is an MBE too for Michael O'Neill, manager of Northern Ireland, who took them to the knock-out stage.

Topping the list in the world of stage and screen, director Sir Richard Eyre is made a Companion of Honour, while percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie gets the same recognition for services to music.
Ray Davies, 72, said his initial reaction to his knighthood had been "a mixture of surprise, humility, joy and a bit embarrassed", but added: "After thinking about it, I accept this for my family and fans as well as everyone who has inspired me to write."
New dame Patricia Routledge said she was "very surprised indeed but very pleased that the honour pertains to theatre".
Among the thespians to be named OBE are Naomie Harris, Helen McCrory and Tim Piggott-Smith, while Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan receives the same honour.

Justine Roberts, founder of parenting website Mumsnet, is appointed CBE, while Marcia Shakespeare is appointed MBE for her work against gun violence since the death of her daughter Leticia in 2003. Of her award, she said: "I don't do it for medals, my reward is when I can see a child has turned their life around."
