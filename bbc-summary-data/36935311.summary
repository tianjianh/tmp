The Canadians, who were teaming up at an ATP World Tour event for the first time since 2013, pegged back the second seeds from a set down but double-faulted in the third-set match tie-break to give their opponents the edge.
"They made a few more balls at the key moments," Nestor added. "They put a lot of first serves in play in the match tie-break and played solid doubles."
It is a second ATP World Tour Masters 1,000 final of 2016 for Murray and Soares, after they finished runners-up in Monte Carlo.
In the other semi-final, Dodig and Melo beat Florin Mergea and Horia Tecau of Romania 6-4 6-3 in 71 minutes.
