[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield United 1-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry lost ground on League One leaders Burton after Billy Sharp sealed victory for Sheffield United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blades keeper George Long twice saved well from Adam Armstrong and made a flying stop from a Ruben Lameiras shot.
John Fleck also failed to connect with an Armstrong pass and when Long spilled a cross it was adjudged not to have gone over the line.
Substitute Sharp headed home a Paul Coutts corner from close range before Sam Ricketts was sent off late on.
Sheffield United manager Nigel Adkins:
"We played against a very good footballing side and we had a game-plan. The lads worked very hard and we were solid, resolute and committed, which is great to see.
"The players were disciplined and organised. We want to be competitive and there is a resilience about the players.
"We want to be attack-minded, especially at home, but we've been punished before when teams have caught us on the counter-attack so we need to be nice and solid. We want to have that platform of being hard to beat and keep clean sheets."
Coventry manager Tony Mowbray:
"You've got to take your opportunities when they come along. It wasn't a game with lots of chances.
"The boys were saying in the dressing room that the ball was definitely over the line (Murphy shot). Joe Cole span away celebrating when he probably could have put it in himself.
"The referee had a difficult day. He got some right and he got some wrong so we have to accept that.
"The nature of the goal we conceded was frustrating. It's always disappointing and frustrating to concede a goal from a corner-kick. Reice has decided to come for the ball and missed it. It happens and I'm not sure whether the boy who scored knew much about it.
"Credit to them because I thought they set up well and defended well. We have to take it on the chin and move on to the next one."
