The 26-year-old, who has won two of his last three events in America, had a double bogey six at the 11th as he slumped to a six-over round of 78.
Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke and Ernie Els made the cut by a shot on one over.
Italian Francesco Molinari holds a one-shot lead at 10 under with Byeong Hun An of South Korea second after a 64.
McIlroy won the PGA Championship title 12 months ago with a winning score of 14 under, but has now missed the cut at Wentworth in three of the last four years.
The Northern Irishman broke his own course record with a 61 at Quail Hollow en route to victory at the Wells Fargo Championship last week, but showed signs of fatigue in his fifth tournament in five weeks.
He missed a putt from inside two feet at the 10th and then hooked his drive out of bounds at the next.
"That little stretch killed me," said McIlroy, who has only a few days of rest before his foundation hosts the Irish Open at Royal County Down on Thursday.
"I'd love to have played the weekend but it's a weekend off I probably need," he said.
England's James Morrison, who won last week's Spanish Open, had seven birdies in a 66 and is in fifth place on seven under.
Two-time winner Luke Donald carded a second successive 70 and shares 11th, six strokes off the lead, but suggested that the greens needed replacing for the second time in six years.
"I guess the only way to fix them is to redo them again," said Donald. "If there's one tournament you should expect them to be perfect, it's this one."
"An exhausting schedule finally caught up with McIlroy and it resulted in a miserable second round. He never looked comfortable on greens where the uneven surface can easily undermine confidence.
"He says that it is a disappointment to miss out on the weekend but the two days off provide a welcome breather.
"Although this is the European Tour's flagship event, McIlroy regards the Irish Open as his 'fifth major' and he should be fresher for his tilt at Royal County Down next week.
"By contrast, the leading Briton James Morrison is entitled to feel thrilled with his 66. To get to seven under par is some achievement for last week's Spanish Open champion, given he was four over par after 11 holes of his first round."
