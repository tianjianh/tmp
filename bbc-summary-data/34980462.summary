Police are investigating the activities of the Military Reaction Force (MRF), an undercover Army unit.
They are looking at 18 shooting incidents, two of them fatal.
Det Ch Insp Peter Montgomery said a witness had given the investigation team significant new information.
As a result, he said, there is a new line of inquiry.
Earlier, detectives appealed for information about 18 shooting incidents that took place in Belfast between April and September 1972.
Two years ago, the BBC's Panorama programme broadcast claims by former MRF soldiers that their unit had killed unarmed people while hunting "the IRA".
They claimed MRF actions "saved lives".
However, seven months after their interviews were broadcast, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it had begun an investigation into the allegations.
The inquiry is being carried by detectives from the PSNI's Legacy Investigation Branch, a special police unit that investigates historical cases, many of them killings that took place during the Troubles.
The incidents under investigation are:
In total, 17 people were injured, two of whom died.
More than half of those who were shot were teenagers, the youngest person to be wounded was a 15-year-old boy.
Earlier, Det Ch Insp Montgomery, said: "We are looking at these incidents as part of an overall investigation into the activities of the Military Reaction Force at the time.
"We know these events took place a long time ago and we know they took place during one of the worst years of the Troubles when many shootings occurred but we believe there are people out there who can help us progress this investigation and we are appealing to them to contact us."
The MRF was a small, secretive unit within the Army and consisted of about 40 undercover soldiers who patrolled west Belfast in unmarked cars.
It operated for about 18 months before it was disbanded in 1973.
