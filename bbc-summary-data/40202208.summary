Tottenham winger Josh Onomah was given an odd red card in England's quarter-final victory over Mexico when attempting to dribble past an opponent, for which the video referee was not used.
Earlier in the tournament, an Italian player was dismissed after the video assistant referee intervened, while in the opening game, Argentina forward Lautaro Martinez was sent off for elbowing an England player, which the referee initially missed.
