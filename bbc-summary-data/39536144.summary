Northants sped to a crushing innings victory over Glamorgan inside two days as they dismissed the visitors for 187 in their second innings.

Seamer Ben Sanderson led the way with another devastatingly accurate display, taking 4-31.
Colin Ingram's 47 was the top score for the visitors, who were skittled out for just 101 in their first innings.
Northants had managed a third batting point through last man Sanderson, despite Rory Kleinveldt falling for 86.
The home side dominated the match from the start after their seamers took full advantage of Glamorgan's surprise decision to bat first.
Glamorgan's middle order managed some token resistance on day two, but Northants' three strikes before lunch had already virtually sealed the result.
Kleinveldt chipped in with three wickets, while spinner Graeme White claimed two.
A career-best return of 4-85 from teenage seamer Lukas Carey was the only real positive for Glamorgan.
Northants captain Alex Wakely told BBC Radio Northampton:
"We haven't won the first game since 1995, so it was a nice little motivation for us and to win within two days, I don't think I've done that before so it's a pretty good feeling.
"It was a good toss to lose, we just assumed we'd be batting, we hadn't even thought about doing the toss and if I'd won it I'd have been a bit stuck out there, so the first hour did the damage for us.
"For me the most pleasing thing was the bowling all the way through, we bowled in partnerships and the pressure was on the whole time.
"We had to bat well, Rory's innings was phenomenal and that was the innings that changed the game for me."
Glamorgan captain Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport:
"I admitted we should have bowled (first), but we had them 27 for 3 and then we had Wakely bowled off a no-ball and dropped the next ball, they could have been 27 for 4 and the game in the balance.
"Then we dropped Rory on the boundary on about ten, he scored 86 and took the game away from us.
"Our batting performance (on day two), I don't think it was a 190 kind of wicket, it was a good batting wicket and that's something we need to reflect on and re-group this week.
"Lukas (Carey) has been the most impressive bowler in nets, I think he's got a bright future ahead of him and it's nice to have Colin (Ingram) back as well in decent touch."
