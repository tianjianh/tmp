Fifa lifts ban on Qatar's Saoud al-Mohannadi

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Fifa appeal committee has lifted a one-year ban imposed on Qatar's Saoud al-Mohannadi in November last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Qatar Football Association vice-president Mohannadi was banned by Fifa's ethics watchdog for his failure to cooperate with an inquiry into an unnamed third party.
But in a hearing last week, the committee upheld his appeal and lifted the sanctions imposed on him.
It also revoked a 20,000 Swiss franc fine levied against him.
In a statement issued on Thursday, Fifa's appeal committee said the "evidence available was not sufficient to establish to the appropriate standard" that Mohannadi had violated football's world governing body's code of ethics.
Mohannadi was also barred from standing as an Asian Football Confederation delegate to the Fifa Council at an AFC Congress.
It is unclear whether his appeal victory has come too late to get him back on the ballot for next month's election in Bahrain of four AFC members to the Fifa Council.
