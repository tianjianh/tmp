[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British Olympic short track speed-skater Jon Eley has retired, ruling out a bid for a fourth Winter Games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old, who was the Team GB flag bearer last year in Sochi, made his Olympic debut at Turin 2006 and twice won world relay bronze medals.
He cites being a new father and "not wanting to just make up the numbers" at the next Games in Pyeongchang 2018 as being behind the decision.
He tweeted: "It's official, I have hung up my skates."
