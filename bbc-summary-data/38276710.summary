The game came alive at the three-quarter mark when Fiacre Kelleher put the Blue Toon in front.
Jordan Kirkpatrick levelled with 15 minutes left from a Jon Robertson ball.
In the evening kick-off, Scott Robinson scored and was later sent off as East Fife boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at play-off chasing Brechin, who saw Elliot Ford dismissed at the death.
