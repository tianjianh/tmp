Lord Janner: 'Abuse victim' seeks dementia records

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who claims he was abused by ex-MP Lord Janner has called for the release of medical reports which prompted the decision not to prosecute him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire that seeing those reports would give him peace of mind.
The director of public prosecutions (DPP) announced in April that 86-year-old Lord Janner would not be charged because of his dementia.
The Labour politician has denied any wrongdoing.
DPP Alison Saunders said Lord Janner's dementia was so severe that he could "play no part in a trial".
The alleged victim interviewed by the programme was not one of the cases being considered by Ms Saunders for potential prosecution.
He described as a "typical whitewash" the decision not to prosecute the former MP.
Speaking about the tests for dementia, he said: "We need to see when those reports were taken and be able to look at the dates and the conclusions and be able to test it".
The BBC cannot verify his version of events.
Leicestershire Police have confirmed that they have taken a statement from the man.
In the past, Lord Janner has strongly denied claims that he perpetrated child abuse, and more recently, the 86-year-old's family said he was "entirely innocent of any wrongdoing".
His alleged victim spoke to Victoria Derbyshire anonymously, and asked to be referred to as 'David'.
Now 50, he claims to have been abused by Lord Janner when he was a child.
At the time 'David' felt he had nobody to turn to as his family had broken down, and he became withdrawn.
"I didn't trust anybody. I was probably ashamed," he said. "Deep down I knew it was wrong and I didn't want to talk about it."
As an adult, 'David' said he has suffered severe depression and extreme anxiety.
He said he decided to approach the police in January 2007, after his marriage collapsed.
He claims that officers were initially dismissive but he decided to contact them again in March of this year after a police appeal for anyone claiming abuse to come forward.
This time, he said, things were different: "I wanted my story to be heard and I really felt that they were taking it seriously."
He feels that being able to see the medical reviews which led Ms Saunders to decide against prosecution would be a comfort to him and others alleging abuse.
"The reason she [DPP Alison Saunders] said it wasn't in the public interest is because four medicals experts said he'd got severe dementia so he was not fit to plead," he said.
"If we saw those reports and we knew who the medical experts were it would probably make her decision more understandable."
"People with dementia may not be able to plead, but the victims and survivors are not getting any justice," he claimed.
