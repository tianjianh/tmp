[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Ferriby United 1-2 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover had a scare at North Ferriby before eventually prevailing on the Villagers' turf.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Early on, Rory Watson saved Ricky Miller's penalty, denying the league's runway leading goalscorer.
But the south coast club continued to press and Aswad Thomas curled a shot on to the inside of the post.
North Ferriby hit Dover with a sucker-punch early in the second half when Curtis Bateson bent a delightful free-kick past Steve Arnold.
But midfielder Joe Healy scored his third in three games for the Whites, smashing in after a Watson punch fell conveniently into his path.
Two defenders then combined as Sam Magri teed up Thomas to strike home the Dover winner.
