Belfast City Hall's colourful lighting requests dilemma

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are being asked to approve new criteria for requests to light up Belfast City Hall.

Coloured LED lighting was installed in 2013, allowing it to be lit up to mark significant dates or achievements.
The last 18 months have seen a big rise in requests to light the building up from support groups, in relation to medical conditions or diseases.
A report said the council was unable to recognise all of these, and that all should be refused under a new policy.
If the lighting was used too frequently, "the overall impact is diminished", added the report.
The details were outlined as part of a report submitted to Belfast City Council's Strategic and Policy Resources Committee.
Councillors on the committee are set to discuss the proposed policy on Friday.
The building is currently illuminated on 10 agreed days during the year, but the council also considers requests from charities and significant anniversaries.
The report said: "It is clear from social media and tourist feedback that the system has demonstrably enhanced the City Hall's image as a notable landmark."
However, it added that the new lighting had also resulted in "a significant number of requests for access of types not foreseen when the system was implemented".
The report said a total of 203 requests had been received in addition to the agreed list of recognised days since the system went live in 2013.
It said many of the requests were for "very worthy and important causes and very emotive issues".
But it said there were now more than 140 such diseases, conditions and other special days currently recognized internationally by the United Nations.
The report said it "would clearly not be possible to recognise all of these, so clear criteria are needed".
