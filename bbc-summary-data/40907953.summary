[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Heading into the game without a goal this season, the visitors' task got even tougher when they conceded a Josh Magennis header from a Ricky Holmes cross with just two minutes played.
Justin Edinburgh's men responded well, seeing shots from Marc Richards and Billy Waters saved by Ben Amos.
Charlton could have extended their lead after 32 minutes when Tariqe Fosu was found by Magennis but dragged his effort wide.
Karl Robinson's side managed to double their advantage after the break when Holmes embarked on a superb run before firing the ball past David Cornell with 61 minutes on the clock.
Northampton pulled a goal back with 11 minutes remaining when Richards headed in to give the visitors a glimmer of hope.
However, the nerves were settled for Charlton when Jake Forster-Caskey fired home from Ezri Konsa's pass with four minutes of added time gone before adding a superb second three minutes later to cap a fine performance.
