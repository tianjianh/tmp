Derbyshire's police and fire service are to share a purpose-built Â£14.5m headquarters.

It will be built on the site of the force's old offices in Ripley, north of Derby, after plans were approved.
Both organisations said it would save money in the long term and lead to improvements in the way they worked together.
Building is due to start in April next year with work expected to be finished by February 2017.
Derbyshire police said their current buildings were coming to the end of their useful life.
Police and Crime Commissioner Alan Charles admitted that while new headquarters were initially more expensive than repairing the old ones, it would allow further savings in the future.
He added: "Sharing headquarters with the Fire and Rescue Service in this way will allow both our organisations to adapt more easily to change and improve our ways of working, including making best use of technological advancements that are so important to efficiency."
Roland Hosker, chairman of the Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service (DFRS) panel, said: "DFRS's current headquarters is no longer fit for purpose and restricts the opportunities to develop new and more efficient ways of working. "
The existing building, at Burton Road, Littleover, is being sold to help fund the new project.
Additional funding is being sought from government transformation grants for "joint blue light" schemes.
