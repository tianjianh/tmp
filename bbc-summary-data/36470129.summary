The 26-year-old Zenit St Petersburg midfielder has replaced Dynamo Moscow's Igor Denisov, who was injured in Sunday's 1-1 friendly draw with Serbia.
Yusupov, who has won two caps, had to borrow boots for his first training session.
Russia face England, Slovakia and Wales - in that order - in Group B.
"After being on holiday for 14 days, of course I am going to be a bit out of shape," Yusupov said.
"I don't really know what sort of physical condition I will be in.
"I was supposed to fly back to Moscow. I didn't even have my football boots with me and none of the clothes that I needed."
Russia's first game is against England on Saturday.
