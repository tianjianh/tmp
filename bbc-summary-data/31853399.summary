[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leicestershire became crucially important to Richard III after Henry Tudor landed in Wales in August 1485.
The king stayed in Leicester on the night of 20 August before marching out to cut off Henry's progress through the midlands.
Richard's death at Bosworth, along with the recent discovery of his bones, have left a rich legacy in the area.
On 22 March the reburial cortege will pass some of these places - starting at Fenn Lane in Leicestershire before heading into the city.
