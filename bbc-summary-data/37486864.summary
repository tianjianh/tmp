The 26-year-old scored 4,978 runs in 101 first-class matches for the county and also played 38 limited-overs games.
But he only made eight Championship appearances this summer as the county won the Division Two title.
"Jaik has been a terrific servant to the club and contributed throughout his time here," head coach Chris Silverwood told the club website.
