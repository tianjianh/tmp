Maxime Colin: Brentford defender could miss rest of season with groin injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford fear defender Maxime Colin could miss the rest of the season with a groin injury.

Colin, 24, has not played since the Bees' 3-1 defeat against Derby on 20 February and might require surgery.
"He's been to a consultant and has had injections that we hope can cure him," boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London.
"If not, it might be the surgical route, which we're hoping not because that might cross him out for the rest of the season."
On a brighter note for the Bees, Alan McCormack is close to a return after two months out with a calf problem.
And striker Scott Hogan, sidelined since August 2014 after suffering two serious knee injuries, scored on his return to action in an under-21 game against Crystal Palace this week.
