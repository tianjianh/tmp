A long-serving RSPCA inspector says an abandoned pony found on a remote country lane had suffered some of the worst neglect he has ever seen.

The young piebald cob was found on Thursday at Braceby, near Grantham, with a hind leg infested with maggots.
Inspector Ian Callingham said the pony had obviously been dumped and left to die, and had suffered terribly. The animal was put down.
The RSPCA wants to hear from anyone who saw anything.
Mr Callingham, who has been with the RSPCA for 25 years, said: "The location was extremely remote; there are no homes, farms or equestrian centres nearby, so it is clear this pony was deliberately left with no intention of return.
"Her left hind leg was severely swollen to twice the size, and three large, deep holes that were bleeding and covered in maggots were clearly visible.
"It was terrible to see this young pony clearly in a huge amount of pain."
He added: "The wounds had been sprayed with a purple antiseptic spray, which suggests the owner was aware of the injury, but clearly failed to seek appropriate veterinary advice.
"She had a good body condition and trimmed hooves, so it is likely the owner was overwhelmed by the injury and reluctant to seek further treatment, for whatever reason."
On advice of the vet, the pony was put down to end her severe pain and suffering.
The charity said a low market price has led to irresponsible owners abandoning horses.
