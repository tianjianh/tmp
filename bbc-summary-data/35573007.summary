The 15-year-old from Kent scored 88.60 to easily claim top spot, while Paula Cooper from the United States was second with 79.00 and Austria's Lara Wolf third with 74.20.
It was Team GB's first medal on snow in the Winter Games, which are being held for the second time.
GB won three medals in 2012.
But they were in ice sports - two in short track speed skating and one in bobsleigh.
Rowlands told BBC Sport: "I couldn't be happier. It's probably the best run I've ever done.
"I hurt my knee in a World Cup event a month ago so I didn't expect this at all.
"There are two main competitions I ultimately want to get to, the X Games and then the Olympics. This is a great step towards that and I'm just so stoked to win."
Jenny Jones, who become the first Briton to win a Winter Olympics medal on snow when she won slopestyle bronze in Sochi in 2014, said: "It's a great result and a brilliant experience going forward to big competitions in the future.
"It's a really big halfpipe and she coped with it really well, getting great height at the top and landing at the bottom with a nice, clean 720 alley-oop.
"What was so good to see was how she held her nerve as some athletes have all the tricks but can't produce it under pressure."
