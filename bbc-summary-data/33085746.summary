Norway women 1-2 England women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England reached the quarter-finals of the Women's World Cup after Lucy Bronze's stunning strike sealed victory against Norway in Ottawa.

Bronze fired into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area to book a last-eight meeting with hosts Canada.
Norway dominated the first half and led early in the second through Solveig Gulbrandsen's flicked header.
But Steph Houghton headed in from a corner before Bronze gave England their first World Cup knockout win.
England closed out the final 14 minutes and there were emotional scenes at the end as the substitutes charged on to the pitch to join their team-mates in celebrating a famous victory.
Now, they have the opportunity to better the quarter-final defeats suffered in each of their three previous World Cups - which they reached directly after qualifying from the group stage - when they meet Canada in Vancouver at 00:30 BST on Sunday.
To secure the tie with hosts, England had to overcome a nation that won the 1995 World Cup, were 2013 European Championship runners-up and a side they had not beaten in four previous attempts at major tournaments.
For a long period, it looked as if England would lose out to a team five places below them in the world rankings as Mark Sampson's outfit struggled to keep the ball and failed to cope with the direct approach of the physical Norwegians in sweltering conditions.
Indeed, when Gulbrandsen climbed highest at the front post nine minutes into the second half to deflect a corner past Karen Bardsley, Norway's lead was entirely deserved.
Bardsley had played her part in keeping the scores level in the first half as holes appeared in the England defence, saving from Isabell Herlovsen and Ada Hegerberg.

Still, she was partly to blame for the Norwegian goal, needlessly tipping Gulbrandsen's shot behind when the ball was heading well wide.
At that point England were second best, constantly wasting possession and failing to provide support to lone striker Toni Duggan.
If going behind jolted them to life, so too did the introduction of Jill Scott, who provided the energy and industry that England's attacks previously lacked.
It was Scott who forced the corner that led to Houghton's equaliser, the England captain arriving to meet Fara Williams' cross with a powerful header that flew inside the far post.
And the Manchester City midfielder played her part in the winner, linking well with fellow substitute Jodie Taylor on the right of the penalty area before the ball was laid off for Bronze to smash a right-footed drive into the net via the hand of goalkeeper Ingrid Hjelmseth.
England finished strongly and rarely looked like surrendering the advantage, with the final whistle sparking joyous celebrations.
Attention now turns to Vancouver and a clash with a Canada team that beat them 1-0 in a pre-tournament friendly and are managed by Englishman John Herdman.
