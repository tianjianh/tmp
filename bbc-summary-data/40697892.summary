The former England forward suffered the injury in last week's pre-season fixture against Port Vale.
Bent has scored 28 times in 84 Derby games and news came after Saturday's friendly win over Kaiserslautern.
"Gutted to be having a spell on the sidelines. Great result for the boys yesterday. Long may it continue," the 33-year-old said on Twitter.
Bent's injury was confirmed by a scan and boss Gary Rowett told the club website it was "a bit of a blow".
He added: "He had looked sharp in the games so far but it's something we will just have to deal with."
