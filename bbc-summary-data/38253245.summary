[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mattie Lennon set to return as Tyrone hurling manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mattie Lennon is on his way back to Tyrone for a second stint as the county's senior hurling manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Armagh native Lennon is expected to be ratified by the Red hands committee, a year after stepping down from the post.
He had a successful spell with Tyrone in 2014 and 2015, guiding them to a first ever Nicky Rackard Cup title and securing successive league promotions.
Since his departure, two managers and an interim manager have taken the reins.
Antrim man Dominic Kearns stepped down after just a few weeks in the job early last year, with Waterford man and former Antrim manager Kevin Ryan appointed at short notice.
He too stepped away before the end of the season, but said he had achieved his objectives in helping Tyrone retain their NHL Division 3A and Nicky Rackard Cup status.
Following Ryan's departure, long-serving player and assistant manager John Devlin took over on a temporary basis.
Lennon previously managed his native Armagh from 2006 to 2008 and was in charge of the Monaghan team that reached the NHL Division 3A final in 2012.
He has also managed the Armagh Under-21 footballers, and played hurling at all levels for Armagh and his club Derrynoose.
