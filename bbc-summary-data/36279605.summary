They may be carrying the UK's hopes of success at Eurovision but Joe and Jake will have strong support from the home town of one of the singers.

As the duo perform live in Stockholm on Saturday night, they will be cheered on by Joe Woolford's friends and family in Ruthin, Denbighshire.
A party has been organised by his uncle where locals can watch the contest on a giant screen.
Geraint Woolford said the town was "buzzing" about the contest.
Joe, 21, will performing You're Not Alone with Jake Shakeshaft, 20, from Stoke-on-Trent in the annual competition.
Both singers were former contestants on The Voice UK.
Joe's family, including his mother Ffion, stepfather Krino Pab, father Alun Jones, sister Misha and younger brother Zac are flying to Sweden to join the 16,000-strong audience watching the final in the city's Globe Arena.
An estimated worldwide TV audience of 200 million viewers is also expected to tune in.
Mr Woolford, a local councillor, said: "We're all very proud of him. Everyone is talking about it... and he's really putting Ruthin on the map internationally.
"A lot of us would have liked to have travelled to Stockholm to be there with him, but it's just too expensive, with ticket prices ranging from Â£350 to Â£2,500.
"But we'll have a real celebration ourselves, especially if Joe and Jake win."
Joe's mother, Ffion Woolford, added: "I've only managed to speak to him for a brief time this week because he's so busy with rehearsals.
"He's incredibly excited and really looking forward to the contest. The arena where he'll be singing is vast, but we're sure we'll do well and I'm looking forward to being there to support him."
Speaking ahead of the event, Joe and Jake said they were quietly confident their song could do well - despite the UK's recent track record.
We've done a lot of preparation, we've been rehearsing non-stop, we've been practising movement, we've been running in and out of the studio," Joe said.
"We want to get a good result for the UK."
The Eurovision final is on BBC One on Saturday 14 May at 20:00 BST.
