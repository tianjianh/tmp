Lynne Sandford, 41, from Dorking, Surrey, has argued for her son Michael, 20, to be returned home after he was placed on suicide watch in prison.
He is due to stand trial in Las Vegas in August and denies several charges.
Ms Sandford said her son has OCD, severe depression and Asperger's syndrome.
It is alleged Mr Sandford tried to snatch a policeman's gun during a rally at a Las Vegas casino on 18 June. Officials claimed he said his plan was "to shoot and kill Donald Trump".
He denied charges of disrupting government business and official functions and being an illegal alien in possession of a gun.
Ms Sandford said: "If found guilty of the charges, Michael could face up to 30 years in prison in the USA.
"He is now shackled and handcuffed in a US mainstream prison, and has been put on suicide watch."
Ms Sandford has set up a crowdfunding campaign on the Crowd Justice website to raise money for his legal team.
She said her son was "totally unable" to deal with the "threats and stresses" of being in a US mainstream prison.
Ms Sandford added: "Because of his severe mental health problems, his family, who love him very much, want him returned to the UK.
"We want him to serve his sentence in a safe institution for vulnerable people, where he can receive appropriate help."
Michael Sandford is due to attend a court hearing on 11 August and stand trial on 22 August.
