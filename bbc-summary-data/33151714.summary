[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seren Bernard, 14, was found dead in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, in April 2012.
John Keith Mumberson, her drug worker, told the Milford Haven hearing on Tuesday she appeared to be looking to the future during their last meeting.
But he said she could act impulsively and could be blasÃ© about her own safety.
Mr Mumberson had worked with Seren to address her drug and alcohol use, and would meet her for hourly sessions at her school.
On Monday, the inquest had heard a mental health assessment which highlighted Seren had suicidal thoughts was not shared with her social worker.
But Mr Mumberson told the hearing Seren had never indicated any suicidal feelings to him.
He said Seren's foster parents were providing a "secure and positive" environment and he thought things were improving for the teenager.
"My overriding memory is that she was starting to look forward," he said.
"She was in a safe environment and we could move on from there. That's what I remember of our last meeting."
The inquest continues.
