Arek Jozwik, 39, died from head injuries after the attack in Harlow.
Essex Police has released CCTV images of passers-by during the time of a fight involving Mr Jozwik and his friends and a group of youths.
Officers have been meeting Polish police to discuss the case, which is being treated as a hate crime.

Six teenagers have been arrested and released on police bail in connection with the murder.
Officers from the two forces have also talked about an assault on two Polish men in Kitson Way, Harlow, on Sunday, which is being investigated as a separate hate crime.
A Polish police officer will be based in the town for at least the next week to help the Essex force with its investigation and provide reassurance, the BBC has been told.
"We fully understand that residents in Harlow have been left deeply shocked by the murder of Arek Jozwik, and the assault of two Polish men," said Ch Supt Sean O'Callaghan.
Det Ch Insp Martin Pasmore from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate said CCTV from The Stow showed Mr Jozwik and his two friends at TGF Pizza at 23:10 BST on 27 August.
"They then went outside and spoke with a group of youths as well as other passers-by for up to about 20 minutes," he said.
"However it can be seen that the atmosphere then changed and there was a verbal argument.
"It is during this altercation that Arek receives a single punch to the face, causing him to fall backwards and bang his head on the ground.
He appealed for anyone who was in The Stow on the night in question to come forward and speak to police.
"We are investigating his murder as a hate crime but there are other lines of enquiry that we need to look at and the information you can give us could be vital."
