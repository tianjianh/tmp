[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zach Clough opened the scoring, spinning on to Derik Osede's pass before drilling a powerful effort past Jak Alnwick from the edge of the box.
Josh Vela then doubled the lead, sweeping home from close range after Alnwick had spilled Sammy Ameobi's cross-shot.
And full-back Lawrie Wilson then sent the Macron into delirium as he hammered a half-cleared corner past Alnwick for his first goal of the season.
The home side had chances to go further ahead as Andy Taylor had one effort tipped over the bar and continued to dominate in the second half, with Gary Madine going close on three different occasions.
Vale recovered their poise and after defender Remie Streete was denied superbly by goalkeeper Mark Howard, the visitors finally punctured the Wanderers' defence when Sam Hart headed in from close range.
