Evans, 29, made his debut in 2006 and has played 195 games for the Dragons.
The back-rower is the sixth Dragons player to extend his contract alongside Hallam Amos, Rynard Landman, Brok Harris, Nic Cudd and Ed Jackson.
"It's a place I have called home for over 10 years and it looks like I'll be spending my whole career here," said Evans.
