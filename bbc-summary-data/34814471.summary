Officers located two Rottweilers that had got loose in Otterbourne with the help of a police helicopter at about 18:20.
The hunt started after a 12-year-old old child was attacked and taken to Southampton General Hospital.
Hampshire Constabulary advised members of the public to avoid the area and not approach the animals.
A force spokesperson said the dogs' owners helped with the search.
