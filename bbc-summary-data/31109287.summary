[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cracks appear in £4.5m Stoke-on-Trent regeneration scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Soil conditions" may be responsible for pavement cracks in a £4.5m regeneration scheme in Stoke-on-Trent, the council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme, which is being funded by the council and the European Regional Development Fund, aims to improve streets and squares in Hanley.
However, the authority said some of the new paving on Stafford Street had "moved", leading to cracks.
The council said it would investigate the cause and carry out repairs.
The so-called public realm scheme, which includes work on Parliament Square, road and pavement reconstruction and new lighting and tree planting, forms part of the council's aim of making Hanley feel like Stoke's "city centre".
The work, which has been going on since 2012, is due to be completed in October.
However, the council said: "There is a section of paving on Stafford Street that appears to have moved slightly.
"Following investigation, it was identified that this was a small section approximately 20 sq metres (215 sq feet)."
"We believe this is only a localised problem, due to settlement, possibly related to soil conditions.
"However, we will be carrying out investigative works in the coming weeks to clarify exactly what has happened and rectify the problem."
