Building work at Wrexham Cemetery will see the restoration of Grade II-listed chapels and a lodge, which has been closed over safety concerns.
Wrexham council warned there would be some disruption, with paths, fencing and entrances also being improved.
It comes after the cemetery won a £1.1m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Councillor David A Bithell, lead member for the environment and transport, said work on the cemetery, which is on the register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Wales, would be completed in 2017.
The council said it was one of the finest examples of a Victorian cemetery in Wales with a well-preserved "gardenesque" cemetery landscape which was typical of the time it was created.
