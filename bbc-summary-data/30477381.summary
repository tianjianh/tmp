[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dounreay site closure pushed back four years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The finishing date for work to decommission and close the Dounreay nuclear power site in Caithness has been pushed back from 2025 to 2029.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Changes in the way radioactive fuel should be handled and a requirement for additional security at nuclear sites has created more work at Dounreay.
The changes are required by the UK government.
Cavendish Dounreay Partnership said current levels of employment would be maintained for longer.
The company runs the nuclear plant's operator Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL).
