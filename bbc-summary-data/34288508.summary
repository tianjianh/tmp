The oldest flying Swordfish Mk1 was built at Sherburn-in-Elmet, in North Yorkshire, by the Blackburn Aircraft Company.
W5856 saw active service in the Mediterranean during the 1939-45 war.
It is also to fly over Brough, East Yorkshire, where it was first restored to full flying condition by BAE Systems in the 1990s.
About 1,700 Swordfish aircraft were built at the Sherburn-in-Elmet factory and the last one left the production line in 1944.
The plane is based at the Royal Navy Historic Flight in Somerset.
Swordfish aircraft were armed with a torpedo and played a crucial role in protecting Allied convoys from German U-boat attack in the Battle of the Atlantic and attacking the German battleship Bismarck in 1941.
Sarah Douglas, whose family ran the Blackburn Aircraft factory, said: "People in Yorkshire have a great affection for the Swordfish."
"The factory was run by my grandfather, Norman Blackburn, and local companies took great pride in making Swordfish components", she added.
This aircraft was adopted by the city of Leeds in 1996 in tribute to the companies that built Swordfish components.
Blackburn Aircraft was founded by Robert Blackburn who built his first aircraft in Leeds about 1908.
The company was absorbed by Hawker Siddeley in 1960 and the Blackburn name was dropped in 1963, it later became BAE Systems.
