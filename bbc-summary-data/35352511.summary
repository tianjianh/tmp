Controller of BBC One Charlotte Moore has been appointed as the BBC's new controller of TV channels and iPlayer.

The newly created role is part of a wider reorganisation of the corporation.
Moore, who brought The Great British Bake Off to BBC One, will start her new job on 25 January and will report to acting director of TV Mark Linsey.
She said: "I'm honoured to lead the BBC's channel portfolio into the future at such a significant time."
She continued: "It is more important than ever for audiences and programme makers that we have a clearly defined sense of purpose for each channel to ensure we deliver even higher quality and more distinctive content."
As the BBC's commissioning editor of documentaries, Moore was behind successful documentaries such as Terry Prachett's Choosing To Die.
In February 2013, she was appointed acting controller of daytime television and had been acting controller of BBC One since Danny Cohen's promotion to director of BBC Television.
She became controller of BBC One in June 2013.
BBC Two and BBC Four controller Kim Shillinglaw is to leave the BBC and her post will be closed.
The BBC said the reorganisation "follows other recent moves to simplify structures at the BBC".
