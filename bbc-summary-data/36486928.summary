After heavy defeats in the opening two contests, the Cavaliers now trail 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.
Kyrie Irving added 30 points for the home team, with Steph Curry only claiming 19 for Golden State.
"We weren't ready to play," said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. "They just punched us right in the mouth."
James added: "My team-mates got me going. They told me to be aggressive - and that's what I was."
Cleveland were beaten by Golden State in last year's Finals.
Game four is also in Cleveland on Friday.
