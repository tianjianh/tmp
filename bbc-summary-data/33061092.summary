Dumfries and Galloway overhead power line consultation begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Consultation is starting on plans to modernise the overhead power line network stretching from Ayrshire across Dumfries and Galloway and into Cumbria.

Scottish Power Energy Networks says it needs to replace much of the ageing system with a new higher voltage line.

It said much of the existing 132,000 volt (132kV) system was coming towards the end of its operational life.

Initial consultation will seek views on a broad corridor of land that has been identified where potential routes for a new overhead line could be situated.
Consultation events are taking place at the following venues:
