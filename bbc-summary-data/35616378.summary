The team is looking to challenge Mercedes after finishing second in the 2015 constructors' championship.
Four-time world champion Vettel won three races in his debut season with Ferrari but finished third in the drivers' competition.
"We had a fantastic year last year and we all want more," said Vettel.
"When I joined the team there were a lot of people changing their positions and it was a difficult time to have expectations.
"But now we have had a much better winter to prepare and therefore we will be a strong team - as we have seen already last year - but even stronger this year."
The new car sees Ferrari revert to the push-rod suspension for the first time in four years and large sections of white on its livery.
German Vettel will once again partner Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen, who won the team's last drivers' title in 2007.
Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne has said that it would be "a tragedy" if the team failed to win a title in a 10-year span.
The 2016 season starts with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne from March 18-20.
