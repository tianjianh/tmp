Half of the eight large outdoor residential activity centres run by the Education Authority (EA) are set to close next year.

The activity centres currently offer courses for young people and adults.
Delamont Outdoor Education Centre in Killyleagh, County Down, is due to close next March. Three others will shut in August 2017.
They are Bushmills Outdoor Education Centre in County Antrim, Ardnabannon Outdoor Education Centre in County Down and Killowen Outdoor Education Centre, also in County Down.
Delamont Outdoor Education Centre is situated within the 300-acre Delamont Country Park and currently has the capacity to accommodate up to 30 plus students as well as accompanying staff.
