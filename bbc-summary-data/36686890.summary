Rahimov's final lift of 214kg gave him a total of 379kg, breaking the 15-year-old clean and jerk record of 210kg.
China's Lyu Xiaojun, who set a world record of 177kg in the snatch, also lifted a total of 379kg but took silver because he is heavier than Rahimov.
Egypt's Mohamed Mahmoud won bronze with a combined 361kg.
The event was overshadowed by an elbow injury to Armenia's Andranik Karapetyan, who had been in medal contention before suffering the problem as he attempted a clean and jerk lift of 195kg.
