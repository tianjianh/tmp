[SN]TITLE[SN]
Work to start on Leeds-Bradford cycle super highway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on a £29m cycle superhighway linking Bradford and Leeds has officially begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 14-mile (23km) route will run from Bradford city centre to Seacroft, in east Leeds.
The CityConnect project, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, has been funded by an £18m cash award from the Department for Transport and £11m of local funding.
The scheme also includes resurfacing parts of the Leeds Liverpool canal.
Coordinators say they hope the cycle way will encourage more people to make short journeys by bike and improve access to employment, skills and education.
The project is jointly managed by West Yorkshire Combined Authority, Leeds City Council and Bradford Council.
