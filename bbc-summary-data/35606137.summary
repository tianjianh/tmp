The prints are most likely to have belonged to craftsmen handling it before the varnish dried, according to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
The discovery was made public ahead of a new exhibition on how Egyptian coffin design changed over 4,000 years.
The prints were "one of many small details that bring us closer to the ancient craftsmen," a spokeswoman said.
Julie Dawson, head of conservation at the museum, said the prints were first identified in 2005 by researchers at the Fitzwilliam but had "not been widely publicised" before now.
They were discovered on an inner coffin lid belonging to the priest Nespawershefyt, dating from about 1,000 BC.
Organisers of "Death on the Nile" said it was the first time a major exhibition has "put the focus" on ancient Egypt's artisans.
