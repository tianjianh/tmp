Sheku Bayoh's family to meet Lord Advocate next week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a man who died in police custody a year ago are to meet the Lord Advocate next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheku Bayoh, 31, died after being restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife, on 3 May 2015.
His death is currently being investigated by Police Scotland's independent watchdog, the Police Investigations Review Commissioner.
The father-of-two's relatives will be holding a commemorative service on Sunday.
They will lay flowers at the spot where he died in Hayfield Road, Kirkcaldy, and have asked friends to join them in celebrating Mr Bayoh's life at the town's Templehall Community Centre.
His partner Collette Bell, mother Aminata Bayoh, sisters Kadi Johnson, Adama Jalloh and Kosna Bayoh, and brother-in-law Ade Johnson will then meet Frank Mulholland on Monday.
The meeting will take place in Mr Mulholland's office in Edinburgh's Chambers Street and will also be attended by the family's solicitor Aamer Anwar.
Mr Bayoh's relatives have previously met Mr Mulholland when they complained that there were "too many questions and not enough answers" over the death.
The Lord Advocate was asked to update Holyrood on the investigation last September and told MSPs: "Having met the family on two occasions, I know the effect that this tragedy has had on them and they have borne their loss with great dignity.
"They are right to demand answers and a thorough, impartial and objective investigation is what they deserve."
He also confirmed that a fatal accident inquiry into the death would be held, regardless of any criminal proceedings.
