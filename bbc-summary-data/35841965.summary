Michael Ball is to take over BBC Radio 2's Sunday morning slot following the death of Sir Terry Wogan.

Weekend Wogan had broadcast from 11:00 to 13:00 every Sunday, and will now be replaced by The Michael Ball Show.
Ball said he had "learned so much" from "friend and mentor" Sir Terry, who died in January aged 77.
The station also announced Claudia Winkleman will leave the Arts Show to front a new Sunday night slot and Craig Charles will host a Saturday funk show.
Ball currently hosts a programme on Sunday evenings from 19:00 to 21:00. He will start the new show on 10 April.
"I feel so honoured to have been asked to return to Sunday mornings on BBC Radio 2," he said. "I learned so much from my great friend and mentor Sir Terry Wogan. He was simply the best."
Ball previously presented a show in the same time slot before the launch of Weekend Wogan in 2010.
Richard Madeley will present the show for 10 weeks each year when the singer and presenter is away.
"Terry was such a huge part of our audience's lives for so long that finding another presenter to fill that particular slot was always going to be difficult," Lewis Carnie, Radio 2's head of programmes, said.
"Michael is already familiar to our audience and I'm delighted that he will take over the Sunday morning slot."
Winkleman said she was "completely over the moon" about moving from the Friday night arts slot to a new show, Sunday Night with Claudia Winkleman, from 19:00 to 21:00 on Sundays - replacing Ball's show.
She said: "We'll play great music and will try to help the listeners get ready for the week. The first record I ever bought was The Lion Sleeps Tonight by Tight Fit so it might get an airing.  Apologies in advance."
The Arts Show, moving to a new Thursday night slot, will be presented by guest presenters in the short-term. Jonathan Ross is the current guest host.
The Craig Charles House Party will be broadcast from 22:00 to 00:00, and will include soul and funk music. Charles presents the BBC Radio 6 Music Funk and Soul Show from 18:00 to 21:00 on Saturdays.
He said: "I've loved presenting various shows on Radio 2 in recent years, so to get my very own permanent Radio 2 home every Saturday night, where I can play my favourite funk and soul tracks, is a dream come true."
