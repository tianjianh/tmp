A young humpback whale that became entangled in rope off Australia's New South Wales coast has been freed by National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) rescuers, the organisation said.

It was first spotted on Monday near Bermagui, protected by its mother, but bad weather prevented its rescue.
Teams used knives on hooks to cut through more than 150m of rope.
Ian Kerr, who led the operation, said the chances of the calf surviving had now "improved greatly".
"If the material had not been removed the chances of this whale surviving would not have been good," he said.
The crew attached buoys to the rope to slow the whale down and tire it, making it safer to rescue. They then pulled up alongside in small boats to cut or dislodge the ropes late on Tuesday.
It was the first operation of its kind this season for the NPWS.
"Increasing whale numbers and human use of the oceans mean there is a greater chance whales can be entangled in fishing gear, nets or ropes during their migration up and down the coast," Mr Kerr said.
He said it was "very satisfying" to see the calf continue its migration south with its mother.
