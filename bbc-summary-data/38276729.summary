Cardiff Blues coach Danny Wilson said it was "great" to see Alex Cuthbert score in his side's win over Bath.

The Wales wing crossed for the second time in a week as Blues opened a five point lead at the top of Pool Four in the European Challenge Cup.
Cuthbert was the subject of social media criticism for his Wales performances, but Wilson backed him.
"I thought he had a really good game and great to hear the crowd cheer him when he left the pitch," he said.
"I've always said he's a quality player, but as you know people will jump on him if he has half a bad game."
Wilson said the 28-3 win over the English Premiership side was important for his squad after they had lost four of their last five matches which had seen the Blues slip to seventh place in the Pro12 table.
"Teams go through rough patches and to beat Bath at home in Europe is a great thing to get under our belt," Wilson added.
"It's a start, but we need to keep working hard and we've got a tough turnaround now to go to Bath and I'm sure they'll load up now with some big guns who didn't play today and we'll be up for that challenge."
The Blues travel to the Recreation Ground on Thursday, December 15, when players like Wales number eight Taulupe Faletau and England fly-half George Ford will come into the equation for selection for Bath.
