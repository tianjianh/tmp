[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A murder suspect spoke of a desire to slit someone's throat the day before he allegedly stabbed a pensioner to death, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Telfer, 25, denies murdering John Baker in the Calton area of Glasgow on 29 June 2016.
Witness Danielle McNaughton told the High Court in Glasgow that Mr Telfer was "hyper" and allegedly had a knife.
Mr Baker's friend later told the jury how the 76-year-old was his "smiling self" the night before he died.
During the probe into Mr Baker's death, Ms McNaughton, 18, had told how she had been out with friends in Glasgow city centre last June 28 and Mr Telfer was there.
She told officers: "He was asking everybody in the group who was up for going to rob somebody with him.
"He was pure hyper and was saying that he was going to slit the person's throat and do them in."
Miss McNaughton added he "looked bouncing".
Asked by prosecutor Iain McSporran QC what she meant, the witness replied: "Under the influence."
Mr Baker's friend Christian Andrews recalled how the pair had spent the evening at a bar in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street.
He described Mr Baker as popular and said he was in a "very happy mood" when they parted company.
Mr Telfer faces further charges including claims that the same day he tried to rob two women of their handbags.
One of the alleged victims - air hostess Victoria Weston -  told how she was near Central Station when a man threatened her with a knife and grabbed her bag.
He also denies these charges.
The trial, before Judge Lord Matthews, continues.
