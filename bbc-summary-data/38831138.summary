In the Islamic centre, blood smeared the floor and walls and bullet holes could still be seen in the aftermath of the carnage.
Worshippers said they wanted to show the world the scene of the crime.
Alleged gunman Alexandre Bissonette, 27, has been charged with six counts of murder and five of attempted murder.
Mosque vice-president Mohamed Labidi, in an emotional news conference, said they were opening the mosque to show the consequences of hate and Islamophobia.
He said they had been "attacked in the heart of their community".
Mr Labadi also described the courage of one of the victims, Azzedine Soufiane, 57, who died trying to protect other worshippers as the gunman entered the mosque on Sunday during evening prayers.
"When he saw the attacker recharge his gun, he ran quickly to immobilise him," said Mr Labadi.
"But the attacker was quicker and shot him directly and he fell down here, he fell down here as a hero." He pointed to a patch of blood on the floor.
"Without his intervention, we would have more martyrs."
Mr Soufiane ran a halal butcher shop in the suburb of Sainte-Foy, down the street from the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre, and has been described as an important member of the local Muslim community.
The six worshippers who died were immigrants who had moved to Quebec to seek a better life.
The other victims were Khaled Belkacemi, 60, Abdelkrim Hassane, 41, Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42,  Ibrahima Barry, 39, and Aboubaker Thabti, 44.
The funerals for three, Mr Hassane, Mr Thabti and Mr Belkacemi, will be held in Montreal on Thursday and their bodies will be repatriated to their countries of origin.
In the wake of the deadly shooting, Quebecers and their political leaders rallied around the province's Muslim community, with thousands attending vigils to commemorate those killed and injured.
