Solid US economic data and renewed hopes that a Donald Trump administration will cut corporate taxes again boosted shares.
The S&P 500 gained 0.5% to 2,349.25 points, its longest winning streak in three-and-a-half years.
The Dow Jones also rose 0.5%, to 20,611.86, and the Nasdaq added 0.6% to 5,819.4.
Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71% to a two-year high after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to cut costs.
Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2% and 4% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1bn in each of the carriers.
