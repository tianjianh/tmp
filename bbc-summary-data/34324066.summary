People from black and ethnic minority groups face barriers getting into sport in Wales, new research has said.

Sport Wales said its study showed there is some way to go before sport in Wales is truly inclusive for these groups.
Minister for Communities and Tackling Poverty Lesley Griffiths joined community representatives, equality bodies and Sport Wales for a panel discussion on Tuesday.
The panel discussed the study at the Pierhead, in Cardiff Bay.
Sport Wales chair Prof Laura McAllister said: "Regrettably, there is still a stubborn inequality when it comes to people who come from Wales' black and minority ethnic communities.
"As an organisation, we regard that as unacceptable."
Sarah Powell, chief executive of Sport Wales, added: "Sport should be for all - we all have the right to access opportunities to get involved and stay active and healthy, regardless of our backgrounds.
"There are some excellent examples where sports have worked hard to break down barriers and as a result seen positive results but sadly it's clear there are still those who feel they cannot access sport or have no place within it. This needs to change."
Sport Wales interviewed people from Indian, Polish, Chinese, African-Caribbean and other minority ethnic groups - which make up about 4.5% of Wales' total population - about their experiences.
The study highlighted lower incomes, limited time, limited mobility, limited facilities, racism and language barriers, as some of the reason for lower participation among some black and minority ethnic (BME) groups.
Among its recommendations were finding role models to inspire communities, making use of already established networks and working alongside them to create opportunities that fit the needs of BME communities.
Ahead of Tuesday's panel discussion, Lesley Griffiths said: "Sport can have a hugely positive impact on people's lives - helping them stay fit and active and bringing people from diverse backgrounds together.
"This research is an important contribution to our understanding of the barriers experienced by black and minority ethnic communities in accessing sport.
"The challenge is now for everyone in the sector to use this as a basis to develop innovative ways of tackling this inequality head on."
