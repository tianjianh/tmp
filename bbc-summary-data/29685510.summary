Out Of The Woods is rumoured to be about Harry Styles, Dear John about John Mayer, and I Knew You Were Trouble about Jake Gyllenhaal.

But Taylor Swift has hit back at claims she only writes songs about her ex-boyfriends.
"No-one says that about Ed Sheeran. No-one says that about Bruno Mars," she said in an interview with Australian radio station 2DayFM.
"Frankly, that is a very sexist angle to take."
The 24-year-old added: "I have a really strict personal policy that I never name names. So anybody saying that a song is about a specific person is purely speculating."
But despite never naming names, many people think much of Swift's back catalogue is linked to past relationships.
"My first album came out when I was 16," she said.
"Then what happens is, as you get more successful, you have more and more people paying attention to what you're doing. All of a sudden the perspective has changed.
"They use you writing songs about your life as a way to play detective.
"You're going to have people who are going to say, 'Oh, she just writes songs about her exes'.
"No-one says that about Ed Sheeran. No-one says that about Bruno Mars. They're all writing songs about their exes, their current girlfriends, their love life and no-one raises a red flag there."
