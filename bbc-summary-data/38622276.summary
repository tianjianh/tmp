[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Are dragons real? Well sort of - this ruby sea-dragon is actually a fish, from the same family as seahorses, and is one of just three known species of sea dragon.

The 10 inch-long dragon is red, with a curling yellow-tipped tail.
Sea dragons are incredibly rare, and live around the coast of Western Australia.
This is the first time that researchers have found one alive in its natural habitat and they were able to film it using an underwater camera.
