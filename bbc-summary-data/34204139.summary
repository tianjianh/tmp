Home-owners in west London whose properties lie in the path of a proposed third runway for Heathrow have taken their fight to the people in charge.

Some residents of Harmondsworth, Hillingdon could have their properties compulsorily purchased for demolition.
In retaliation they targeted the director of corporate responsibility's house by laying a giant plastic runway across his drive.
Matt Gorman said he was "not happy" about the incident and said his family's privacy had been invaded.
The protestor's stunt came after the Airports Commission backed a third runway at Heathrow which is being considered by the government.
The group also targeted the property of the airport's chief executive John Holland-Kaye.
Veronica Rumsey, who has lived in her house for 43 years said the action was to show "we were here first".
Her neighbour, Neil Keveren, said they  were living without "peace of mind" and he would fight for his property.
He said: "I'm not leaving it and that is all there is to it. If it takes more direct action there will be more direct action."
In July Mr Keveren was fined £600 for blocking the tunnel which leads to Heathrow Airport terminals 1, 2  and 3, but he said "people need to know that we are going to go the whole hog".
Heathrow Airport said it had created a plan which had the local community "at its core" and included a compensation package of more than £1bn for noise insulation and compulsory purchases.
In a statement it said: "The protestors are a small minority...Heathrow expansion will create 40,000 new jobs in London and up to 180,000 jobs and £211bn of economic growth across the country."
John Stewart the chair of the main anti-Heathrow expansion group Hacan said: "This just shows how angry people are.
"The fact that ordinary residents are willing to go to these lengths is a signal of just how difficult it will be for the airport and any government to build a third runway at Heathrow."
