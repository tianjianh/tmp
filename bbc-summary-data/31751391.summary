Firefighters and paramedics were called to Fredrick Road in Gorleston, Norfolk, at 11:00 GMT amid reports of the blast.
A man in his 50s and a woman in her 40s were treated for burns to their arms, upper bodies and face.
Three fire engines and a search and rescue team were called to the scene. An investigation is now underway, the fire service said.
Norfolk deputy fire officer Roy Harold said the building was unsafe and "literally coming apart at the seams".
It was too early to identify a cause of the explosion, he said.
The man and woman, who were taken to nearby James Paget Hospital, were not thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries, he added.
Local resident Kim Aeger said she thought a lorry had crashed on the nearby main road when she heard the explosion.
"I heard a woman screaming," she said.
"I saw her and a man with burns so we called an ambulance.
"The woman was concerned about her cat and a lizard still in the house.
"The whole side of the building had gone and there was a strong smell of gas.
"The wall had collapsed onto the drive next to the house and had damaged a car parked there."
