Ikechi Anya also sent in a dangerous cross for Watford striker Odion Ighalo but he failed to connect.
Graziano Pelle had a rare Saints chance but his angled shot was tipped over the bar by goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes.
Relive Watford's draw against Southampton
To say this was not a classic would be a bit of an understatement as both sides lacked a goal threat and cancelled each other out.
Southampton drew 1-1 in the first leg of a Europa League qualifier at home to Danish side FC Midtjylland on Thursday and lacked an attacking spark, especially after forward Sadio Mane went off injured early on.
Following this performance, Saints manager Ronald Koeman may be concerned at the impact of combining the demands of a domestic season with a European campaign if they qualify for the group phase of the Europa League.
On the plus side, Koeman employed a formation using three centre-backs and his side kept their first clean sheet in nine Premier League games.
The Hornets scored 91 goals in the Championship last season as they achieved promotion but have yet to get off the mark in two home games this campaign.
Chances were at a premium in this game and when they did come the home side's way they lacked the ruthlessness to take them.
Anya twice delivered threatening crosses into the Southampton six-yard box in the first half and the first evaded everyone while the second went through the legs of Ighalo at the far post.
Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores:
"We tried to win but it was impossible. They changed their plan and it was difficult.
"We had maybe two or three chances. It was difficult to create opportunities because they played well and defended with five players."

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman:
"We played a little bit different than the first two games because we had to be defensively better. In my opinion, it always starts at the back and at least we had our first clean sheet of the season.
"One of the key points of last season was that we had a strong defensive organisation."
Southampton's Sadio Mane and Victor Wanyama have been linked with moves to Manchester United and Tottenham respectively but Koeman added: "We know have to deal with speculation over our players.
"Again, no-one is for sale. Everyone stays at Southampton. We want to bring in another defender."
Watford will travel to Preston on Tuesday for a League Cup second-round match. Southampton face a trip to Denmark to play FC Midtjylland in the second leg of their Europa League qualifier on Thursday with the tie poised at 1-1.
