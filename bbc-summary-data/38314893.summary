Lilly-Mae called the emergency line "calmly" after Portia David lost consciousness following an epileptic fit at their Derby home in October.
The youngster, who was given the award at her school assembly, said she was "so happy" to receive it.
Miss David said she was "still in shock", but "very proud" of how Lilly-Mae handled the situation.

Lilly-Mae, from Alvaston, said in the call: "I'm woke my mum up, but she's not waking up. Her head span around and she fell on the wooden floor."
Call handler Andrew Garven, of East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS), replied: "What I need you to do is stay on the phone for me it's really important, okay?"
He said her bravery was "beyond her years".
Miss David said two weeks prior to the incident she had suffered seven epileptic episodes in about an hour, where her heart stopped twice.
"I was really worried after this and kept repeating to Lilly that 'if you can't wake me ring 999'. I never thought it had sunk in", she said.
"The courage she had to leave me, get my phone and call for help, calmly... I'm speechless.
"Santa is going to pay her a really nice visit."
Acting head teacher Louise Knibbs, of Lakeside Community Primary School, said they were "extremely proud" of Lilly-Mae.
"She's a bright and happy little girl, who clearly stayed calm in quite an upsetting circumstance," Ms Knibbs added.
"Thankfully it all turned out well in the end."
EMAS said Lilly-Mae, who is the first child in Derby to receive the award, was a "hero for saving her mum's life".
"The Laverick Award is very special, it is in memory of a brave, loyal and caring paramedic who lost his battle with cancer," the message on Facebook read.
"His colleagues designed the award to commend children and young adults who have demonstrated bravery and selflessness."
