Christopher Tester, 37, from Torquay was wounded during a robbery at his parents' restaurant on Christmas Day.
His sister, Vicky Tester, said her brother was being flown to the neighbouring island of Guadeloupe for specialist treatment.
She said he remained in an induced coma, but his condition was stable.
Friends have set up a fundraising appeal to bring him home, because he did not have travel insurance.
It has now raised more than Â£59,000.
Speaking to the BBC, Miss Tester said her brother had planned to spend three weeks with his parents on the Caribbean island.
Describing him as "placid, laid back and easy going", she said her brother would be "gobsmacked" when he realised how many people had donated money to help him.
Miss Tester first realised something was wrong when she noticed a missed call from her parents early on Boxing Day morning.
ABS Television in Antigua posted a police statement saying masked gunman shot Mr Tester in a struggle during a bid to rob the family.
