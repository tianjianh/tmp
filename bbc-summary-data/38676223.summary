Bruton, 24, has agreed an 18-month extension to her deal that was set to expire in December.
She was named the club's players' player of the year in their first season in WSL 1 and has been part of England's next-gen camps.
"The club's ambition to progress and push on in the WSL made it an easy decision for me," Bruton said.
