[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The operations of the Dyfed-Powys Police Helicopter were taken over by the National Police Air Service at midnight.
The Pembrey base in Carmarthenshire will be retained as a "forward operating base" for now, although aircraft will not be stationed there.
Dyfed-Powys Police's commissioner said it would still mean 24-hour air cover.
The nearest helicopters will now be based at St Athan, in the Vale of Glamorgan and Hawarden in Flintshire.
The new arrangements will cost Â£890,000 a year from January - about Â£275,000 less than in 2014-15.
It come as the local service transfers from forces in Wales and England to the national service.
