Sports car maker TVR has said its new production line could be based in south Wales.

The company confirmed it was looking at a location in the area - one of three sites being considered around the UK.
It comes a week after Aston Martin revealed it would build its new luxury car at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan.
TVR, which has its roots in Blackpool, told BBC Wales it hoped to make a decision on where its new car would be built in "the next few weeks".
A spokesman from TVR said the new manufacturing plant was "likely to be a small, bespoke facility which would aim to begin car production by the end of 2017".
The company has not disclosed where the potential south Wales site is.
