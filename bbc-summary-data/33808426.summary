A group of British trekkers have been airlifted from a remote part of Kashmir after becoming trapped following flash flooding in the Himalayas on Tuesday.

The group of 20 students and two teachers from the Holt School in Wokingham, Berkshire, were trekking in Ladakh when they became trapped.
The evacuation began on Thursday, with the trekkers airlifted in two groups by the Indian Air Force.
The school said everyone in the group was "safe and well".
The UK Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance and was in contact with local authorities for updates.
The group, along with five local staff, had been nearing the end of a three-week expedition to India, said Adventure Lifesigns, which organises outdoor educational programmes for school groups. They had been due to return to the UK on Thursday.
They were rescued close to Leh, in the mountainous Ladakh region, which is part of Indian-administered Kashmir.
Adventure Lifesigns said the team was split into two groups to be airlifted because Ladakh is at high altitude and helicopters in the region can only carry limited numbers.
The company said a lack of light meant the helicopter could not fly the remaining group out on Thursday, but they "have subsequently been picked up and are now back in Leh town".
"Safety is paramount on all of our expeditions. At no time was any of the group in danger. After the heavy rains began, they initially camped near the swollen Markha river and waited for the rains to subside and river levels to drop," Adventure Lifesigns said in a statement on Friday.
"We were in regular contact with the team and they had adequate supplies and camping equipment. Due to their imminent return to the UK, it was decided for speed to air evacuate them back to Leh airport."
Keniesha Mills, 40, from Wokingham, Berkshire, was among those airlifted in the first group.
She said a huge cloudburst caused flash floods when they were returning from a trek on Tuesday.
Suzanne Richards, head teacher at the Holt School, said the group had been in regular contact with the school and parents to reassure and give updates.
"Every effort is now being made to secure flights home for the group," she said.
Several areas in Ladkah - a disputed territory between India and Pakistan that has attracted increasing numbers of adventure tourists in recent years - have suffered flooding in recent days.
