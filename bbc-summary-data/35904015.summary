After three wins out of three, England lead West Indies by two points and will play Australia in the semi-finals if they remain at the top of the group.
Pakistan are third, with one defeat against the second-placed Windies, who play India in their final match.
England captain Charlotte Edwards said: "If we play well we should win but they have played well in the tournament."
England have survived batting collapses to preserve their unbeaten record, beating India by two wickets with an over to spare despite twice losing two in two balls.
Then, against the West Indies, nine wickets fell for 47 before they scraped to victory off the final ball.
"You have got to take the game in isolation because Dharamsala was a completely different wicket to what we are going to face here," Edwards said.
"There are things we can take from the collapses but ultimately we have won two games.
"We are not going to dissect the games and think 'we should have done this, we should have done that'. We won the games and have shown a lot of bottle."
Australia, winners of the last three World T20 tournaments, qualified in second place from Group A behind New Zealand, having lost to the Kiwis by six wickets.
