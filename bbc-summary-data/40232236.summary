Belfast International Airport hopes a fall in the value of the pound can help drive up passenger numbers from the Republic of Ireland.

It is launching a Brexit-themed newspaper and billboard campaign aimed at people who live along the southern side of the border.
The airport says sterling's weakness against the euro means there can be a cost advantage to departing from NI.
The adverts proclaim 'Vote to Leave from Belfast'.
The airport's chief executive Graham Keddie previously criticised Tourism Ireland for not doing enough to promote the international airport.
He said: "We have been seeing a noticeable increase in the number of southern-registered cars in our car parks.
"For many in the southern border region it is easier to drive north than south."
In recent years Dublin Airport has seen its Northern Ireland-based passenger users soar to around 1m a year.
It offers significantly more flights and destinations and Ireland abolished air passenger tax in 2013.
Dublin Airport is one of the fastest growing in Europe.
Its 28m passengers a year is more than five times that of Belfast International.
