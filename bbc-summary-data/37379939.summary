A Syrian couple living in Scotland after fleeing the war-torn country fearing their son was dead have pleaded to be reunited with him.

Abedul Karou and his wife escaped Syria earlier this year after being told nine-year-old son Mohamed had been killed in a bombing raid.
They later discovered the youngster was alive - but all borders have been closed and Mohamed is trapped.
Mr Karou, now living in Penicuik, said he just wants to hug and kiss his son.
The Home Office has said Mohamed must have a DNA test to prove he is the couple's son before he can be brought to the UK.
But there are no test centres in Syria due to the devastating civil war, and the nearest are in neighbouring countries which have closed their borders to Syria.
Prime Minister Theresa May has now vowed that the case will be looked at.
Mr Karou said: "My sister sent me a picture and I saw him and cried, because he has no clothes.
"He's not eating well because there is no food of course. I don't know if he's being covered in the night - how he sleeps, how he eats, how he's living. We don't know."
The family were separated after a bombing attack in Homs, in the west of Syria.
Mr Karou said: "My mind was saying he is dead but there was something, a small light of hope in my heart, that he was still alive. Unless I see his dead body I wouldn't believe he had died."
He said he was "very happy" when he learned his son was alive but was very worried for him now.
Mr Karou said his son was in a "miserable situation" and is concerned he may be kidnapped by jihadis and trained by them.
Midlothian MP Owen Thompson has now written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd to ask her to help after receiving an assurance from Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions that the case would be looked at.
He said: "This family have gone through an unimaginable amount of pain: from finding out that their son is still alive to the agony and frustration of the last six months trying to get Mohamed out of Syria.
"A Red Cross chaperone has been offered to take Mohamed across the border but the Home Office has advised against this because it is just too dangerous. This little boy is in an extremely vulnerable position and urgently needs our help to ensure that he can be reunited with his family in Scotland.
"In light of the exceptional circumstances in this case, I call on the Home Secretary to take immediate action to remove Mohamed from the imminent danger he faces."
Mr Karou added: "When I came here and when I see people, communities start talking about my case and they try to open a big conversation about it, my hope is getting bigger and I really feel happy now.
"It's like every father who is responsible for a family. He wants to see a complete, happy family. He wants to get back after a long day and see a complete family waiting for him. He wants to hug him he wants to kiss him."
