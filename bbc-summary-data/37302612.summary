They finished the competition in Rio with 147 medals in Rio - 27 more than they won in London.
It is also the first time since 1988 that Great Britain has won more than 50 gold medals at a Paralympics.
The team's target - set by UK Sport - was 121 medals, which has been achieved.
ParalympicsGB finished third in the medal table at their home games four years ago, behind Russia and China.
Russia do not have a team in Rio after the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) applied a blanket ban on their athletes competing, following a report which found evidence of widespread doping across Russian sport.
