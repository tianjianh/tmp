BBC Radio Lincolnshire's Charlotte Wright collapsed while jogging in the uphill area of Lincoln in November.
Steve Race and Josie Vincent, described by Mrs Wright as a "hero and heroine",  did CPR until medics arrived.
The station is working with LIVES and St John Ambulance to provide free training sessions.
Those wanting to get involved can email savealife@bbc.co.uk and will receive an automated response with further information.
Mrs Wright said: "Six months ago, two strangers saw me lying on a pavement and got out of their cars to help.
"When they realised I was having a cardiac arrest, they started CPR and literally brought me back to life."
"Most people who suffer a cardiac arrest don't survive - this is a sobering fact I think about every day," she added.
She has urged everyone to get trained and said "it's so simple and could save someone's life."
Campaign organiser Lucy Parry said: "We were all so shocked about what happened to Charlotte, and just relieved that someone was there to help her.
"Her experience inspired us to start this campaign."
Recent statistics show only one in 10 people survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
