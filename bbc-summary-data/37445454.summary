[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers from the Metropolitan Police Service Counter Terrorism Command detained the man in a street in the city on Thursday afternoon.
He is being questioned on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Two properties in the city are also being searched.
Police said the arrest was pre-planned and was as a result of an investigation by the MPS Counter Terrorism Command supported by the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit.
There was police activity in the Grangetown and Riverside areas of Cardiff on Thursday afternoon but Metropolitan Police refused to confirm if it was linked to the arrest.
The BBC understands the arrest is related to alleged Islamist terrorism.
