[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Williams is on track for a Scarlets comeback against Connacht eight days before Wales' Six Nations campaign starts against Ireland.

Scarlets face Connacht in Galway on 30 January, with Wales' trip to follow on Sunday, 7 February
Williams sustained a foot injury during the Rugby World Cup in October and has not played since.
"He trained during the week with us and trained very well," said Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac.
"He's passed all the tests so far, so it's all looking good for him to get some game time next week."
Williams is expected to spend two days in the Wales training camp early this week before returning to Scarlets ahead of the Pro12 trip to Galway.
Pivac does not expect to have any other Wales squad players available to him as his team bids to stay top of the table.
The west Wales region finished without a win in the European Champions Cup for the third time after their 22-10 home defeat by Northampton.
Wales and former Scarlets wing George North scored the Saints' bonus point try.
But Pivac says they switched focus after the first couple of rounds.
"You could see early on in that competition that our focus was the Pro12, it was just unfortunate with what happened in the Rugby World Cup [injuries to Liam and Scott Williams] and then injuries we picked up ourselves.
"When you get to Europe, the depths of the squads vary and we don't quite have the depth that some of these sides have.
"The results speak for themselves really."
The Scarlets had 14 senior players on the injury list for the Northampton defeat, with every position apart from half-back affected.
They will now lose scrum-halves Gareth and Aled Davies, as well as front-rowers Ken Owens and Samson Lee, to Wales training duties.
Flanker John Barclay will also be absent on Scotland duty when the Six Nations kicks off.
