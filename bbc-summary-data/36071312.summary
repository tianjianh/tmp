Southend United: Dan Bentley to 'weigh up' contract options

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend goalkeeper Dan Bentley says he needs to "weigh up" his future with his contract expiring in the summer.

Bentley, subject to interest from QPR last summer, has made 159 appearances for the League One side.
"My agent and I are in talks with Southend and they'll be making an offer to me," the 22-year-old told BBC Essex.
"I've got to weigh up my situation. I want to play at the highest level and I'm sure any player, if they get the chance to do that, will do so."
He continued: "I have really high aspirations and am a really motivated person. If you ask anybody they'll say the same thing. If they get the chance to play at the highest level, they'll take it."
Bentley broke a club record with 12 consecutive home clean sheets last season, helping the club earn promotion via the League Two play-offs, with the keeper's save from Wycombe's Sam Wood in a penalty shootout at Wembley sending them up.
Bentley was in goal against Walsall on Saturday as Jordy Hiwula scored an 88th-minute winner for the Saddlers, a result that saw Phil Brown's side drop to 13th in the table.
The Shrimpers had been within touching distance of the play-off places for much of the campaign, but are now nine points off with four games to go.
"It's something we hadn't foreseen ourselves. I never expected us to fall away in the way we have," said Bentley.
"Our inconsistencies have meant that that's happened. It's really disappointing because we've been there or thereabouts most of the season and at the final hurdle we've not taken our consistency over the line."
