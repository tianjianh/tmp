[SN]TITLE[SN]
Willard Wigan's microscopic artworks exhibited in Birmingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Birmingham sculptor, whose works are so small they can only be viewed through a microscope, is holding an exhibition in his home city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Willard Wigan, 57, a micro-sculptor, creates pieces that sit within the eye of a needle or on a pin-head.
An exhibition of his works is being held at the Library of Birmingham from 11 January.
Mr Wigan, who is also a patron of the Â£189m library, said the works were borne from his "fantasy world".
The artist said he first became interested in micro-sculpture aged five when he began making houses for ants because he thought they needed somewhere to live.
His works include miniature versions of athlete Usain Bolt, a hummingbird and cartoon characters Pinocchio and Cinderella.
The sculptor was awarded an MBE for services to art in 2007.
Explaining his decision to support the library, which opened in 2013, Mr Wigan said: "Literacy and learning initiatives can support, encourage, challenge and enhance [children], whatever their abilities.
"These initiatives are even more important in Birmingham where literacy levels are amongst the lowest in the country."
Part of the proceeds from the exhibition will support community programmes operated by the library.
