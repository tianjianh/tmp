Manchester United: Eric Bailly could have Uefa ban extended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United's Eric Bailly could have his European ban extended after Uefa opened disciplinary proceedings over his red card against Celta Vigo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ivory Coast defender, 23, was dismissed after a brawl in the final minutes of United's Europa League semi-final aggregate victory on Thursday.
A direct red card carries a one-match ban - which means he will miss the final - but Uefa will determine whether to extend that at a hearing on 20 July.
His case does not qualify for appeal.
European football's governing body only overturns decisions made by the referee in cases of mistaken identity.
Bailly was sent off for a swipe at Celta's former Manchester City striker John Guidetti, with Facundo Roncaglia dismissed for retaliating.
Speaking on Friday, manager Jose Mourinho said Bailly would play in the club's three remaining Premier League fixtures to "give a rest to some of the others".
United play Dutch side Ajax in the Europa League final on Wednesday, 24 May. Victory would guarantee a place in next season's Champions League.
The club's final game of the domestic season is at home against Crystal Palace, three days before the match in Stockholm.
