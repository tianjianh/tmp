The Northern Ireland golfer recorded birdies at the fifth, ninth and 18th hole during his closing round of the PGA Tour event on Sunday.
Bogeys at the first, seventh, 12th and 16th marred his round however as he fell away to end on seven under par.
American Jim Furyk beat Kevin Kisner in a play-off to win the tournament.
McDowell began the event strongly, tying for the lead after the opening day thanks to an impressive 66.
The Portrush man followed that up by signing for rounds of 69 and 70 to lie joint 10th going into the final day.
Jim Furyk earned his first PGA Tour win since 2010 after he beat fellow American Kisner in added holes.
Furyk, 44, started the final day four shots behind overnight leader Troy Merritt on 10 under.
But a final eight-under round of 63 took him into a play-off, where he defeated Kisner after two extra holes.
Masters champion Jordan Spieth, 21, finished tied 11th on 10 under after a closing round of 70.
