Police Scotland launched an appeal to trace Jaden Rogerson, 14, and Ben Adair, 15, after they failed to turn up at their schools on Thursday morning.
They were later reported to have bought a tent in Dumfries.
On Saturday police said officers traced the pair "during the night". They thanked everyone who helped in the search.
