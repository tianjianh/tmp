[SN]TITLE[SN]
More time may be given for Peelhouses data centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A proposed internet data centre in south-west Scotland could be given an extension to its planning consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plan for Peelhouses Farm, north of Lockerbie, first emerged in 2008. Planning permission was granted in 2010.
The project has remained on the drawing board despite permission being renewed in 2013.
Officials at Dumfries and Galloway Council have recommended a further three-year extension.
When the scheme first emerged, there was a promise of an Â£800m investment and the creation of thousands of jobs.
Backers pledged to turn the site into an "international hub for the internet age".
Initially the scheme also included a major housing development but those proposals were subsequently dropped.
The latest plans include a data centre, technology park, horticultural research facility and visitor centre.
The request for planning permission to be extended by a further three years was submitted by consultants Blackmores D Limited.
No objections have been lodged.
