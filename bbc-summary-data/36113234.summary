[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former head teacher Clifford Stott found not guilty of abusing boys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former primary school head teacher has been found not guilty of abusing two boys during the 1970s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clifford Stott, 69, of Rise Road, Skirlaugh, East Yorkshire, was cleared of eight historical sexual offences by a jury at Hull Crown Court.
He had denied indecently assaulting former pupils of Paull Primary School and Sproatley Endowed School.
Mr Stott left the court with his family, who cheered and cried as the jury delivered its verdict.
During the trial, several character witnesses paid tribute to Mr Stott describing him as "an excellent teacher", "an inspiration" and "a Christian in the true sense".
Mr Stott previously said the three years since his arrest had been "the most difficult of my life" and that "huge parts" of his life had changed.
The court heard he was made head teacher at the age of 28 and was one of the youngest heads in the country at the time.
