The 19-year-old defender has agreed a two-year deal with the Reds, with the option of a further year.
"He still has a lot to work on but we think he has a lot of potential," head coach Dermot Drummy said.
"He has a wonderful opportunity to progress his career. He's one for the future but I'm sure he will be looking to play his part this season as well."
Garnett, who did not feature for QPR's first team, is Crawley's 14th signing of the summer.
