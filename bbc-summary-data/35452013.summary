US presidential race: NYT endorses Clinton and Kasich

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The New York Times has endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican John Kasich in their bids to become their parties' presidential candidates.

Ms Clinton, the liberal daily said in an editorial, is "one of the most broadly and deeply qualified candidates" in modern history.
An outsider in the Republican race, the NYT called Mr Kasich the "only plausible choice".
The backing comes days before Iowa voters become first to make their pick.
The endorsement of Ms Clinton from one of the top-selling titles in the US is no surprise; the NYT backed the former secretary of state in her losing bid for the presidency against Barack Obama in 2008.
The NYT had praise for Ms Clinton's main rival, Bernie Sanders, but the paper said he "does not have the breadth of experience or policy ideas that Mrs Clinton offers".
Assessing the Republican field, Saturday's editorial gave a damning verdict on the two leading contenders.
Frontrunner Donald Trump "has neither experience in nor interest in learning about national security, defence or global trade", the paper said. Ted Cruz "will say anything to win".
Instead, the NYT plumped for Ohio Governor John Kasich as "the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race".
Mr Kasich tweeted he was "proud" to gain the NYT's support, which may be something of a mixed blessing given that the paper has been a frequent focus of criticism for US conservatives.
