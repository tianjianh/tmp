The BBC Weather Centre said many areas could see up to 3cm (1.2in) of snow on Sunday night, with up to 15cm (6in)  on the Scottish mountains.
The Pennines, the Peak District and parts of North Yorkshire are also expected to be affected.
Drivers are being warned to watch out for ice across most of the UK.
Temperatures fell to -6C in many parts of Britain on Saturday night, from central Scotland through to Cumbria and Buckinghamshire.
It was particularly chilly at Loch Glascarnoch, in Ross and Cromarty, where an overnight temperature of -8.2C was recorded. And -7.3C was the temperature at Eskdalemuir, Dumfriesshire.
The Met Office has issued a low-level severe weather warning across most of Scotland, north and east England, and north Wales, because of the freezing temperatures and snow fall.
BBC Weather has yellow warnings of ice for eastern areas of England and Scotland, parts of northern England, Northern Ireland and north Wales on Sunday morning.
BBC Weather forecaster Holly Green said most of the UK would have a "dry, bright day in store", although it would remain cold, and scattered showers would spread across from the east to the west, bringing rain to northern Ireland, south-west England and Wales.
However, rain reaching western areas later on Sunday is expected to turn to snow across parts of Scotland and northern England.
Our forecaster said the areas most at risk of heavy snowfall were places like the Grampians, the Pennines, the Peak District and the North York Moors, where up to 15cm (6in) could be expected.
Lower levels would probably experience "slush accumulations", she said.
And the end of the cold snap is still not in sight, with the freezing temperatures due to last into next week.

On Saturday, light snowfall was reported in Cumbria, Teesside and County Durham, the Pennines and the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Up to an inch (25mm) of snow settled in some areas. Two Scottish ski resorts have been able to open for business this weekend.
Almost 30 flood warnings are still in place in England and Wales after heavy rain and winds battered parts of Britain earlier in the week.
Three people died in the storms, and hundreds of households are continuing the clean-up process in the aftermath of flooding, which hit parts of England and Wales.
The AA has warned drivers to be careful in the cold weather.
Patroller Andy Smith said: "This weekend will be winter's first serious test for drivers and their cars.
"Ice is the real concern, as it's been so wet recently, and it's very hard to distinguish between a puddle on the road and treacherous black ice."
The light covering of snow in parts of the UK has already prompted a flurry of bets on a white Christmas, according to bookmakers Ladbrokes.
