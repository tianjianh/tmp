He told a news conference on Monday that Northern Ireland would be "collateral damage" in the time ahead.
Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that she would trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017.
But Mr McGuinness said Northern Ireland would suffer economically and politically.
Mrs May told the Tory Party conference - her first as prime minister - the government would strike a deal with the EU as an "independent, sovereign" UK.
In the wake of her comments, sterling has fallen to a three-year low.
On Sunday, politicians in Northern Ireland gave their reaction to Mrs May's announcement.
