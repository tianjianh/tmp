Bees have been stolen from an Anglesey farm for the second time in the past month.

Three queen bees and 30,000 bees were taken from three hives on the outskirts of Cemaes Bay, between 30 July and 4 August.
And in the early hours of Thursday, about half that amount including a queen bee were stolen.
Katie Hayward, from Felin Honey Bees, said she was "absolutely devastated" and extra security would be needed.
"Beekeeping itself has become quite a popular hobby," she told BBC Wales.
"The nucleus of bees - which is what they've taken - is a small amount of bees with the queen.
"They are quite valuable, quite sought after and it's a quick ??170-180. You put those bees in a new hive, people can ask ??400 or ??500 for it. It's lucrative."
