French press sees IS 'war' brought to Paris

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
French newspapers have reacted with defiance to last night's attacks in Paris which left more than 120 people dead.

Commentators are in little doubt that bloodshed was a response to the country's support for operations against the so-called Islamic State group, which has since said it carried out the attack.
But the overriding message is that the attacks should not force France to alter its behaviour, either at home or overseas.
Editorial in Liberation:
"Even during the fiercest battles linked to the Algerian civil war in the nineties, France has never seen such a degree of violence. It is France, its policy, its international role that are targeted by the killers... It is impossible not to link these events to the battles that are taking place in the Middle East. France plays its role there. It must unblinkingly continue its action."
Front page of Le Parisien:
"This time, it is a war"
Le Figaro:
"Eleven months after the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, France once gain plunges into horror. The worst-case scenario, feared by the special services, the one of a multiple attack striking at the heart of Paris as well as a highly symbolic venue, became the reality on Friday night."
"Being part of the anti-Islamic State coalition for over two years, France focused its strikes on Iraq and decided to deploy its aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in the Gulf in December. A declaration of war to which the terrorists responded with scenes of Apocalypse."
Le Monde, under the headline "Heavy heart, cool head":
"The terrorists will strike again: the means that they used today did not disappear with the heroic assault of our police in Bataclan... we will have to organise ourselves in the long-term, and not cease to function as free, creative and open societies. Permanently closing the living spaces of our cities would seal the victory of the terrorists. We must learn to live with danger, rather than cowering in misfortune or taking the easy option in dealing with the complexities of the Middle East."
Les Echos:
"By putting pressure on France to stop its intervention in Syria, the jihadists obviously seek to get the same result as al-Qaeda when it hit Spain in March 2004 (191 killed), punishing the country for its intervention in Iraq together with the USAâ€¦ A short while later, Spain's Socialist Party decided to stop military operations in Iraqâ€¦ Since then, Spain has not been targeted, although it is not possible to establish whether this was a decision taken by al-Qaeda, the result of the work of Spain's anti-terrorist police or the difficulty to plot large-scale attacks."
Sports newspaper L'Equipe:
"Security has already been the biggest concern of the European Championships. After yesterday's attacks and the attacks in January, fears have reached a peak."
