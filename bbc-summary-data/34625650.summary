Taiwan Championship: Charley Hull five shots behind Lydia Ko

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Charley Hull slipped to third at the Fubon LPGA Taiwan Championship after a one-under-par third-round 71.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hull, 19, is five shots behind the leader, New Zealand's Lydia Ko, who went sub-70 for the third successive round with a 68.
Hull's triple-bogey seven on the 10th, her only dropped shots of the round, cost her badly as she was two shots clear at the time.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew shot a 68 to move up the leaderboard into fifth.
