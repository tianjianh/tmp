Georgie Hankins spoke to six men while volunteering at Northampton's Hope Centre, which helps vulnerable people.
The 21-year-old Northampton university graduate said she was "overwhelmed" by their stories.
Ambrose Doherty, one of those photographed, said of her work that "each face shows the struggles".
"There are some smiles here and there on the faces of those photographed, but each face shows the struggles we have gone through," he said.
"When you are homeless you are invisible, but Georgie had a vision to make the silent speak."
He volunteers at the centre and has been homeless for 12 of his past 25 years.
Ms Hankins said she took the photos during her seven months at the centre to give "a different perspective of the homeless".
"I was able to find out about their lives, and was really overwhelmed by their stories."
Exhibitions of Ms Hankins' photos have been held at both the university and Brick Lane in London.
