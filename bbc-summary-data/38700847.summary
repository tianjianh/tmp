Bury 3-3 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall fought back from 2-0 down only to concede a stoppage-time equaliser as they drew a thrilling League One encounter 3-3 at Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In-form striker James Vaughan gave the hosts a 22nd-minute lead before Reece Brown scored a 45th-minute free-kick from around 40 yards.
Bury were stunned by three goals in eight minutes through Erhun Oztumer and a Jason McCarthy brace, but Tom Soares pounced at the death to deny Walsall a third straight win.
Tom Pope and Amadou Bakayoko had gone close at each end before Pope crossed for Vaughan to slide in his 17th goal of the season - and seventh in three games.
Neil Etheridge then saved a Pope header and blocked the striker's follow-up, while Bury's Rob Lainton saved a Bakayoko shot.
But Bury doubled their lead as Brown's free-kick caught Etheridge off his line and flew into the top corner.
The Shakers eased off in the second half, though, and Walsall made them pay. Matt Preston had a shot blocked on the line and Lainton denied Isaiah Osbourne from the rebound.
But Oztumer hit a 20-yard free-kick into the bottom corner on 71 minutes to spark the Saddlers' fightback.
Five minutes later, McCarthy fired home from Bakayoko's cut-back before the Southampton loanee headed home from Osbourne's cross.
Soares then glanced in Brown's cross to rescue a point but Bury remain in the relegation zone.
