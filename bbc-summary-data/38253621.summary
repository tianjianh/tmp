[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa and Leicester City are likely to be investigated by the Football Association in its inquiry into historical child sex abuse.

How much the clubs knew about the actions of former scout Ted Langford is said to fall within the inquiry's terms of reference, the Times reported.
He was jailed in 2007 for abusing four young players in the 70s and 80s. He died in 2012.
More than 50 clubs are potentially linked to the investigation.
The Times reported Langford was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court for abusing boys while he was a scout for both clubs.
A spokesman for Aston Villa said: "The club co-operated fully with the authorities during the investigation at that time."
A Leicester spokesman added: "We take the current matter very seriously. At present, however, we have no indication of any allegations made against or in relation to Leicester City Football Club.
"We will, of course, investigate fully in the event any further information comes to light."
The FA would not comment on whether Langford's crimes formed part of the investigation.
However, its internal review is considering what "steps" were taken by "clubs identified as linked to alleged sexual abusers took at the time of any incidents," and "what that club did or did not know and/or did or did not do in relation to child sexual abuse".
Langford, who lived in Perry Barr, Birmingham, was jailed for three years.
He worked as a scout for Dunlop Terriers, a feeder club to Aston Villa.
