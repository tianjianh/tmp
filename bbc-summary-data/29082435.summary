Khalida Mahmood and Muzaffar Mahmood spoke of their shock at Aqsa's apparent radicalisation.
She is thought to have travelled through Turkey in November 2013.
In the broadcast with the US network CNN, they insisted her upbringing reflected their moderate views.
Her father said: "She was the best daughter we could have. We don't know what happened to her.
"We told her there was nothing wrong with prayer or reading the Koran."
Aqsa Mahmood attended the private Craigholme School in Glasgow before going on to university.
Muzaffar Mahmood added: "We are a moderate Muslim family and it was a big shock for us.
"Her last message was that 'I will see you on the day of judgement... I will take you to heaven, I will hold your hand,' that's what she said. 'I will become a martyr.'"
Aqsa contacted her parents after arriving in Syria and had kept in touch through social media until Tuesday, when newspapers reported her involvement with IS.
Comments attributed to Aqsa Mahmood on Twitter called on people in Britain to repeat terrorist atrocities seen in Woolwich and the US.
Her mother Khalida recorded a message in the hope that Aqsa may see it broadcast.
She said: "My dear daughter, please come back. I'm missing you so much. Your brothers and sisters miss you a lot.
"My dearest daughter, in the name of Allah, please come home. I love you."
