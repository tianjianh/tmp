[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falling roof panels at Manchester Victoria railway station was a result of damage caused by a bird, an investigation has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two people received minor injuries in October when panels above platforms one and two caved in.
The station unveiled a £44m upgrade in October 2015, including the £20m roof.
Network Rail said the reporting of faults with Northern Rail was a factor in the roof not being repaired before the incident.
Network Rail said it has "revaluated communication channels" with Northern when logging faults to ensure there is no repeat of the incident.
