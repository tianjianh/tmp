Solihull Moors 1-0 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Daly's fourth-minute header was enough to secure victory for Solihull Moors as they maintained their unbeaten start to the season at home to pointless Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daly got on the end of a Jordan Gough cross to score the only goal of the game, but Moors goalkeeper Danny Lewis then came to the rescue to preserve his side's lead.
He made a close-range save to deny Blair Turgott before the loose ball was cleared to safety.
The visitors' best chance of an equaliser came in the second half when midfielder Joe Anderson fizzed in a cross that just needed a touch.
Bromley have now lost their opening three games to sit bottom of the table, while Solihull are up to third, having taken seven points from a possible nine.
