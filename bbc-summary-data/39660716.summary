A storytelling app, Traces, has been launched at St Fagans National History Museum.
The bilingual app focuses on characters who might "have lived and experienced" the castle and grounds in the early 20th Century.
The project hopes to offer visitors to the museum "something different".
Traces is a partnership between Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, Cardiff University, and Cardiff Bay-based company Yello Brick.
Dafydd James, head of digital media at National Museum Wales, said: "We hope it captures the visitors' imaginations."
