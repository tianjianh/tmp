Town could name the same XI that started the second leg of their semi-final win over Sheffield Wednesday.
Chelsea loanee Kasey Palmer (hamstring) may be a surprise squad inclusion after missing the past three months.
Reading will hope Jordan Obita (ankle) is available after missing the semi-final second leg against Fulham.
Garath McCleary (hamstring) will push for a start after being on the bench in that 1-0 win.
The two sides finished fifth and third respectively in the regular season and were separated by four points.
Huddersfield are bidding to return to English football's top flight for the first time since 1972, while if Jaap Stam's side are victorious at Wembley, it would see them return to the Premier League after a four-season absence.

Huddersfield head coach David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds:
"I think everybody expected Fulham and Sheffield Wednesday in the final.
"There were a lot of statements before the semi-finals about momentum and about form. It is another example where we have proven that experience and what has happened in the past is irrelevant.
"After the 120 minutes against Sheffield Wednesday there were a lot of tired legs, but now after a training camp in Portugal and training on the grass here, everybody is ready to go."

Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"You've always got ideals as a manager that you want to go for the best results or finish as high as you can, but to end up in the top 10 would have been a good season for us.
"It's a very big and important game, but the players know what they need to do. Everyone's quite calm within the team and there's experienced players there.
"Times like this are probably easiest for a manager, as you don't need to say a lot as a manager as everybody knows what they need to do to win that game and everybody knows what's at stake."
Paul Ogden, BBC Radio Leeds
Huddersfield Town still have some very fresh memories of play-off triumphs, from both Wembley and Cardiff, but the Championship play-off final? It's something we usually watch others do, en route to our half-term beach.
This Wembley weekend has upgraded rapidly in fans' minds, from a possible end-of-season-bonus to something that now should result in regular appearances on Match of The Day next season.
Reading are a respected opponent, similar to Huddersfield in their organisation and desire to keep the ball to themselves all day long, if at all possible.
But as the only play-off participant to have been defeated by Huddersfield during the regular season, the Royals have been regarded throughout as more desirable than free-scoring Fulham or, until the semi-final, indomitable Sheffield Wednesday.
After a season dominated by nail-biting victories (22 of Huddersfield's 25 regular-season wins were by a single goal margin), it is so very Huddersfield to reach Wembley by a penalty shoot-out, and then mysteriously re-introduce cherished Chelsea loanee Kasey Palmer to the squad, during a post-semi-final warm weather training camp.
The thought of Chelsea's borrowed flair-pair Izzy Brown and Palmer, plus a German leading scorer called Elias Kachunga, running free across Wembley in Huddersfield Town colours, will keep all Terriers fans awake with excitement until Monday.
That image, like so many others from a breathtaking season, carry the same likely subtitle; it could be a while before Huddersfield Town fans see anything like this again.

Anyone who says they knows who will win this game is guessing - it's far too tight to call.
With 1-0 home wins in the fixtures between these two sides in the regular league season, and only four points separating the two teams over the 46 games, the stats back that up.
The two teams have reached the most valuable game in football in a similar manner. Reading finished 17th last season, and Huddersfield were two places below them.
They have both gone for relatively untried European managers in their mid-40s, who brought in a dozen new players last summer. They both have distinctive possession-based tactical approaches to the game.
Statistically, tactically, and managerially there is little difference, leaving us with the mental toughness of the players.
The team that best copes with the stress of the big occasion, the huge crowd and the enormous consequences of success or failure will inevitably be the ones playing in the Premier League next season.
