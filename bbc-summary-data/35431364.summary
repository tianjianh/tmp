Exeter Chiefs: Whitten, Taione, Short & Welch sign new deals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Whitten, Elvis Taione and James Short have agreed new two-year deals with Exeter, while lock Damian Welch has penned a new one-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Ireland and Ulster centre Whitten, 28, has played 66 league games since joining in 2012, while hooker Taione, 32, has made 11 league appearances.
Wing Short, 26, has made nine Premiership appearances since his summer move from London Irish.
Welch, 33, is likely to miss the rest of this season with a pectoral injury.
Head coach Rob Baxter said: "Obviously we're really pleased to announce that the four guys have signed new deals.
"Each of them are very important members of the squad and we're delighted that they want to be part of things moving forward.
"In recent weeks Whitts, Shorty and Elvis have shown some fantastic form, while Damo was probably enjoying his best-ever season with us until he got injured.
"That was obviously disappointing for him and for us, but the good thing is he's well into his rehab programme now and it's almost like he's having another pre-season programme and that will enable him to come back even stronger."
