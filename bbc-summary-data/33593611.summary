Edenilson Steven Valle's body was found floating in the pool on Sunday. The star - who was away at the time - said this was an "unthinkable tragedy".
Mr Valle , 21, is believed to have been a member of the household staff. Relatives reportedly told investigators he could not swim.
It is thought he may have fallen into the pool during a party.
Moore, 52, said in a statement: "My heart goes out to this young man's family and friends."
Los Angeles County coroner's Fred Corral said Mr Valle, had been missing for 10 or 15 minutes before his friends found him floating in the deep end of the pool early on Sunday morning.
Emergency crews were called to the house in the city's Beverly Crest neighbourhood. Paramedics treated the man but he was pronounced dead at the scene.
Demi Moore bought the house together with her former husband Ashton Kutcher. She was once the highest paid actress in Hollywood.
