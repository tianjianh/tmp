David Anderson strangled 36-year-old Louise O'Brien in Perth's Dunkeld Road, following a row over making some food.
The High Court in Glasgow heard Ms O'Brien was found dead in her bed with a heart-shaped chocolate beside her.
Anderson - who had faced a murder charge - was jailed for six years after admitting the reduced charge of culpable homicide.
Lord Boyd said Anderson was "clearly in love" with Ms O'Brien and that only he knew "what exactly happened" between the couple.
The judge added he found it "chilling" Anderson had used his dead partner's phone to message her son after the attack.
Prosecutor Bernard Ablett said the exact date of Ms O'Brien's death was not known.
She was last spotted on 24 April, but discovered dead on 28 April.
During that time, Anderson called in sick to work claiming he had an upset stomach. He was also spotted walking alone in Perth city centre.
The court was told that he had made a series of web searches including: "If you are accused of murder, are you automatically put in prison?"
On the day that Ms O'Brien's body was found, Anderson contacted his mother to tell her: "I've done something terrible and I've been unable to deal with it mentally for days.
"I tried to hurt myself because I could not deal with it.
"I don't want to tell you, but it'll come out anyway. I have broken the law. It is very serious."
Mr Ablett told the court: "A chocolate sweet wrapped in red foil and in the shape of a heart was found on the bed beside the body."
Louise's mobile phone was later checked and a number of messages to her son were found.
The advocate depute said: "It is suspected that Anderson was responsible for sending these texts to give the appearance that Louise was still alive."
Anderson's lawyer Brian McConnachie described the case as a "tragedy" for all concerned.
