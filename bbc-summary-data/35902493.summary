[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 0-1 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Tonge's late penalty earned Stevenage victory at Luton and moved them nine points clear of the League Two relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The experienced midfielder slotted home to end a six-game winless run after Olly Lee was adjudged to have tripped Ben Kennedy in the area.
Luton's Alan Sheehan curled a second-half shot against the crossbar.
But their best chance was wasted by Jack Marriott when he was denied by keeper Jamie Jones when one-on-one.
Luton remain mid-table, while Stevenage now seem all but safe in League Two, with York and Dagenham & Redbridge running out of matches to close the gap.
