[SN]TITLE[SN]
Unite and GMB to consult members on offshore pay deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Unite and GMB unions are to consult their members on a new pay deal from the Offshore Contractors Association (OCA).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Late last year members of both unions rejected an offer, claiming the proposals involved no wages increase and no changes to the conditions of contractors.
The OCA is now proposing a 2% increase in basic and sick pay.
A consultative ballot is expected to take place over the next month.
Last July, hundreds of North Sea workers went on strike over plans to cut their pay and allowances.
The action was taken by members of the RMT and Unite unions employed by the Wood Group on Shell platforms.
It was the first industrial action of its kind in the offshore oil and gas industry in almost 30 years.
