Helen Habblett claimed to be living as a single mother after separating from her husband in 2009.
However, Dundee Sheriff Court heard the couple reunited the following year and her husband was in full-time employment.
Social media profiles, bank records and covert surveillance confirmed the couple were living together.
The court heard that Habblett told the Department for Work and Pensions and HMRC that she was still a single mother and fraudulently claimed £48,792.75 in tax credits and £7,603.50 in income support.
Depute fiscal Eilidh Robertson told the court: "She claimed child and working tax credits in 2003 and in 2009 informed HMRC that she had separated from her husband and was living solely with her children.
"In 2011 and 2013 she confirmed there were no changes.
"She claimed for income support in 2009 and again stated she was living only with her children."
Miss Robertson said confidential information was received that Habblett had reunited with her husband, prompting an investigation.
She said: "Examination of bank records, employment records, Facebook profiles and car insurance applications suggested she was in fact co-habiting with him.
"Interviews with neighbours and surveillance further suggested they were living together."
Habblett, 51, pled guilty to charges under the Tax Credits Act and Social Security Administration Act, committed between September 2010 and July 2014.
Defence solicitor Jim Caird said: "She has a family of five children and has never been in trouble before."
Sheriff Alastair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports and released Habblett on bail.
