[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Indian woman faces being separated from her two children who are pupils at a Highlands primary school because of an issue with her visa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gloria Macleod, who is married to a Scot working in Dubai, faces deportation from the UK on Saturday.
The Macleods set up a family home in Dingwall in July and the couple's children attend a local school.
The Home Office says she does not have the correct visa, but is considering representations related to her case.
Ian Blackford, SNP MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, is in talks with the Home Office about Mrs Macleod's situation, which would see her daughters left in the care of elderly grandparents if she is deported.
Mrs Macleod is an Indian passport holder whose husband Robert was born and brought up in Dingwall, but currently works in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
In July, the couple and their children Siobhan, 11, and Meaghan, 10, who are British citizens, travelled from UAE to Scotland to set up a family home in Dingwall.
The children were enrolled in a local school.
Mrs Macleod holds a UK C - visit passport. It was issued by the British Consulate in Abu Dhabi in December 2009 and valid for 10 years.
To allow her to stay with her children in Dingwall, Mrs Macleod and her husband made an application to stay in the UK while Mr Macleod continued to work in Dubai.
Mr Blackford said the Macleods were advised by the Visa Office, acting on behalf of the UK Immigration Service, that this application had to be lodged in person in Dubai after which she would be able to return to the UK.
However, the MP said that on her recent return, after lodging the appropriate application as advised, she was refused entry to the UK.
Mr Blackford said that this refusal was despite her having a pending application for an entry clearance to care for her children and holding a valid visa.
Mrs Macleod was granted temporary admission, on condition that she is deported to Dubai on 1 October.
Mr Blackford said: "The family clearly want to live in Mr Macleod's home town and he intends to return at every opportunity to be with his wife and daughters.
"He has a good job in Dubai and it is quite understandable that he wants to continue with this to support his family."
A Home Office spokesman said: "A visitor visa cannot be used to enter the UK for the purpose of permanent residence.
"It is the responsibility of those seeking to enter the country to ensure they hold the correct type of visa.
"Mrs Macleod was granted temporary admission to the UK and we are considering further representations in relation to her case."
