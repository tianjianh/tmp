Bristol Rovers 2-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers climbed into the League One play-off zone as they came from behind to beat Fleetwood Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers trailed to a fourth-minute strike when Ashley Hunter's angled right-foot shot found the top left corner.
But Matty Taylor headed home Daniel Leadbitter's cross on 61 minutes to level.
And Leadbitter was again the supply line when Cristian Montano shot home right footed to win the game on 73 minutes.
Rovers, who have lost just twice in 13 games, stand fifth in the table, having risen three places, now four points above 10th-placed Fleetwood.
Fleetwood's livewire strikers Hunter and Chris Long caused Rovers plenty of problems in the first half, both having efforts saved.
But, at the other end, Taylor forced three saves from Chris Neal and had another effort deflected over.
