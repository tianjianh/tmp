Scottish Borders Council has approved plans for a pre-consultation and review of its schools estate, including 63 primaries and nine secondaries.

It said the move was aimed at giving "maximum educational benefits for children and young people".
The council said feedback from parents, pupils, staff and other groups would be taken into account.
A report on the best way forward will then be put together in time for a meeting in May.
The local authority said the aim of the review was to deliver a schools estate which provided:
Cllr Sandy Aitchison said: "Our key priority is to ensure that attainment and achievement levels are improved for children and young people right across the Borders, both within and outwith the formal curriculum.
"In order to achieve that we must have a school estate that meets the needs of everyone who uses our facilities.
"This pre-consultation and review is vital in terms of providing us with the information we need to be able to make a full and thorough assessment of our current provision - what works, what doesn't work, what needs improving."
He stressed there were "no fixed plans" on the table and encouraged anyone who used school facilities to give their views.
The pre-consultation will be undertaken over a four-week period in March.
The council will write to parents towards the end of February explaining the purpose of the review and inviting them to take part.
