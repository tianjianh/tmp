Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch has delivered an energetic headline set to close the first full day of the Glastonbury Festival.

Florence was moved to the headline slot last week when Foo Fighters pulled out after singer Dave Grohl broke his leg.
Florence's set for the Pyramid Stage crowd included a cover of Foo Fighters' Times Like These, dedicated to Grohl.
Saturday's main attractions include pop legend Burt Bacharach and divisive US rapper Kanye West.
Other acts performing on Friday included heavy rock veterans Motorhead, R&B star Mary J Blige, blues rockers Alabama Shakes and pop star Lulu.
Pete Doherty and Carl Barat's indie band The Libertines played a surprise set after being revealed as the secret act before Florence on the bill.
And Mark Ronson performed on The Other Stage, bringing out Blige, funk legend George Clinton and DJ Grandmaster Flash for his smash hit Uptown Funk.
Parts of the site have become muddy following several hours of rain on Friday afternoon.
The weather brightened up on Saturday, but more rain is forecast for Sunday.
On the Pyramid Stage, a barefoot Florence Welch sung songs from her three albums, including her singles Ship To Wreck, Shake It Out and Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up).
The free-spirited singer-songwriter, whose latest album has just been number one in the UK and US, spent much of the 15-song set running and twirling from one end of the Pyramid Stage to the other.
Her athleticism came despite only recently recovering from breaking her foot in April.
"Glastonbury is a place I love so much," she told the crowd. "The first time I came here I had no tent and we played at 11 o'clock on a Sunday morning in a tea tent, but I had this feeling that everything was beautiful and I hope you all feel like that tonight."
Introducing Times Like These, she said: "We would like to dedicate this next song to the legend and all-round incredible human being Dave Grohl.
"We hope through the Glastonbury ley lines this gets to you and you feel better. We're sending you so much love."
She also told the audience that she had wanted a choir with her but had not had time to assemble one - so she asked the crowd to sing along instead.
Her set closed with euphoric renditions of You've Got the Love and Dog Days Are Over, after which she took off her shirt, waved it in the air and ran off stage.
