The Foxes won the Premier League for the first time having begun the season as 5,000-1 outsiders for the title.
Wales will be featuring in their first major finals for 58 years at Euro 2016 and are 80-1 to win the tournament.
"Wales do remind me of Leicester," the former Wales and Leicester midfielder told BBC Radio Wales.
Speaking on the Jason Mohammad programme, Savage added, "Leicester have changed the face of football forever by showing that with a lot of hunger, desire, work rate and team spirit, you can go a long way.

"Wales have certainly got that. If they can have Gareth Bale in form, who knows?"
Leicester won the title as Chelsea ended Tottenham Hotspur's challenge by coming from 2-0 down to seal a point at Stamford Bridge on Monday.
The Foxes' title triumph means midfielder Andy King has become the fourth Welshman to earn a  Premier League winner's medal.
The 27-year-old, Leicester's longest serving player, is set to be included in Chris Coleman's Wales squad for this summer's European Championship finals in France.
Savage, who won 39 caps for Wales and played for Leicester between 1997 and 2002, sees similarities between the two current squads.
"Wales have got Gareth Bale and he's a superstar, but if you look around the team they've got very, very good players - Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and now Andy King a Premier League winner," Savage continued.
"They've got Ashley Williams who has been brilliant in the Premier League and around those players there's a togetherness and a team spirit I've witnessed when I've seen Leicester."
