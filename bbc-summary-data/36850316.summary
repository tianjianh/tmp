Tata has paused plans to sell the site, which currently employs 4,000 people.
The Indian company is working on keeping its UK business as part of a joint venture with German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp.
Roy Rickhuss from the Community union said he was "encouraged" by the visit.
Mr Clark was appointed head of the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on 14 July as part of Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet reshuffle.
Mr Rickhuss said: "I am encouraged that Greg Clark has met with steelworkers in his first week on the job.
"He will have left today in no doubt that Community will keep the pressure on this government to keep their promises to protect the steel industry.
"The new secretary of state clearly understands the scale of the challenge still facing the industry, but his words to steelworkers today must be followed by firm actions to help save their jobs.
"By visiting Port Talbot, he will have seen first-hand that the highly skilled workforce is the foundation on which any success for this industry will be built."
