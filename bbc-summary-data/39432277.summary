Hogg, 28, was injured in a collision with team-mate Mark Hudson in Town's 4-0 defeat by Bristol City on 17 March.
The initial diagnosis would have ruled the former Watford man out for the rest of the campaign.
But the Championship club said in a statement that he could now return to training on Sunday, 2 April.
Huddersfield's head of medical Ian Kirkpatrick said: "The initial information, symptoms and summary down in Bristol Royal Infirmary suggested Jonathan had a fracture in his cervical spine.
"However, a detailed review with the specialists we use in the area has added to Jonathan's diagnosis and rate of recovery.
"If there was any remote question over this, the specialists would say and we would err on the side of caution. However, a team of multi-disciplinary specialists - and an independent third opinion on Tuesday - gives us complete confidence.
"We can now lift the restrictions on Jonathan, with the aim of him returning to full training as soon as is safely possible."
