Shahid Afridi: Pakistan decide not to renew all-rounder's central contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan have decided not to renew Shahid Afridi's central contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old has not been selected since Pakistan's early exit from the World Twenty20 in India in April, after which he resigned as Twenty20 captain.
A hard-hitting right-handed batsman and leg-spinner, Afridi retired from Test cricket in 2010 and from one-day internationals in 2015.
He has scored more sixes than any other player in the history of one-day international cricket, with 351.
Meanwhile, off-spinner Saeed Ajmal has also been omitted by the Pakistan Cricket Board, hurting his chances of making a comeback in the national side.
