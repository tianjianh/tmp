Doncaster Rovers staved off relegation from League One for another week with an impressive win over Coventry.

Tommy Rowe made it 1-0 with his second goal in as many games when he headed in Gary McSheffrey's inswinging corner.
Andy Williams headed in Nathan Tyson's back-post cross to double their lead.
A draw or loss could have seen Rovers relegated if Fleetwood and Shrewsbury had won, but the win leaves Darren Ferguson's side three points from safety with two matches left to play.
Rovers now have two wins and a draw from their last three games and travel to bottom side Crewe next Saturday before a final-day match against automatic promotion contenders Burton Albion.
Coventry manager Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"I feel as disappointed as I've been in the team all year. Where is the team that we saw beat Gillingham 4-0, Millwall 4-0, Wigan 2-0?
"Maybe it's a bit too much for a few young players. I'm really disappointed for the supporters who've come out for them.
"In my mind the promotion push was over quite a while ago, while mathematically you could still do it and you keep going but I don't think it was realistic to think that we were going to do that."
