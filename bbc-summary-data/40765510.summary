Sprinter Proud, who won 50m butterfly gold on Monday, took third in the 50m freestyle final in 21.43 seconds.
Guy - part of GB's gold medal-winning 4x200m freestyle relay team on Friday - shared 100m butterfly bronze with Joseph Schooling of Singapore in 50.83.
American Caelab Dressell won the 50m freestyle and 100m butterfly.
He secured his third gold medal of the night by teaming up with Nathan Adrian, Mallory Comerford and Simone Manuel to win the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay ahead of the Netherlands and Canada.
Proud finished fourth on his Olympic debut at Rio 2016 and was delighted to secure a second medal of the competition, but this time in an Olympic event.
Only freestyle has a 50m event in the Olympics, with butterfly, breaststroke and backstroke limited to 100m and 200m.
"That was an amazing race to be part of," said 22-year-old Proud.
"To come away with a bronze in an Olympic event is probably more pleasing than the other day," he said.
"Caeleb has been amazing this week and isn't someone who's going to disappear anytime soon, so it's given me more motivation to go back to training and work on things like my start, because he has the best start I've ever seen."

Guy's success came less than 24 hours after powering the British men's 4x200m freestyle team to a successful defence of their title they won at the 2015 Worlds.
The 21-year-old admits he struggled to sleep last night after the adrenaline high, but also because his room-mate Adam Peaty was apparently snoring.
"I was fairly tired today," said Guy. "To win a bronze is a good result because I had a terrible start, turn and awful finish - so there's lots to work on."
Britain's Sarah Vasey qualified for Sunday's 50m breaststroke final in 30.46 - the sixth quickest time.
Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom claimed her second title of the week - following up 100m butterfly gold with the 50m title - as Dutch swimmer Ranomi Kromowidjojo and Egypt's Farida Osman finished second and third respectively.
Sjostrom then qualified for Sunday's 50m freestyle final by setting a new world record of 23.67 - her second record of the week after breaking the 100m mark earlier in the event.
Australia's Emily Seebohm upset home favourite Katinka Hosszu to claim 200m backstroke gold ahead of the Hungaria, while USA's Kathleen Baker came third.
American Katie Ledecky won her third straight world 800m freestyle gold, her fifth title of the championships.
Chinese swimmer Binjie Li, 15, came second, USA's Leah Smith was third with British debutant Holly Hibbott eighth.
