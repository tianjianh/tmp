In a statement he said: "I want to apologise to my fiancÃ©e, my children, as well as my mother, father, and brothers for the mistake that I made.
"I also want to apologise to the UFC, my coaches, my sponsors and equally important to my fans."
The announcement comes less than a week after Jones successfully defended his title against Daniel Cormier.
The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) confirmed that following a random drug test in December, Jones provided a sample which contained traces of benzoylecgonine, the main metabolite in cocaine.
Under UFC rules benzoylecgonine is not a banned substance out-of-competition.
As a result, organisers were unable to penalise Jon Jones or stop him from fighting, despite knowing of the positive test.
A statement on the UFC website said they would stick by the fighter.
"While we are disappointed in the failed test, we applaud him for making this decision to enter a drug treatment facility," it read.
"Jon is a strong, courageous fighter inside the octagon [the cage where fighters do battle] and we expect him to fight this issue with the same poise and diligence.
"We commend him on his decision, and look forward to him emerging from this programme a better man as a result."
Jon Jones became the youngest ever UFC champion in 2011.
His current record inside the "octagon" is 21 wins and just one defeat, which came because he was disqualified.
UFC president Dana White said: " I'm confident that he'll emerge from this program like the champion he truly is."
