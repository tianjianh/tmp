Brogan Warren, 21, from Northampton, died after the Citroen Saxo she was travelling in crashed on the Shrivenham Bypass, near Swindon, on Sunday night.
It is understood the other victims travelling with her from Bristol's vegan festival VegFest were Sam Kay, Nicoletta Tocco and Krop Jones.
Ms Warren's mother Deborah Bryne said her daughter had a "magical soul".
"My heart and soul have been torn away and it hurts so much I can barely breathe," Ms Bryne said.
"I'm hoping the four of you quickly found each other on the spirit side and walked together to eternity.
"I can picture you all holding hands, skipping and dancing up into the clouds and rainbows knowing that you truly have found paradise together."
Ms Warren's partner Grant Brooks said: "You gave the world such joy and you showed us all that the world has magic."
Festival organisers described the four victims as "wonderful people" in a tribute on Facebook.
"We are so sorry to hear such sad news after such an uplifting event," they said.
Also on Facebook, Hannah Greeno wrote: "Heartbreaking! We were dancing right next to them, they were so happy!"
The occupants of a Mercedes also involved in the crash, including a three-year-old boy, were injured and taken to hospital, police said.
Their injuries were not believed to be life threatening.
