The first three ODIs count towards the International Cricket Council (ICC) Women's Championship, which determines qualification for the 2017 World Cup.
"They always seem to get themselves in and among semi-finals in the major tournaments," Winfield told BBC Sport.

"Our job is to make sure our game is on top form."
Winfield, 24, added: "They've got good players in Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates, and they've also got some players we've not seen a great deal of, so they're not to be underestimated."
England dominated Sunday's game with Northern Districts at the same Bay Oval venue.
Yorkshire right-hander Winfield made 33 from 42 balls as England racked up 342-9 from 50 overs. The hosts then slipped to 109-7 after 35 overs, at which point the target was revised.
"It's a good track out here and we've managed to put plenty of runs on the board," said Winfield.
"We're really excited moving into the first one-day international, playing a really aggressive brand of cricket, and we're expecting to score big runs.
"We've had a good amount of time out here, and it's about the nitty gritty stuff now."
