Footballer Ched Evans is to have his rape conviction appeal heard on 22 March, it has been confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-Sheffield United player was jailed for five years in 2012 after being found guilty of raping a woman, 19, at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire.
Evans, 27, was released in 2014 after serving half of his sentence.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the conviction after his lawyers lodged fresh evidence. It will be heard at the Court of Appeal.
In October, the body said it had carried out a 10-month investigation into the case and referred it based on new information which was not raised at trial.
Evans, a striker with 13 caps for Wales, has always maintained his innocence.
But his attempts to restart his career with Oldham Athletic and his former club collapsed in the face of a public outcry.
