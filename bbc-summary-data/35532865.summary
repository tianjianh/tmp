A bill ensuring hospitals in Wales have sufficient nurses on duty at all times has been passed by AMs.

Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams, who proposed the legislation, said Wales would be the first part of Europe with such a legal requirement.
"This small but fundamental change in the way we staff our wards with nurses will undoubtedly save lives," she said.
Meanwhile nurse training places will increase by 10% - an extra 135 - in a Â£85m Welsh government package.
Extra training places for physiotherapists and radiographers are also included.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said highly-trained staff were "the heart of the Welsh NHS".
"This investment is based on what NHS organisations have told us they need to maintain services," he said.
"Despite the financial pressures faced during in recent years we have continued to invest in education and training for health professionals in Wales. This year is no exception."
AMs approved Ms Williams's nurse staffing levels bill on Wednesday evening.
"The logic is simple: more nurses on our wards means each nurse can spend more time with each patient, ensuring better care as a result," she said.
"More staff nurses means health boards won't have to fork out for expensive agency nurses, saving our NHS money in the long run."
