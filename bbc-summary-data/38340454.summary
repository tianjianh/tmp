Judy Murray has described the prospect of her ten-month-old granddaughter picking up a tennis racket as "ghastly".

Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, the mother of Andy and Jamie Murray admitted that she "couldn't think of anything worse".
She also said that she would not be calling her son "Sir Andy".
It follows speculation that the current men's singles world number one will be knighted in the New Years honours.
Judy Murray said it had been a big year for the family after both her sons were ranked the best in the world for their sport for the first time.
Her daughter-in-law, Kim Murray also gave birth to daughter Sophia in February, while Jamie received an OBE.
She told the programme that both her sons' achievements were "remarkable".
"It's amazing what they've done in the same year and for family harmony. No fighting at Christmas," she said.
However, when asked about the prospect of Andy Murray being given a knighthood, she said: "Andy's always been about the sport. He's not interested in the fame and fortune.
"He's always been about working hard and trying to achieve within the sport, those are the things that are important to him.
"He got an OBE the year that he won Wimbledon in 2013. But I know he's said that he feels too young for something like a knighthood and I certainly don't fancy calling him Sir Andy."
Despite being a coach for both her sons in the early years of their career and previously leading the British Fed Cup team, Judy Murray said she would not want her granddaughter following in their footsteps.
She said: "Not sure I would be looking to do that to be honest. I would much rather be looking to teach her to dance. I can't think of anything worse for her. Could you image being the child of some well-known tennis player. Every other kid in the block is going to want to beat you aren't they?
"No, I think it would be ghastly. I hope she does something else."
Judy Murray appeared in the twelfth series of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing but was eliminated early on in the show.
She said her sons had a mixed reaction to the news that she was to appear as a contestant.
She said: "They were quite funny when I was doing Strictly because when I said to them 'I've been asked to do Strictly, what do you think?', Jamie said 'oh mum you love Strictly, go for it', and Andy went 'oh my God, you'll be awful', and he was right of course.
"But I think they were concerned for me that it didn't go well and all the rest of it.
"But as I went on through the competition, they were loving seeing me dressed up, loving the fact that I was enjoying myself and also that people were saying nice things about me.
"Probably for most of their careers, people weren't saying particularly nice things about me.
"You had to put up with a lot of bad media over the years for being the competitive mum and in many people's eyes that's not acceptable.
"But it's all changed now and Strictly probably has a part to [play] with that."
