[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 2-1 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stunning goal from youngster Ben Stevenson helped Coventry beat Oxford as they claimed their first home league win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder broke the deadlock in the 28th minute when he rifled in a 25-yard shot which gave Oxford keeper Simon Eastwood no chance.
But with Coventry's confidence fragile after a morale-sapping defeat at Charlton at the weekend, they needed another to really settle.
It came just two minutes before the half-time break when visiting defender Phil Edwards tried to head a long pass from Chris McCann back to Eastwood, unaware his keeper had come galloping off his line.
That left Marvin Sordell, who had offered the home side's most potent threat, the simple task of side-footing home into the empty net.
Oxford could well have taken the lead in the 22nd minute when Chey Dunkley met a corner powerfully with his head only for the ball to bounce off the crossbar with keeper Lee Burge stranded.
Substitute Dan Crowley ensured a nervy final few minutes when he scored in injury time.
