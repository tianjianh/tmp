A D-Day veteran who started an ancient game of football on his 100th birthday has said it was one of the best days of his life.

Bill Milward "turned up the ball" for the second day of Royal Shrovetide Football in his hometown of Ashbourne, Derbyshire.
The game has been played almost every year since at least the 17th Century.
The match ended in a 1-1 draw after the Down'Ards goaled the ball late on Wednesday evening.
Mr Milward said: "I did practice a little bit - I tried with one hand to start but it over balanced me.
"Every year you look forward to Shrovetide. It's one of them things that gets in your blood."
Day one ended with a goal for the Up'Ards - those born north of Henmore Brook, but Matthew Etherington goaled for the Down'Ards at Clifton Mill, on Wednesday.
Mr Milward added: "Best day of my life - I couldn't have had a better time of it."
He first took part in the sometimes violent game when he was "about nine or 10" and continued to play until the outbreak of World War Two.
The veteran - awarded a Legion d'Honneur last year - drove an amphibious landing craft when the allies launched their invasion of Nazi occupied France in 1944.
The crowd sang happy birthday to Mr Milward as well as the traditional renditions of Auld Lang Syne and God Save The Queen before he threw the ball into the crowd.
