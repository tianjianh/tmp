[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Cochrane, 38, and Andrew Green, 32,  began exchanging sexual texts with the 15-year-old in 2011.
Both men worked at Lord Lawson of Beamish School in Gateshead, but their victim was not one of their pupils.
The National College for Teaching and Leadership conduct panel found them guilty of professional misconduct.
PE teacher Cochrane had taught at the school for 11 years while music teacher Green had taught there for five years.
Both resigned in March 2012. Both men said they believed the girl was over 16.
The panel ruled that Cochrane engaged in a sex act with the girl in his car - knowing that she was 15.
Although Green had sex with her, at the time he thought she was over 16, the panel found.
The girl, who is now 19 and referred to as girl A' in the report, said that in May 2011 she had sex with Green in his house.
The girl also exchanged sexual messages and pictures with Cochrane but they had only met once, the panel heard.
She said she had performed a sex act on him in his car in May 2011.
Both men were given an indeterminate ban from teaching for life.
