Danny Rowe: Barrow sign Wycombe Wanderers defender on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow have signed defender Danny Rowe on a one-month loan from League Two side Wycombe Wanderers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rowe, 20, has made 10 appearances for Wycombe since joining from Rotherham last summer, but has not played since their win against Oxford in December.
"By not having a reserve team, we can't give match practice to lads who aren't involved on a Saturday," Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth told the club website.
"Danny's part of my plans but this move is to let him play more football."
