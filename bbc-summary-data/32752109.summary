Childhood sweethearts, born at the same hospital just two hours apart, have got married.

Sophie Coles and Dave McDermott grew up yards apart in Wigston, Leicestershire and went to the same school, college and university.
The couple, who now live in Portsmouth, married in their home county on Saturday - the anniversary of their first kiss when they were 16.
Dave described it as a "freaky coincidence".
The pair, now aged 26, were born on the morning of 14 March, 1989, at the Leicester Royal Infirmary.
"We first realised when we were 16 at school," said Sophie, a medical sonographer.
"I thought he was joking but he actually was born in the same hospital, possibly on the same ward."
Dave, who works in software sales, said it's a mixture of fate and coincidence.
"It was early days and you just brush it aside - a freaky coincidence really," he said.
Sophie said they shared their first kiss shortly before they sat their GCSEs, exactly 10 years ago.
"My friend is trying to work out the stats of two people being born on the same day, let alone the same year, who are different genders and then meeting each other but we can't work it out," she added.
"So, if there's any good mathematicians out there who can work it out I'd be interested in finding out."
Since the couple contacted their local paper with the story, they have received attention from the national and international press.
"I'm sure the five minutes of fame will be over soon," said Sophie.
The couple are due to spend their honeymoon on safari in Africa.
