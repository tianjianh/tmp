[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Organisers of a Magna Carta barons trail in Lincoln say patrols are being set up to ensure the statues are not damaged.

A helmet on one of the statues, which was knocked off, has been repaired.
The figures, designed by Lincolnshire artists, will eventually be auctioned with the profits going to charity.
Donations made during tours of the Baron Trail will be given to the city's first responders service.
The colourful statutes are displayed in prominent locations in the city.
Spokesman for the Lincoln Business Improvement Group (BIG) Matt Corrigan said a team of volunteers would ensure the statutes were not damaged.
"We will need to look after them and our wardens team will do that along with other volunteers who will be going out and checking on the barons and making sure they are all in good condition," he said.
"The damage was probably caused when someone tried to climb up it and the helmet came off in their hand. It has all been sorted out now."
The trail is part of the 800th anniversary celebrations of the sealing of the Magna Carta.
The city holds one of four remaining original copies of the charter, which was sealed by King John at Runnymede in 1215.
The barons have all been sponsored by businesses or organisations and given their own identity, including the Truck Driver Baron, the Graduate Baron and the Beekeeper Baron.
