Scotland has to capitalise on Andy Murray's Grand Slam success before he retires, according to his mother, tennis coach Judy Murray.

As her son clocked up his 500th career win, she said there is a "massive, massive opportunity" to grow the game in Scotland.
And after a hugely successful Davis Cup match in Glasgow, she wants to make the most of the game's popularity.
"But it needs to be done now," she said.
Speaking at a tennis road show in Dumfries, Ms Murray said: "I think there's a huge opportunity to grow the game in Scotland. There has been for five or six years now.
"Andy's been in the top five for about seven years and obviously has his grand slam titles, Jamie has a grand slam title. They are both playing Davis Cup - there was a huge atmosphere for the GB-USA Davis Cup match a few weeks ago."
She added: "There's no point in trying to provide a legacy after everything over, you have to start now.
"Andy is 27. He's still got a few years left in him I'm sure, but you never know at what point he's going to retire and when he retires I want to make sure the game is in good shape for the long term."
Jamie Murray, a doubles specialist, has previously spoken of his concern that there will be no legacy in Scotland when his brother retires.
The 2007 Wimbledon mixed doubles champion said the scenario would be a "tragedy" because many youngsters would like to play.
Ms Murray has been taking part in two days of Tennis on the Road sessions with young people in Dumfries and Galloway.
The events at schools across the region show parents, teachers and students how to deliver tennis lessons to children and adults.
She said: "What we are trying to do is build a workforce of people to create activity so that anyone who want to try it has a place to start."
