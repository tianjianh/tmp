[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Johanna Konta produced a commanding display to beat Belinda Bencic 6-2 6-1 and secure her place in the US Open fourth round in New York.

Konta, showing no sign of the health issues that affected her during the second round, brushed aside the Swiss 24th seed in 52 minutes.
The 25-year-old, ranked 13, reached the fourth round last year and made the Australian Open semi-finals in January.
Fellow Briton Kyle Edmund also reached the last 16 by beating John Isner.
Edmund, one of three British men in the third round, overcame the big-serving American in four sets and will face Novak Djokovic in the last 16.
Konta served with pace and accuracy from the start to keep 19-year-old Bencic on the back foot and a run of seven unanswered games gave her complete control.
She did not give away a single break point, won 19 out of 20 points on her first serve and hit 29 winners to her opponent's nine.
"I feel overwhelmingly happy," said Konta, who faces Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova in the next round.
"I felt I did a good job playing the match at hand and I focused all my energies into this match. I was happy how I dealt with things."
Konta had collapsed on court in her previous match and needed almost 15 minutes of treatment before feeling able to continue.
"I'm still recovering in every way," she added. "I think it was quite a traumatic experience. I'm just still working on getting better."
Sevastova, ranked 48 in the world, beat French Open champion Garbine Muguruza in the second round before overcoming Ukraine's Kateryna Bondarenko 6-4 6-1 in the third.
If Konta comes through, she will face either Madison Keys or Caroline Wozniacki for a place in the semi-finals.

Johanna Konta has every shot needed and can definitely challenge for Grand Slam titles. It's not just her ranking, it's who she beats that makes you think that.
She creates good speed on the ball herself but she can cope with power and the ball that comes to her at pace. She has good racquet control, quick feet and good balance, and is keeping the momentum going from last year.
American eighth seed Keys claimed a dramatic 7-5 4-6 7-6 (7-3) win over a tearful Naomi Osaka of Japan.
Leading 5-1 in the final set and on the cusp of the biggest victory of her career, 81st-ranked Osaka crumbled as Keys took the next five games en route to a victory that left her 18-year-old opponent fighting back tears.
"This is the greatest comeback of my career, hands down," said Keys.
Two-time US Open runner-up Wozniacki, now ranked 74, beat Monica Niculescu 6-3 6-1.
It is the first time since January the Dane has won three matches at the same tournament.
Petra Kvitova made the last 16 by beating Elina Svitolina 6-3 6-4 and will face either second seed Angelique Kerber or CiCi Bellis next.
Roberta Vinci, the Italian seventh seed and runner-up to compatriot Flavia Pennetta in 2015, overcame Carina Witthoeft 6-0 5-7 6-3.
The 33-year-old Vinci will meet Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine for a quarter-final place.
Tsurenko, the world 99, made the last 16 at a Grand Slam for the first time by beating 12th seed Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia 3-6 6-3 6-4.
