Leicester's meeting on Tuesday was abandoned after two races due to unsafe, slippery ground following rain.

The meeting was brought to a halt after Frankie Dettori's mount Magillen came down just after the winning line when finishing runner-up to Rodaini in a six-furlong maiden race (14:30 BST).
"Following an inquiry, the jockeys felt it was unsafe to continue," said clerk of the course Jimmy Stevenson.
"Thankfully, both horse and rider were fine."
Stevenson said the late rain had made the top of the ground greasy.
Dettori is expected to be fine to ride at Epsom this weekend, where he will partner joint favourite Wings Of Desire in the Derby on Saturday.
