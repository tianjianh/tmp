Glan Clwyd Hospital: Disciplinary action promised by Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There will be disciplinary action following a damning report into care in a mental health unit at a Denbighshire hospital, the first minister has said.

Carwyn Jones was speaking as it emerged the health minister's statement on the Tawel Fan scandal had been withdrawn.
Instead ministers will back a call from the Conservatives for a debate on failings at the Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital on Wednesday.
Families said patients were treated like animals in a zoo.
An independent report said a string of allegations, which it found proven, amounted to "institutional abuse".
A Welsh government source said the decision to support a debate was taken "in full recognition of the strength of feeling across the chamber on the issue".
In the report published last Thursday, families described seeing patients "constantly crawling on dirty floors" and being "like a zombie...drugged up".
One family said they found a relative in bed in a pool of stale urine.
The report's author, health specialist Donna Ockenden, criticised a lack of action by the senior leadership team when problems had been flagged up in previous reports.
Answering AMs' questions on Tuesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones described the findings as "shocking" and "appalling" but said recently-introduced spot checks offered some reassurance.
"The results of those spot checks show that whilst there are some issues in some of those units, we can have some assurance that there is nothing equivalent happening in mental health units across the rest of Wales," he said.
Mr Jones also outlined what the families of those affected by events at the unit can now expect from Betsi Cadwaldr health board.
"The local health board (LHB) will take disciplinary action against those who are responsible," he said.
"It is simply not good enough to say that lessons have been learned and nobody bears responsibility within the LHB.
"I do not think that is a credible position for the LHB to be in and I don't think that the families will accept that for one minute."
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies criticised Mr Jones for taking five days to respond to the report, saying: "You are the first minister of Wales, the buck stops with you".
Mr Jones said it was appropriate to express a view in the assembly chamber, rather than "on Twitter".
Betsi Cadwaladr health board has apologised and a number of staff have been suspended or transferred to other duties.
Earlier on Tuesday, Plaid Cymru Ynys Mon AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said the health board needed "further intervention" from ministers, but it was "too early" to say what form the intervention should take.
He said there were "real concerns" about the health board's size, distance from people and "lack of accountability".
On Monday, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb called on Mr Drakeford to "show some leadership", saying the families concerned wanted to see "real accountability" and someone to "lose their job" over the scandal.
