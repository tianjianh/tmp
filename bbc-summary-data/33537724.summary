The 1944 Willys Jeep, belonging to a 73-year-old from Surrey, was taken from a car park during a show at Imperial War Museum Duxford on Sunday.
The man's father used the vehicle during the war and later paid Â£25 to have it shipped back to the UK.
Police said the theft had left the elderly owner "devastated".
Officers described the stolen vehicle as a "rare military jeep" of "great sentimental value" to its owner.
It had been shipped to England when the man's father moved back from Hawaii with his British-born wife.
The owner, who did not wish to be named, inherited the vehicle when his father died in 1957.
It was later restored and was on show at Duxford for the first time.
"These Jeeps were built to last no longer than a week, or one tank of fuel," the owner said.
"Soldiers even had printed instructions on how to destroy them quickly to prevent them falling into enemy hands."
Its registration is AMB644 and "USA 20497753-S" is painted in white on the bonnet.
Officers believe someone may have photographed the thief sitting in the Jeep before it was stolen.
Det Sgt Andy Denzey, from Cambridgeshire Police said: "The victim is extremely upset because he has lost something that held fond memories of his brave father.
"A part of his life has been ripped away from him."
