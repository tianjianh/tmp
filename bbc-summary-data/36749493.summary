Canadian star Drake has notched up a 13th consecutive week at number one with his single One Dance.

The song has now had the longest reign at the top of the charts since Wet Wet Wet's Love Is All Around in 1994.
Only two songs have had a longer unbroken spell at the summit: Love Is All Around (15 weeks) and Bryan Adams' Everything I Do, I Do It For You (16).
Frankie Laine's I Believe also spent 18 weeks at number one in 1953, but his run was interrupted by two other songs.
Drake's minimalist R&B track has dominated the charts since its release in April.
However, its success is primarily down to streaming. The song is only number 11 in this week's sales chart - with millions of streams pushing it to number one in the official Top 40, which combines sales and on-demand music.
Summery house track This Girl, by Kungs vs Cookin' on Three Burners, is the best-selling single of the week, but only manages to make number two in the singles chart.
In the album chart, US pop-punk band Blink-182 score their first ever number one with California.
The band's seventh album, it is also the first to feature vocalist Matt Skiba, who replaced founding member Tom Delonge.
"We're so excited and thankful," said the band. "This is the first time we have ever got a number one, and we are super thankful to all of you for supporting us."
The record sold 24,000 copies to top the chart, pushing Adele's 25 into second place.
There were new entries for Bat For Lashes' concept album The Bride - about a woman whose fiance dies on his way to their wedding - at number nine, while dance band Metronomy debut at 20 with their throwback album Summer '08.
Meanwhile, US singer-songwriter Carole King sees her 1971 album Tapestry re-enter the chart at 32.
The star performed the album in full at London's Hyde Park last Sunday, marking her first UK show since 1989.
The album's reappearance means it has been in the UK charts for a total of 182 weeks.
Despite the album's status as a timeless classic, that is by no means the longest-lasting record in this week's countdown. David Bowie's greatest hits collection racks up its 323rd week in the chart, followed by ELO's All Over The World (314 weeks) and Adele's 21 (285).
