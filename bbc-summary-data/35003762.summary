Jean Quigley's mother: 'Justice done' after Stephen Cahoon conviction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of murdered Londonderry woman Jean Quigley has said she is relieved that justice has finally been done after her killer was convicted of murder for the second time on Thursday.

Stephen Cahoon beat Jean to death, when she was pregnant with his child, at her home in Cornshell Fields back in 2008.
It emerged after the trial that Cahoon had a history of violence against women.
Jean's mother Emma McBride said she broke down in tears after the verdict.
Cahoon had denied murdering Jean, a 30-year-old mother-of-four.
But a jury at Dublin's Central Criminal Court on Thursday found the 43-year-old guilty of the murder at Cornshell Fields in Derry on 26 July 2008 by unanimous verdict.
He had previously been convicted of the murder in 2012, but that was quashed earlier this year.
Cahoon had admitted strangling Ms Quigley, who was 10 weeks pregnant with his child at the time of her death, but had denied it was murder.
Emma McBride said that she thought about her daughter every day.
"How does anybody assault a woman?" she said.
"The fact that I found Jean and the condition I found her in, my heart was tore out.
"It is never going to leave me. It was very hard to sit in the trials.
"Even yet, I would walk the floor at night sometimes because I can't sleep."
