The 42-year-old, the former coach of Cagliari and Bologna, replaces Eugenio Corini, who resigned on Tuesday.
The Sicilian side have only managed two wins in 21 matches and are one point above last-place Pescara in Serie A.
Palermo president Maurizio Zamparini has overseen about 60 coaching changes in 30 years as a club owner.
Last season alone, there were eight changes and this campaign there have been a further three replacements.
