Brownlee beat Spain's Mario Mola by 17 seconds with South Africa's Richard Murray five seconds back in third.
The Yorkshireman closed leader Mola's advantage in the overall rankings to 235 points going into the Grand Final at Cozumel in Mexico on 18 September.
Summer Cook led a United States 1-2-3 in the women's race with Vicky Holland and Non Stanford fifth and seventh.
Cook beat Sarah True in a sprint finish to secure her first World Triathlon Series win, with Katy Zafares in third.
Britain's Jodie Stimpson was unable to finish because of an Achilles tendon injury. She still sits in third place overall in the series, but may not be able to compete in the Grand Final.
In the men's race, Brownlee, 26, was second after the 750m swim, then broke away with Australia's Aaron Royle and Slovakia's Richard Varga in the 20km bike section.
His victory was never in doubt when he dismounted in the lead for the 5km run and he was able to celebrate by slapping hands with the crowd as he approached the finishing line.
Britons took four of the seven top places with Grant Sheldon, Thomas Bishop and Adam Bowden in fourth, fifth and seventh respectively.
Brownlee is now in second place in the World Series rankings with 3,705 points and can still overhaul Mola, who is on 3,940 points, with victory in Mexico.
Jonny's brother and double Olympic gold medallist Alistair, will return for Mexico after missing Edmonton.
