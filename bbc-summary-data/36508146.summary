Hong Kong-born Moore, 23, was the last British player in the event, having overcome world number 67 Christina McHale 6-2 6-2 to reach the last eight.
But the world number 280 could not take any of four break-point chances against Johanna Konta's conqueror Zheng.
She also served five double faults as 22-year-old Zheng won in 83 minutes.
Moore revealed she had been hampered by injury and told BBC Sport: "It was there, I could feel it, but I can't fault Saisai for the way she played, she didn't give me much of an opportunity.
"Every loss is a disappointment. It's been a great week and I have to take the positives and look forward to Birmingham next week. I do think I've improved a lot of things I needed to and going forward I am really excited about how things can progress."
Top-seeded Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic and unseeded Alison Riske of the United States won two matches each on Saturday to reach Sunday's final, after Friday's quarter-finals were washed out.
Pliskova beat Monica Puig of Puerto Rico 6-2 6-2 in 54 minutes after earlier seeing off Ashleigh Barty of Australia 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (9-7).
Riske took three match points to beat Zheng 6-1 7-5 in her semi-final, after earlier beating Anett Kontaveit of Estonia 6-3 6-3.
