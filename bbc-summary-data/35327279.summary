Jon Casey, 35, was stabbed to death in Barrack Road, Northampton, shortly before 17:30 GMT on 16 January 2015.
Northamptonshire Police are hunting Waijs Dahir, 21, who lived in Semilong Road, in the town, at the time.
On the anniversary of his death, Mr Casey's family urged anyone with information to contact police.
Mr Dahir, who was a student at the University of Northampton at the time, originates from Coventry.
He returned there shortly after the murder occurred and then left the country on Saturday 17 January 2015, police said.
Det Insp Louise Hemingway, said: "For the past year, Mr Casey's family have had to live with the knowledge that the person who killed Jon has not yet been brought to justice.
"That is why we have issued the details of Waijs Dahir today in the hope that he, or anyone who knows where he is, will contact us."
In a statement, his family said: "The sadness of losing our Jon Boy is what our family wakes up to every day. Knowing that we will never see him, hear him or hug him again is what we must learn to live with.
"Nothing can change the horror of what happened one year ago when our Jon, a partner, a son, a brother and a daddy to two little girls was taken from us so cruelly.
"As a family we ask that if you have any information that can bring the person who ended our Jon's life to justice to please contact Northamptonshire police."
