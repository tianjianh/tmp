A group of four hillwalkers have been airlifted to safety after getting stuck on a "dangerous ledge" 2,000ft (609m) up a mountain on Skye.

The men were trying to descend Bla Bheinn when they got into difficulty in fading light on Thursday.
They raised the alarm at 20:40 and a rescue operation involving the coastguard, Skye Mountain Rescue Team and Police Scotland was launched.
A coastguard helicopter from Stornoway in Lewis airlifted the men.
They were flown to an airfield at Broadford on Skye. They were uninjured and did not need medical treatment.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it had been a tricky rescue operation carried out on what it described as a dangerous cliff ledge.
A spokesman said: "Winch operator Robert Glendinning and winchman Peter Wood had to use all their skills to rescue the four - the winchman even climbing the cliff at one point to reach them."
