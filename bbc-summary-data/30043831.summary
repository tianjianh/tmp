A report, by the Nursing and Midwifery Council published in October, found patients were afraid to complain about services.
One woman, who did not want to be named, said her time on Loveridge Ward in 2007 left her too scared to have a second child.
The Health and Social Services Department have launched a review.
The mother, who did not want to be named, said she felt bullied by midwives over breast feeding and was left alone in pain for long periods.
"After my experience having my first child at Loveridge Ward I would have been terrified to go back to that.
"Myself and my husband both wanted to have another child in the future and my child is desperate to have someone to play with, but my experience left me too scared to go back to Loveridge Ward again."
A spokesman for the department said: "Women's views and experiences of maternity services are at the very heart of the independent review.
"The terms of reference of the review have been specifically drafted to ensure the review team gives heavy weight to the views and experiences of maternity patients.
"Women who have used the island's maternity services are 'experts by experience' and learning from that expertise is vital in ensuring that we provide the maternity services that women and their families expect and deserve."
Anita Davies, from the National Childbirth Trust, said more women were now coming forward and that there was a mix of stories about the service.
