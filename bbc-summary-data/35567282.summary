Jimmy Spencer's header and Josh Coulson's volley put the home side two goals up before James Berrett's top corner strike brought York back in it.
Ben Williamson capitalised on Scott Flinders' spill from Spencer's driven shot to regain the two goal cushion.
The U's Luke Berry chipped a late penalty over the bar after Dave Winfield's clumsy foul on Leon Legge.
Cambridge manager Shaun Derry told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:
"I think everyone was wondering how we would respond after a difficult afternoon last week.
"I thought we controlled the game from start to finish. We could have scored a lot more goals, we could have been more ruthless, but the key to it was reacting and getting the three points.
"It was a real accomplished 95 minutes. You reach for the stars as we always do, but I'm delighted with the three points, the calibre of the goals was pretty decent as well."
York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York:

"It's disappointing. I thought we started well. I think from our point of view we had too many off it today.
"Physically, I thought they caused us problems up front and we didn't handle that.
"I thought they handled the conditions better than us and that was the difference in the game."
