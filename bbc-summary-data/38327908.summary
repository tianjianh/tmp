The Olympic Council of Ireland will elect a new president to succeed Pat Hickey at an extraordinary general meeting on 9 February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hickey stepped aside as OCI president after being arrested by Rio police during the Olympics in an investigation into illegal ticket sales.
The 71-year-old is expected home in Ireland on Thursday after being released on bail on medical grounds.
Dublin man Hickey has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
A statement from the OCI said that Hickey would not be a candidate for the president's post, which he has held since 1988.
"For clarity, as Pat Hickey has repeatedly advised in the past year prior to the Rio Games 2016, he would be finishing his term of office after the Games, therefore please note he will not be a candidate for President at the forthcoming elections," said the OCI.
Hickey, who has also stepped aside from his presidency of the European Olympic Committees, was detained by Brazilian authorities and charged with various offences relating to ticket touting.
Earlier this week after four months of detention, which included a brief prison stay, a court ruled Hickey's passport could be returned on medical grounds after his lawyers lodged a bond of just over Â£340,000.
Judge Juliana Leal de Melo from Brazil's Special Court for Supporters and Large Events warned his bail would be forfeited if he did not return for future legal proceedings.
Hickey suffers from a heart condition and is set to receive treatment in Dublin.
Several OCI executives have resigned since August, including vice-president, Football Association of Ireland chief executive John Delaney, treasurer Kevin Kilty and crisis management committee member Ciaran O'Cathain.
Willie O'Brien is serving as interim OCI president, and is expected to be a candidate for the role in February.
Meanwhile, OCI chief executive Stephen Martin has been appointed as Team Ireland's chef de mission for the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea.
The County Down native and double Olympic hockey medallist also led the Irish team at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Ireland are hoping to qualify competitors in alpine skiing, snowboarding, and skeleton disciplines.
