Having dominated practice for Saturday's Ulster Grand Prix, Hickman stamped his authority on the six-lap Superbike race to clinch the second victory of his career over the 7.4-mile course.
Harrison, Anstey, Dan Kneen and Michael Dunlop all lapped at over 133mph, with Yorkshireman Harrison and Dan Kneen bettering their previous best lap speeds at the event.
Manxman Kneen finished fourth on the Tyco BMW, followed by Michael Dunlop on his Bennetts Suzuki and Fermanagh's Lee Johnston.
Teenager Joe Thompson was awarded the win in the National race which was red-flagged after three laps, Davey Todd taking second.
The Challenge race was abandoned after being halted twice because of accidents at Leathemstown and Budore, while the planned Supertwin race did not take place as the organisers called an end to proceedings for the day at 20:00 BST.
