Ganson, 46, has been the department's coach and technical director for the past three years.
The St Helens-born official retired in April 2013 with the 2008 World Cup and numerous domestic finals on his CV.
"I understand refereeing and the increasing demands placed on our referees," said Ganson.
"It's a critical area in the sport. There are changes we will introduce in the way we prepare, coach, assess and appoint our referees.
"Our coaching structure has been reviewed to assist in developing our referees and I want to accelerate the development of Championship and reserve grade referees so we have a stronger talent pool to select from at the highest levels."
Sharp left the department last season to take up a head coach role at Championship side Featherstone Rovers.
RFL chief operating officer Ralph Rimmer added: "A great deal of work over recent months has also gone into the Match Officials Pathway within the development pyramid.
"Following that work, Super League match official Ben Thaler will be heading up a focused recruitment campaign which is now being rolled out by the team."
