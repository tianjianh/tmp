A ferry detained for urgent repairs has set sail after passing an inspection, the operator has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Condor said the Liberation set sail from Poole earlier on Saturday after being detained since Tuesday.
Safety issues were found on the vessel, which is heading for Jersey and Guernsey, by Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA) inspectors.
But a spokesman for Condor said the boat now reached the "highest standards of safety".
The operator said contingency plans retained the "lifeline passenger links" to the Channel Islands, with about 70% of passengers offered travel on their booked day and all passengers travelling within 24 hours of their booking.
Inspectors found 11 deficiencies, with four giving grounds for detention; the main engine operation, steering gear operation, fire doors and ISM (International safety management code).
