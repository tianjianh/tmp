An airline has banned six "drunken" passengers from its flights after they were rude and aggressive towards staff.

Jet2 said the group caused problems on a flight from Newcastle to Tenerife on Saturday.
The firm has banned three people for a year and is refusing to fly another three home from the holiday island.
A spokeswoman said the group had been drinking "illicit alcohol", which refers to alcohol bought before they boarded the plane.
The company said: "This group were rude and aggressive to our cabin crew after drinking illicit alcohol, and they should be in no doubt that the consequences of such behaviour will not be accepted.
"We want our customers to have an enjoyable flight experience without the actions of a disruptive few spoiling it and we will take all necessary action to stamp it out."
The company is asking for duty free spirits sold at airports to be sealed in bags amid calls for the government to review the issue.
