[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker, who had registered five goals in his previous four outings, headed Jake Caprice's cross into the bottom right corner to open the scoring inside nine minutes at Kingfield Stadium.
Gateshead forward Danny Johnson saw his 36th-minute effort clip a post, before Ugwu capitalised on a mistake by visiting goalkeeper Dan Hanford to double the advantage 11 minutes into the second period.
Ugwu completed his treble 18 minutes from time when he latched on to Patrick McLaughlin's poor headed back-pass to lob the ball over Hanford.
