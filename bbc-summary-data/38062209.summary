Bradley Stoke traffic jams: Government asked to intervene

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government is being "urged to intervene" in long traffic jams caused by works to build a new public transport system near Bristol.

Lane closures at Bradley Stoke have caused delays during rush hour, with many commuters blaming the Metrobus project.
Local MP Jack Lopresti said the roadworks had "gone on too long".
He met Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling to ask him to "put pressure" on the council.
Mr Lopresti said he had asked Mr Grayling to "put pressure on South Gloucestershire Council and the contractors to get a grip of the situation to complete the works as quickly as possible".
"The Metrobus works need to be completed as quickly as possible with the minimum disruption to local residents," he said.
The Conservative MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke has also called an "urgent meeting" with the contractors, Metrobus and South Gloucestershire Council.
Commuters told BBC Radio Bristol "rush hour is now two to three hours long" and "everyone is really frustrated".
South Gloucestershire Council apologised earlier in the week for the congestion and said the closed lane, causing many of the traffic problems, should be reopened by the end of December.
Metrobus is part of a wider plan to improve public transport in Bristol and the surrounding areas.
