HSBC glitch payments 'all processed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A computer glitch that delayed 275,000 HSBC payments has now been resolved, the bank has said.

HSBC said at midday it had "processed all outstanding payments".
Some customers are still taking to Twitter to complain that their funds have not appeared, but HSBC advised them to contact their own banks.
HSBC said remaining delays could be because "individual banks may have slightly different clearing times" and apologised for "inconvenience caused".
Friday's fault, which affected HSBC customers and people expecting payments from HSBC accounts, left many people without expected money ahead of the bank holiday weekend.
It is understood to have been caused by an error in a file sent to Bacs, the system used across the UK to process payments.
The bank will conduct a review but the fault is not thought to have been the result of a major systems failure or hacking.
David Kennard, from Haywards Heath in West Sussex, said he and his partner had been scheduled to complete the purchase of their new house on Friday.
"We sat outside our new home with the removals lorry for hours waiting for confirmation that our funds had arrived with the vendor's solicitors," he said.
"By 5pm the money still hadn't arrived, and we were told that nothing would now be done until Tuesday after the bank holiday weekend.
"So last night we had to check into a local hotel for four nights and go out and buy clothes for the weekend and toothbrushes, etc.
"We will have to pay for the removal company to store and re-deliver our household goods next week. Thank you, HSBC."
Carole Collins, from North Baddesley in Hampshire, said she was due to get money from the council on Friday as part of her care package - but nothing had come through.
"I have four carers who look after me and I won't be able to pay them," she said.
"I won't be going anywhere this weekend."
Paul Lewis, presenter of personal finance programme Money Box on BBC Radio 4, said knock-on effects like missed mortgage payments meant there was "a lot of unwinding to do to make sure nobody suffers from this".
HSBC has said it will ensure that "no-one loses out" as a result of the "unacceptable" payment problems.
They should contact their bank if they have suffered any costs as a result of the problems, he added.
