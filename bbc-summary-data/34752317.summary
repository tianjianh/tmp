Jose Mourinho: Chelsea boss banned for expletive-laden rant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jose Mourinho's one-game stadium ban was handed out because of an abusive rant at referee Jonathan Moss during Chelsea's defeat by West Ham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mourinho, 52, chose not to appeal against the punishment, which was for the "persistent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour".
The Chelsea boss first refused to leave the referee's dressing room.
The referee reported Mourinho then shouted: "You [expletive] referees are weak… Wenger is right about you."
"I asked him to leave the dressing room area," Moss wrote in his report. "He refused. I asked him again. After he refused I asked Mr Sutton [West Ham's security manager] to escort him from the room.
"At this point Mr Mourinho became very aggressive and animated. He shouted that you [expletive] referees are weak... Wenger is right about you... you are [expletive] weak."
Mourinho will serve his ban when his side - currently 15th in the Premier League - take on Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday evening.
Wenger called referee Mike Dean "weak" and "naive" following Arsenal's 2-0 defeat by Chelsea in September.
The Frenchman received no punishment for his words, a fact which Mourinho brought up when he was fined £50,000 for saying referees were "afraid" to award his side penalties following their loss to Southampton.
Asked about his stadium ban on Friday Mourinho said: "This stadium ban is connected to words, to complaints.
"I can imagine that in the future we are going to have lots of managers with stadium bans, because the stadium bans should be related to something really serious."
The Football Association, which made its decision to ban Mourinho on 2 November, said statements by assistant referees and the fourth official at Upton Park also stated the Chelsea manager was asked to leave the dressing room twice, and confirmed the language he used.

Mourinho "showed a total lack of respect for the match officials and the sanctuary of their changing room," according to the FA statement.
The panel decided a touchline ban or an extended touchline ban was not sufficient punishment because Mourinho - who was also fined £40,000 - would still be able to access the dressing room.
"To only order a touchline ban would have the potential of enabling Mr Mourinho to commit a similar offence," the statement added.
At the time of the disciplinary process, Mourinho was still appealing against a separate incident where he was charged for comments made after his side's defeat at home to Southampton.
"We did not consider that matter as part of our deliberations as to the appropriate sanction," said the FA, which turned down the appeal for the Southampton offence on 5 November.
However, the FA said it took into account "his disappointing record of misconduct to date" but took kindly to Mourinho's decision to turn down a personal hearing.
