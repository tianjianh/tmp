Simpson's new contract will keep him at the club until 2019.
Team-mates Danny Drinkwater, Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy, Kasper Schmeichel, Wes Morgan and Andy King, and manager Claudio Ranieri, have all signed new deals this summer.
"I'm over the moon. I've been here two years now and the club is going places," Simpson said.
Simpson, 29, joined the club from Queens Park Rangers in August 2014 and played 31 times during their 2015-16 title-winning season.
