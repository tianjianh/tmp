[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 0-0 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegation-threatened Guiseley took a third point from as many games to improve their chances of surviving in the National League by drawing with Woking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Preston had an early chance for Guiseley but his header flew over the bar, with Jake Cassidy managing to hit a post shortly before half-time.
The Lions continued to dominate following the restart and Michael Rankine saw his shot saved by Brandon Hall.
Woking's goalkeeper was kept busy throughout and his best save came in the 68th minute, when he thwarted Cassidy by repelling the striker's long-range effort.
