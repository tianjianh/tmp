What do we know about Corrie Mckeague's disappearance?
Mrs Urquhart, from Dunfermline, said she appreciated police are doing an "incredibly difficult" job.
But why they would not search an area a stone's throw from where he vanished "does not make sense", she said.
"There's a huge amount of buildings and shops there which he could be in," she said.
The camera which spotted him walking into the "horseshoe" area - a loading bay - rotates on a three-minute timer.
Mrs Urquhart said her son could have walked across to the back of shops off Short Brackland without being seen by this camera.
Had he walked in any other direction he would have been picked up by one of the other cameras which are fixed, she added.
Mr Mckeague, a gunner at RAF Honington, was last seen on CCTV at about 03:25 BST.
He had been on a night out in the town with friends from the airbase.
When asked if the buildings had been searched, Suffolk Police told the BBC: "Police and partners have carried out extensive searches to locate Corrie.
"Since the start of the inquiry officers have visited homes, businesses and other properties in Bury St Edmunds to search and carry out inquiries to try to find him.
"This has included door-to-door visits, searches and the distribution of leaflets."
A freedom of information request revealed that more than Â£26,000 had been spent on the investigation so far.
