The man and woman, aged in their 60s, were also tied up and threatened with knives during a two-hour long attack in Halsted, Kent.
Kent Police said the three men who broke into the house off London Road fled with a "quantity of cash".
The couple are in hospital with severe burns and could have "life changing injuries", police said.
Sgt Simon Harrold said: "The victims of this crime have been subjected to a horrendous ordeal.
"Both husband and wife have suffered some severe burns and possibly been left with life changing injuries. They are both continuing to require treatment in specialist burns units and I can only imagine the trauma and shock they have suffered."
He appealed for anyone with information about the attack on the evening of 26 April to contact Kent Police.
Officers have been making house-to-house inquiries in the local area and reviewing potential CCTV since the burglary.
One of the suspects was black and about 5ft 10ins tall. The other two were white. All three wore dark clothing.
