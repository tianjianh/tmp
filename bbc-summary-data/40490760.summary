An "extremely dangerous" prisoner has been released early from a nine-year jail term after his sentence was recorded in error as nine months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ralston Dodd, 25, was jailed in November after he admitted stabbing a man three times in the back following an argument on a north London street.
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said such releases in error were "extremely rare" and it was investigating.
A warrant for Dodd's arrest has been issued.
Dodd attacked a 21-year-old man with a knife in Islington on 18 September 2016, before going on the run.
He was arrested on 11 October and was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment at Blackfriars Crown Court on 11 November after pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
After his sentencing, Det Insp Will Lexton-Jones said the inquiry had "ultimately led to an extremely dangerous offender being jailed".
He added: "This was an appalling act of violence that almost cost a man his life. The seriousness of this offence is reflected in the extensive prison sentence."
Dodd, from Islington, was being held in custody at HMP Thameside in south-east London before his release.
The Sun newspaper reported that after he was released he was spotted in a car by his victim.
His father told the newspaper his son "could have died" in the attack.
"I held my son and thought he was going to die. How can this happen without anyone noticing?," he said.
An MoJ spokeswoman said such releases in error are "extremely rare but we take any case very seriously".
"We are urgently investigating so we learn the lessons to prevent it happening again," she said.
"Public protection is our priority."
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said it wished to trace a man "for being unlawfully at large".
