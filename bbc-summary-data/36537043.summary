Five questions Sir Philip Green must answer on BHS

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former owner of BHS, Sir Philip Green, appears before MPs from the Work and Pensions Committee and Business, Innovation and Skills Committee this week to discuss the sale and collapse of BHS.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
You'd think it would be hard to top the drama of last Wednesday's session of the parliamentary inquiry into the demise of BHS. Death threats, insults and apologies all helped the five hours of evidence fairly whizz by.
However, the appearance on Wednesday of former owner Sir Philip Green was always going to be the main event.
Only he knows how all the pieces of the BHS jigsaw fit together. Even before he sits down, the stakes have been raised by his repeated insistence that one of the inquisitors-in-chief should stand down.
Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions committee, has been highly critical of Sir Philip and has made no secret of his desire to see the retail tycoon put his hand in his own pocket to plug a shortfall in the pension scheme of hundreds of millions of pounds.
Sir Philip maintains this compromises Frank Field's impartiality making him unfit to chair a parliamentary inquiry. It's an unwelcome diversion ahead of a crucial session of evidence.
But, assuming Sir Philip does turn up, here are the key questions he needs to answer:
All these questions and the many others he will face on Wednesday could be summed up in one overarching question:
Did he knowingly condemn 11,000 workers and 20,000 pensioners to a short changed future by selling to a man who had no chance of success? I know what his answer will be, but will he be able to convince MPs and the court of public opinion?
Perhaps we could add just one more - what is a knighthood worth?
