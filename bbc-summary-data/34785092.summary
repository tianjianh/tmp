He takes over from Paul Shaw, who stepped down as England women's head of performance in September.
Robinson, 48, was first-team coach at Sussex and scheduled to start his new role at the end of the year, in time for the South Africa tour in February.
"To have the chance to play a part in the next chapter for the England women's team is a great honour," the former right-arm seam bowler said.
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had wanted someone with "first-class or international playing or coaching experience" as the women's set-up underwent a restructure.
"He has a superb coaching record with Sussex, experience of working with England teams, a reputation for getting the best out of players, and is highly regarded as one of the best coaches working in the men's professional game," ECB head of women's cricket Clare Connor said.
"The next 18 months are hugely important for the England women's team and the players must quickly get back to winning ways in South Africa."
England, who lost this summer's multi-format Ashes series to Australia, are second in the International Cricket Council's women's team rankings.
Sussex have appointed Mark Davis, 44, as Robinson's successor.
"Robinson has pedigree and is a well-respected coach within the English game, having won two County Championships at Sussex - but they were relegated last season," BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said.
"He has no international experience - that was something Clare Connor said was a key attribute for any successful candidate.
"But Robinson led an England Lions tour to South Africa at the start of 2015, apparently impressing the ECB during the trip.
"This is a step up for the England women with a coach with vast experience at a high level in the men's game, but the pressure is on with success expected at next year's World Twenty20."
