[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash, involving a Vauxhall Meriva, happened on the A693 near the junction with West Pelton on Tuesday morning.
Radoslaw Drzewiecki, aged 29 and from Chester-le-Street, was pronounced dead at the scene.
A 45-year-old woman from Stanley was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving, and later bailed pending further inquiries.
Mr Drzewiecki's family said in a statement: "Radoslaw was a wonderful son, a loving fiancÃ© and a friend to many.
"He was always laughing and smiling, with a heart of gold and everyone who met him loved him straight away.
"He will be hugely missed by many and words can't describe our sense of loss."
