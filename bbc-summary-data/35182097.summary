Wales and Real Madrid football star Gareth Bale surprised children at a Cardiff hospital by turning up unannounced with bags full of toys.
Lucy Griffiths, whose son Jayden was at the Children's Hospital for Wales with breathing difficulties, said: "It made our Christmas."
She said Bale, who is from Cardiff, wished the children a merry Christmas as he gave out the gifts.
"He just turned up as a surprise - not even the nurses knew about it," said Ms Griffiths, from Newton Abbot in Devon, who was visiting her sister in Cardiff when Jayden became ill.
"It was a lovely thing to experience. He gave Jayden two presents, wished him a merry Christmas and said to get well soon.
"There were quite a few children there and to have someone like that come to do that was amazing. Jayden had a huge smile on his face."
Ms Griffiths said Bale turned up at the hospital with his pregnant girlfriend, Emma Rhys-Jones, at about 16:30 GMT on Thursday.
Jayden, who has asthma, was allowed home later that evening.
