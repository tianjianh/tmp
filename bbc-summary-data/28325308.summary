The firm, which provides services to the energy and pharmaceutical sectors, also plans to create 114 additional jobs at sites around the UK.
Doosan said it was investing Â£4.5m in the Renfrew facility, which is being backed with Â£1.5m Regional Selective Assistance from Scottish Enterprise.
The new jobs are expected to be phased in around the UK sites by 2018.
Doosan Babcock chief executive Andy Hunt said: "The opening of this centre is fantastic news for Scotland and for Doosan Babcock as we seek to grow our process business, creating new roles for British engineers.
"The process sector can be a highly complex area to operate in but, thanks to this investment, Doosan Babcock will have the skillset and specialist knowledge to offer customers an integrated engineering and construction service that is unparalleled."
Doosan said the opening of the centre was the first step in a plan to almost triple the size of its process business over the next five years.
The new department will aim to deliver a "complete service" to companies operating in process industries such as oil and gas, refining, petrochemicals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
This service will range from concept design through to the construction and handover of new production facilities, as well as the repair, overhaul and upgrade of existing plants.
The company aims to engage UK customers and then target international growth opportunities, particularly in regions such as the Middle East.
Scottish Enterprise chief executive Lena Wilson said: "Doosan has ambitious plans for expanding its process business on the world stage and it is testament to our key capabilities and skills that Scotland has been selected as the location for such a pivotal part of the company's global growth plans.
"The company's decision to locate this new service here is an excellent example of how the support that we and our partners can offer is helping bring new investment into Scotland."
Finance Secretary John Swinney added: "This is another sign of confidence in Scotland as a great place to do business and a great place to invest."
