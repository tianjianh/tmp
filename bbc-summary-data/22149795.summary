The mother of an Essex man killed in a crash in Crete says she is "relieved" the trial of a lorry driver accused of his death is to go ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glen Daly, 24, of Chadwell St Mary, near Grays, died when his motorcycle was involved in a collision with a lorry on the Greek island in June 2009.
The lorry driver has been charged with negligent homicide.
Mr Daly's parents Les and Dorothy are due to travel to Heraklion for the start of the trial on Thursday.
The trial has been delayed three times: it was adjourned in 2010, 2011 and again in February this year.
"I have mixed emotions," said 55-year-old Mrs Daly. "I am relieved it's going ahead, but at the same time I'm worried about it.
"All I've ever asked for is the truth."
Mr Daly was on the third day of his holiday with his friend Tony Atkins when he died.
The trial will hear evidence from Mr Atkins, 27, who witnessed the crash.
