Stockton's £6.3m crematorium gets go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £6.3m crematorium is to be built in Stockton nine years after it was first proposed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stockton Council has approved the facility on the site of the former Blakeston School on Junction Road.
A spokesman said  more than 70% of people now opt for cremation, but families had to use facilities in Acklam and Redcar.
He said the town's population was estimated to rise by 20% in the next 20 years and demand needed to be met.
The facility, which will be owned by the council, will have gardens of remembrance, landscaping and parking.
