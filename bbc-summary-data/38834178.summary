The victim, who has serious injuries and is being treated in hospital, was found by a passer-by in Truro shortly before 17:00 GMT.
Devon and Cornwall Police have cordoned off an area by Baynards Close and James Place and an investigation has begun.
Sgt Paul Kelly said eight officers had attended the scene and were working to "make sure things were forensically secure".
"We believe this to be an isolated incident and would reassure the public that there's not increased levels of danger to them," he said.
Officers have appealed for any witnesses to contact them.
