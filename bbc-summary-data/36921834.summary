Ofgem investigation into SSE pre-payment meter tariffs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ofgem has launched an investigation into SSE's pre-payment meter processes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The energy regulator said it was responding to concerns about the Perth-based company's approach to switching customers to pre-payment tariffs.
The probe will focus on the impact of the process on those in potentially vulnerable situations.
Ofgem will consider whether SSE breached its Standards of Conduct, which aim to ensure suppliers treat customers fairly.
It will examine whether the company breached licence conditions, which require it to provide appropriate information, and ensure a consumers' ability to pay, when suggesting alternative payment methods.
SSE described the basis for the investigation as a "historic issue".
A spokesman for the energy provider said: "We are committed to treating all our customers fairly and will be cooperating fully with Ofgem's investigation into this historic issue."
