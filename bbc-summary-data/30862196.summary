Jon Casey, 35, from Ecton Brook in the town, was found stabbed in Barrack Road, near to the Lazeez Indian restaurant at 17:30 GMT on Friday.
Mr Casey was taken to Northampton General Hospital where he died just before 18:25.
Det Insp Mark Brayfield said it was a "brutal and ultimately fatal attack". Mr Casey's family have been informed.
A post-mortem investigation was being carried out by a Home Office pathologist in Leicester to determine the cause of death.
Mr Brayfield, from Northamptonshire Police, said detectives were following a number of lines of inquiry.
He said: "We would urge anyone in the area at the time and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward.
"We are very keen to know of Mr Casey's movements in the hours leading up to his death."
