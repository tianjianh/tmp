Reggie Richardson dog bite death: Dad denies child cruelty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of a three-week-old baby boy killed by the family dog has denied child cruelty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reggie Richardson, also known as Reggie Young, was attacked in his home in Falkland Road, Sunderland in June 2015 and died in hospital.
Ryan Young, 30, of the same address, also denied owning a dog which, while dangerously out of control, caused injuries that led to Reggie's death.
The Lakeland terrier has since been destroyed.
Caroline Goodwin, defending, said the family had been left "devastated" by the incident.
Appearing at Newcastle Crown Court holding a picture of his son, Young sobbed as he sat with his head down in the dock.
