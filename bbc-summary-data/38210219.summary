Jack Duggan's late strike secured the Northern Premier League part-timers a first-ever third round tie at League Two side Wycombe Wanderers.
It is the second time the club have defeated Football League opposition, having beaten Plymouth Argyle in a first-round replay in 2011.
Duggan fired in Luke Benbow's floated free-kick at the back post for the win.
The West Midlands side - who are ninth in their division - were good value for their victory over a club 89 places ahead of them in the English football pyramid.
Chris Lait fired wide early on before Dan Scarr forced David Cornell into a smart save with a header on the half-hour mark while Duggan glanced wide moments later, before again forcing Cornell into a low stop as Stourbridge dominated.
Those missed chances nearly came back to bite the Glassboys in first-half stoppage time, but Paul Anderson could only drag his rasping drive wide.
The home side saw a long throw-in cannon off the visitors' crossbar, while Scarr had a header palmed over by the busy Cornell, before Duggan pounced to send the War Memorial Ground wild.
Stourbridge manager Gary Hackett told BBC WM:
"I thought we were outstanding. We certainly didn't get lucky, we were the better team. It's one of those special nights and it's a great occasion for everybody connected with the football club.
"We had a 15-minute spell in the second half when there were some very tired legs, but the crowd kept them going. We hung on, defended immensely and Matt Gould's not had a shot to save.
"This has got to be the biggest, beating a League One side at home. This is what the FA Cup is about.
"Everybody connected with this football club are heroes. I spoke to a gentleman who comes on the coach every week and never misses a game - I told him these nights are for you. Hugh (Clark, Stourbridge president) has been here 50 years and experienced some tough times at this football club, so he gets rewarded tonight. We all do."
