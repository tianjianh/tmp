[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Wheeler scored the only goal of the game as Exeter City extended their unbeaten run to 10 games with victory over fellow League Two play-off hopefuls Portsmouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wheeler netted his ninth goal of the season as the Grecians moved up to seventh with victory at Fratton Park.
Portsmouth had the first chance of the game in the sixth minute when Carl Baker's low cross found Conor Chaplin, but his flicked effort went just wide of the post.
Reuben Reid forced Pompey's goalkeeper into action six minutes later after weaving his way into the box and attempting a curling effort, but he was denied by David Forde.
Exeter took the lead in the 57th minute after the ball rebounded off Pompey's Danny Rose before finding Wheeler, who lashed it into the roof of the net.
Gareth Evans almost earned a point for Portsmouth in the 72nd minute but his stinging effort was well matched by Exeter goalkeeper Christy Pym who managed to hold onto the ball.
