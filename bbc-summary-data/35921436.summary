Sonia Todd spent five weeks crafting Michael Jackson from breakfast cereal, chocolate and icing, in order to thrill the judges in Birmingham.
She won a bronze medal at Cake International show, though could not beat it enough to win gold.
Ms Todd, of Thirsk, North Yorkshire, describes herself as "a massive fan" of the singer.
"I love baking and I love Michael Jackson, so I've just combined the two", she said.
The confection sits on a skeleton made of wood and cake stands to support the weight. Ms Todd researched the project on the internet and took advice from her local cake supplies shop.
"I had to make sure that when I was building him that he was going to be able to stand on his own two feet without any structure being able to be seen," she said.
"For the size of him it was quite a task really."
She said she was surprised at the response to the cake version of the "King of Pop", which saw people queuing up at the NEC show to take selfies.
"I didn't let anybody know that it was actually me that done him," she said.
"I wouldn't put my name to him unfortunately.
"To me I've built him and I've spent the past couple of week s looking at him so to me he is nothing special."
Ms Todd said she is planning another project ready for the autumn show.
The Jackson cake will be used to raise money for a local hospice.
