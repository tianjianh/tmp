The Grade II listed City Pool and Turkish Baths in Newcastle shut in 2013 due to the "high investment" needed.
Fusion Lifestyle Ltd has now been granted a lease for the site and plans to renovate the building and restore the historic baths.
The Re-open Newcastle Turkish Baths campaign group said it was "delighted" by the news.
The facility, which opened on Northumberland Road in 1928, is one of only 11 of its kind in England.
Cait Read, from the group, said: "We are excited to continue to be involved in the future of the building, to ensure that it re-opens as a valuable resource for the people of Newcastle and an attraction to people visiting the city."
Fusion has also taken over the City Hall, which was under threat of closure as part of a consultation into multi-million pound budget cuts in the city.
It will be sub-leased it to the Newcastle Theatre Royal Trust, which will continue to operate it as a concert and entertainment venue.
City Hall Action group chairman Tony Stephenson, said: "We're very pleased to see that this deal means the City Hall will continue as a viable music venue in the future."
