Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk was interviewed by Lancashire Police over the allegation on 4 January.
But the Crown Prosecution Service said no further action should be taken because of "insufficient evidence".
Mr Danczuk said he was "relieved" the case against him had been dropped and described the investigation as an "immensely stressful period".

The independent MP had been suspended from the Labour Party a month before the rape allegation emerged, when he admitted sending inappropriate text messages to a teenage girl.
The 49-year-old voluntarily attended a police station by appointment when he was interviewed over the rape claim.
He said in a statement: "I am grateful for the decision made by the CPS and I am relieved that the investigation has now come to an end.
"Even though I maintained my innocence throughout, this has been an immensely stressful period for me and my family.
"I now expect the Labour Party to conclude their investigation into these matters and lift my suspension as soon as possible."
In a statement, the CPS said: "Following receipt of a file from Lancashire Police... the evidence was considered by a specialist prosecutor in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors.
"It has been decided that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.
"The complainant has been informed and we have written to her to fully explain our decision."
Lancashire Police said it "entirely respected" the decision of the CPS, which it had "worked closely with" throughout the investigation.
"While these allegations were made against a public figure, we have been committed throughout to investigating this matter in the same professional and victim-focussed way that we would all such allegations," it said.
The force said it "remained committed to investigating allegations of this nature, no matter how long ago or what the role, position and status of the alleged offender".
Labour said the MP "remains suspended from the party".
