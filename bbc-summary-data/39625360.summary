The Czech suffered damage to tendons and nerves in her left hand after she was stabbed by an intruder at her home in Prostejov in December.
The 27-year-old was initially expected to be out for at least six months.
But on Monday the two-time Wimbledon champion announced that she has submitted her entry for Roland Garros.
In a post on her Instagram page, she said: "My name will appear on the entry list for Roland Garros tomorrow because, as the entry deadline approached, I had made good progress in my recovery process and I want to give myself every last opportunity to be able to compete at one of my favourite events.
"This unfortunately does not mean necessarily that I will be ready to play in Paris, but that I'm doing everything possible to give myself the chance and keep a positive mindset."
The French Open begins on 28 May.
