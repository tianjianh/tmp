Northern Ireland's Finance Minister Arlene Foster has condemned a threat that caused a security alert at her County Fermanagh constituency office.

She said the threat with a "recognised code word" resulted in the evacuation of her office in East Bridge Street, Enniskillen, and nearby buildings.
Police said they closed the road after a report of a suspicious object.
The alert ended shortly before 16:30 GMT and "nothing untoward" was found. Roads and shops have reopened.
Earlier on Friday afternoon, the area between the town hall and the war memorial was evacuated by police.
In a statement, Mrs Foster said: "Those behind this alert have not just disrupted the work of my constituency office, but also many businesses in the centre of Enniskillen."
She said it had an "impact on a large number of people on a busy working day".
"It is clear that those responsible have absolutely no regard for the people of Enniskillen or anywhere else as they use the failed tactics of intimidation and threat.
"I hope that the police can identify whoever is responsible for this and ensure they are brought to justice swiftly."
Mrs Foster is a member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and has held ministerial roles at Stormont since 2007.
She has twice been acting first minister of Northern Ireland, temporarily taking on Peter Robinson's role while he stepped aside during financial and political controversies.
