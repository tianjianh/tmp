The film is written by Jonathan Brackley and Sam Vincent, directed by Bharat Nalluri and stars Kit Harington, Jennifer Ehle and Peter Firth.
The "action-packed" plot follows a terrorist who escapes from MI5 custody during a routine handover.
Mike Reaney from Isle of Man Film said it will be in cinemas in 2015.
He added: "The script is literally action-packed and audiences are going to be taken on a thrill-seeking joy ride by this widescreen version."
The multi-award winning Spooks began running on BBC One in 2002 and was screened internationally.
MHK Leonard Singer said: "It is great to have such a prestigious production here with us on the island- Spooks has a huge following around the world."
