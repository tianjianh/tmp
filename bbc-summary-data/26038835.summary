Police have issued a poster appealing for information on a missing Fife man, who disappeared in November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The missing person poster, with a new photograph of Allan Bryant, was released to mark three months since he was last seen.
The poster also asks people to check again, and to keep checking, sheds, garages and outdoor buildings.
Mr Bryant, 24, was last seen outside the Styx nightclub in Glenrothes on 3 November 2013.
Ch Insp Derek McEwan, of Police Scotland, said: "This is one of the largest missing person searches ever conducted in Fife and has seen specialist resources including helicopter, divers and search dogs used.
"We would ask everyone who has any type of outdoor structure in their garden or land to check it again, even if they have already done so, and to regularly check it for any sign of Allan.
"His family are, understandably, desperate for any news about Allan or his whereabouts and I would once again ask that anyone who has any information to call Police Scotland on 101 or through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
