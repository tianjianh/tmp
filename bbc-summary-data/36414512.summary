[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Nottinghamshire v Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brendan Taylor became the first Nottinghamshire player to score a century in each innings for 13 years in his side's draw with Durham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taylor added to his first-innings 114 with an unbeaten 105 to become the first Notts player to achieve the feat since Russell Warren at Lord's in 2003.
Michael Lumb had earlier made 52 before being caught and bowled by England prospect Scott Borthwick (3-73).
But, with Notts on 289-5, rain denied them a chance of setting a target.
Both sides take 12 points from the game.
The home side began the day on 104-1 but lost Greg Smith (21) in the first over, lbw to a low delivery from Graham Onions, who later failed to complete his 14th over because of injury.
Jake Libby made 42 as Notts were 141-3 before Taylor and Lumb put on 97 for the fifth wicket at more than six an over.
Lumb fell to a neat caught and bowled from Borthwick and the leg-spinner took his eighth wicket of the match when he had Samit Patel caught behind for 10.
Taylor was unbeaten on 105 from 81 balls - including five sixes and 10 fours - when heavy rain arrived in Nottingham.
By reaching three figures, he also became the first Nottinghamshire batsman to make a century in each innings of a match at Trent Bridge since Tim Robinson in 1989.
