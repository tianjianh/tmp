[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Poppi Iris Worthington died in December 2012, and her father, Paul, 46, and a 30-year-old woman were later arrested.
An inquest in October ruled the cause of death could not be ascertained and their bail has now been cancelled.
Police said the inquiry was continuing and a file had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration whether to bring criminal proceedings.
