[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Jamie Wallis, of Dorset Police, was charged with common assault after allegedly attacking a 30-year-old man at Bournemouth Police Station in April.
Bournemouth Magistrates' Court heard the case against the 40-year-old officer had since been discontinued.
The officer was removed from front-line duties during proceedings and this will now be reviewed, the force said.
A spokesman for Crime Prosecution Service (CPS) Wessex said it had concluded there was "insufficient evidence to have a realistic prospect of conviction".
Supt Pete Windle, head of professional standards at Dorset Police, said: "Dorset Police expects the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from its staff.
"We have a duty to thoroughly investigate criminal allegations against our staff, as we have done in this case, the details of which were then passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for their consideration and decision."
PC Wallis, who is based at Winton Police Station, had been due to appear before the court on Friday.
