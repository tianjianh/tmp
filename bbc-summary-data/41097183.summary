Len Saunders death: Youth admits cigarette punch killing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 17-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of charity worker who was punched and died after he was stopped and asked for a cigarette.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, attacked Len Saunders, 65, in St Helens in July. He died nine days later.
Liverpool Crown Court heard the youth was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time.
Mr Saunders' niece said his death was a "monstrous act".
The victim was described as an "unsung hero" of the community as a result of charity work which included delivering food to orphanages in Romania.
A local bridge will be lit up in yellow in tribute to Mr Saunders when his funeral is held.
