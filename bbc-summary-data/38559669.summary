Black face-paint Morris dancers heckled in Birmingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of Morris dancers abandoned a performance in Birmingham city centre after being heckled for their use of black face paint.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dancers, from Alvechurch in Worcestershire, were accused of being racist because some of their members' faces had been blackened.
One man filmed himself confronting them as they performed near the Bullring.
The Alvechurch Morris dancer group has not commented on the incident.

The use of black face make-up by Morris dancers has become a controversial issue, with Shrewsbury Folk Festival banning the practice after receiving complaints.
Supporters, however, say the practice dates back centuries and is not linked to race.
