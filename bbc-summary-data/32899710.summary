Hadrian's Wall of Sound: Q&A

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first ever BBC Music Day will kick off its nationwide celebration of music next Friday and includes a relay spanning Hadrian's Wall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hadrian's Wall of Sound will feature hundreds of musicians from the North East and Cumbria performing along its 73 mile (117km) length.
Here's a look at what people can expect.
The event will start at daybreak on 5 June in Bowness on Solway, West Cumbria, and finish about 14 hours later in Wallsend, North Tyneside.
A baton will be passed between performers, who will use various modes of transport, including horses, motorbikes, unicycles, and an open-top vintage bus.
There will be a diverse range of acts including a pianist performing on a white grand piano in a field, teenage rap artists, Morris Dancers, a Northumbrian piper, and a ukulele band.
Durham-born operatic bass Graeme Danby, who will be performing on top of Cawfield's Crag, said: "I am a lucky man - I get to sing opera in the world's best opera houses but occasionally I get to do something different.
"This year it is singing my own special translation to a favourite aria from Mozart's opera Magic Flute in one of the world's most beautiful spots whilst being filmed by a drone helicopter."
He will then pass the baton on the Royal Northern Sinfonia Wind Quintet.
BBC Music Day will feature programmes, events and concerts across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
More than ten UK towns and cities will host events, with a number of star names, such as Tom Jones, Lulu, producer Mark Ronson and Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor acting as BBC Music Day Ambassadors.
The aim is to bring people together through their love of music, and the public has been asked to nominate unsung heroes - people who have made a contribution to the local music scene.

There are places along the wall where people can watch the relay go through, although not all locations are suitable.
The best places to see the relay are Carlisle, Housesteads, Brocolitia Temple and Newcastle Quayside.
BBC Breakfast TV, Radio 3, and local BBC stations in Newcastle and Cumbria will also cover the event.
BBC Look North will broadcast from Segedunum Roman Fort in Wallsend for the end of the relay, and there will be full online coverage on BBC Tyne and Wear, and BBC Cumbria.
