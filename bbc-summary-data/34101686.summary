The incident happened at 20:10 BST on Friday off Commercial Road on a path between Delph Road and Bridge Street.
The boy managed to break free from the man and ran off and police were called.
Lancashire Police say the man has a distinctive floral tattoo on his right arm and they have increased patrols in the area.
Det Con Tom Wignall, of Blackburn CID, said: "The boy is understandably shaken and while incidents of this type are rare, we are treating it seriously and have stepped up patrols."
The man is described as Asian, 5ft 8ins, in his 30s, slim with a grey beard and had a white flower tattoo, possibly a rose, with green stems and yellow thorns, on his right forearm.
