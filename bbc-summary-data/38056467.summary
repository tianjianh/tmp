The proposed Pembrokeshire Food Park would be located at Withybush Industrial Estate, just outside Haverfordwest.
Hacer Developments said the park would provide one million square feet (92,903 sq m) of food production and cold storage facilities.
Pembrokeshire councillor Keith Lewis said it was "very exciting".
The park, which would also have a shared distribution network and transport hub, will target large-scale food producers as well as specialist outlets and start-up businesses.
Keith Lewis, deputy leader of Pembrokeshire council, said he was "hopeful" of support from the Welsh Government.
"A Pembrokeshire food park would provide a considerable boost for the local agricultural sector and food and drink industry," he added.
