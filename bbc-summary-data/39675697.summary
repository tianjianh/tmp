[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley 1-1 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Luke Varney scored his first goal for Burton Albion to help confirm their Championship status with a nervy draw at Barnsley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A poor Burton clearance allowed George Moncur to drill home the opener.
Brewers keeper Stephen Bywater made a string of saves before Varney met a Lasse Vigen Christensen corner to head home with his first touch.
John Brayford also made an important late block on Tom Bradshaw as Burton held on to guarantee their survival.
Nigel Clough's Brewers were rarely troubled by the hosts before John Mousinho's miscued ball out of defence was pounced upon and Moncur coolly finished.
The visitors themselves failed to seriously threaten before the break, with a wayward Jackson Irvine header moments before Moncur's strike their best chance.
The Tykes pressed for a second, with Bywater making a number of crucial interventions, including a fine effort to keep Angus MacDonald's acrobatic overhead kick out in the 51st minute.
Varney, a January arrival from Ipswich Town, made an immediate impact, scoring Burton's first-ever goal against the Tykes as he nodded beyond Adam Davies to equalise from a corner.
The forward continued to threaten as he twice tested Davies, while Kyle McFadzean went close to scoring an own goal when he sliced an attempted clearance from a Moncur cross narrowly wide of Bywater's right-hand post.
Brayford's intervention late on earned Burton the point they needed to be certain of remaining in the division for a second season, while the draw leaves the Tykes winless in nine games at Oakwell.
Barnsley coach Jamie Clapham:
"Today was always going to be difficult because we knew they were always going to get bodies behind the ball, make it tough and slow the game down, so it's nothing we didn't expect.
"Unfortunately, we just didn't have the quality to open them up. The quality that we did have was in the first half on the counter-attack and it was good, intricate play to score the goal.
"The players gave everything for the Barnsley shirt, as they have done all season, but it was incredibly difficult to break down that yellow wall.
"The season's not over. We're really looking forward to going to Newcastle and spoiling their party."
Burton boss Nigel Clough:
"I'd say this is our greatest achievement because of the clubs we have been up against this season and the strength of the league.
"To get 52 points and survive is a bigger achievement than actually reaching the Championship.
"We have had to play the likes of Newcastle, Aston Villa, Derby and Sheffield Wednesday, week in, week out, so there are no easy games.
"You look at the resources and we are on a par with a lot of teams in League One, but we're not on a par with anyone in the Championship.
"You have to embrace that and say 'we are the smallest club' and get like-minded players who want to come and fight against the odds."
