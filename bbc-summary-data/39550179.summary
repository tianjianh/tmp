Crewe created the first real chance in the 28th minute when Callum Cooke's deflected strike was spilled by Jonny Maddison, but Liam Shephard cleared the ball to safety.
But Yeovil took the lead in the 29th minute when Khan set up Dolan from a free-kick and the midfielder curled an effort into the top right-hand corner.
Right on the stroke of half-time the Glovers doubled their lead as another Khan set-piece found Akpa-Akpro to head home.
In the second half Akpa-Akpro had an effort ruled out for handball.
However, Yeovil managed to score a third through Khan, who netted from close range after Francois Zoko had hit the crossbar.
