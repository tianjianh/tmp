[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon is to take the SNP's election message to Orkney and Shetland as campaigning continues across the country.
Elsewhere, Labour will say the low paid would be better off under its tax plans.
The Conservatives will highlight their plans to help the next generation get on in life.
And Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie will visit an outdoor adventure centre in the Borders.
Ms Sturgeon said she would use her visit to the Northern Isles to highlight the SNP's "record of delivery" for Scotland's islands.
And she said empowering island communities would be a key feature of a re-elected SNP government.
Speaking ahead of the visit, Ms Sturgeon said: "Our island communities are part of the fabric of Scotland, and after years of neglect by the previous Labour/Lib Dem executive the SNP government has done everything we can to support them."
She said her government had invested in island health and education services, supported island economies, increased the Air Discount scheme from 40% to 50% and completely frozen ferry fares for 2016-17 across Scottish government-funded services.
Ms Sturgeon added: "By giving both votes to the SNP in this election, people in Orkney and Shetland will be voting for a government which is absolutely determined to realise the potential of our island communities."
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale will visit a cafe in Leith, where she will focus on the party's plans to increase income tax for those earning more than Â£150,000 from 45p to 50p
She will argue that those on the lowest incomes would be better off under Labour's plans for income tax - which would also see the other bands raised by 1p - and a new fair property tax.
Speaking ahead of the visit, Ms Dugdale said her plans were "fair, reasonable and the only way to stop cuts to our public services", with the wealthiest people being asked to pay more "to protect our public services and to reverse Tory cuts".
She added: "That means that those on the lowest incomes, under Â£20,000, will not pay a penny more than they do today and hundreds of thousands of families will be better off.
"Nicola Sturgeon is continuing to oppose a 50p rate of tax. She won't ask the richest 1% in Scotland to pay their fair share but she will ask our children to pay the price in cuts to schools."
Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson will highlight her plans to "ensure the next generation get the skills and training they need to get on in life".
She will highlight three key Scottish Conservative commitments:
Ms Davidson said: "We need to redress the balance between vocational and academic education in this country.
"The SNP has raided Scotland's colleges and it's time we invested properly in skills training again.
"Everyone leaving school should be able to get the training and qualifications they need to get a highly skilled and well-paid job."
Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie will visit Go Ape in Glentress Forest, near Peebles, where he will speak about the scale of the challenge Scotland is facing to meet its green emissions targets.
Mr Rennie claimed the Conservatives in Westminster are "slashing green budgets" and the SNP are "taking their marching orders from airlines on an Air Passenger Duty cut that would mean big increases in emissions".
He added: "We need to see action across the board to help get Scotland greener. That means boosting renewable energy, supporting green transport, improving energy efficiency and much more.
"The SNP have left us with a lengthy to-do list if we are to reach our climate change targets.
"Liberal Democrats will take the urgent steps required to start meeting Scotland's green goals."
