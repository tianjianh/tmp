World number 96 Broady, who beat former Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki in the previous round, was soon 3-1 down to 2014 Wimbledon finalist Bouchard.
And in only her second WTA semi-final, the 26-year-old lost the opening set to her Canadian opponent in 38 minutes.
Bouchard, the world number 52 who won the only previous meeting between the pair in 2012, triumphed in 76 minutes.
Broady had three break points in the eighth game of the second set to level at 4-4 but was unable to take them.
Bouchard will next face 21-year-old Ukrainian Elina Svitolina, the second seed and ranked 19th in the world. She beat China's Lin Zhu 6-3 6-3.
Broady, meanwhile, has withdrawn from the Indian Wells event which starts on Monday.
She wrote on Twitter: "I've never played there before and was really looking forward to it but I need to look after my body."
Elsewhere, British number two Heather Watson reached the semi-finals of the Monterrey Open.
The 23-year-old beat second seed Caroline Wozniacki 7-5 6-4 in the quarter-finals and will meet France's Caroline Garcia in the last four.
