Council paints 60cm double yellow lines in Leicester street

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A small section of double yellow lines, measuring roughly 60cm (2ft), cost a council about £1 to paint.

The lines on Chatham Street, Leicester, have been in place for some time but were repainted earlier in November.
They were spotted by a Leicester Mercury reader who asked whether they were "the smallest double yellow lines in Leicester?"
The city council said the area helped to differentiate between a disabled parking bay and a regular parking bay.
A spokesman said: "We no longer use a small section of yellow line to differentiate between bays in this way, but as this one was already there it has been renewed as part of a wider programme of yellow line-painting along Wellington Street.
"The work will have been carried out under our wider road-marking budget so the costs of that specific bit being renewed are probably around £1."
