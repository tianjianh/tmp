UCI Track Cycling World Championships: Archibald picked for GB team

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Katie Archibald has been selected to be part of Great Britain's team for the UCI track cycling World Championships in London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]

Archibald, 21, has recovered sufficiently, however, to be included in the women's endurance team.
Fellow Scot Callum Skinner will be part of the men's sprint quartet.
Full Great Britain team for the UCI Track Cycling World Championships (2-6 March):
