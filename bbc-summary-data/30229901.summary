Izzy the green sea turtle has survived being hit by a boat, fought off a crocodile attack, and spent more than a year in hospital.
But after being cared for by staff at the Reef HQ Aquarium in Townsville, Australia, she's just been released back into the wild of the Great Barrier Reef.
They've attached a satellite tag to her so they can keep an eye on how she gets on.
Watch Ayshah's report for more on Izzy's extraordinary journey.
