A poll of Northern Ireland business leaders by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has delivered a gloomy assessment of the future implications of Brexit.

The organisation had been pro-remain in June's UK referendum on EU membership.
On Tuesday, it conducted an electronic poll of 100 business representatives attending a post-Brexit seminar.
Following the survey, the CBI said that none of the participants identified "a positive impact" from a UK exit.
It suggested 92% of those polled "believed the impact of Brexit will be negative on the Northern Ireland economy over the next five years".
The businesspeople also felt the downside would be worse in Northern Ireland than in other parts of the UK.
CBI's Northern Ireland chairman, David Gavaghan, said: "Whatever the actual outcome of the negotiations over the next period, our members recognise the fundamental need to get on with it.
"We need to work together to identify key economic priorities and ensure that we do everything we can, within our power, to make this a great place to invest and do business."
