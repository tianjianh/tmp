Boycott wants to stand for election at the club's annual general meeting.
Chairman Steve Denison is against the former president's return because he wants stability and has asked members not to vote for him on 26 March.
"Come on Geoffrey... Back down. This is doing nothing for our great club," tweeted ex-Yorkshire skipper Vaughan.
Asked what his solution was to the financial situation at the club, Vaughan subsequently tweeted: "Let the experts on finance deal with it... not cricket experts."
Former England opener Boycott, a BBC Test Match Special summariser like Vaughan, made 414 first-class appearances for Yorkshire between 1962 and 1986, and was club president from 2012 to 2014.
The 75-year-old former Yorkshire captain, who acts informally as an overseas ambassador for the county, is unhappy at the club's level of debt, reported to be in excess of £20m.
He told BBC Look North earlier in the week: "I'm not trying to create any trouble. If you carry on with the debt as it is, there won't be a club in existence as it's a recipe for bankruptcy.
"The debt's gone from £5m in 2002 to £24m in 12 years, so the businessmen on the board haven't done a very good job have they?"
Yorkshire recently posted a profit of £368,000 after tax for 2015.
It was their first profit announcement since 2009.
