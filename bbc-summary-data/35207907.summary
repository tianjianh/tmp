Martin Hamilton's body was found near West Calder in West Lothian on 17 December.
Officers are now working in the Mosside area of Blackburn.
Police believe Hamilton, who suffered serious injuries before he died, was murdered soon after he was last seen in Glasgow in April.
Det Supt Kenny Graham said: "Whilst examinations and searches are ongoing near West Calder where Martin Hamilton's remains were found, we are now conducting further work in nearby Blackburn.
"As the investigation has progressed we have identified this area of Blackburn as of interest, and I am keen to speak to anyone living or working here who may have any information which could assist.
"As well as some search activity, officers will be carrying out extensive house-to-house inquiries and high-visibility patrols of the area."
Hamilton, from Glasgow, was previously one of Scotland's most wanted men.
He was released from prison in September 2014 but was sought by police in April for breaching the terms of his licence.
At the time, police described him as "potentially dangerous".
In October, an appeal was made on the BBC's Crimewatch programme and the Crimestoppers charity also offered a reward of Â£2,000 for information leading to his arrest.
Hamilton was nicknamed the Blackhill Butcher, after the Glasgow housing estate from which he operated.
He had been on the police's most-wanted list before he was jailed in 2000 over a string of charges including drug dealing, torture, abduction and sodomy.
Hamilton was sentenced to a minimum of nine years in prison after being found guilty at the High Court in Inverness.
The case was moved 200 miles from Glasgow amid fears that witnesses could be intimidated.
Hamilton had evaded justice on 12 previous occasions when witnesses were too terrified to testify.
