Nye Frankie Newman, from Guildford in Surrey, died on 1 January, his parkour group said.
The 17-year-old was a keen participant of the sport, in which people climb and jump over obstacles and buildings.
Luke Stones, a fellow member of the Brewman parkour group, rejected suggestions Mr Newman had been "train-surfing" at the time of his death.
The cause of Mr Newman's death is not yet known.
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: "We are providing support to the family of a British national following their death in France."
Mr Stones described Mr Newman as "an incredible human being who was always up for anything" and "experienced things in his short life that many won't experience in their lifetimes".
He said his friend always gave a "positive outlook to any situation" and "inspired so many people through his enthusiastic lifestyle".
Photos posted on social media showed Mr Newman leaping between buildings in Hong Kong and somersaulting on the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.
Joe Groombridge, from Aldershot, wrote on Facebook: "Devastated to hear this. Had the pleasure of knowing Nye Frankie Newman for a number of years and from a young age he was always wild and eccentric with so much to give.
"Stories I've heard of his travels tell me he lived his life in the exact same way inspiring people across the world doing what he loved most. Taken too soon, RIP."
James Dickson wrote: "Such an inspirational guy has just lost his life, it's such a shock and just shows us that life is delicate, Nye lived his life to the fullest and will be missed by many, rest in peace man."
On New Year's Eve, Mr Newman posted on Facebook: "2016: Greece, Morocco, Spain, France, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Finland, China, the Philippines, Hong Kong and the Netherlands.
"It's been a hectic year full of lots of mental memories."
An event is being organised in his memory in Guildford in March.
