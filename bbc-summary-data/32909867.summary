Police are investigating a report that two planes may have flown under a bridge in an incident of "unofficial aeronautical acrobatics".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three aircraft, thought to be seaplanes, were seen flying past the Kessock Bridge to Inverness at about 13:15 on Tuesday.
Two of the planes were said to have flown underneath the bridge.
They were then reported to have met up with the third aircraft before continuing their flight.
Police have launched an investigation and appealed for information about the incident.
Pictures of three aircraft, one a seaplane, over Inverness on the day of the incident have emerged.
The images, released by a Highlands-based freelance photographer, show the planes in a loose formation over the city but not near the bridge.
Some pilots have previously been criticised for risky flying in the Highlands.
In the summer of 2003, two Spanish pilots received a police warning after they flew light aircraft under Ballachulish Bridge on Loch Leven.
The incident came just three weeks after a helicopter was reported to have flown under the Skye Bridge twice on successive days.
Police investigated claims in June 2006 that four microlight helicopter pilots flew through the RAF's bombing range near Tain in Easter Ross.
The incident, which drew an official complaint from the RAF, came just days after the same pilots were spotted flying under a railway viaduct at Croy, Inverness-shire.
It was also alleged that they flew low over Dunrobin Castle, near Golspie.
