They are receiving medical attention and none is believed to be seriously hurt, Oslo police said.
According to one report, some 1,800 students were attending a show by American house DJ Steve Aoki at Sentrum Scene at the time.
The premises were evacuated and cordoned off, and firemen secured the site.
One student told Norway's NTB news agency "it was total chaos".
Aoki said he was "saddened and shocked" by the incident.
