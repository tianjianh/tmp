Thiago turned in a cross from outstanding winger Kingsley Coman to put Bayern ahead after nine minutes.
Coman set up Muller to volley in his 26th goal of the season before Muller steered in the third after the break.
Substitute Robert Lewandowski raced clear for the fourth before Thiago tapped in from another Coman assist.
Second-placed Borussia Dortmund play at home to Mainz on Sunday (16:00 GMT).
Bayern, who rested Arjen Robben, Arturo Vidal and Douglas Costa, are at home to Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday night with the last-16 tie level at 2-2 from the first leg.
Pep Guardiola's side will go into that game on course for a fourth successive domestic title as they won for the first time in three Bundesliga games.
Werder Bremen had won their previous two league games and lost just one of their last five to enhance their prospects of avoiding relegation.
But they were also below full-strength, notably missing former Bayern striker Claudio Pizarro, and were no threat to the champions who had chances to make their 12th league home win in 13 attempts more emphatic.
The two sides meet again in the semi-finals of the German Cup in April.
Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola:  "People think it's easy to win 5-0, but every game is like a final for us to stay ahead of Dortmund."
Bremen coach Viktor Skripnik: "No matter what team comes here, if they have 20 or 30 per cent ball possession, it looks like they don't want to (compete). We did everything. Bayern are Bayern."
