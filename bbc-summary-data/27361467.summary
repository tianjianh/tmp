A new principal has been appointed at an independently-run academy in Manchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andy Griffin will become principal at Manchester Academy in Moss Side. Mr Griffin was previously the head at Broadoak School in Partington.
The academy, which is state-funded but run by the United Learning charity, has about 900 pupils aged 11-18.
Mr Griffin said: "Its popularity as a local school reflects its current success and future potential."
The current principal, Dr Antony Edkins, is leaving to become chief executive of a charitable trust running six academy schools in the Midlands.
Manchester Academy has agreed to a request from the city council to take on an additional Year 7 class from September due to the demand for places, United Learning said.
United Learning runs 49 schools across England educating about 36,000 pupils.
