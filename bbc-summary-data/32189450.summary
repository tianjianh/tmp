The Prodigy have topped the Official UK album chart for the sixth time.

Their new album, The Day Is My Enemy, outsold the competition - including Sam Smith and Ed Sheeran -  despite receiving mixed reviews.
Described as "a full-throated return to form" by The Guardian, it was panned by Rolling Stone magazine, which called the songs "obnoxious and samey".
The Essex band pushed last week's number one, Chaos and the Calm by James Bay, down to number two.
Their previous number one albums are: Music For The Jilted Generation (1994); The Fat Of The Land (1997); Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned (2004); Their Law: The Singles 1990-2005 (2005) and Invaders Must Die (2009).

In the singles chart, Jess Glynne held on to the top spot, despite strong competition from Ed Sheeran and Rudimental, whose track Bloodstream had been the biggest-seller at the start of the week.
Glynne's upbeat pop anthem Hold My Hand sold 80,000 copies over the last seven days - outperforming Sheeran's single by just 5,000 units.
It is British singer's first solo number one. She previously topped the charts as a featured vocalist on songs by Clean Bandit (Rather Be) and Route 94 (My Love).
James Bay was at number three with Hold Back The River, followed by pop newcomers Years & Years, whose single was the most-streamed track of the week.
King notched up 1.96 million plays, putting it just ahead of Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk, at five.
Elsewhere, Australian pop singer Sia saw a sales boost after performing on the semi-finals of The Voice last week.
Her album, 1,000 Forms of Fear, jumped 19 places to number five; while the song she played on The Voice, Elastic Heart, jumped from 23 to 10.
Sia's 2014 single Chandelier also celebrated its 40th week in the chart by climbing three places to number 29.
Meanwhile, the 90th edition of the Now... That's What I Call Music series sold 264,000 copies last week, topping the compilation charts.
