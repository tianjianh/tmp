A statement from Scottish Water said: "Repair work is now completed on a faulty valve in Edinburgh.

"There was a risk the supply could again be affected in parts of the Old Town and New Town this morning.
"A team of our engineers have been on site all morning working on the valve and the surrounding network, trying to keep as many customers on their normal supply as they could."
