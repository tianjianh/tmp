[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cy Cooper, 44, was pulled from the blaze at the property on Bluebell Close at about 00:25 BST on Wednesday, but was pronounced dead at the scene.
A post-mortem examination revealed he died from multiple injuries, none of which was related to the fire.
Paul Anthony Noel Cain, 23, of no fixed abode, is to appear before Sheffield Magistrates' Court later.
Three men and a woman, who were all initially arrested on suspicion of murder, have been released without charge.
Detectives said the fire was being treated as arson and a joint investigation with South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue was under way to confirm the cause.
