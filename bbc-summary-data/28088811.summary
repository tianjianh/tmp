Most people starting a new activity need extra motivation and encouragement. A coach's support and enthusiasm can make a huge difference to the enjoyment and participation in an activity.
With the right training, a coach can help to develop important life skills in their players such as team work, respect, goal setting, confidence and control.
There are many different reasons to become a coach, and the good news is that you don't have to have had a sports background to start. Many people get into coaching as a way of giving back to their community. Inspired to be a coach yet?
Coaching is a great way to express your passion for a sport and be actively involved instead of standing on the sidelines.
It is not only exciting and self-satisfying but you can have a positive influence on people's lifelong involvement in sport. It will also help you to keep active, both mentally and physically.
There are many ways in ways to get involved, such as helping your local club, getting involved in your children's sporting activities or even helping to support the next elite sports star!
It's social, it's helpful and it keeps you on your toes.
The best starting place for trying out coaching is to assist a coach. Most coaches will be grateful for any help you can give. So why not try it out? What do you have to lose?
In England, contact your nearest county sports partnership, in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland contact your home country sports council.

"The most satisfying part of being a coach has to be seeing the little smiles on the kids' faces when they are having fun, whilst they are learning and improving their skills."
Cycling coach, Caitlin Tromans
"I can't pinpoint a day or event where I decided to begin coaching, so the trigger was probably a combination of things: realising there is more to life than work and Game of Thrones, seeing that a lack of javelin coaching in my home town 15 years ago had turned into a complete absence, my waistline.  Whatever it was, something clicked and I decided now was the time."
Javelin coach, David Turner
I hated PE at school. I was clumsy, awkward, and always picked last for the team but I was lucky to discover my local rowing club when I started secondary school, and from then on I grew to love sport and understand the difference it can make to your lifeâ€¦I have a life that continues to be filled with incredible experiences, friendships and opportunities thanks to some of my coaches which is why I spend my evenings and weekends coaching. I know I can be part of creating a more fulfilling life for my athletes.
Rowing coach, Rachel Hooper
