It enabled Malcolm Turnbull to be the second world leader to contact Mr Trump, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Nicknamed "The Shark", Australian-raised Norman was world number one for 331 weeks in the 1980s and 1990s.
He is a regular golfing partner of the US president-elect.
Australia's ambassador the US reportedly contacted Norman for Mr Trump's contact details within hours of his election victory.
Mr Turnbull described his call with Mr Trump as "very warm, constructive and practical."
It is believed Prime Minister Theresa May was the ninth world leader to congratulate Mr Trump.
On Tuesday, Norman wrote in Newsweek: "I will say that I have spoken to the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, and he is on-board with wanting to see President-elect Trump succeed."
"Only time will tell, but I am optimistic and feel that it is an interesting and exciting time to be in America."
Mr Turnbull said he discussed the Islamic State group, security in the Asia-Pacific region and trade during his conversation with Mr Trump.
"We stayed in touch with both sides in the election campaign, so that... we were able to get off to a good start with the new administration," Mr Turnbull told radio station Triple M.
"I've Â­already had a good chat with the president-elect and I'm sure the very strong relationship between Australia and America will continue."
Mr Trump briefly mentioned Australia in a Twitter post on Wednesday while rejecting criticism he was not giving enough time to media interviews.
"Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me," he wrote.
Norman is also friendly with the Clintons. Former US President Bill Clinton injured his knee in 1997 while teeing off with the Australian golfer at his Florida home.
As well as his major wins at Turnberry and Royal St George's, Norman finished runner-up in two US Opens, two US PGAs and three Masters.
In 1996, Norman famously blew a six-shot lead at Augusta to hand victory to England's Nick Faldo.
