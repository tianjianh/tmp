Greece denies default accusations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greece has denied reports it is preparing to default on its loans if it cannot reach agreement on its bailout terms with international creditors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A government spokesman said negotiations were proceeding swiftly towards a solution.
Greece negotiated a three-month extension to its €240bn (£176bn; $272bn) bailout at the end of February.
The Greek government is due to pay the International Monetary Fund (IMF) €203m on 1 May and €770m on 12 May.
But reports suggest the government is rapidly running out of money. It needs to find €2.4bn to pay civil service salaries and pensions this month.
The Greek government has also dismissed media reports that it was considering calling early elections if it failed to negotiate a settlement with its international creditors.
Last week, eurozone officials said Greece only had six working days left to come up with a revised list of reforms to seal a deal on its next rescue bailout.
Eurozone deputy finance ministers want an agreement on the €7.2bn loan in time for a Eurogroup meeting on 24 April.
Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has said that Athens will not be able to service its debt without financial help from the European Union
