Bromley 4-1 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow's National League play-off aspirations were all but dashed as Bromley racked up a third straight win by triumphing 4-1 at Hayes Lane.

George Porter headed the home side in front with a bullet header in the first 10 minutes, having freed himself at the back post to get on the end of a Blair Turgott corner.
The two sides then exchanged penalties in quick succession. Richie Bennett equalised for Barrow before Turgott smashed in a similarly confident spot-kick into the top corner to restore the Ravens' lead.
Tobi Sho-Silva then moved into double figures for the season, nodding in Lee Minshull's header across goal.
In a much quieter second half, Sho-Silva tapped in his second and Bromley's fourth.
