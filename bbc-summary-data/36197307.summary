Agulla has scored 13 tries in 45 top-flight games for Bath since joining in June 2012 following his release by Leicester Tigers.
The 31-year-old has won 63 international caps for Argentina.
"It's with a heavy heart that I leave Bath, but now is the right time for me to look at other opportunities and experiences," he told the club website.
Bath are ninth in the Premiership table with one game left to play, having won only eight matches this season.
