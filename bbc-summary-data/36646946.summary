England 1-2 Iceland: How did players rate in Roy Hodgson's last game?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a night that saw England go out of Euro 2016 with a humbling, humiliating defeat by minnows Iceland that cost manager Roy Hodgson his job.

But just how bad were England's players as they suffered a 2-1 loss in the last 16 in Nice?
BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty rates the players who contributed towards one of England's most embarrassing results.
Dreadful tournament summed up by his error for Iceland's winner. Overheated again in the tunnel before kick-off. Made a couple of decent saves but damage done.

His worst night of what had been a good tournament. Recalled but was caught out for first goal and wasted any attacking positions.
No shortage of effort but still looks short of international class.
Uncertain under physical pressure from Iceland's attackers. Never looked totally settled.
Same as Smalling and the rest of England's team. Nervous, unsettled, poor.
Had a good tournament and one of just four players to start all four games, but was way off the pace on Monday. Taken off at half-time but will come again.
Struggled to make any sort of impact on this game - and indeed Euro 2016.
Another who had played well but this might just have been his worst England performance. Never seen so many passes go astray in the second half.
Surprisingly recalled despite doubts about his confidence. Won a penalty but his confidence looks shot. Substituted.
Complete nightmare. Missed a good headed chance in the second half and took a collection of the worst free-kicks and set-pieces seen at this level.
Busy early on playing on the right of the front three but completely wasted out there. Faded along with everyone else.
Nowhere near fit enough to be taken to this tournament and could not put his imprint on the game.
Plenty of pace and energy but by then the game's pattern was set.
Almost a contender for England's man of the match with his running and endeavourâ€¦in his four minutes.
