[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League strugglers Torquay United came from a goal down to seal a draw against Wrexham courtesy of a 78th-minute penalty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Harry scored from the spot for Wrexham a minute into the second half after Torquay keeper Brendan Moore brought Izale McLeod down.
The visitors broke back and levelled the scores as Luke Young was fouled and Jamie Reid levelled from a penalty.
The hosts almost found a late winner but Iffy Allen fired over.
Torquay United remain in 21st place but are now just a point off safety after Woking were beaten 4-2 at home by Maidstone United.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I am not pleased at all, it was the poorest performance we have served up.
"There was a lack of enthusiasm, passion and desire, for me. The standard I want at the football club and we have set in recent weeks, this was nowhere near that.
"If the players want to be at the club going forward, they need to perform a lot better than that."
