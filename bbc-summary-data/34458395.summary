Footage filmed by dozens of passers-by and on CCTV showed men in crash helmets smashing their way into Winsor Bishop in Norwich on 5 August.
Police soon made arrests by following a van along the A11 to near Thetford.
Five men and a 17-year-old, all from London, had previously admitted robbery at Norwich Crown Court.
Alfredo Rojasvargas, 24, and Bradley McMillan, 22, both of Islington, were sentenced to six years in prison.
Tommy McKenzie, 25, and Curtis Bradbury, both of Hillingdon, were each given six years in prison.
Mark Moloney, 18, also of Islington, was given five years in a young offenders institution.
Dillon Zambon, 17, of Islington, was given three years in a young offenders institution.
The men used a sledgehammer, pick axe handle and an axe to smash their way into the shop in London Street.
Three of the men grabbed five Rolex and Cartier watches from the shop while their accomplices revved scooters outside.
The men travelled to Norwich in a silver transit van on the morning of 5 August, parking it on land between Aylsham Road and Drayton Road, Norfolk Police said.
They then rode into the city centre on three scooters, with one driver and one passenger on each.
At about 10:50 BST they pulled up outside the jewellers where the pillion passengers began attacking the glazed door with weapons, forcing their way in.
Two of the riders held up the security shutter which had been activated, allowing the three men to get inside.
They made their getaway on the scooters.
Police said information from more than 40 999 calls from the public helped them track the offenders.
A police helicopter located them in woodland near Thetford where they were caught. All six had been arrested within an hour of the raid.
Their jail sentences "reflected the seriousness of the offence", Det Con Katie Barnard said.
