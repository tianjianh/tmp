Worlingworth barn wall deaths: Matthew Skeet's family criticises inquest verdict

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parents of a teenager killed when a wall collapsed on him at a building site have criticised an inquest jury's accidental death conclusion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Skeet, 19, and his boss Kevin Ruffles, 57, died while working on a barn conversion in Worlingworth, Suffolk in October 2010.
An Ipswich inquest jury concluded both men's deaths were accidental.
Mr Skeet's parents said Mr Ruffles was responsible for their deaths because he dug a trench that led to the collapse.
The inquest heard a digger was being used to dig a foundation trench under the gable end of the barn at the Old Maltings on Church Road and the two sub-contractors were the only workers left on site.
Mr Skeet, of Melton, was employed by Mr Ruffles, of Hollesley, who ran Peninsula Plant.
The site was being run by Elliston, Steady & Hawes (ESH) builders of Great Blakenham.
In 2014 at Ipswich Crown Court, ESH was fined Â£45,000 for health and safety offences.
Mr Skeet's mother Linda said: "I feel I've got nothing from the inquest and court case - he went to work that day and he never returned.
"Kevin Ruffles took the risks and, with 40 years of experience, he should have known better.
"Matthew wasn't killed by accident - it was sheer neglect and it was risk-taking actions killed him."
Mr Skeet's father David said: "The barn has now been re-built as homes using totally different materials - it should have been knocked down in the first place.
"We're in the year 2015 and I work on sites and know myself some firms are hot on health and safety and others are not."
Mr Ruffles' family did not wish to speak after the inquest.
After the court case, ESH offered its "sincerest sympathy" to the dead men's families.
