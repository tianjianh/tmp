Emergency services were called to Market Hill, in Sudbury, Suffolk, at about 18:25 BST after reports people were trapped.
Police said a "full-scale evacuation" had taken place in the immediate area as flames spread, with up to 20 people moved from their homes.
Three people were taken to hospital for further treatment.
The patients, a man in his 50s, a woman in her 40s and a woman in her 70s, had minor burns and were suffering smoke inhalation, East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust said.
They were taken to West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, while another patient was treated at the scene.
The cause of the fire is not yet known, Suffolk Police said.
The fire is thought to have affected several shops and adjoining flats in the centre of Sudbury. Suffolk fire service sent 15 appliances to the blaze.
Sarah Pheby, an administrator who lives across the road from where the fire broke out, said: "I could feel the heat of the flames on my face when I looked at it through the window, and that was through my double glazing.
"The first floor of the building has collapsed, it is just a shell now. The roof has gone."
Local Labour councillor Luke Cresswell said: "I saw around 20 people being evacuated. They were given covers and looked really upset.
"There were families including children. They looked really shaken up, some of them were crying.
"A couple of the young girls only looked around five or six-years-old and were very upset."
