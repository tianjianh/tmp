The 34-year-old scored 14 goals in 41 appearances last season for the Cumbrians, helping them reach the League Two play-offs.
London-born Ibehre has penned a one-year contract at Cambridge.
"I had a great time at Carlisle, but I was ready to come back home, be with my family, enjoy my football and get success as well," said Ibehre.
He continued to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "It's such a good feeling to be in and amongst it, being up there in the league and going to other grounds knowing you're the people to beat.
"But you don't get there without putting the work in. That's what I've come here to do. I've still got the buzz from being in the play-offs. I want to come here, try to ignite that and do the best I can for the club."
The former Leyton Orient, MK Dons and Colchester forward has scored 110 goals in 535 career league appearances.
