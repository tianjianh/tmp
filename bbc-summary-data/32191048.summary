[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tobacco display ban in small shops comes into force

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Legislation banning the display of cigarettes and other tobacco products in small shops in Scotland has come into force.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish government legislation is aimed at reducing children and young people's exposure to tobacco.
The ban has been in place for larger retailers since April 2013.
The Scottish Grocers Federation has claimed the move will lead to longer transaction times and inconvenience customers.
It also argues that it will make it difficult for staff to locate stock.
The new law applies to shops with a selling area smaller than 280 sq m.
Imperial Tobacco lost a legal challenge against the ban after bringing the issue before Supreme Court judges.
The company had claimed the legislation was outside the competence of Holyrood as sales supply and product safety were matters reserved to Westminster.
But a panel of five judges unanimously ruled that its challenges were not well-founded.
The law means cigarettes, cigars and rolling tobacco must be covered up.
