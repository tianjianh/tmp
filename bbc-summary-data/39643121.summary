[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in Northern Ireland have detained a Chihuahua with "serious anger issues" for "jay-walking" and biting officers' fingers.

The offender, who police dubbed "Nigel" because "he looks like a Nigel", was picked up wandering the streets of Lurgan on Wednesday morning.
"Nigel didn't want to play ball", the arresting officer said. "He's an angry wee man and is seriously anti police!"
After the comedic Facebook post, "Nigel" was reunited with his owners.
His real name was Simba, which prompted the Lion King joke that he "certainly wasn't feeling the love tonight".
Pleading for the owners to come forward in the Facebook appeal, the PSNI Craigavon officer had written: "I like my fingers and don't fancy their chances if he's here another night.
"He's currently sleeping on my jacket, which I have a feeling he's not going to let me have back."
Officers were on routine patrol when they spotted Nigel on Ashleigh Crescent in the County Armagh town at about 03:30 BST.
He was not wearing a collar and seemed to be coming from Avenue Road towards Orient Circle or Carrick Drive.
"He was subsequently arrested for jay walking, disorderly behaviour and 2 counts of assault on police," wrote the officer.
"He's got serious anger issues, and bit myself AND Big T."
The post is accompanied by a rather indignant-looking Nigel sitting in the police car.
"By the way, in this photo he's in the driver's seat. MY seat. He chased me out of my own police car!! Angry wee so and so.
"Of course, the main thing is that Nigel is safe. The roads are no place for a wee lad like him to be wandering."
There are several hashtags listed at the end of the post, including #GetNigelHome, #WeeManSyndrome and #KeepingFingersSafe
