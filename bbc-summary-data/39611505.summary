Arthur Roy Taylor, known as Archie, left his accommodation at about 09:30 BST on Saturday to take his boat out from Gwbert boat club in Ceredigion.
The vessel was found later but Dyfed-Powys Police said Mr Taylor was unaccounted for.
The coastguard completed a low tide search on Sunday and said the search was now a missing person inquiry.
A coastguard spokesman said it was "unlikely" they would be formally tasking teams to search for him on Monday morning "unless new evidence comes to light".
The matter was now one for police, he added.
Police had asked for any video or photos taken by members of the public on Saturday morning as they may have captured him sailing.
A spokeswoman said: "Mr Taylor is 5'4", of slim build and has grey hair. He was wearing a navy jumper and dark grey waterproof jacket."
