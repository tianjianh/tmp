People can be heard singing about lynching black people, saying they would not be allowed in the fraternity.
The president of the university, David Boren, says that he is "investigating".
But the head of the fraternity the students are said to have belonged to confirmed they were Oklahoma students and their chapter had been shut down.
"Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video," a statement on the fraternity's website says.
"We apologise for the unacceptable and racist behaviour of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way."
One of the chants in the videos also references lynching.
Brad Cohen, the fraternity's national president, says: "I was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video."
In a statement on their Twitter account, Sigma Alpha Epsilon at the nearby Oklahoma State University says: "The Oklahoma State chapter of SAE does not condone racist behaviour of any kind and is not associated with the individuals in the video."
They also address a picture showing a Confederate flag hanging in the fraternity's house.
"SAE doesn't endorse the Confederate flag nationally nor do we endorse it as a chapter. The flag has never been a symbol of our fraternity," they say.
The flag, which dates from about 150 years ago in the time of the Confederate States of America before and during America's Civil War, is seen by some people, especially in the southern states, as being representative of their history.
Others see it as representing slavery and racism, especially because of its use by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.
In an update on Twitter, Boren says that "such behaviour will not be tolerated" and it is "reprehensible and contrary to all of our values".
The video was first shared online by Unheard, a black student group at University of Oklahoma. How they got it, or who made the video, isn't known.
