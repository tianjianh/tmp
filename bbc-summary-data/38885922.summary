Hundreds of migrants are trying to reach the UK from Calais three months after the camp known as the Jungle closed, the BBC has learned.

Migrants are taking buses to Calais from Dunkirk. Kent MP Charlie Elphicke has called for the buses to be stopped.
The boss of the Port of Calais also said about 200 people were still being found each week in lorries.
Jean-Marc Puissesseau said more than 2,000 a week used to be detected, so the figure was down by more than 90%.
BBC reporter Peter Whittlesea said a bus driver told him migrants tried to catch buses each night but there was a maximum of 30 on each coach, and one night saw 60 try to board a vehicle.
Mr Elphicke, Dover's Conservative MP, said: "It's really important that these buses are stopped so that people can't just go to Calais, try their luck and then go back home in the evening to the camp in Dunkirk."
Mr Puissesseau said: "The detection of migrants [was] about more than 2,000 a week. Now the figures are down to 200, so it's as it was before the Jungle."
He said migrants still wanted to reach England and added: "It will take many years before they disappear, until all the wars in the Middle East stop."
Stuart Madden, manager of a Calais truck stop, said the "crisis has not gone away".
He said: "It has become less visible since the closure of the camp but certainly migrants are still going to want to get into the UK.
"Obviously the numbers are not as great as they were back in 2015, but of course if you've got lorries then the migrants are going to want to try to get on board."
