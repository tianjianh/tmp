[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wrexham found opening scorer Tuton's pace hard to counter while he and James struck before the break.
Visiting defender Jamal Fyfield was controversially sent off in the dying minutes for a challenge on Tuton.
Halifax remained two places below safety while Gary Mills' Wrexham dropped to 10th in the National League.
Speaking about the defeat and Boxing Day's 1-0 setback against Southport,Wrexham boss Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "We started the game very well and then defensively for the two goals, just very poor and it changes the game, it lifts them.
"Saturday's performance was our worst. Today we did okay in spells.
"But we can't defend like that. Did we look like scoring in the two games? I don't think we have.
"We've come up against two sides that are on the up and full of themselves and we haven't coped with it."
