[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late brace of tries from England centre Kallum Watkins earned Super League's bottom club Leeds Rhinos a stunning victory at Hull FC.

Hull were top of the table but their defeat, coupled with victory for 12-man Wigan over Wakefield, saw them drop to second, two points below the Warriors.
The hosts led 13-4 at half-time but Joel Moon's try gave the Rhinos hope.
Marc Sneyd's penalty extended Hull's advantage but Watkins scored his 99th and 100th tries for Leeds to win it.
The reigning champions remain bottom of the table and are unable to finish in the top eight, but will gain huge confidence from one of their most impressive performances of a disappointing campaign.
They made the perfect start when Liam Sutcliffe dived over in the corner in the third minute, but half-back Sneyd inspired Hull into the lead by the interval.
His 40-20 kick set the platform for Carlos Tuimavave's reply, and after Kirk Yeaman had touched down for Hull's second try, Sneyd landed a drop-goal to create a nine-point gap.
Leeds still trailed by seven with eight minutes to play, but their second-half pressure eventually told as Watkins twice went over from close range to condemn Hull to a second successive defeat.

Hull FC head coach Lee Radford: "It's a not great feeling. I can't fault the players' efforts, I thought they defended their try line for crazy periods really well, we just got undone by a couple of plays near the end.
"They had a lot more ball than we did in the second period and they got us. We know fundamentally why we got beat.
"I'm glad Leeds are not in the top eight. I felt all week, with the way they play and the tempo they play at with the ball, they could hurt us but knowing it and stopping it are two different things."
Leeds head coach Brian McDermott: "The most pleasing thing is that we've beaten a good team.
"Hull came back and got hold of the game and for us to fight and get back into the game again, is probably the first time we've done that this year.
"For the first time this year we looked like a tough team that can ride some storms during games. We didn't play with any fear of losing and that was important."
