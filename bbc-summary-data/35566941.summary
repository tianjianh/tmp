Kodjia put the Robins ahead just before the break, slotting in at the back post from Lee Tomlin's cross.
Joe Bryan came close to doubling the lead when he cut inside, before firing narrowly over the bar from distance.
But Kodjia sealed the points shortly after when he shot into the bottom corner after being picked out by Bryan.
MK Dons failed to register a single shot on target, and drop below City to 21st in the table, five points above the bottom three.
Kodjia's goals, his first in 11 league games, helped maintain Lee Johnson's perfect start as Bristol City head coach.
The Frenchman could have had a hat-trick had he been able to direct a first-half header on target, while Luke Freeman also shot wide before the break as the visitors earned a well-deserved third win in three matches.
MK Dons manager Karl Robinson:
"We were unrecognisable in many areas of the pitch and I have to take responsibility for that.
"The blame for today rests on my shoulders because my players have been outstanding this season.
"But let's be honest, I thought Bristol were just as bad as us in the first half and I think that's probably one of the worst first halves of football I've seen all season."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson:
"I think the solidarity and the team shape was the most pleasing thing for me today.
"We were dangerous throughout and we have a lot of attacking players who can cause teams a lot of problems.
"The players restricted a good MK Dons side from creating any chances and I don't think we can ask for any more really."
