After feeling ill the 24-year-old underwent tests which confirmed he has contracted nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma.
The Rochdale-born midfielder will begin a six-month course of chemotherapy.
"Nodular sclerosing is the most common of all types of Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK. Nearly six out of 10 of all diagnosed cases are this type and it is the most common type in young adults. It is usually found at an early stage when lymph glands in the neck become enlarged."

"Joe will get all the love and support we can give him as he undergoes his treatment," said Tranmere chief executive Mick Horton.
"We are stunned by this news and all our thoughts are with Joe and his family.
"We ask that the privacy of Joe and his family is respected and we will share information with supporters as and when we receive it.
"I'm sure all of our fans will join us in wishing him a full and quick recovery."
Thompson began his career at Rochdale where he made over 100 appearances for his hometown club and moved to Rovers in 2012 for an undisclosed fee.
"Joe is a fantastic young man and he will be missed around Prenton Park while he has treatment," manager Ronnie Moore told the club website.
"He has the full support of all the coaching staff and his team mates and we will do everything we can to help him make a full recovery."
