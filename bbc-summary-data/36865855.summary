[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spray-paint and stencils are being used to spell out a message urging dog owners to clean up after their pets in the Scottish Borders.

It is the latest action from the local authority to tackle the problem.
The council has also produced a video with Hawick High School, run a poster campaign and appointed two enforcement officers on a 12-month trial basis.
Councillor David Paterson said the message would be spray-painted at known dog fouling blackspots.
"The stencils use chalk-based paint which means they are temporary," he said.
"We are taking the issue of dog fouling seriously, as can be seen with this and our various other educational activities related to the responsible dog ownership strategy.
"For those not willing to listen, there is now the real threat of an Â£80 fine through the appointment of enforcement officers as part of the year-long pilot."
He said he had met the officers who were "highly trained and committed to working with the council".
"They will only issue fixed penalty notices to those who do not observe the law," he added.
