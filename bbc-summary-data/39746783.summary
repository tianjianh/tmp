Dundee: Scott Bain reveals new manager Neil McCann is aiming high

Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain says new manager Neil McCann has set them a target of not only avoiding relegation but finishing seventh.

Paul Hartley was sacked after a run of seven defeats left the Dark Blues second bottom of the Premiership.
"Now it's the bottom six, we want to finish seventh, as high as we can," said Bain. "It's been great.
"The whole vibe now is we are going to be positive and basically try and finish top of this league we are in."
Dundee, who are second bottom of the table and in the relegation play-off spot, visit Motherwell on Saturday in their first post-split match.
Well are two points and one place above McCann's side going into the game.
"Look, we lost seven in a row," said Bain. "It's not great and no-one is going to be happy about it, but we were never down in the dumps where we thought we couldn't get out of it.
"But I have definitely seen a lift from myself and from other players since the new manager has come in.
"He's come in and been very positive. He's been very instructive about what he wants us to do and the boys have really bought into what he is trying to achieve."
Beat Motherwell and Dundee could move as high as eighth depending on results elsewhere.
"It's a mini-league and we play all the teams round about us and we want to finish top of that - we want to finish seventh," said Bain.
Bain had followed Hartley to Dundee from Alloa Athletic, but the 25-year-old was philosophical about the manager's departure.
"At the end of the day it's football and it happens every week, whatever time of the season it is," he said.
The Motherwell players are also adjusting to life under a new manager, with boss Stephen Robinson having taken over from Mark McGhee in March.
And winger Elliott Frear is wary of Dundee receiving a lift from their change of manager.
"We were similar when we went to Kilmarnock when the gaffer came in," the 26-year-old said. "It changed the mood of the place and everything lifted 10 to 20%.
"So they are going to be lifted by a new manager coming in with new ideas, but it is always a bit of a unknown when a new manager comes in so you are not really sure what is going to go on.
"So hopefully we can catch them off guard, start quick and get a few early goals, which would be nice."
