Tracy Ralph, 35, from Hawkwell, Essex, was taken to hospital with pneumonia on Christmas Eve and later developed meningitis and "deadly blood clots".
Her sister-in-law Amanda Ralph started fundraising for rehabilitation and "the best prosthetic feet we can buy".
Almost Â£80,000 of a Â£100,000 target has been raised in four days.
"It's a miracle. There must be a higher power at work here," Mrs Ralph told the BBC.
"We've had contributions from all over world, people have been giving thousands of pounds. We appreciate every penny."
Tracy, a mother of two small boys, was planning on running a half marathon later this year, but had to be put into an induced coma on Christmas Day.
She was treated for meningitis, septicaemia, blood clots and bleeding on the brain, her sister-in-law said.
Doctors had to amputate her feet and legs below the knee, as well as her fingers.
She has been in intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital in London, but might soon be moved back to Southend Hospital for further treatment, Mrs Ralph said.
"We decided to start fundraising because we want to give Tracy what she needs," said Mrs Ralph.
"The house will need to be renovated, she'll need prosthetics, an adapted car, a wheelchair, support from carers - we have no idea how much that's going to cost.
"If the money's there that people have so kindly donated, at least she'll have options," Mrs Ralph added.
