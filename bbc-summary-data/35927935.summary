Bethany Gallimore, aged 14, said she was scared to leave home after the attack in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire.
Her mother Denise said she was left "physically sick" after seeing her daughter covered in blood - and then watching the brutal video hours later.
Staffordshire Police said three teenagers had been arrested.
Bethany, a pupil at Congleton High School, said she spotted a gang of about 10 around 22:30 BST on 27 March as she spoke to her mother on the phone.
"They ran to me and began crowding me, and started saying I was ugly and fat and telling me they wished I'd drop dead," she said.
"I said [to my mum] 'I'm on my way' and then that's when they hit me, just after I put the phone down.
"They said 'aren't you going to hit her back?' and I said 'no, I don't like fighting'. So they hit me again.
"It went on for 45 minutes to an hour. I knew they were kicking me but I blanked out."
Mother Denise, aged 32, said she was horrified when she saw her daughter.
"She was covered in blood. We started cleaning her up.
"We were just getting in bed and she came in crying her eyes out saying 'they've put the video on Facebook'.
"When I saw them kicking and stamping on her head I was physically sick. I never want to watch it again."
Bethany, of Mow Cop, said she was speaking out so a repeat attack does not happen to anyone else.
"I just don't want those girls walking the streets thinking they can get away with it."
Staffordshire Police said three teenagers, two aged 16 and one aged 13, had been arrested on suspicion of assault.
