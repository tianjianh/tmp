Currently, 81 pupils diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder are being taught in mainstream schools.
But the local authority wants to create units for 16 pupils each at Dunvant and Portmead primaries and Birchgrove comprehensive.
The council said numbers of diagnoses were increasing and it had launched a consultation on the plans.
Cabinet member for education Jen Raynor said there were some successful mainstream school sites.
But she added: "Creating these new units will have a significant impact on these pupils' wellbeing and increase their chances of reaching their full potential in life."
