Lachie Turner says he is ready to fight for a place in Exeter's line-up.

Turner, 28, has won 15 Australian caps, can play at centre, wing or full-back, and moved to Sandy Park this week.
But the club has a settled group of backs with the likes of Jack Nowell, Henry Slade, Sam Hill, Phil Dollman, James Short and Ian Whitten all impressing so far this season.
"I wouldn't want to go somewhere I was guaranteed a position, because you become lazy and complacent," he said.
"The growth that you get as a rugby player doesn't happen on Saturdays and Sundays, it happens through the week and to be in a position like this where you've got so many strong, talented players in my position will really benefit me individually as a rugby player, but it will also benefit the team.
"As predominantly a back three player, you've got some great people in those positions at Exeter and I'm looking forward to learning from them and being challenged by them, but also challenging them in return."
Turner helped the Waratahs to the 2008 Super Rugby final and the 2010 semi-finals and says second-placed Exeter are capable of continuing their impressive run.
"I've seen a few of their games and I've trained with the players now and seen them, and they can achieve anything," he told BBC Sport.
"They're a very talented group of players and by the end of the season, a lot of people are looking at them now wondering where they're going to be and I for one can't wait to see at the end of the year where they sit."
