Rio 2016: Bernard Tomic makes himself unavailable for Olympic Games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bernard Tomic has ruled himself out of the Rio Olympics because of an "extremely busy" schedule - and will play at an ATP event in Mexico instead.

Tomic and Nick Kyrgios had been warned by Australia's Olympic team boss that their behaviour was being monitored in the build-up to the Games.
Tomic, 23, was criticised for holding his racquet by the strings when facing a match point at the Madrid Open.
He says he made himself unavailable for Rio "with a heavy sense of regret".
The world number 22 added: "On the basis of my extremely busy playing schedule and my own personal circumstances, I am regrettably unable to commit to this year's tournament."
Tomic plans to play in the Abierto Mexicano Los Cabos, which starts on 8 August, two days after the Olympic tennis tournament begins.
Tomic's behaviour at the Madrid Open was labelled "appalling" by Australia's Olympic chef de mission Kitty Chiller, who said she would not "twist anyone's arm" to compete in Rio.
