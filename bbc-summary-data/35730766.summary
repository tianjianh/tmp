[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A newborn baby died as a result of "failings" at a hospital, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dylan Oates, from Littleborough, was four days old when he died at the Royal Oldham Hospital on 20 January 2014.
The trust issued a "sincere apology" and accepted the care which Dylan and his parents received was "sub-standard".
Six other babies and three mothers also died at the hospital during an eight-month period up to July 2014.
North Manchester coroner Lisa Hashmi said staff missed irregularities in Dylan's heartbeat as he and his mother were not efficiently monitored.
Gill Harris, Chief Nurse at The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, apologised for the "failings and sub-standard care afforded to Dylan and his parents".
She said it was a "desperately sad case" and she sincerely apologised and expressed sympathy to his parents and family for their loss.
The inquest heard his mother Jayne Oates was admitted to the hospital six days before Dylan's death as she was overdue.
After his birth, he was taken to intensive care as he was not breathing or crying and his condition deteriorated.
Ms Hashmi said Dylan had suffered neglect at the hospital and his death could have been prevented.
She identified poor midwifery leadership and staffing levels as well as ambiguities in the trust's guidelines.
Martin Oates, Dylan's father, said they were "devastated" by the loss of their baby.
He said: "This investigation has uncovered that many things should have been done differently during the days leading up to Dylan's birth.
"It gives us some comfort that as a result of this investigation improvements are being made."
