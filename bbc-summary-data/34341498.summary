The vision for a new Meadowbank Sports Centre in Edinburgh has moved a step closer after the council revealed the funding shortfall has dropped.

In February, a report estimated the project cost was £43m with a funding shortfall of between £11.3m and £19.8m.
These figures have now been revised to £42m with a shortfall of £6.8m
The new figures are in the latest Meadowbank report going to Edinburgh city council's corporate policy and strategy committee on Tuesday.
The new figures are due to increasing land values, a modified and re-costed design and "no significant issues" from a ground survey.
•An outdoor athletics track with seating for 500
•An indoor 60m six lane athletics track with jumps area
•An outdoor throws area
•A 3G synthetic sports pitch or grass pitch in the centre of the outdoor athletics track for football, rugby and other pitch sports
•An additional outdoor 3G synthetic sports pitch
•An eight badminton court sports hall with 500 permanent seats plus bleachers (the same size as the current Meadowbank Hall 1)
•A four badminton court sports hall with 500 permanent seats (the same size as the current Meadowbank Hall 2)
•A gymnastics hall, gym, studios, changing facilities, café and meeting rooms.
Andrew Burns, Edinburgh city council's leader, said: "This new figure is really encouraging and gives everyone hope that a new Meadowbank fit for the 21st Century can now become a reality.
"Obviously there is still a long way to go with a project of this scale but I want to assure everyone the council is committed to continue our exciting work on redeveloping Meadowbank.
"We will continue to explore all funding options to find the required £6.8m so the existing facility can be demolished and transformed into a brand new sports complex that would serve the sporting needs of the residents of Edinburgh and the east of Scotland."
Meadowbank was originally built for Edinburgh's 1970 Commonwealth Games.
The plans would see the existing site transformed into a new sports centre.
If the funding shortfall is found and the team are appointed in February 2016, demolition could begin next autumn with a new Meadowbank opening in Spring 2018.
