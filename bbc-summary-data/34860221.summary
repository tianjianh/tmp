Det Ch Supt David Sandall said it was proving an "extremely traumatic time for her parents" and they are now treating the disappearance of the 15-year-old, from Measham, as murder.
The teenager has not been seen since about 18:00 GMT on Friday when she was dropped off outside Ibstock Community College.
Two men, aged 27 and 28, who were arrested on Monday on suspicion of kidnap have been re-arrested on suspicion of murder.
