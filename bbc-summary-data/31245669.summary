Ethel Irene Ditcher was killed when she was struck on Leigh Road, Leigh, at about 11:45 GMT on Wednesday.
Police said a man was seen to steal her purse before leaving. Officers are still trying to locate him.
Her family said they hoped "their conscience gets the better of them and they hand themselves into the police".
The man is described as white, about 6ft (1.8m) tall, between 30 and 40, and of medium build with a brown beard.
In a statement, her nephew and niece said: "We cannot believe that someone has done this to our auntie. We are absolutely disgusted by this person's actions."
Det Sgt Neil Lawless, from Greater Manchester Police, called it "one of the most disgusting crimes" he had ever investigated.
