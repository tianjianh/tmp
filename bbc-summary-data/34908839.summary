Redruth head coach Steve Larkins says Exeter Chiefs youngster Jack Maunder is capable of playing Premiership rugby.

The 18-year-old has played three games since joining the National Two South club on loan earlier this month.
"He's just got that little bit of class about him," Larkins said after his side beat Worthing 24-16 to go sixth in their division.
"I know that Exeter watch our games now with interest, as they're watching him to move on and kick on again."
Larkins added to BBC Radio Cornwall: "He's a name that we know will be around in the Premiership in the future."
Maunder was loaned to National One side Plymouth Albion earlier this season, but did not play a game at the Brickfields.
"I didn't get the game time I was hoping for so I asked if I could move down to Redruth and get some more game time," said Maunder.
"They play a brand of rugby that suits me and suits how Exeter play as well, so I'm loving it down here."
Larkins says Maunder's fast reactions are what sets him apart.
"Every time there's a breakdown the ball's gone and that gives our 10, our 12 and our 13 more opportunities and more space," he said.
"Jack does think before he gets the ball, which is ideal - there's no hesitation, it's down and away very quickly.
"He's still young and we don't want to put too much pressure on him, but he's somebody that we're glad to have here."
