[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parents of pupils at Llysfaen Primary School, Lisvane, Cardiff, have now been told by the head teacher that the court case was the reason why David Pugh, 54, from Caerphilly, was absent from work.
Pugh pleaded guilty and was given a 32-week term, suspended for two years, at Cardiff Crown Court on Friday.
The offences did not take place at the school or involve pupils.
In a letter, headmistress Melanie Jenkins wrote that the judge had said Pugh would never work with children again.
"I will not go into the nature of the crime, but feel the children deserve an explanation for his absence," she added in another letter.
In a joint statement after the court case, the school and Cardiff council said: "None of the offences took place in the school, nor did they involve images of children from the school, and as such Llysfaen primary was not part of the Gwent Police investigation.
"The safety and wellbeing of the children are of the utmost importance and the school has strict safeguarding measures in place."
Pugh was also placed under a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years.
