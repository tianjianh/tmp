[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 37-year-old, who had already quit one-day and Twenty20 cricket, will finish his international career on home soil, in the second of the three-match Test series against India in August.
He announced his decision during the second Test match against Pakistan in Colombo and confirmed he has opted out of the third and final match.
"This is my time to call it a day," he said on Saturday.
Left-hander Sangakkara is Sri Lanka's highest run scorer and is the fifth-highest Test scorer of all time.
Since his Test debut in 2000, he has amassed 12,305 runs from 132 matches, with 38 centuries, 52 fifties and an average of 58.31.
Sangakkara played his final T20 international in Sri Lanka's World T20-winning campaign last year and his last ODI in this year's World Cup.
He signed for Surrey on a two-year contract in January, having previously played county cricket in England for Warwickshire and Durham.
