Goodship recently returned to action for Bournemouth's Under-21 side after an 18-month lay-off with a knee injury.
"Brandon has been training with us recently and has looked sharp. He has a real hunger about him and is itching to get playing and scoring goals," Yeovil boss Darren Way told the club website.
The 21-year-old was on the bench for Saturday's match against Portsmouth.
