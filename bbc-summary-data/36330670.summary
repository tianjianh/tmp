US TV network CBS has announced plans for a spin-off series of its Emmy award-winning drama The Good Wife.

The new show, which doesn't yet have a title, will premiere in spring 2017 on CBS All Access - the network's subscription online streaming service.
It will see the return of characters played in the main series by Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo.
The final episode of The Good Wife was broadcast in the US earlier this month after seven seasons.
Baranski appeared in all seven series as Diane Lockhart, a senior partner of a Chicago law firm. British actress Jumbo joined the show in its final season to play lawyer Lucca Quinn.
"The Good Wife is consistently one of our most-watched series across digital platforms," Marc DeBevoise, general manager of CBS Digital Media said.
"This new series, with the incredible storytellers and marquee talent that have signed on, is a perfect addition to CBS All Access's original programming slate."
The Good Wife creators Robert and Michelle King will co-write the first episode of the spin-off series, which is expected to be between 10 and 13 episodes long.
Ridley Scott, David Zucker, Liz Glotzer and Brooke Kennedy will serve as executive producers.
The show will pick up a year after the events in The Good Wife's finale, which has won five Emmy awards during its run.
Some fans expressed disappointment with the last episode, which will be screened in the UK in June, complaining many storylines were not properly concluded.
The Good Wife began in 2009 and starred Julianna Margulies as Alicia Florrick, who begins working as a lawyer after her lawyer husband is sent to prison.
It is not yet known if the new series will be broadcast in the UK.
