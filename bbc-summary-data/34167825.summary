The teenager was said to be climbing a pipe spanning the gorge when he lost his grip near Colin Burn off Baird Road in Armadale at about 17:50 on Saturday.
A friend raised the alarm and firefighters managed to remove him on a stretcher from the gorge about an hour and a half after the fall.
He was taken to hospital for treatment for minor injuries.
Sgt Andrew Meikle said: "An extensive rescue operation, led by the fire service, was carried out today at Colin Burn in Armadale following a report of concern for a 13-year-old boy.
"Rescuers successfully reached the youngster before moving him to safety.
"He has since been transferred by ambulance to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh for his injuries."
