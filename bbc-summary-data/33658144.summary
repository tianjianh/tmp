Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, NatWest, Santander and Virgin Money have confirmed they will offer the savings product.
It is aimed at helping first-time buyers save for a deposit and includes a government top-up.
The industry has said the scheme should run alongside building more homes.
First-time buyers purchasing an owner-occupied home worth up to £250,000, or £450,000 in London, will be eligible for a Help to Buy Isa when it launches on 1 December.
The monthly maximum contribution from savers into a Help to Buy Isa will be £200, following an initial deposit of up to £1,000, with the government adding £50 a month at the most.
The accounts will run indefinitely once opened. But if someone accumulates £12,000 over that time, a maximum of £3,000 will be added by the taxpayer.
Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that a typical first-time buyer faces paying 5.1% more for a property than they did a year ago. The average price paid for a starter home in May was £211,000.
Data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed that the typical first-time buyer needed a deposit of 18.6% in May.
Earlier in the week, accountancy firm PwC predicted more than half of the under-40s would be renting homes from private landlords in the UK in 10 years' time.
