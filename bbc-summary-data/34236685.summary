The remains of a man were found at Hollow Ponds in Epping Forest in north-east London and police said the body may have been there for several weeks.
The body was found on Wednesday evening and removed on Thursday but police have now, after post-mortem tests, confirmed they are treating the death as murder.
Officers have identified the victim but his name has not been released.
The Met said his next of kin had been informed.
The partially-buried body was found by a passer-by in undergrowth off Whipps Cross Road in Leytonstone, in a wooded area close to Whipps Cross University Hospital.
Det Ch Insp Jamie Piscopo, who is leading the investigation, said: "Hollow Ponds is a busy and popular local beauty spot, with a cafe and a boating lake.
"It is also surrounded by a number of busy roads, including Whipps Cross Road.
"We would like to speak to anyone who may have been in the area the last several weeks, and may have witnessed any unusual or suspicious activity, to come and speak to us."
