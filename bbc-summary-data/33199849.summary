After choosing to bat, Glamorgan looked in trouble on 57-4 after Australian all-rounder Clint McKay claimed two early wickets for the visitors.
Despite the efforts of Chris Cooke (84), they were still in trouble when Wagg came in at 136-6, but he hit 94, blasting six sixes and seven four.
Replying to Glamorgan's 278, Leicestershire were 37-1 at the close.
The in-form Wagg, a double centurion against Surrey last week, helped steer Glamorgan to a second batting point, sharing a partnership of 44 with Cooke before putting on a further 78 in a spectacular stand with last man Andy Carter (10 not out).
Glamorgan batsman Chris Cooke told BBC Wales Sport:
"The day was pretty much in the balance. It wasn't easy batting early on but it got a bit easier as the ball got older.
"We've played some good counter-attacking cricket this season and that worked again today as Waggy played brilliantly.
"Hopefully we can knock them over now as we feel the wicket's only going to get worse."
