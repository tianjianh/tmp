'Mystery coin' found in Jersey hoard

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "mystery coin" has been uncovered as part of work to discover the secrets of the world's largest Celtic coin hoard.

The hoard of some 70,000 coins and jewellery pieces was found by two metal detector enthusiasts in 2012.
Jersey Heritage conservator, Neil Mahrer, is working on separating the coins in full view of the public at the Jersey Museum.
He said so far experts had not been able to work out its origins due to an unusual "geometric pattern".
Mr Mahrer said: "Our Celtic coin expert Philip De Jersey has been our go-to man for instant identification of anything strange and he usually mails us straight back with our answer but this coin has stumped him.
"He reckons its Armorican but the geometric pattern is apparently unknown, which is always exciting."
This is not the only discovery made as part of the restoration work.
Mr Mahrer said on the first day of work on the hoard they found a "beautiful blue glass bead" next to a piece of silver wire.
Dr Sonia O'Connor from Bradford University said the size of the hole was too big to be a necklace piece and was likely part of a larger object.
Mr Mahrer and his team are working in a glass fronted room as part of the Treasure: Uncovering Celts and Romans exhibition at the Jersey Museum.
It is designed to allow visitors to watch as the team remove gold and silver objects as well as coins from the hoard, thought to be worth about Â£10m.
