A rocket launcher has been found at a household waste recycling centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The green launcher, about 3ft (1m) long, was discovered in a skip by staff at the Knowle Hill centre, near Exmouth.
Devon County Council said the launcher was stripped of its launch mechanism so "it could not have been used".
The centre was closed "as a safety precaution" for about an hour until police disposed of it.
