Oskar Pycroft walks as Bristol City mascot for first time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A young Bristol City football fan with cerebral palsy led his team out as mascot for the first time since an operation to help him walk.

Last year fans of the club and rivals Bristol Rovers helped raise Â£57,000 for an operation to enable seven-year-old Oskar Pycroft to walk.
Oskar took his first steps at Ashton Gate for the Championship match between City and Preston North End.
He led the team out in his wheelchair last season, ahead of the operation.
