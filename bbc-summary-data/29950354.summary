The "innovative" stage adaptation will launch in a purpose-built theatre next to Wembley Stadium in London.
It will be created by Robin de Levita, who was behind a Dutch stage show about World War Two diarist Anne Frank.
The movie adaptations of The Hunger Games have taken around $1.5bn (Â£946m) at the worldwide box office.
The latest instalment, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, will be released in cinemas later this month.
Based on the novels of Suzanne Collins, the dystopian tales follow the fortunes of Katniss Everdeen, who becomes a reluctant reality show heroine.
No further details of the production, or the plans to build a new theatre to accommodate it, have been disclosed.
Tim Phelan, chief marketing officer for Lionsgate - the company behind The Hunger Games film franchise - said the team behind the stage adaptation would "provide a uniquely immersive experience for fans around the world".
Broadway producer Mr de Levita added: "The theatre is a fantastic medium to bring the many meaningful layers of Suzanne Collins' writing to life."
