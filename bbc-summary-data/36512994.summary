CJ Stander: Ireland flanker gets one-week ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
CJ Stander will miss Ireland's second Test against South Africa after receiving a one-week suspension.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stander was sent off in Saturday's historic first-Test win in Cape Town for colliding with Patrick Lambie.
A disciplinary hearing on Sunday lasted for five hours before it was adjourned.
After a second day of deliberation, Stander was ruled out of Saturday's second Test in Johannesburg but will be available for the third in Port Elizabeth on 25 June.
Lambie was concussed in the incident and will also miss Saturday's second Test.
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt felt South-African born Stander's red card was "very, very harsh" although his team regrouped to achieve the country's first Test victory in South Africa.
"CJ had both hands extended," Schmidt said. "Once you are in the air, you cannot change your trajectory,"
"Sometimes, I think when there is an injury like that, the consequence is that a card comes out.
"I know CJ and Pat are friends. CJ was upset that Pat was hurt, as much as he was upset that he had to leave the field."
Paddy Jackson kicked 16 points, with Jared Payne and Conor Murray scoring tries as the Irish earned a thrilling 26-20 victory at Newlands despite having to play for more more than 57 minutes with only 14 players.
Ireland will clinch the series if they win in Johannesburg on Saturday.
