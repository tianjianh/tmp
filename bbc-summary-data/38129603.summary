[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon has started a two-day visit to Ireland as she looks to strengthen links between Scotland and Ireland in the wake of the Brexit vote.

The Scottish first minister is to meet President Michael D Higgins and foreign affairs minister Charlie Flanagan.
She will also become the first serving head of government to address the upper house of the Irish Parliament.
It follows a meeting with Irish premier Enda Kenny at the British Irish Council last week.
The first minister wants to expand business, cultural and political links between Scotland and Ireland under plans to strengthen relationships with EU countries.
She is also examining possible options for maintaining Scotland's links to the European single market - and has a shared interest with the Irish government in keeping the whole of the UK in the single market.
However, the Irish government's international development minister has previously been quoted as saying there would not be direct talks with the Scottish government over Brexit.
Speaking ahead of the visit, Ms Sturgeon said Scotland and Ireland had a long history of co-operation based on "shared values, close historic and cultural ties and the deep links between our people".
She added: "I'll be stressing the Scottish government's commitment to the principle of European solidarity and the benefits Scotland receives from membership of the European Single Market.
"Given the close proximity of our countries, Ireland is a strategic partner for Scotland. The opening of a Scottish Government Innovation and Investment hub earlier this year demonstrates the value we put on this relationship."
It comes as the former prime minister of Ireland, John Bruton, said he did not believe it would be possible for Scotland to remain in the European single market, if the UK as a whole leaves.
He added: "I don't see how you can have several different markets with different sets of rules and different arbitrators in different parts of what's currently the United Kingdom.
"I just don't see how that can be done. I think it's technically, administratively and politically nearly impossible".
Ms Sturgeon is to visit SSE Dublin headquarters on Monday before touring Trinity College where she is to receive an honorary patronage from the Philosophical Society and talk to students.
On Tuesday she will attend a business breakfast with 120 chief executives, before addressing the upper house of the Irish Parliament.
