The 17-year-old has been training with the Premier League club's under-21 and under-18 sides since the end of July.
"I'm very happy to have signed with Palace," he told the club's website.
"It's a very good place for wingers. I'm a right winger, but I can play anywhere. I'm left-footed, so I like to cut inside to create chances to score."
