The callback affects products sold between September 2010 and June 2012.
The US Consumer Safety Commission (CPSC) said more than six million of the affected cables had been sold in the US and Canada alone.

The announcement comes nine months after a separate issue forced the company to pull its Chromebook laptops from sale after reports that their chargers had been overheating.
The latest case involves power cords marked with LS-15 on their sides that were sold alongside HP and Compaq "notebook" and "mini notebook" PCs as well as other hardware.
