Kieran McQuillan, who was from Elgin, died following the accident which happened on Brechan Rig, in the town at about 17:30 on Friday.
Police said he may have been riding a white scooter at the time.
They have appealed for anyone who saw the Red Renault Master van or Keiran in the area before the accident to contact them.
Kieran had fair hair and was wearing a blue top and blue jeans.
Sgt Steve Manson, of Police Scotland, said: "Our thoughts continue to be with Kieran's family and friends at this time.
"Local residents may see and increased police presence in the area while we continue our investigations into the collision and anyone with any information who hasn't yet come forward can speak with these officers or alternatively contact Police Scotland via 101."
The van was being driven by a 46-year-old man who was uninjured.
A friend of Kieran's family has set up a JustGiving page to help pay for his funeral.
