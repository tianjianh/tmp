Loom bands dress to be put up for auction again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dress made from loom bands will be put up for sale again after two deals to buy it fell through.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dress sold in an online auction last week for a top bid of £170,100 after being modelled by 12-year-old Sian from Prestatyn in Wales.
When that deal failed, the makers of the dress were hoping to agree a "second chance" offer of £150,000.
But the second chance bidder didn't respond by 3pm on Wednesday - the deadline for them to buy the dress.
Sian's mum, Helen, told Newsround today that they'll re-list the dress for only three days and she "hopes this time we get genuine bids".
Helen says they'd do things a bit differently to avoid the auction getting out of control again.
For example, bidders will have to email her first with their bid, before it is accepted.
Helen told us that as with the first time around, "anything over £50 is a bonus".
Although the dress hasn't sold, Helen says Sian has thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
She's even made her a scrapbook of all the media coverage that the loom band dress has received, including Sian's visit to Newsround's studio.
But Helen said the family "are ready to go back to normal and get on with our lives."
