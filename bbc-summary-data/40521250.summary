The 26-year-old scored 25 league goals in his three seasons at Swindon, including six in League One last term.
He is new Oxford United manager Pep Clotet's first signing at the club.
"There was a lot of interest early on," Obika told BBC Radio Oxford. "As soon as I spoke to the management team and saw their desire about the project at this club, that was the big pull."
