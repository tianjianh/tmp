A series of events will be held across Wales this weekend to commemorate the 70th anniversary of VE Day - the end of World War Two on the continent.

Beacons were lit on Friday evening at the castles in Cardiff, Kidwelly, Beaumaris, Burry Port, Swansea, Welshpool, Brecon, Blaenau Gwent and Craig-y-Dorth in Monmouth.
It followed a two minute silence observed across the country on Friday.
On 8 May 1945 hundreds of beacons were lit to celebrate the end of the war.
Events this weekend in Wales include VE Day exhibitions, bell ringing at cathedrals and numerous 1940s themed parties and celebrations.
