Wrexham caretaker manager Dean Keates has warned the club's players they are on "trial" as the club seeks a new boss following Gary Mills' sacking.

Keates, along with Joey Jones and Andy Davies, was again in charge for Wrexham's shock 3-2 FA Cup qualifying replay defeat by Stamford on Tuesday.
"They're on trial. You don't know who's in the stand. You don't know whoever's watching," said Keates.
Wrexham host Bromley in the National League on Saturday.
Keates says aspects of their loss to Stamford underlined how much better things could be at the Racecourse.
The home fans roared Wrexham on as they tried to fight back with a spirited response after they went 2-0 behind.
"The fans have every right to feel hurt. It's a fan-owned club.
"They want people out there who are passionate about representing them and we said to them for that 10 minutes you've seen what it's about and what the fans can be like - they'll push you on.
"The lads need to take that on and multiply it by nine and get it done for 90 minutes."
Macclesfield manager John Askey has been touted as favourite to succeed Mills while Wrexham legend Mickey Thomas believes Keates could hold on to the role.
Keates says Wrexham's players must perform well to impress any new boss.
"If the manager's not here, it might be his agent, it might be his assistant manager," said Keates.
"The lads who are scouting for the jobs have got the chance to see the players who represent the football club from now until April.
"They have to make sure that... they're doing what they need to be doing give themselves a chance of having a job."
