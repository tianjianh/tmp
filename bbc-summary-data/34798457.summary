The 23-year-old was suspended by the Gulls last week following an alleged incident in a nightclub in Torquay.
He can play in either defence or midfield and is Torquay's leading scorer this season, with seven goals.
"He has plenty of experience and knowhow at this level and higher up, so I'm sure he'll be a real asset for us," Guiseley boss Mark Bower told the club website.
Hurst, who began his career at West Bromwich Albion, signed a one-year deal with Torquay in the summer.
