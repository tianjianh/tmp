Hatton Garden Safe Deposit, which had up to Â£200m of jewellery stolen in April, has gone into liquidation.

Stella Davis at law firm SPW confirmed the company is insolvent as it "owes money to companies and people".
The Easter weekend raid saw thieves drill a hole into a vault before ransacking 73 safety deposit boxes.
Nine men are due in court on 4 September charged with conspiracy to burgle.
They are also charged with conspiracy to conceal or transfer the jewellery.
