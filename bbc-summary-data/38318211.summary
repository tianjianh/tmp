The inquest heard a member of staff at the KC Grande Hotel attempted to wake Miss Freestone when she was found lying on her back on the beach at about 09:00.
She was taken to a nearby clinic but was confirmed dead from asphyxiation caused by drowning.
Statements taken at the time said no-one had seen her in the water.
The teenager's mother Fiona Freestone paid tribute to her daughter during the inquest.
Miss Freestone was "extremely close" to her twin sister Sophie, the coroner was told.
Fiona Freestone said: "Together they would sing, dance, mountaineer, and scuba dive.
"Bryony achieved excellent GCSE and A-level results and went on to study geography at Exeter University, a subject she was passionate about.
"I would describe Bryony as gregarious, a loving personality.
"At her funeral, someone described Bryony as being someone who laughed a lot - she knew it was good for the soul and lived her life with a smile.
"She saw the beauty in the world and was not ever afraid to chase it.
"We love and miss her very much."
