The communications officer allegedly shoved Pinilla at half-time in a game Brazil eventually won on penalties after it had ended 1-1.
Paiva is banned for three matches, with a fourth suspended for two years.
That means he will miss Tuesday's semi-final against Germany.
He will also not be involved in either the final or the third-place match.
Paiva has already served one part of his three-game ban after missing the 2-1 quarter-final win against Colombia on Friday.
He has also been fined 10,000 Swiss francs (Â£6,500).
