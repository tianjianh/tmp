Tuesday's winning numbers were 01, 05, 09, 22 and 38 and the winning Lucky Star numbers were 02 and 10. The top prize was £51,818,873.
Four ticket holders matched five numbers and one lucky star to win £207,523 each and 12 people matched five numbers to claim £23,058.
National Lottery said it was the third Euromillions jackpot to be won in the UK so far this year.
"National Lottery players in the UK are enjoying a fantastic run of luck on Euromillions," said a spokeswoman.
"We urge all players to check their tickets, to see if they have scooped the £51.8m jackpot, so they can begin to enjoy their life-changing win as soon as possible."
Just weeks ago a British player was the sole winner of a £24.6m Euromillions jackpot.
A ticket holder in Ireland claimed a 66m euro (£50m) share of the jackpot in February.
Last week, a £35.1m National Lottery jackpot, the biggest in the UK game's history, was won by a single ticket.
