Bristol City 2-3 Reading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yann Kermogant scored two late goals as Reading came from behind to snatch victory against Bristol City.

Tammy Abraham gave Bristol City the lead when he pounced on a rebound, before doubling his side's lead minutes after the break from the spot after Tyler Blackett felled Callum O'Dowda.
Liam Kelly began Reading's comeback before Kermogant lashed home an equaliser with four minutes to play.
And the striker struck again with a superb effort to win it for the Royals.
Reading, who began the day in third place in the Championship table, were looking for their third straight victory after their final game of 2016 against Fulham was abandoned due to fog.
But it was City, who have now lost nine of their last 10 games, who took a surprising 2-0 lead courtesy of top scorer Abraham's brace following Reading's defensive errors.
Goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi's poor pass out fell to Joe Bryan which led to Abraham's first, before the Bristol City striker added his 17th goal of the season in all competitions, after Blackett's clumsy challenge in the box.
Reading began their charge in the 72nd-minute through substitute Kelly, before Kermogant netted twice in seven minutes to complete the comeback in stoppage time, and they remain third in the Championship table, while Bristol City fall one place to 18th.
Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"We're very pleased with that, in terms of how we played as most of the time we controlled the game and scored three goals in the second half as well to win.
"At times in the first half, we were careless giving the ball away allowing them to break on the counter.
"We needed to step up and be better than that in the second half. After conceding a second goal, we stuck to our plan and were patient.
"We got our crisp, quick passing going and that's what we did right up until the end of the game."
