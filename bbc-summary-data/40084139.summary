Figen Murray hailed the support at a vigil celebrating the 29 year old's life in Heaton Moor Park in Stockport, Greater Manchester, on Sunday.
Mr Hett was one of 22 people killed in the suicide bomb attack on 22 May.
Mrs Murray said his friends were "all very tearful and yet they said the most beautiful things about him".
A Coronation Street-themed cake was among the tributes at the vigil for Mr Hett, who had a tattoo of the soap's stalwart Deirdre Barlow.
Members of his family also wore personalised T-shirts with tributes from celebrities including singer Mariah Carey and BBC Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw.
Speaking in front of hundreds of people who attended the vigil, Mrs Murray said: "I know I've lost a son to this horrible event but they were his friends before and I've gained more sons now."
She also spoke about a hashtag #BeMoreMartyn which was being used to pay tribute to Mr Hett on social media.
"I don't know how that came about and who started it but I'm going to have it tattooed somewhere on my body. I think he's taught us all a lesson how to live life more fully," Mrs Murray said.
Mr Hett's partner Russell also paid an emotional tribute to the "Deirdre to my Ken" on stage at the vigil.
"I feel robbed of my future, but I feel so grateful of my past", he added.
Mr Hett died just days before he was due to fly to the USA for a two-month "trip of a lifetime" for which he had been saving for two years.
