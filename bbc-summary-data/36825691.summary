A pair of Korean artists have used facial recognition software to spot "cloud faces" in the sky over Bradford.

Hundreds of images were taken by Shinseungback Kimyonghun using a CCTV camera on the roof of Bradford's National Media Museum in June.
The duo said while "humans see figures in clouds... algorithms sometimes find faces where there are not any".
The pair have chosen 27 images to make Cloud Face for the museum's In Your Face show, which opens on 23 July.
They said the pictures are "a result of computer's vision error, but they often look like faces to human eyes too", having fed the images through a computer at their base in Seoul.
The museum's senior exhibitions manager John O'Shea said the show "takes a closer look at our fascination with faces".
