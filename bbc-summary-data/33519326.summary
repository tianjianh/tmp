Harrogate's Great Yorkshire Show gets under way

The Great Yorkshire Show agricultural event is under way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thousands of people are expected to flock to Harrogate for the farming extravaganza, which is in its 157th year.
The Prince of Wales, who became its patron in 1998, will be in attendance along with the Duchess of Cornwall.
Organisers hope to smash the current attendance record of 135,111 over three days, set in 2006. It fell just short last year with 130,949 visitors.
There will be more than 1,200 stands and almost 13,000 entries this year, for competitions ranging from show-jumping to sheep-shearing.
Show director Bill Cowling will be stepping down after ten years at the helm.
He said: "This will be our 157th show and as ever it, it will be the perfect platform for the best of British farming as well as a fun day out for all the family."
The 2012 event was cancelled after one day for the first time in its history due to heavy rain, at a cost of Â£2m.
The forecast on the first day will be mainly dry with the possibility of a few showers.
