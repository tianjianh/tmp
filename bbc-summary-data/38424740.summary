St Mirren 1-1 Greenock Morton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricki Lamie's first ever Morton goal snatched his side a point in added time against Renfrewshire rivals St Mirren.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The defender fired home from close range after the Buddies failed to deal with a late corner.
Saints had taken the lead from a first half set piece that Gary MacKenzie headed home.
Three points had seemed even more likely for the hosts when Morton's Jamie McDonagh was red carded for kicking out.
Lamie had already hit the crossbar in Paisley when his header cannoned back off the woodwork at the end of the first half.
But his maiden goal in two-and-half-years at the Greenock club came in the last seconds of the game to break the Buddies' hearts.
St Mirren's goal arrived when Stevie Mallan's corner was met confidently by the head of centre-back MacKenzie, who directed it beyond Derek Gaston.
On the hour-mark McDonagh received a straight red card from referee Nick Walsh for aiming a soft kick at Saints midfielder Rocco Quinn when the pair tangled on the ground.
The hosts failed to make their advantage count, though, and instead Jamie Lindsay and Thomas O'Ware threatened before Lamie eventually made Saints pay.
St Mirren manager Jack Ross: "Disappointed that we ended up throwing away two points but equally disappointed with our performance in the last 25 minutes.
"We were good for the first hour but didn't handle our man advantage well enough. We allowed ourselves to be put in a position where it became precarious.
"We should have retained possession better and made them work harder to get the ball.
"Aberdeen's Craig Storie should arrive on loan on the seventh of January and hopefully two or three other faces will join him as well."
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "I'm absolutely thrilled with the performance which certainly deserved the point.
"We always looked a threat and a side in control of the game, but obviously we lost a goal from a set piece and that can happen.
"It was a red card for Jamie McDonagh, absolutely no qualms about that. I told him at the end of the game that he let his team-mates down. But he's 20 years of age and he's done really well for us - he's just had a rush of blood and kicked out.
"If you score a late goal in a derby match it does feel like a victory.
"We're on the look-out for a striker."
