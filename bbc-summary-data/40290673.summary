The 24-year-old right-back, who can also play at centre-back, has agreed personal terms and is set to sign after taking a medical when he returns from holiday later in June.
BBC Derby Sport reports that the initial fee is around £2m and could rise to more than £4m.
Wisdom played 38 games on loan with the Rams in the 2013-14 season.
He has also had loan spells with West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City and was with Red Bull Salzburg last season.
Former England Under-21 international Wisdom made a total of 22 appearances for the Austrian top-flight side.
Rams boss Gary Rowett has already recruited defender Curtis Davies and has said he wants to bring in another defensive player.
