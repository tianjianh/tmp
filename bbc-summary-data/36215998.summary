Tissington, which has a population of about 110 people, will welcome 35,000 over the course of a week for the Tissington Well Dressings.
Six wells have been decorated using clay, petals and coffee beans.
It is believed the tradition began when locals reasoned they escaped the Black Death due to the water supply's purity.
Sir Richard FitzHerbert, chief executive of Tissington Hall, said: "The wells never dried up in times of plague.  It is done to praise the Lord, but it has a secular tone to it."
The themes of the tributes to the wells vary, with this year's decorations celebrating events such as the Queen's 90th birthday, the 150th year since Beatrix Potter's birth and the ancient game of Shrovetide Football.
Wells are dressed by applying clay on wooden boards, using materials like coffee beans to make an outline and placing twigs, wool and petals on to the surface for different colour effects.
Sir Richard said since the event began, the village had welcomed visitors from Spain, France and New Zealand.
"It's what we're famous for and long may it continue," he said.
The event, which began on Thursday, will conclude on Wednesday.
