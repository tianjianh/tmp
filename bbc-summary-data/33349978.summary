John 'Goldfinger' Palmer, 64, was found by his family last Wednesday at a house in Sandpit Lane, South Weald, Essex.
The death was not thought to be suspicious initially, but post-mortem tests found he was shot in the chest.
Police want to speak to anyone who was in the area from 16:00 to 18:00 BST on Wednesday.
"The area is rural but is often used by dog walkers and joggers," said Det Ch Insp  Simon Werrett, of Essex police.
"Officers are at the scene making inquiries and I would urge anyone with information, no matter how small, to come forward."
Palmer was jailed for eight years in 2001 for masterminding a timeshare fraud targeting people across the UK.
A year later, he was ordered to hand over Â£35m, but the ruling was overturned on a technicality.
His wealth was once estimated at Â£300m, according to an Underworld Rich List compiled for the BBC in 2004.
Palmer had owned helicopters, a French chateau and a Â£1m mansion in Bath, and was once considered one of the biggest landowners on Tenerife.
He was acquitted of handling gold from the 1983 Brinks Mat robbery at Heathrow airport.
