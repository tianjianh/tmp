The 29-year-old spent last season with Championship side Fulham, for whom he played 39 times, before being released.
"To get back into the Championship is what we're looking to do," O'Hara told the club website. "I want to win trophies and with this squad I feel we can mount a challenge."
Gillingham, who beat Southend in their opening game, host Bury on Saturday.
