[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number two Aljaz Bedene lost in the first round of Wimbledon to seventh seed Richard Gasquet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Frenchman, a semi-finalist in 2015, won 6-3 6-4 6-3.
Bedene, ranked 56th in the world, becomes the fifth British man to fall in the opening round.
Andy Murray faces Liam Broady in an all-British match later on Tuesday, while Johanna Konta, Heather Watson, Katie Swan and Tara Moore also play for places in the second round on day two.
There are 15 British players in the singles this year, and so far two - Marcus Willis and Dan Evans - have gone through, with seven knocked out.
Gasquet took early control of the match, racing into a 4-1 lead, and despite Bedene breaking the Gasquet serve to recover to 4-3, the Frenchman claimed the opening set.
The world number 10, who was beaten by Novak Djokovic in last year's semi-final, outclassed Bedene for much of the remainder of the match with a typically stylish performance.
Gasquet's single-handed backhand is regarded as one of the best in the game and he hit 16 backhand winners on his way to victory.
