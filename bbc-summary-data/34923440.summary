The antiques expert said he had "thoroughly enjoyed" his time presenting the daytime series.
The BBC refused to comment on newspaper reports in September that Wonnacott had had "a bust-up" with the show's producers.
Guest presenters were recruited to shoot the remaining half of the current series.
The BBC said, at the time: "We wouldn't comment on individual staff matters."
Wonnacott will be seen fronting new episodes airing on BBC One until early 2016.
He said: "I am pleased to have been part of Bargain Hunt for so many years and have thoroughly enjoyed every one of my, roughly, 1,200 programmes hunting out bargains with the contestants.
"I look forward to developing new programme ideas."
The BBC said: "We would like to thank Tim Wonnacott for his dedication to Bargain Hunt over the last 12 years and for the great expertise that he has brought to the show in that time.
"Bargain Hunt will be moving in a new direction next year utilising a team of experts who present a number of shows each."
The BBC added that Wonnacott will continue to work with the BBC on Antiques Road Trip.
Wonnacott, a former director of Sotheby's, has been the dapper host of the popular BBC One programme since 2003.
He was a contestant on last year's Strictly Come Dancing series and recently presented The Great Antiques Map of Britain on BBC Two.
