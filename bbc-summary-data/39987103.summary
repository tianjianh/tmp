The 34-year-old winger joined the Bees last August after leaving Sheffield United, and went on to score once in 32 appearances in 2016-17.
Campbell-Ryce, who has been capped 18 times by Jamaica, has also had spells at Rotherham, Southend, Barnsley, Bristol City and Notts County.
Barnet confirmed the appointment of assistant first team-coach Rossi Eames as their new head coach on Friday.
