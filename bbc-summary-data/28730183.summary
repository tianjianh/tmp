Sir Bradley Wiggins was among the star names battling wind and rain to take part in a 125-mile cycle race from London's Olympic Park.

The 2012 Tour de France winner and Olympic gold medallist was racing for Team Sky in the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic.
But another gold for Wiggins was not to be with the race won by Adam Blythe, who beat fellow Briton Ben Swift.
A race for the public was cut from 100 to 86 miles, after weather warnings.
A section covering Leith Hill and Box Hill in Surrey was missed out.
Having started in east London, the route ended outside Buckingham Palace.
Event director Hugh Brasher said the safety of the cyclists was the most important consideration.
"This decision has been made in the light of detailed information from the Met Office and with full agreement of local authorities and other agencies," he said.
Ahead of Sunday's elite race Sir Bradley said: "I always enjoy competing in front of home fans and have great memories of riding this route at the Olympics.
"The support we got then was unbelievable, and it was the same again at the Tour of Britain last year, so this promises to be a really special day."
It was a particularly special day for one couple who got married during the ride.
Keen cyclists Gary Watson, 44, and Lisa Russell, 41, from Raynes Park in south-west London, were pronounced husband and wife at Richmond Park's Pembroke Lodge, where they were met by friends and their five-year-old daughter Betsy, who had the rings.
After the ceremony, they began their new life together by cycling the rest of the way to the finish line.
Thousands of cyclists took part in rides and races as part of the weekend-long RideLondon event through London and Surrey.
On Saturday, an estimated 60,000 people took part in a 10-mile (16.1km) ride through central London.
