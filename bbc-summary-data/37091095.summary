[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zander Diamond put the Cobblers ahead when he nodded in Brendan Moloney's cross before James McClean levelled.
Gareth McAuley headed in Matt Phillips' free-kick to put Albion ahead but Alex Revell's goal led to extra time.
After a goalless 30 minutes, Kenji Gorre scored the decisive penalty following James Morrison's miss.
Baggies striker Saido Berahino, who had a short spell on loan with Northampton in 2011, put his penalty wide before the home side's John-Joe O'Toole saw his spot-kick saved.
Darren Fletcher and Alex Revell both scored with their efforts but Cobblers goalkeeper Adam Smith saved Morrison's penalty to give Gorre the chance to send his side through to the third round for the first time since 2010-11.
The victory extended Northampton's unbeaten run in all competitions to 26 games, their last defeat coming against MK Dons in the FA Cup fourth round in January.
Northampton Town match-winner Kenji Gorre: "When it left my boot I knew it was in and I started running before it hit the net - it was crazy.
"We had our fans close by and they were great throughout the whole game. To run over to them was class. They were so loud, I just started running to everyone."
West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "I wish Northampton all the best. They worked really hard and kept at it.
"If we have come here and didn't open them up and didn't play well then you can slaughter us, but we did that. We've not hit the back of the net and that's what you have to do.
"I understand supporters - if you're not winning you're not going to be happy, whether it's me or another manager."
