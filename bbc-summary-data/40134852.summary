[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elderly couple have been left "ashamed and traumatised" after giving £600 to three bogus callers in a Falkirk village.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the men used "bullying tactics" to receive money for gardening work at the pensioners' home in Waverley Crescent, High Bonnybridge.
The men first visited the couple in March, when they received £300 to partly trim a hedge.
They returned at about 13:00 on 26 May and were given a further £300.
Larbert community sergeant Ally Goldie said: "The elderly couple found all three men within their kitchen and on being challenged, they stated they were present in order to clear up the mess left by them in March.
"As a result, they were able to convince the couple to again part with more cash in the region of £300 for trimming another hedge in their garden, which again was only partly trimmed.
"The work carried out by the males does not match the money paid by the couple."
The men left in a white Ford Transit van. One of the suspects was described as having short red hair.
Sgt Goldie said: "This elderly couple have been left feeling ashamed and traumatised by bullying tactics used by the men which resulted in them handing over approximately £600 for very little garden work being carried out."
