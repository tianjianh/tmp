Great Western Railway brings in bike reservation rule

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new rule has come into force for train passengers travelling with their bicycles on some Great Western Railway (GWR) services.

The rail firm has said those travelling between the west and London on high speed trains must reserve a space by 18:00 BST the day before travelling.
Previously, cyclists could only board with a bike during off-peak hours. This is being extended to all services.
The firm has said the change brings it in line with other operators in the UK.
The new regulations have prompted some criticism from passengers.
Exeter Cycling Campaign tweeted: "Very disappointing @GWRUK only taking bikes on high speed trains if booked 2hrs in advance, even if there's a space."
Trains to and from London will have six dedicated bicycle storage spaces on board, but those with a folding bike do not need to make a reservation, the company said.
Dan Paines, from GWR, said: "It's getting more and more of a problem as more and more people bring their bikes on.
"It's much more popular than it was, even two or three years ago.
"What we're seeing is that people with bikes and tickets, turning up and finding that there's no space on that train, having to buy another ticket or pay a little bit more to get on the next one."
