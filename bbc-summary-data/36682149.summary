The Kiwi, who led the All Blacks to the World Cup in 2011, will assist head coach Leo Cullen for several weeks.
Cullen said it was important for Leinster's coaching staff and players "to look at different ways of challenging ourselves".
"Everyone in the organisation will benefit from his expertise," he added.
Having led the Auckland Blues to two Super Rugby titles, Henry was appointed head coach of Wales in 1998 before leading the British and Irish Lions on their tour of Australia in 2001.
He was appointed New Zealand head coach in 2004, leading them at two World Cups, winning the trophy in 2011.
Henry will join Leinster, who he described as "a club with such a rich and proud history", for a few weeks before the 2016-17 season begins.
"Undoubtedly the coaches and the players will benefit from having a coach of his stature in and amongst us as we build towards the new season," said Leinster coach Cullen.
