[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chinese superstar Ding Junhui held off a gutsy Martin Gould fightback to win a tense match 10-8 and progress to the second round of the World Championship.

Ding, who had to qualify after dropping out of the world's top 16, dominated early on but only led 5-4 after a thrilling opening session.
Gould scored a magnificent ton to end the session and then went 8-6 up.
But Ding, who scored three centuries and seven further breaks of 50 or more, rattled off four frames to win.
"After he fought back I had some pressure on me," said 11-time ranking event winner Ding. "But at 8-6 down I just thought, 'go for everything'".
A Ding victory looked unlikely when Gould needed snookers in the 14th frame.

But despite losing from a strong position, Ding refused to crumble and he took full advantage of a couple of missed opportunities and some sloppy safety play to win through.
Ding will now face either Judd Trump or fellow countryman Liang Wenbo in the last 16.
World number five Trump - the second highest seed left in the tournament - trails UK Championship finalist Liang 6-3 after their afternoon session.
Rising star Kyren Wilson leads tenth seed Joe Perry after fighting back from 4-2 down with three consecutive breaks of 50-plus, including a score of 89 where he was on course for a 147.
Elsewhere, world number seven Mark Allen and 2013 runner-up Barry Hawkins earlier both booked their place in the last 16 in contrasting style.
Northern Irishman Allen led debutant Mitchell Mann 6-3 overnight and won four frames without reply, while Hawkins described much of his performance as "awful" despite seeing off China's Zhang Anda 10-5.
World number 12 Hawkins set up a second-round date with Ronnie O'Sullivan thanks to his unconvincing win over Chinese qualifier Anda.
He rounded off the match with a tournament-high break of 141, but was far from happy with his efforts.
"I was awful at times - I was so lucky to be 6-3 up," he said. "I could easily have been 6-3 down with the way I was playing.
"I've got to play quite special in the next round. If I can put Ronnie under a little bit of pressure, hopefully I can give him a game. If not, he will bash me up with a session to spare."
