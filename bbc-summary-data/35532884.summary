A newly promoted train station cat has become a media sensation after her career advancements were followed from around the globe.

Felix has been the resident pet at Huddersfield railway station in West Yorkshire since 2011, when she was brought in to catch mice.
She has now been given a high-vis vest and made Senior Pest Controller.
A cat flap has also been built at the ticket barrier to allow her platform access.
Felix's success has been covered by newspapers in Taiwan, the Netherlands and Hong Kong.
The story saw a surge in popularity after the Huddersfield Examiner pounced on Felix's "purr-motion".
At the time of writing, a page for Felix has amassed over 20,000 'likes' on Facebook.
A First TransPennine Express spokesman said: "Felix came to the station when she was nine weeks old five years ago.
"We haven't kept a mice tally, but we think she's caught three recently."
The station said the cat was also a "natural" at chasing off pigeons on the station's platforms.
Felix is not the first "station cat" to find global fame - Tama, a stray which was made a station master in western Japan, was credited with turning a loss-making railway company around thanks to the number of tourists it attracted.
After Tama's death last June, thousands of people attended a Shinto-style funeral where the cat was elevated to the status of a goddess.
