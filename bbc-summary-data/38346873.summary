Colin Waterfield, of Stonehouse Road, Norwich, was found guilty at Norwich Crown Court after a five-week trial.
The jury heard the victims were abused in Norwich between 1973 and 1995. The youngest child was four years old.
Norfolk Police said the victims had been left "psychologically scarred" by Waterfield's abuse.
He had denied all the charges against him, and was convicted of 24 counts and cleared of six offences.
Police began investigating Waterfield after being contacted by one of his victims.
During the trial, the court heart evidence from a police video recording of a female witness who said Waterfield had regularly invited children to his house from a children's home.
She said he videoed the children in his front garden after getting them to remove their clothes.
"It was abuse of the most horrendous kind," said Det Insp Paul Brown, who oversaw the investigation.
"The children involved not only suffered physical harm but many have been left psychologically scarred and as adults are struggling to come to terms with what happened.
"They have been extremely brave in speaking with officers about events which took place decades ago."
Waterfield will be sentenced on 17 January.
