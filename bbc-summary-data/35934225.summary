[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to redesign a ferry terminal in Portsmouth to accommodate a larger boat have been approved by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wightlink Ferries wants to build a three-storey terminal in Gunwharf Road for its Portsmouth to Fishbourne service as part of a Â£45m project.
The upgrade will see new ramps put in so vehicles can be simultaneously loaded and unloaded on two levels.
Portsmouth City Council's planning committee approved the plans at a meeting on Wednesday.
The firm still has to secure planning permission from Isle of Wight Council next month for a new loading ramp at the Fishbourne terminal.
The new ferry will carry 178 vehicles and more than 1,000 people on each crossing.
It is expected to come into service in 2017.
