Owen Jenkins' body was found in the River Trent near Beeston Marina and Beeston Weir following a major search on 10 July.
On Sunday, a ride to the weir and a minute's silence was organised by Nottz Bikerz, whose founder Kieron Thomas knew Owen.
Hundreds of people also joined the procession on foot.
At the event Owen's mother, Nicola Jenkins, thanked everyone who had joined the search for her son, but also warned people about the dangers of going into the water.
"All your support has helped him live on in our hearts and you've all just been so amazing.
"Stay out of that water," she told the crowd. "I'll be down here watching."
Malakai Thomas, one of the ride's organisers, said: "Although it's not going to bring [Owen] back, it's the least we could do...
"It's about coming together as one to pay their respects... I knew there was going to be a lot [of bikers] but I didn't expect that many.
"It was an emotional but beautiful day, Owen was looking down on us."
Owen's great aunt, Liz Ryan, said her nephew was a "hero" as he had gone into the water to save a girl.
He had played rugby for Nottingham Casuals RFC since he was seven and was a pupil at Chilwell School.
Head teacher Ian Brierly described him as an "enthusiastic and gregarious young man".
He said the community was "heartbroken" by his death.
