A one-off accounting charge meant fourth-quarter net income was $272.3m, down by 8% compared to $295.6m in the same period 12 months earlier.
In after-the-bell trading in New York shares in the company gained 4.5%.
About 700 million web surfers visit its website every month, ranking it among the top in the global industry.
However, it shed more than 1,000 jobs during 2012, and has long been divided over whether it should focus on media content or on tools and technologies.
Chief executive Marissa Mayer was brought in last July from Google to turn the company round, and the latest financial figures are the first full quarter's under her leadership.
Ms Mayer has been focusing on building better mobile and social networking services.
She said that during the quarter Yahoo made progress "by growing our executive team, signing key partnerships including those with NBC Sports and CBS Television and launching terrific mobile experiences for Yahoo Mail and Flickr".
