One-Day Cup: Dawid Malan century sees off Glamorgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dawid Malan hit a brilliant unbeaten 156 as Middlesex completed their One-Day Cup group stage fixtures with an eight-wicket win over Glamorgan.

But wins for Kent and Lancashire later in the evening meant they were eliminated from the competition.
Colin Ingram hit 102 off 93 balls in Glamorgan's 251-9, with James Harris taking 4-38 against his old club.
But Malan and Paul Stirling (58) began Middlesex's reply with a stand of 139 as they reached 255-2 in 39.4 overs.
Stirling was caught off Kieran Bull and paceman Dewi Penrhyn Jones, playing only his second game for the Welsh county, had Sam Robson lbw for 22.
By then, however, it was far too late with Malan in full cry at the other end and he hit four sixes, one of them striking the top-tier balcony, and 18 fours in his 128-ball innings.
Neil Dexter finished the game in style by clearing the rope from a free-hit following a no-ball by Penrhyn Jones, whose 6.4 overs cost him 73 runs.
Middlesex seamer James Harris told BBC Wales Sport:
"We played really well from start to finish after losing the toss, bowled really well upfront and never let Glamorgan get away from us, I managed to get a few cheap wickets at the end.
"For us to finish it off with a bit of style and for Dawid (Malan) to play so well, it was a very satisfying day.
"For Dawid to start like that and build an innings, when you have 140 on the board before you lose a wicket you're going to win a lot more one-day matches than you lose. Then for him to carry on and score 150 was pretty special."
Glamorgan century-maker Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport:
"It's always nice to come to Lord's, it's a good day out and I just kept working hard. When you're playing well it's key to realise that and try to extend it as long as possible. I was fortunate again to do that today and thoroughly enjoyed it."
"It was nice to see two young guys (spinners Andrew Salter and Kieran Bull) do well, so that's invaluable experience for them and even some of the other younger guys, it'll be a good experience if a harsh one."
