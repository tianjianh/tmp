The 22-year-old made six appearances for the Reds last season, before a loan spell with neighbours Notts County.
He scored six times during a 17-game stint with Notts to help steer them away from League Two's relegation zone.
Grant, who is a product of Forest's academy, made his debut in 2014 and scored on his first start for the club - a League Cup defeat by Tottenham.
"Buzzing to sign a new three-year contract. Can't wait for the new season to start and kick-on," Grant said on Twitter.
