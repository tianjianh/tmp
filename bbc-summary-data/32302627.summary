[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An arson attack on a west Belfast school in which mobile classrooms were destroyed was "act of wanton vandalism", its principal has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police received reports that three mobile units at Christian Brothers' School (CBS) on the Glen Road had been entered and set on fire at around 21:45 BST on Monday.
The rooms were "completely destroyed" by the blaze, police have said.
CBS principal Tom Armstrong said GCSE students' work was lost in the fire.
"It's wanton, mindless vandalism of the worst extreme," he said.
"[Through] the act of some witless vandal, the [future] lives of a number of our boys and girls will be in jeopardy, because all of their work has been destroyed and we have to make a case now with the awarding body.
"[The work] had been marked and lucky enough we do have all of the scores, but in terms of actual work for submission as sample or evidence we don't have any of that now."
Two fire appliances attended the blaze, which was extinguished after an hour.
Mr Armstrong said CCTV footage which had been passed to the police showed an individual acting alone.
"When I look at the footage it seems to me that this person was quite witless because he could've done himself extreme harm when he set fire to one, then two, and then the third mobile.
"My pupils are outraged. They take ownership of this school, so any damage to it they feel it themselves."
Police are appealing for anyone with information about the attack to contact them on the non-emergency number 101.
