Toddler Ayeeshia Jane Smith died after being 'stamped on'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A toddler was "stamped on" and sustained "car crash-like injuries" before she died, a court was told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ayeeshia Jane Smith's mother, Kathryn Smith, and her partner Matthew Rigby deny murder, causing her death and child cruelty.
The 21-month-old died of a tear to her heart at their home in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, in May 2014.
Injuries to many internal organs were consistent with stamping or crushing, a Home Office pathologist said.
Both defendants cried as a recording of their 999 call was played to a jury at Birmingham Crown Court.
Ms Smith, 23, from Sandfield Road, Nottingham, could be heard telling the operator her daughter had suffered a seizure.
She said: "She's not breathing, there's nothing there, she's gone."
When paramedics arrived they could not resuscitate the girl.
Home Office pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar said Ayeeshia's injuries could be likened to those seen in car crash victims.
Mr Rigby, 22, of Sloan Drive, Nottingham, has pleaded not guilty alongside Ms Smith.
The trial continues.
