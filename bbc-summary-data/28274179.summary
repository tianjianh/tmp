Healthcare assistant Sharon Wall, 53, from Tuffley in Gloucester, was attacked on Wednesday at the inpatient unit of Wotton Lawn Hospital.
Ryan Matthews, 61, of Horton Road, Gloucester, will appear before Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on Saturday, police said.
Ms Wall's family said she was "nothing less than one in a million".
The family tribute, issued in a statement, said: "We would like to thank everyone for their support and such kind words that have been said about Sharon.
"She was nothing less than one in a million and to say that she will be missed is an understatement.
"We would ask for people to respect our privacy and allow us to grieve for her at this difficult time."
Her employers described her as "highly compassionate and dedicated".
Shaun Clee, chief executive officer of the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, said: "Sharon Wall was a well respected healthcare assistant and everyone who knew her speaks about her warmth, caring nature and good sense of humour.
"Above all, our thoughts remain with Sharon's friends and family. On behalf of colleagues across our trust, I extend our most sincere and deepest sympathies."
Wotton Lawn has four admission wards, a psychiatric intensive care unit and a low secure unit.
It is one of four sites 2gether runs in Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The trust said it cared for more than 1,300 people a year in its hospitals.
