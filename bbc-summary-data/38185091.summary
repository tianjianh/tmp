EY Scottish Item Club forecasts much slower economic growth

A leading forecaster has sharply lowered its estimates for Scottish economic growth next year.

The EY Scottish Item Club has forecast output growth of 0.4% in 2017 - 1.6% lower than it expected in June.
Its prediction for 2016 has also been lowered from 1.2% to 0.7%, having forecast growth of 1.9% in its report a year ago.
EY said growth would be "much slower" as existing headwinds were "compounded by political and economic uncertainty".
"Modest" growth is expected to return from 2018 but EY warned that would in part "depend on the economic landscape as shaped by Brexit" and potential policy changes brought by a Trump presidency.
The latest Scottish figures were well below its estimates for the UK as a whole, which is expected to grow by 1.9% in 2016 and 0.8% in 2017.
The report said the "bright spots" of economic growth from mid-2015 - consumer spending and investment - had "faded".
It added: "With the saving ratio dropping to a record low and personal disposable income to drop 0.1% next year, consumer expenditure will be unable to buoy economic growth and business investment will suffer from the politically-driven uncertainties."
The report also warned that while the recent fall in the value of the pound had led to a pick-up in manufacturing export orders, rising import prices would hit both business costs and consumers' pockets in 2017.
On city growth, the item club predicted Edinburgh and Glasgow would outpace the Scottish average throughout the years 2016 to 2019, at 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.
Stirling is expected to perform "on a par" with Scotland at 1%, with Inverness just slightly below on 0.9%.
The report argued that growth in the capital would be led by the "strong presence" of business services, while the information and communications sector would be the fastest area of growth in the other three top performing Scottish cities.
Mark Harvey, EY senior partner for Scotland, said: "None of the UK's nations, regions or cities will be immune to slower economic growth over the next three years but there will be significant variations across the country indicating there is more work to be done in rebalancing the economy.
"From a Scottish perspective we would of course want to see growth boosted to be more in line with the UK.
"In a slower growing economy it will be harder to achieve more economic balance, not only on a UK level but across Scotland too.
"Although we can see pockets of growth in Scottish cities, little progress is likely to be made to increase these further and expand the output of the weaker cities in the short-term."
