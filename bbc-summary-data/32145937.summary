A builder who murdered a property developer and his wife in a frenzied knife attack has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick and Gillian Kettyle were found with stab wounds at their house in Fetcham, Surrey, on 27 November.
The Old Bailey was told Viktoras Bruzas, 39, believed his ex-wife was having an affair with Mr Kettyle and carried out a revenge attack.
The Lithuanian national, who admitted two counts of murder, was ordered to serve a minimum of 33 years in prison..
He changed his plea on Wednesday after denying the charges at a previous hearing.
The Kettyles, who were both in their 50s and known as Pat and Gilly, were described as the "most fantastic parents" and a couple who "dearly loved" each other.
Bruzas, from Walton-on-Thames, attacked Mr Kettyle with a kitchen knife in a "particularly brutal" manner because he blamed him for "ruining his life" and the failure of his marriage, according to prosecutor Alan Kent QC.
The Old Bailey was told it was likely that Mrs Kettyle was stabbed as she tried to protect her husband.
The pair's teenage son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, hid after being woken by screaming and shouting and held the handle of his door when the killer approached his bedroom.
But the court heard Bruzas told the boy through the closed door: "I have no issue with you, boy, or your mother. It's Patrick, he's ruined my life. I'm not scared of prison."
Mr Kent told the court: "On that evening he left his flat armed with a knife, intending to take the ultimate revenge, and that's what he did.
"The victims were a perfectly normal middle-aged couple who were, in their own home, murdered by this defendant.
"Patrick Kettyle was clearly a very charming man. It seems the defendant's wife began to talk to Patrick Kettyle about the state of her marriage.
"She would complain that the defendant was a violent and controlling man and had been that way throughout their marriage," added Mr Kent.
Bruzas learnt of "flirtations" after he logged into his wife's email account.
He made threats against the property developer several months before the murders and was issued with a police notice.
On one occasion he drove to Mr Kettyle's house in the early hours and shouted: "Why are you trying to take my wife away from me?"
He also emailed him saying, "My family going to sort out."
Surrey Police launched a manhunt for Bruzas, who was thought to have fled to West Sussex, following the discovery of the couple's bodies.
The court was told he asked officers, "How long do you get for murder in this country?", when he was caught driving his car through the nearby village of Oxshott 18 hours later.
Det Ch Insp Mark Preston said: "This deeply saddening incident has been devastating for the family and friends of Patrick and Gillian and left the close-knit community of Fetcham in shock.
"I welcome today's guilty plea and lengthy custodial sentence and I hope that it will bring some form of closure to the family.
"I would like to recognise all the officers and staff who worked tirelessly on the operation to find and capture Bruzas as quickly as possible and on the murder investigation itself to ensure he was brought to justice."
