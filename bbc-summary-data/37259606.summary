The body of 13-year-old Quinlan Pringle, of Colchester, was found on 21 August after he was swept away by the sea at Boulogne 15 August.
He had been with his two younger brothers at the water's edge when all three ended up in the sea.
His brothers were rescued and treated for shock while an unsuccessful search for Quinlan got under way. His body was found between rocks by fishermen.
He was described as "a quiet, sensitive and considerate boy" by Philip Morant School in Colchester.

College principal Catherine Hutley said: "Quinlan was an aspirational and hardworking young man with a cheeky, endearing side to him which we all loved.
"He will be sorely missed by the school community and our thoughts are with his family.'
"We are working closely with Essex County Council to ensure students, their families and our staff have all the support they need at this devastating time.
"Quinlan was a quiet, sensitive and considerate boy with a delightfully playful, yet unobvious, sense of humour."
It is understood Quinlan and his family arrived in Boulogne on the day of his death.
Pascal Marconville, le Procureur de la RÃ©publique Ã  Boulogne, who confirmed the cause of death was accidental drowning, said: "Three children got into difficulties in Boulogne. Two were rescued.
"One couldn't be rescued and was swept away in the current."
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was providing support to Quinlan's family.
