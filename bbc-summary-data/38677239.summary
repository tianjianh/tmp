O'Flynn rifled a low drive into the bottom corner from 20 yards out in the 12th minute and volleyed the ball home from 10 yards seven minutes later.
Kevin Bradley scored his first goal for Ards when his long cross went straight into the net after 34 minutes.
Curtis Allen grabbed the third by tapping in from close range late on.
Allen, who had laid the ball off for O'Flynn's opener, rammed home after Aaron Harmon's initial low shot had been parried by Aaron Hogg.
O'Flynn met Chris Lavery's cross for his second of the night but a mix-up in communications between defender Calum Birney and goalkeeper Elliott Morris allowed Bradley to pull one back before the break.
Carl McComb hit the woodwork with a free-kick in the first half and Morris denied Gareth Tommons with a good save.
The Glens now lie one point behind seventh-placed Dungannon Swifts and three benhind Glenavon.
Glentoran manager Gary Haveron: "We have closed the gap on the top six and laid the challenge down to other teams ahead of their matches at the weekend.
"This is a hard place to come to but we raced into a 2-0 lead and were good value for it. From there, we could and should have killed off the game.
"But we switched off and didn't take responsibility for a ball into the area and at half-time it's a totally different game. Our back four dealt with everything in the second half and in the end it was a professional job.
"Stephen O'Flynn is a class act but has struggled badly with injury. He came up with the goods tonight and showed what he is about. He is quality, has two good feet, strength and he's a leader too."
Ards manager Colin Nixon: "I'm very disappointed. We conceded a couple of bad goals, then rallied a little and got a lucky goal to get back into it.
"The second half was a non-event and we huffed and puffed a bit, but I thought we deserved to get beaten to be honest.
"We are conceding bad goals and that is why we are in the trouble we are in."
