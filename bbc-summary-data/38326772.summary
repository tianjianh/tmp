The incident took place in Dhaka's Narayanganj district. Police say a colleague pumped air into the boy's rectum using a high-pressure hose.
Police say the reason for the incident is not clear but the teenager's colleague has been arrested and his family are seeking murder charges.
This is the third such incident in just over a year in Bangladesh.

Boy killings: Six sentenced to death
Police said it happened at the end of the day when the two workers were using the air hose to remove cotton stuck to their bodies.
In July a 10-year old boy, Sagar Barman, was killed in a similar incident at another spinning mill in Narayanganj.
Three teenage boys later admitted assaulting him "as a bit of fun", local media reported, but did not intend to kill him.
Eight months earlier, the high-profile death of Rakib Hawlader shocked the nation.
The 13-year-old boy had air pumped into his body by his colleagues in retaliation for leaving his job as a mechanic.
Two men were subsequently sentenced to death for his murder, which triggered protests.
Child labour is common in Bangladesh, with many children working in unofficial garment factories, often in harsh conditions.
