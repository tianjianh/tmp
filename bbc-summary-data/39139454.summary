[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic have paid tribute to Lisbon Lion Tommy Gemmell, who has died aged 73 following a long illness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former defender Gemmell scored in the 2-1 victory against Inter Milan in 1967 when Celtic became the first British club to win the European Cup.
"Our thoughts are with Mary and Tommy's family and friends at this very difficult time," Celtic said.
Former Celtic player Murdo MacLeod said it was "very sad news" and described Gemmell as "one of the greats".
Gemmell also scored in the 1970 European Cup final, which Celtic lost 2-1 to Feyenoord. He spent 10 years at Celtic, between 1961 and 1971, making 418 appearances and scoring 63 goals.
MacLeod, who also spent a spell as assistant boss at Celtic, told BBC Scotland: "I know he had been struggling over the last few months.  Just really sad news.
"He's obviously been one of the greats at Celtic Park to be part of the European Cup-winning side.
"A top player, one of the first defenders getting forward all the time. [It's] just so sad. We heard Billy McNeill's news [about suffering from dementia] over the last few days and now this.  It's just very sad."
Asked how Gemmell would be remembered, MacLeod said: "Scoring a goal in the European Cup final.  To be part of that was just fantastic.  The Celtic Lisbon Lions - anywhere they went over the years everybody knew where they were.
"And for Tommy Gemmill to score a goal in that European final was just wonderful."
