Simonstone Hall in the Yorkshire Dales shared a picture of the plaque, donated by a hotel guest, on Facebook.
"Here lies the BBC career of Jeremy Clarkson who had a fracas on this spot, 4 March 2015," reads the plaque. "The rest is legend."
Clarkson was suspended, then dropped, by the BBC following the incident.
The Top Gear team were staying at the hotel during filming when Irish producer Oisin Tymon was assaulted by Clarkson during a late-night argument over food.
Tymon suffered swelling and a split lip and visited a hospital for his injuries.
Following an internal investigation, the BBC announced Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed.
"We were presented with this plaque from one of our guests last night!" wrote Simonstone Hall, sharing a picture on social media.
"We think it would be quite appropriate to put it on the patio where the fracas took place!"
Earlier this month it was revealed Tymon is suing Clarkson and the BBC for racial discrimination, centring on "verbal abuse" he said he received from the presenter during the fracas.
Clarkson will front a new show on Amazon Prime with co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond in the New Year, while Chris Evans will host the new look Top Gear when it returns for a new series.
