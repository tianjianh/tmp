England v Turkey - How the players rated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England got their Euro 2016 warm-up under way with a 2-1 win against Turkey at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

Harry Kane scored the opener and missed a penalty before fellow England striker Jamie Vardy got the winner.
Who impressed? Who struggled? See how the England manager Roy Hodgson's players rated.
Needlessly charged off his line in the build-up to Turkey's equaliser and made it a lot more simpler for them to score, but made amends with his brilliant injury-time stop from Olcay Sahan.
One of five Tottenham players in the starting XI, he tried to perform the same job he did for Spurs, charging up and down his flank. Made one goal-saving block.
It was England's failings as a defensive unit that caused more concern than his individual performance, although he must take much of the blame for their occasional lack of organisation at the back, especially when they played high up the pitch. His excellent header led to Vardy's winner.
Surely the centre-half to make way when Chris Smalling returns at the Stadium of Light against Australia on Friday. Did not take any chances in possession but his marking was sloppy in open play and at set-pieces, where he struggled to keep tabs on Cenk Tosun at a couple of corners.
One of those caught out for Turkey's goal but impressed with his energetic bursts forward. Whether it is on the right or left, full-back is not a position where England have too many problems.
Gave his centre-halves some welcome support when he dropped into the backline and did a decent job of protecting them when he was sitting in front of them too. Outnumbered at times, and surely needs another dedicated defensive midfield partner when England play top-class opposition. If fit, he is a sure starter against Russia on 11 June, however.
Described as a "special talent" by Hodgson this week, but seemed subdued here. Needs to prove his form and fitness to make the plane and while the latter did not seem an issue before he came off in the second half, he certainly did not sparkle. His was overshadowed Dele Alli, and the absent Wayne Rooney probably should not worry about finding a place in England's midfield on Friday either. Still work to do to make the cut.
A livewire from the start and gave more encouragement to the idea that the understanding he has forged with Tottenham team-mate Harry Kane can do some damage at Euro 2016. Was not always as spectacular as with that early assist, but he used the ball intelligently throughout and we are surely at the stage where, whatever the formation, he cannot be left out.
Initially happy to run at defenders and was continuously fouled in the process, but, as always, his end product was an issue when he got past his man. In the end, he seemed to lose belief that he could even do that and started taking the safe option with sideways passes instead.
The team was initially set up in a 4-3-3 formation to suit Kane as the central striker and he more than justified that decision - his penalty miss aside, this was another impressive display leading England's attack. Yes, he was offside when he scored, but he took that chance superbly and was never afraid to miss.
Struggled early on when he was starved of the ball out wide. Looked a different player when England switched to 4-4-2 in the second half, with his pace running on to a ball over the top earning a penalty, then his instincts in front of goal giving him the winner. The last 30 minutes demonstrated why he will scare teams in France, but before that we saw why he should not play as a winger.
Also trying to prove his form and fitness after injury. Hodgson said this week he has "more to do" than Wilshere to make the squad and, apart from a few neat touches, he did not get much chance to do that here. Will hope for more of an opportunity to impress at his old stamping ground, the Stadium of Light, on Friday.
His place in Hodgson's final 23 seems to rest on whether Wilshere is deemed fit or not. Was not given many minutes to shine here, although his appearance from the bench brought loud cheers from a group of Leicester fans. They appreciate him, but does Roy?
