The U's have played 47 matches this season, more than any other side in the top four divisions.
Top-scorer Kemar Roofe and midfielder John Lundstram have both been rested in recent weeks to avoid aggravating minor injuries.
"Roofey looks rejuvenated after his spa week," Skarz  told BBC Radio Oxford.
"If that week has benefited him, then it's the best thing we could have done. He's played a lot of games in his first full season."
Roofe, who has scored 21 goals this term, missed Oxford's away victories at Exeter and AFC Wimbledon.
But the 23-year-old striker made a goalscoring return to the team against York, before netting again four days later at Plymouth.
"Everybody knows what a talent he is and what he has done for us this season," added Skarz.
Oxford host Leyton Orient on Saturday with midfielder Lundstram looking forward to seeing some familiar faces.
The 22-year-old enjoyed two separate loan spells with the O's in recent seasons.
"It will be nice to see a few old faces but even nicer to beat them," said Lundstram.
"When I am looking through the scores each weekend I do still have a quick look to see if any of the old lads have played."
