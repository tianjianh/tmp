Nigel Brent Wilkinson, 43, of Bristol, previously admitted rape, administering a drug with intent to rape and possession of a prohibited substance.
Wilkinson was being investigated for offences against one man when officers went to his home to arrest him and found another victim asleep there.
He was sentenced to 11-and-a-half years at Bristol Crown Court.
At a hearing in July, he pleaded guilty to two counts of rape, three counts of administering a drug with intent to rape and two counts of possession of a prohibited substance.
During sentencing the court was told Wilkinson, of Hill Avenue, had taken young men drinking, then lured them to his home for photo shoots, used a drug to spike their drinks and then had sex with them while they were unconscious.
Det Con Stacey Matthews said: "The men would often stay at his home and throughout their visit he would ply them with alcoholic drinks, some of which were laced with sedatives.
"While they were in a drugged state, Wilkinson's predatory nature would prevail and he'd commit sexual acts on them without their consent."
An investigation was begun by police after they were contacted by the girlfriend of a victim who had texted her to say he believed he had been drugged.
The man was found at Wilkinson's home and taken to hospital, where traces of a sedative were found in his system.
Three months later, officers again went to Wilkinson's house to arrest him and discovered a second victim.
"When they arrived, they found a man asleep on the sofa. He was also taken to hospital and there was evidence he'd been drugged and raped," said Det Con Matthews.
"On the surface, Nigel Wilkinson was a photographer with an interest in male fitness models. In private, he was a cunning sexual offender who used his photography enterprise as a cover and catalyst for his deviant activities."
During the investigation, officers said they had identified a third victim, who was also found to have traces of sedatives in his system.
"We believe there'll be more victims who haven't yet come forward and I'd urge them to do so," said Det Con Matthews.
