Parents can sign up for a free 'First Steps' activity packs each containing an audible ball, a pump, a reward chart and an activity booklet.
The charity that helps blind and partially sighted people get active is hoping the new campaign will improve children's health and fitness.
All activities have been designed to be used individually or with friends and family within the home environment.
"The First Steps pack will often give visually impaired children their first opportunity to try sport or physical activity specifically adapted to them," says British Blind Sport chief executive Alaina MacGregor.
"British Blind Sport knows what a difference playing sport can make to a blind or VI child's life. It can build confidence, encourage communication, improve health and develop relationships.
"Put simply, First Steps will empower young visually impaired children and their families to have a healthier, more active and fun lifestyle."
Families can sign up for a First Steps pack here, email firststeps@britishblindsport.org.uk or call 0131 317 1130.
