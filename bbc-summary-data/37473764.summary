A Welsh woman's family has dismissed criticism that links to killer Christopher Halliwell were not investigated.

Glyn Razzell is serving a life sentence for murdering Linda Razzell, originally from Llanybydder in Carmarthenshire.
But former detective Steve Fulcher said Halliwell could be linked to six other murders - including Mrs Razzell's.
Her family said they have "no doubt" that estranged husband Razzell is guilty.
Halliwell was jailed on Friday for the 2003 murder of Becky Godden, having already been convicted of killing Sian O'Callaghan in 2011.
However, the ex-Wiltshire Police detective at the centre of the Halliwell investigation questioned why officers failed to follow up the taxi driver's connection to other killings, including mother-of-four Mrs Razzell.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mrs Razzell, 41, had a "direct relationship" with Halliwell, of which the force was "particularly" aware.
"We know that Halliwell has killed women, has a propensity for killing women and had a direct relationship with Linda Razzell.
"Whether or not he's responsible for those murders isn't the issue. The issue is why was no investigation conducted into those issues.
"We have a clear multiple murderer and we have concerns about his association with particular women."
Mr Fulcher resigned from Wiltshire Police in 2014 after being found guilty of gross misconduct for failing to follow the proper procedures when arresting Halliwell in 2011.
During the investigation into the disappearance of Ms O'Callaghan, Halliwell offered to take police to "another one" and led Mr Fulcher to a field in Gloucestershire where Ms Godden's remains were found.
The evidence gathered by Mr Fulcher was ruled inadmissible as he had not cautioned Halliwell.
Mrs Razzell went missing in 2002 after setting off to work at Swindon College in Wiltshire - her body has never been found.
A spokesman for Mrs Razzell's family told BBC Wales: "We were 100% happy with the police investigation.
"There is no doubt in our minds who the murderer was. There is no validity in the detective's claim."
In 2005, Razzell, then aged 44, failed in an attempt to overturn his conviction for murder.
He claimed DNA evidence against him was unreliable, but Judge Kenneth Zucker QC said his conviction was "perfectly safe".
He was convicted after drops of her blood were found in the boot of a car which he had access to.
Wiltshire Police is not linking Halliwell to any other murders but are due to liaise with other police forces.
A force spokesman said: "It remains our commitment to keep an open mind and follow the evidence wherever that may take us, so if there are further victims of Halliwell, then our investigation will work tirelessly to bring justice for all those concerned.
"To assist us in this, we strongly discourage speculation as this will cause further distress to families and friends of people who are currently missing across the country, who will clearly be desperate to have news of their loved ones."
