[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 3-0 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale eased to a comfortable win over a lacklustre Doncaster side struggling for goals this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Doncaster goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann saved an early Sam Foley penalty, but Foley made amends to put Vale ahead with a header on 35 minutes.
Uche Ikpeazu doubled the lead just after half-time.
Byron Moore's backheel two minutes from time secured the points, but Rovers are yet to win in League One and have not scored since the season's opening day.
