[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The FA says it is looking into fresh comments made by Wigan chairman Dave Whelan about Chinese people.

This story contains language which you may find offensive.
Whelan, 78, told the Jewish Telegraph he used to refer to a local Chinese restaurant as "chingalings".
He is already under investigation by the FA over remarks about Jewish and Chinese people in an interview where he was trying to defend the appointment of Malky Mackay as the club's new manager.
Whelan has been given until 12 December to respond to that charge.
It is understood the latest remarks have so far not been under consideration by the ongoing investigation.
Whelan has denied making racist remarks and insists he was misquoted.
He has also apologised for any offence caused and warned he will resign from his position at Wigan if punished.
Whelan was quoted using the term "chink" in a newspaper interview with the Guardian last month.

Asked by the Jewish Telegraph whether he himself had ever used the term, he replied: "When I was growing up we used to call the Chinese [restaurant] 'chingalings'.
"We weren't being disrespectful. We used to say: 'We're going to eat in 'chingalings'.
"The Chinese weren't offended by that. That was the name everyone in Wigan called it."
Michael Wilkes, a spokesman for the British Chinese Project, described Whelan's comments as "extremely unhelpful".
He added in the Guardian: "Once again, Mr Whelan, rather distressingly, believes he can speak on behalf of Chinese people.
"Once more, he is using a public platform to tell a wide audience what Chinese people find offensive.
"Contrary to what Mr Whelan may believe, the vast majority of our community deem the terms 'chink' and 'chingaling' highly offensive."
The new controversy comes on the same day Wigan warned supporters not to use racist, sexist or homophobic language during Saturday's match against Norwich City.
"Wigan Athletic are reminding supporters that it is illegal to swear or use racist, homophobic or sexist language," a statement read.
"The club has a zero tolerance on this and any supporter found to be using inappropriate language runs the risk of being ejected from the match, with further sanctions being available depending on the severity of the case."
