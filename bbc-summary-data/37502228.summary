A man who stabbed his neighbour to death and knifed her mother in an unprovoked attack at their home has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maylyn Couperthwaite, 52, died after being attacked along with her mother Audrey, 80, on Woodward Close, Bury, Greater Manchester, in February.
Oliver Faughey, 63, admitted manslaughter and grievous bodily harm at Manchester Crown Court.
He was handed a life sentence and ordered to serve a minimum of 10 years.
Faughey was originally charged with murder, but the prosecution accepted pleas on lesser charges after he was detained under mental health laws.
The court heard he forced his way into the home and stabbed both his victims repeatedly before fleeing the scene.
Maylyn Couperthwaite died at Royal Oldham Hospital, but her mother later recovered from serious injuries.
Senior investigating officer Duncan Thorpe, of Greater Manchester Police, said the family remain "devastated".
He added: "Although nothing will change the events of that night, I hope the result will bring some closure to Audrey and the rest of Maylyn's family."
