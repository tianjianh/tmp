Dragons shackled the Scarlets and led 6-3 after a first half of attrition.
Jonathan Davies broke the Dragons' resistance with the opening try after an hour, before Liam Williams went over in the opposite corner.
Adam Hughes scored a late consolation for the Dragons, who remain 10th in the Pro12 table, while Scarlets overtake Ospreys in third place.
After the Cardiff Blues had dismantled the Ospreys in a firecracker of a game earlier at the Principality Stadium, this second fixture was a damp squib.
Boasting a team packed with internationals and facing a Dragons side on a nine-match losing streak in all competitions, Scarlets were overwhelming favourites.
Yet, despite having never won in their previous four appearances at Judgement Day, it was the Dragons who made the brighter start as two Angus O'Brien penalties gave them a 6-0 lead.
The Gwent region applied themselves well in the first half, using their driving maul to good effect and kicking intelligently to contain their opponents.
Dan Jones' penalty halved the Scarlets' deficit before the break and added a second after the restart to bring them level.
However, he was taken off soon afterwards and replaced by Hadleigh Parkes, usually a centre or wing.
The Scarlets initially seemed disrupted by the change but, after Dragons wing Hughes was sin-binned after an hour, they exploited his absence on the right flank as Davies trotted over in the corner for the game's first try.
Davies' Wales team-mate Williams then forced his way over to extend the Scarlets' lead to 21-9, before Hughes' breakaway try with the final play of the game earned the Dragons a losing bonus point.
