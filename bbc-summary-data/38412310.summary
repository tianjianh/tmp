Brett Pitman hit a stunning late winner as Ipswich inflicted a fifth straight Championship defeat on Bristol City.

Kevin Bru flicked in Tom Lawrence's cross from six yards to give Ipswich a half-time lead.
On-loan striker Tammy Abraham seized on a mix-up between Ipswich's Bartosz Bialkowski and Christophe Berra to stab in the equaliser from close range.
But Town clinched the points when Pitman scored with an overhead kick from Freddie Sears' cross.
Pitman's fourth goal of the season - against his former club - earned Ipswich their second win in three games and lifts them to 14th in the table.
Bristol City, who have failed to win in their last 12 visits to Portman Road, have now lost eight of their last nine league games - their only points in that time coming from a 2-0 victory over Ipswich at Ashton Gate earlier this month.
After Abraham's second goal in two games had cancelled out Bru's opener, it seemed that Ipswich would be left to rue their luck as the game headed towards a draw.
Robins midfielder Marlon Pack hit an attempted clearance against his own bar and substitute Sears had a shot cleared off the line by Joe Bryan as the hosts went close before Pitman struck four minutes from time.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "I thought it was an excellent team performance with the only mark being the goal we gave away - we seem to get punished for every mistake we make.
"But it was a terrific performance. I said we needed to get back our identity, to be harder to play against and be more forceful. I think we did that.
"It was a gutsy performance coming back from conceding a goal like that - but we showed great team spirit and Brett Pitman showed what a finisher he is.
"We got some great support tonight. When I was walking to the dugout, I got some cheers and also a few boos. But only we can turn that around."
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol: "It's another loss, it hurts, it's disappointing but we'll endeavour to get it right.
"It was a really young group out there at the end, we played some good stuff in the second half and were unfortunate not to come away with a point.
"But this league is relentless, it doesn't feel sorry for anybody and we have to maintain confidence and aggression in our play, which we didn't do enough of in the first half."
