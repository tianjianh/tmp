Defender Harry Flowers, 20, has joined the Premier League side from ninth-tier Brocton, of the Midland League's top flight, on a contract until June 2018.
Ron Flowers earned 49 caps for England and was a non-playing member of Sir Alf Ramsey's winning squad, eventually being awarded a winners' medal in 2009.
The Clarets also announced the signing of 17-year-old striker Harry Limb from Wisbech Town, also in the ninth tier.
