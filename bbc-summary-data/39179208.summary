Sodhi, 24, who took 6-11 as Adelaide beat Sydney Thunder in a match in Australia's Big Bash in January, has been capped 41 times in all formats.
From 12 T20 internationals he has taken 21 wickets at an average of 14.47 and strike-rate of a wicket every 13 balls.
"We're really excited to have him," said Notts head coach Peter Moores.
"Ish is a young player whose game has really moved forward. He's not been to England before, so he is an unknown quantity for our opposition and we've seen the impact leg-spinners can have in T20 cricket.
"Ish is a natural attacking leg-spinner who can create pressure and get us some crucial breakthroughs in the middle overs."
Sodhi will be the second of two overseas players, with Australian all-rounder Dan Christian returning to Nottinghamshire having been part of the side that won nine matches in a row in 2016 to reach Finals Day.
