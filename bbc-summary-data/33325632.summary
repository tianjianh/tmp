Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari's contract with Italian club AC Milan has been ended by mutual consent.

The 30-year old joined the Rossoneri permanently in 2012 following a loan spell while he was at Inter Milan.
Muntari had one more year left on his contract that he signed in 2014.
"AC Milan and Sulley Muntari would like to announce they have reached agreement to dissolve the player's contract with the club as of today," a club statement read.
He fell out of favour after former boss Filippo Inzaghi replaced Clarence Seedorf as coach of the seven-time European champions, making just 16 Serie A appearances last season, scoring twice.
His future at the club has been in doubt since May when he asked to be left of the Milan squad for a Serie A match away to Palermo.
Milan paid tribute to the battling midfielder, adding: "AC Milan would like to thank Muntari for the commitment and professional attitude shown during his  time playing in the Milan shirt and wish him all the very best for the future."
He has not played for Ghana since being sent home from the World Cup in Brazil last year for indiscipline.
