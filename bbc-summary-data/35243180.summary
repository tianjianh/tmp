He was two-year-old Archie Tafts.  It is understood the accident happened on Tuesday.
Heather Loughridge works at the Reformed Presbyterian Church mothers and toddlers group, which Archie attended.
She described him as "a very pleasant boy".
"Archie was a lovely, smiley wee fellow," she said. "He always took part in the singing and dancing at the end and really enjoyed it.
"When you hear these things, it puts everything else into perspective. It's hard for people to take in."
She said the toddlers group held a Christmas party the last day they met and he was "singing and dancing".
"He made a wee reindeer picture that day and one of our other leaders said to his mum to put the date on it so she could remember when he did it. That'll be a wee memory of his last Christmas," she said.
"It'll be hard for us all going back next week after the break."
A PSNI spokesperson said: "Archie's parents and extended family would like to thank all who have expressed their condolences at this distressing and difficult time, however, as this is a personal tragedy for them, they will be making no public comment."
