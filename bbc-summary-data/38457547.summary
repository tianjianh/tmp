A five-year-old boy who was given part of his father's liver says he feels "super better" nine months after the operation.

Harry Maceachen, from Shrewsbury, was born with a rare liver disease. He received the transplant from his father Simon in March.
The pair have just spent their first Christmas together since the operation.
And nine months on, Mr Maceachen said there had been "no problems at all" after the surgery.

Harry was born with biliary atresia which meant he had blocked bile ducts.
His infectious laughter and excited energy captured hearts following a show-stealing appearance on BBC Breakfast in December last year.
Mr Maceachen was a living donor as no suitable match could be found from the organ donor register.
He said: "It took a little while to recover from the surgery. Harry bounced back a lot quicker than I did, but he's a bit younger than me so he heals a bit quicker than I do."
While in hospital, the pair wore matching gowns specially made by volunteers called the Wrap Pyjama Fairies, who make pyjamas and surgical gowns for children in hospital.
And the family spread some festive cheer by delivering gowns to youngsters at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford.
Harry, who took part in the British Transplant Games in July, said he now feels "super better" and added that since the operation he can now "run really fast".
