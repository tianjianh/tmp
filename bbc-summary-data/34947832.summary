Warwickshire policeman Christopher Cambray jailed after paying child for sex acts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police sergeant has been jailed after admitting paying a child for sexual services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Cambray, 42, from Shrewley in Warwickshire, pleaded guilty to six sexual offences against children. He was jailed for four years and two month at Birmingham Crown Court.
The charges included sexual activity with a child and making indecent images of children.
Cambray was an award-winning sergeant with Warwickshire Police.
As well as a custodial sentence, he was also sentenced to five years on licence and handed a Sexual Harm Prevention Order prohibiting unsupervised contact with any child under 18 years of age, which runs for life unless lifted by a court order.
Following his arrest in September 2014, Cambray was immediately suspended by Warwickshire Police and dismissed by Chief Constable Martin Jelley after a special case hearing in July.
Det Supt Gary Watson, of Warwickshire Police, said the force is "completely focused" on the victim, adding Cambray's actions were not representative of the behaviour of other officers.
"It is distressing for all concerned when [an officer] is found guilty of a crime that is amongst one of the most challenging and incomprehensible with which we deal," he said.
"We would like to reassure the public that the great majority of people in policing act with honesty and integrity."
