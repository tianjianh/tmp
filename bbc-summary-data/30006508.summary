[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greece 0-1 Faroe Islands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joan Edmundsson's goal gave Faroe Islands a shock win over Greece and increased the pressure on coach Claudio Ranieri.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The nation ranked 187 in the world moved ahead of Greece, who slipped to bottom of Euro 2016 qualifying Group F with one point from four matches.
The only goal came in the 61st minute as Edmundsson steered in Brandur Olsen's mis-hit shot.
Panagiotis Kone went closest for Greece when he missed from six yards.
The Faroes created the better chances, Olsen hitting the post with a first-half free-kick before Frodi Benjaminsen's header was brilliantly saved by Orestis Karnezis.
The Greece goalkeeper also rushed out to deny Edmundsson - a former Newcastle youngster - with his face.
Greece, the Euro 2004 champions, have not won since former Chelsea manager Ranieri, 62, took over from Fernando Santos after this summer's World Cup.
