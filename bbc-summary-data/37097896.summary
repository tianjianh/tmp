[SN]TITLE[SN]
Drink driver was 'eight times over legal alcohol limit'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Perthshire woman who crashed into a bridge was more than eight times the drink-driving limit, a court was told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christina Lochhead had the highest alcohol reading ever seen by a police officer after drinking so much she fell unconscious at the wheel.
Lochhead, of Murthly, was banned from driving for 30 months at Perth Sheriff Court.
The 28-year-old was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work in the community.
A trial heard that Lochhead's reading was still almost eight times the limit when she was released from hospital more than three hours after crashing her car.
She was found guilty of failing to provide two specimens of breath for analysis after driving on the B9099 at Caputh in Perthshire on 25 May last year.
Lochhead twice managed to provide a single specimen of breath but claimed she couldn't add a second because she was suffering from a panic attack.
Solicitor David Sinclair, defending, said: "She fully accepts she had drunk to excess on the morning in question and got into the car when she should not have."
Sheriff Richard MacFarlane told Lochhead: "If there had been a true reading then it would have been a very, very significant level of alcohol.
"You were found by concerned members of public, drifting in and out of consciousness as a result of alcohol consumption and not any injury sustained in the impact."
"The second police officer recalled the circumstances of the case because he had never come across such a high breath alcohol reading before."
The sheriff told Lochhead that she should "count her blessings" she had not been injured or hurt anyone else.
