Many streets were left under deep water after the torrential downpour,
More than half Aberdeen's expected July rain fell in just a few hours.
The council said staff should be commended for their efforts to combat the problems, which included more than 600 sandbags being distributed throughout the city.
Council leader Councillor Jenny Laing said: "Our teams worked extremely hard yesterday afternoon, through the night and into today to protect properties and keep people safe on the roads. They should be commended for their efforts.
"Our partners in Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service are also to be thanked for their work too in helping people out during the floods.
"We can appreciate that flooding causes huge problems and inconveniences to residents and businesses which is why there are plans in place to alleviate the problems working in partnership with Scottish Water."
