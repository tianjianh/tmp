The bag was one of 13, holding a total of NZ$10m, being sent to the Bank of China in Hong Kong from New Zealand, Chinese media say.
Police are treating the case as theft, they add.
Surveillance footage reportedly shows three unsecured bags falling from a trailer as it turns a corner.
When staff realised the bags were missing 10 minutes later, they are said to have returned to the scene but could only recover two of them.
A statement by the airline said: "Cathay Pacific transported a valuable cargo shipment last Friday night to Hong Kong.
"Upon arrival, it was transferred to the cargo terminal where part of the shipment was found missing. As the case is under police investigation, we are unable to provide further details."
G4S International Logistics, that was transporting the money to the Bank of China, said the money was safe until it entered the controlled airside section of the airport - a section to which their staff have no access.
The money was insured, the company said.
