I think Friday the 13th is unlucky because every Friday the 13th I fall out my bed when I wake up.

I think Friday 13th isn't unlucky because it's Niall from One Directions 20th birthday today! What's so unlucky about Niall?

I personally think it's lucky. I was born in 2000 on Friday the 13th and I've had nothing but luck. So I try to get bad luck but it never happens to me it's always happens to someone I know! So I am pretty lucky with this day so go Friday 13th!

Everything I do on Friday the 13th goes wrong I was doing my make-up and it all smudged, my hair is horrible and I have extra homework. I saw loads of ladders that I had to avoid and I also avoid walking over three grids.

I am not a believer in Friday 13th being unlucky, how can a certain date turn everything bad? For me personally nothing is unlucky to everyone, it is a personal thing you think for yourself.
