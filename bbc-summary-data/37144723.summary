Striker Sergio Aguero and summer signing Nolito scored twice apiece as City claimed their second win in two Premier League games with a 4-1 victory at Stoke.
They also beat Steaua Bucharest 5-0 in Champions League qualifying on Tuesday.
"It is impossible to say what is our target or what we can achieve," said Guardiola, who took charge this summer.
Victory at the Bet365 Stadium lifted City, who won their opening league game against Sunderland, to the top of the table, ahead of Manchester United on goals scored.
Guardiola added: "In the short time together my players show me how intelligent they are. They are really good players; they have a lot of quality.
"I am a little bit surprised, in the short time, with the level we played here and in Bucharest.
"It is very good. We have scored nine goals in two games. It was a nice week for us."
