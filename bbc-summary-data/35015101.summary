India, who held a first innings lead of 213, lost Murali Vijay in the fifth over and Rohit Sharma first ball.
But Kohli, reprieved by TV replay after being given out on five, shared an unbroken 133 with Ajinkya Rahane (52).
India lead the top-ranked Test team 2-0 in the four-match series, the second match washed out after the first day.
In his first match on his home ground as captain, Kohli revived his team after they had been 57-4, with South Africa seamer Morne Morkel claiming three of the wickets.
Opener Murali (three) was given out to a rising ball from Morkel that appeared to flick his armguard before flying through to leaping wicketkeeper Dane Vilas, Vijay looking displeased with the decision and shaking his head as he departed.
Morkel struck again with the first ball of his next over to dismiss Rohit Sharma for a golden duck, the ball zipping past the bat and flattening off-stump for Sharma's third single figure score of the series.
India could have been 58-5 when Kohli was given out after Vilas claimed a catch at the wicket, but replays showed leg-spinner Imran Tahir had over-stepped and a no-ball was called.
The skipper went on to his 12th half century in his 37th Test and shared in the first century stand of a low-scoring series in which South Africa's highest total is currently 214.
A 3-0 series victory for India would take them to second in the world rankings behind South Africa, who will lose top spot if they are beaten in their next Test series at home to England, which begins on Boxing Day.
