The 22-year-old Sussex fast bowler, who had been tipped to play for England, died in Scotland in January.
Earlier a willow tree was planted in his memory and a minute's silence held.
He was found dead at a private property after celebrating New Year with friends. The cause of his death remains unexplained.
After the ceremony Sussex began playing their match against Essex.
Sussex cricketer Luke Wright said: "We're known as a family club and it was our little moment to give back to the big man.
"It's been tough, but all the guys are wearing his shirt today with his number and name on."
The club's chief executive, Zac Toumazi, said: "This is the first time as a club we've been able to do something here at the ground that Matthew played at and loved so much.
"It's very important as a Sussex cricket family we've done something here."
