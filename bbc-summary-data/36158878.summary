Wood Group secures $500m Azerbaijan deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wood Group has won a new $500m (Â£342.5m) contract to provide services for BP-operated offshore projects in Azerbaijan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Under the five-year deal, Wood Group PSN (WGPSN) will provide engineering, procurement and construction management services for eight platforms.
The contract will lead to the creation of about 200 new jobs.
The announcement comes just a week after Wood Group secured a Â£100m North Sea services deal from Nexen.
The Azerbaijan contract builds on Aberdeen-based Wood Group's continued support of BP-operated projects offshore Azerbaijan.
Wood Group Kenny is already providing subsea engineering services to the eight platforms under a multi-million dollar contract announced in October.
It includes support of BP's existing subsea infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, UK and Norwegian continental shelves.
David Buchan, WGPSN's eastern region managing director, said: "Wood Group has a 40-year history of working with BP across their global assets and this new contract award is reflective of the strong relationship we maintain with this key client, built on collaboration and continued excellence and assurance in our service delivery."
