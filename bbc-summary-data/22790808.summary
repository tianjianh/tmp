Paris Jackson, the daughter of late pop legend Michael Jackson, is in hospital after attempting to kill herself, a publicist has confirmed.

Paris, 15, is "doing good" and recovering, said Angel Howansky, her grandfather's publicist.
Emergency officials said they responded to a reported overdose in the Calabasas area of Los Angeles where Paris lives, but did not identify the patient.
Local media say she left the family home at about 02:00 PST (09:00 GMT).
Ms Howansky, a long-time publicist for Joe Jackson - Michael Jackson's father and the girl's grandfather - could not confirm reports of a possible drug overdose or multiple cuts on her wrist.
But she later said that Paris was "doing good".
"She's recovering and, you know, a good thing it wasn't an intensive care situation," she said. "She's going to be fine."
Perry Sanders, a lawyer for grandmother and guardian Katherine Jackson, later said Paris was "physically fine and is getting appropriate medical attention".
"Being a sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are. It is especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you," he added.
In a statement, Paris's uncles Tito, Marlon and Jackie said: "Thank you for the outpouring of concern and support for Paris.
"She is safe and doing fine. We truly appreciate you respecting our family's privacy at this time.''
Paris, Michael Jackson's only daughter, is currently part of a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the concert promoters AEG Live, which the Jackson family says bears responsibility for her father's death from an accidental drug overdose in June 2009.
The BBC's Regan Morris in Los Angeles says Michael Jackson went to great lengths to shield his children from the public eye, shrouding them in masks and baggy clothes so they could not be recognised.
He wanted to give them the chance for a more typical childhood than he had as a child star, but after being sheltered for years, Paris Jackson has lived a very public life since his death, our reporter says.
Paris is a cheerleader at her private school and seems comfortable in the limelight - appearing poised and articulate at Michael Jackson tribute events with her grandmother and her two brothers, known as Prince and Blanket.
She is also a popular target for the paparazzi and tabloids, our reporter adds.
Paris also has a popular Twitter account where she discusses music and homework and dispenses make-up tips to her million-plus followers.
Her most recent tweet was a quote from a famous Beatles song: "yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away now it looks as though they're here to stay."
