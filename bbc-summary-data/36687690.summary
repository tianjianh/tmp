"I had no idea it was a medal but my performance was the best I could have done. That is why I was so happy, that all the training and hard work had paid off.
"I am so happy I got to share the final with Kat."
Prior to winning Olympic silver, Page's highest career finish in an international event was fifth at the 2015 World Championships in Denmark.
