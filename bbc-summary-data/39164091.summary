The midfielder took a kick to the foot but Arsene Wenger said it was just a "precautionary" measure.
Leicester's Wes Morgan is out with a hamstring injury while Nampalys Mendy's season is over following an ankle operation.
Robert Huth is back after a Champions League ban, but Islam Slimani remains sidelined with a groin injury.
Simon Brotherton: "I love that picture of Arsene Wenger celebrating at the weekend as his team beat Manchester City at Wembley - an intense release of joy and relief and a rare moment for him to truly enjoy in a turbulent campaign.
"Wenger's reorganised defensive strategy seems to be working and a rejuvenated Arsenal will be put to the test both here and in the North London derby at the weekend.
"Leicester haven't won any of the last 20 league meetings against the Gunners but have won five of the last seven league matches under Craig Shakespeare, and are more than capable of making a game of this encounter."

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "It looks like we will [have to win all our remaining games to finish in the top four]. That has to be the target and to achieve that we have to win the next one [against Leicester].
"We have to take the energy level we showed on Sunday into the Premier League."
Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare: "I'm not sure how many points it will take [to avoid relegation] and the weekend proved that. Teams are capable of winning games and putting points on the board.
"We have to make sure we look after our own club. You are not sure what's round the corner."
"Seeing the Arsenal [FA Cup semi-final] match, it didn't look like turmoil to me. There were players fighting and they thoroughly deserved the win in the end, even though it was a close game."
