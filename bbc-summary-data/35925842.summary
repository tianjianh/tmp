The purse tops the £50,000 on offer at next month's women's race in the Tour de Yorkshire.
The 66km race, in London on 30 July, has the same fund as the men's RideLondon-Surrey Classic a day later.
"We believe in equality in sport," said event director Hugh Brasher.
The individual winner of the race will collect £19,600, with £7,860 going to the winning team.
The race will take place on a 5.5km circuit around central London, taking in The Mall, Constitution Hill, Parliament Square, The Strand and Trafalgar Square.
Trott, who has raced in each edition of the event, added: "RideLondon has pioneered incredible change in women's cycling, first with live television coverage, then live cameras on bikes last year and now with record prize money and parity with the men's race."
