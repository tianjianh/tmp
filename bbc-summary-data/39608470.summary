[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England striker Ellen White sent Birmingham City into the Women's FA Cup final against Manchester City as they beat Chelsea 4-2 on penalties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Meaghan Sargeant nodded Blues ahead with their first effort on goal.
Drew Spence sent the game into extra-time, making it 1-1 with a fine right-footed shot into the top corner.
Blues keeper Ann-Katrin Berger made a string of saves in normal time and the shootout as Chelsea's hopes of a third successive trip to Wembley were ended.
Berger foiled Millie Bright from the spot after Eniola Aluko hit the post for the London club, who were beaten by Arsenal in last year's final, having lifted the trophy in 2015, in what was the first Women's FA Cup final hosted at the national stadium.
Birmingham, who beat Chelsea at Ashton Gate in their only previous final appearance in 2012, take on a Manchester City side that overcame Liverpool 1-0 to keep alive their bid for a fifth trophy in the space of nine months.
The final on 13 May will be the first time either side has played at Wembley.
