Coach Steve Hansen has named all three Barrett brothers in the squad for the match at Eden Park.
Fly-half Beauden, 26, will play his 50th test, while lock Scott, 23, and centre Jordie, 20, are expected to make an appearance from the bench.
The game is a warm-up for the All Blacks' test series against the British and Irish Lions, starting on 24 June.
"This is a test match against a quality and very capable opponent," said coach Steve Hansen.
"This first week has been about bringing together the players from the five different Super clubs and reintroducing them to the All Blacks way."
In other team news, Aaron Smith beat off the challenge of TJ Perenara for the starting role at scrum-half, while Jerome Kaino will make his return following knee surgery, with Ardie Savea slotting in at number eight in place of injured captain Kieran Read.
Full-back Ben Smith will lead the side for the first time in Read's absence.
