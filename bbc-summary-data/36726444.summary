[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A kilo of drugs previously known as "legal highs" and dozens of mobile phones have been seized at a  prison in a single month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
HM Inspectorate of Prisons said the influx of drugs at HMP Lindholme near Doncaster was "destabilising" the establishment.
The Category C prison holds just over 1,000 adult male inmates.
The National Offender Management Service said "the governor was working hard with police" to tackle the issue.
Prison inspectors said they were told "horrific" stories concerning the possible effects of new psychoactive substances (NPS).
Following the Psychoactive Substances Act, brought into effect on 26 May, the production, distribution, sale and supply of drugs previously called "legal highs" is now an offence punishable by up to seven years in prison.
The Inspectorate's report, following an unannounced inspection in March, said links with crime agencies were "impressive" and a kilo of NPS, 67 mobile phones and 145 Sim cards  had been seized in a month.
What are so-called "legal highs"?
Nearly two-thirds of prisoners told inspectors it was easy to obtain illegal drugs.
The report added: "The stories we were told, concerning the possible effects that NPS was having on individuals, including one young man who had literally blinded himself, were nothing short of horrific."
The watchdog said serious concerns still need addressing at HMP Lindholme, but its deterioration had been halted and work, training and education had improved.
Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said the site had a "focus on rehabilitation", but efforts were "undermined by the illegal supply of new psychoactive substances".
"The governor is working hard with police colleagues to tackle this threat and to generally improve safety," he said.
