Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep has called for a documentary chronicling the rape of a young student on a bus in Delhi to win an Academy Award.

India's Daughter tells the story of Jyoti Singh, 23, whose rape and violent death in India's capital in 2012 caused a public outcry.
Streep said at the New York premiere she was on the "campaign" for it to be nominated for best documentary.
"When I first saw the film I couldn't speak afterwards," Streep said.
The nominations for the 88th Academy Awards will be announced on 14 January.
The hour-long film is made by the BBC and directed by British-based actress and film-maker Leslee Udwin.
She also produced the film East is East but India's Daughter marks her debut as a movie director.
Udwin said she had found hope in the protests following Singh's rape but was dismayed at the relatively weak outcry after a four-year-old girl was raped and beaten with stones in Delhi earlier this month.
"Why are people not out on the streets now?" said Udwin.
There were 33,764 victims of rape in India in 2013, according to the country's National Crime Records Bureau.
Medical student Jyoti Singh was returning home from seeing Life of Pi at the cinema with a male friend in December 2012, when she was raped and murdered by a gang of men.
Udwin's film draws on footage of an interview in jail with one of the attackers, Mukesh Singh, who blamed Singh for being out in the evening with a male friend.
"A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night," he said.
"A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy."
Mukesh Singh and the other attackers have appealed against their death sentences.
India's Daughter was due to be broadcast in March in India but was banned while Udwin was in the country promoting it.
The government said it thought certain excerpts could "encourage and incite violence against women".
But a senior government minister, M Venkaiah Naidu, also described the documentary as "a conspiracy to defame India".
Another big area of debate has been whether Udwin and her team got proper permission to film in Tihar, the prison where Singh is being held.
The movie, which was screened on BBC Four in March, will open across the US on 23 October.
Screenings are also scheduled in a handful of countries from Iceland to China.
