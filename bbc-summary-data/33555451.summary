Karen Prictor, 47, and Margaret Rivers, 55, both from Swindon, helped to run the North Wiltshire and District Minor League.
Swindon Crown Court heard Prictor transferred league funds into the bank accounts of both women "funding a lavish lifestyle". Both admitted fraud.
Prictor was jailed for four years and Rivers for two years and four months.
Passing sentence, Judge Peter Blair QC said Prictor ran the league with Rivers "as your personal fiefdom".
He said: "Although it started small, it escalated. You enriched yourselves at the expense of young footballers and the impact to the community has been huge."
The court was told that between 2009 and 2013, Prictor, who was the league's treasurer, deposited more than £165,000 into her bank account.
Judge Blair said she "sought to cover her tracks" by forging bank statements, and "blackened the name of any critics" who suspected her of misconduct.
Prictor also transferred about £35,000 to Rivers, who was league secretary.
The women spent money on family holidays and other luxury items.
Prictor also pleaded guilty to a charge of forgery and improperly obtaining a passport, and Rivers to possessing criminal property.
Rivers's husband Andrew admitted possessing criminal property and was sentenced to 200 hours' community service.
Prictor's husband Kevin, who was the league's fixtures secretary, was cleared of any wrongdoing at a previous trial.
The youth league is one of the country's largest, with 360 teams of seven to 18 year olds competing across 40 divisions.
