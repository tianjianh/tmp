Scarborough Council proposes plan to tackle 'nuisance' gulls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warning signs could be added to chip boxes, urging people not to feed seagulls along the North Yorkshire coast, in an effort to combat the "increasing nuisance" of the birds.

Scarborough Council has drawn up plans to allay growing public concern about mess, noise and "gull-muggings".
The proposals include using bird-proof bin bags and fitting netting to buildings to prevent nesting.
The recommendations will be considered by the cabinet later this year.
A report prepared for the council's Environment and Economy Scrutiny Committee, said: "...Growing public concerns reached a peak last summer about the increasing nuisance caused by two species of gull in the borough: kittiwakes and herring gulls."
Outlining nine potential measures for tackling the gulls, it suggested "officers approach fish and chip shop owners...to recommend the use of a notice prohibiting the feeding of gulls, inside chip boxes and on the shops' premises".
An online consultation attracted almost 500 responses.
One hotelier told the council they were "genuinely concerned for the future of our business", saying "the noise throughout the day and night from March to September is becoming intolerable, not to mention the mess on buildings and cars and swooping".
However, others disagreed with one respondent saying: "Seagulls belong to the seaside. Leave them alone and stop moaning."
Both herring gulls and kittiwakes are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.
The recommendations will be considered by the cabinet later this year.
