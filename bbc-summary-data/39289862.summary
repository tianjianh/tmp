The host of RuPaul's Drag Race told Hollywood Today Live he and Georges LeBar tied the knot in January, 23 years to the day they first met at New York's Limelight nightclub.
"We never wanted to do it. We were looking into it really for tax breaks and financial [reasons]," he explained.
LeBar owns a farm in Wyoming and, according to RuPaul, "doesn't care about show business at all."
He may have a much lower profile than his husband, but LeBar has previously been seen in photos RuPaul uploaded to his Instagram account.
After the interview aired, RuPaul took to his Twitter account to thank fans for their messages of support and share a poignant song lyric.
He posted: "Thank you all for the love and kindness. 'I cry not for myself, but for those who never felt the joy we felt' - I Hear A Symphony, The Supremes."
