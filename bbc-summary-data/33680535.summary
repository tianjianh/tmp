About 200 people attended the service at St Edmund's Church, Walesby, where John lived.
There was also a guard of honour from members of 2 Para, which he served with before becoming a social worker.
Paying tribute, his wife Cheryl said he was a "much loved husband, father and exceptional social worker".
Those attending the funeral wore pink in tribute to the 58-year-old, who was among the 30 UK victims killed in the attack near Sousse.
Mrs Stollery said pink was John's favourite colour.
In a statement, she said: "John was a devoted husband, my best friend and a fantastic dad to our son Matthew, and we miss him every moment of every day.
"I feel privileged to have been his wife and I'm so proud of the outstanding tributes that have been paid in his memory.
"John, you always gave of yourself to others and to us so we could have brighter future. Shine brightly with the stars above. Love and miss you forever."
Speaking about the attack, Mrs Stollery said: "Matt and I are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with the way John was taken from us in such a horrific and tragic way when we were just on a family holiday together."
She added: "Matt and I also wish to remember the other victims and their families and we want to send our warmest and sincere thanks to everyone who has offered us kindness and support over the last few weeks."
Mr Stollery worked at Nottinghamshire County Council for the past 33 years and for the last 16 years was a dedicated social worker, working with children in care.
Colleague Steve Edwards said: "We have lost a truly magnificent social worker and there will be a huge gap in the lives of the children he cared for."
The county council has set up books of condolence at offices across the county for residents to pay their respects.
