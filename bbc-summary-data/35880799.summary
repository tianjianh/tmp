War medals returned to soldier's home town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish man who bought war medals from World War One at auction has returned them to the soldier's home town in Canada, 98 years after his death.

John Cunningham, a 60-year-old from East Renfrewshire, bought three medals awarded to Cpl Thomas Warburton Hooper, after finding out the soldier had a personal connection to his family.
Cpl Hooper's name arose by coincidence in an online search while Mr Cunningham was reading about his grandfather, who also fought in WW1.
He found out that both men had fought for the Lord Strathcona's Horse regiment on the lead up to the Battle of Morueil Wood in France. They had shared a battlefield at Bois de Genlis.
When Cpl Hooper's medals appeared at auction in Liverpool, Mr Cunningham said he knew what he had to do.
Speaking to the BBC Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: "When I saw the date and realised who they belonged to, I bought them at once. I had to have them."
The medals - a 1914/1915 Star, a British War medal, and a Victory Medal - were identical to those awarded to his own grandfather, except for the inscription.
Mr Cunningham's research revealed that Cpl Hooper, from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, had died during the battle at Bois de Genlis on 23 March 1918.
He had been serving a support role - probably looking after horses - but was killed when he was called to the front line to contain an enemy advance, according to a distant relative in Prince Edward Island, David Hooper.
Barely escaping with his own life that day was Mr Cunningham's grandfather, Cpl Donald McLeod, who was wounded in the fighting.
"He was lucky to get away because the Germans were bayoneting the wounded as they came through. They weren't in the mood for taking prisoners that day", Mr Cunningham said.
"I may not have been talking to you now had things gone the other way for my grandfather."
After the auction, it was decided by Mr Cunningham that Cpl Hooper's medals should be returned to their rightful home.
He said: "I got them and thought 'what do I do with them now?'
"I felt I had to pass them on; do something with them."
In late 2015, Mr Cunningham began to contact the media on Prince Edward Island, Canada, hoping he would be able to track down relatives of Cpl Thomas Hooper.
Greg Gallant, curator at the PEI Regiment Museum, Charlottetown, joined the search alongside a genealogist but found that there were no immediate relatives of Cpl Hooper left on the island.
Instead, he suggested that Mr Cunningham donated the medals to the museum. He agreed.
Mr Gallant said: "I feel that these medals are yet another piece of that puzzle that we're always trying to build."
The Charlottetown community has also been welcoming of Mr Cunningham's donation.
"People have approached me and said 'I hear you've got the medals!' It's nice," said Mr Gallant.
They have since been cleaned and mounted, and the museum plans to have them "front and centre" of an upcoming WW1 anniversary exhibit.
The museum is continuing its search for Cpl Hooper's next of kin.
Mr Cunningham's grandfather, Cpl McLeod, lived through the war despite being twice wounded.
He died on 31 December 1972 and is buried in Eaglesham cemetery, alongside his wife and Mr Cunningham's parents.
He hopes that some good can come from his donation of the medals.
Mr Cunningham said: "I would hope that at some point, his (Cpl Hooper's) family, if they still exist, will maybe have the chance to see them and get something from them."
"I didn't want to glorify this in any way, it's really just to remember things. So people can look back."
