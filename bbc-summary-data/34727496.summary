Kevin Pietersen smashes T20 century in South Africa

Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen struck his highest Twenty20 score, with an unbeaten 115 from 66 balls in South Africa's Ram Slam T20 competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Playing for the Durban-based Dolphins franchise, the 35-year-old came to the crease in the first over and hit 10 sixes and five fours in his innings.
He moved to his hundred during a final over in which 30 runs were scored, with Pietersen striking four sixes.
The Dolphins made 174-6 and beat the Johannesburg-based Lions by one run.
Having been told in March he had no future with England, Pietersen has become a freelance T20 batsman and is playing in a Dolphins side alongside South Africa batsmen Morne van Wijk and David Miller.
They both fell cheaply against the Lions but Pietersen reached fifty from 49 balls with a six and then struck four successive sixes in the final over from seamer Dwaine Pretorius.
