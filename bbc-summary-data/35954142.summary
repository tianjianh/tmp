Nicole Kidman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Gemma Arterton and Adrian Lester are also up for awards.
Musical Gypsy leads the pack with eight nominations, and Kinky Boots has seven.
The awards, now in their 40th year, are being given out at London's Royal Opera House in a ceremony hosted by Michael Ball.
Nominations in full
Rylance, recognised for Farinelli and the King at Duke of York's Theatre, learned of his nomination just hours after winning a best supporting actor Oscar for Bridge of Spies in February.
The play, about a castrato opera star and staged at Shakespeare's Globe, was written by Rylance's wife, Claire van Kampen.
Her play received six nominations in total. It goes up against The Father, Hangmen and People, Places and Things for the title of best new play.
Cumberbatch is up for his sold-out performance of Hamlet, while Sir Kenneth Branagh is nominated for A Winter's Tale, which he co-directed. Scottish Kenneth Cranham is nominated for The Father.
Dame Judi Dench's turn in A Winter's Tale sees her nominated in the best supporting actress category.
The nominees for best actress are Arterton, Denise Gough, Janet McTeer, Lia Williams and Kidman, who returned to the West End in Photograph 51.
In the new musical category, Kinky Boots goes up against Bend It Like Beckham, In the Heights and Mrs Henderson Presents.
The musical revival shortlist includes Gypsy, Guys and Dolls, Bugsy Malone and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
Theatre fans have had the opportunity to vote for their favourite production for the Magic Radio Audience Award, the only award chosen by the public.
The contenders are Jersey Boys, Les Miserables, Matilda and The Phantom of the Opera.
