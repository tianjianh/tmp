Finnish Punk band PKN, the first Eurovision act to all have learning difficulties, have been knocked out of the contest in the first semi-final.

They are one of six entries going home, along with Danish boyband Anti Social Media - the first time Denmark has failed to get to the final since 2007.
Ten acts - Russia, Serbia, Armenia, Belgium, Greece, Estonia, Hungary, Albania, Romania and Georgia - are all through to Saturday's final in Vienna.
Netherlands also made a surprise exit.
Last year their act, The Common Linnets, came second in the contest.
Fans of PKN (Pertti Kurikan Nimipaivat) reacted angrily to news they had not been voted through to the final, after they ranked among early favourites with bookmakers.
George Parry tweeted: "Finland didn't make it through to the #Eurovision final. Tantrum time. #sodisappointed."
