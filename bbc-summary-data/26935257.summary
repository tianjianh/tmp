The 25-year-old had moved out of London to live in the countryside with her two young sons, Astala and Phaedra, and second husband, musician Tom Cohen.
Born in 1989, Peaches Honeyblossom Geldof embarked on a media career at the age of 15, writing a column for Elle Magazine and the Daily Telegraph.
She was also a model and TV presenter.
Geldof left home at the age of 16 and went on to contribute to publications including The Guardian and US style bible Nylon, as well as presenting TV programmes such as ITV2's OMG! with Peaches Geldof.
During her teenage years she had spoken of experimenting with drugs and she became a favourite of paparazzi photographers, often snapped on the red carpet or leaving parties in the early hours.
In recent years she had devoted much of her time to looking after her two sons and regularly posted pictures of them and her pets on her Twitter feed.
However, just last week she had attended a launch for Tesco's F&F clothing range in London.
Geldof had continued to write opinionated columns, including one piece in The Independent, voicing her support for same-sex marriage.
In November last year she took on controversial commentator Katie Hopkins while speaking about attachment parenting on ITV programme This Morning, applauded by many on Twitter.
Just a month before her death she gave an interview on attachment parenting - which often involves sleeping in the same bed as your baby - to Mother and Baby magazine, which billed "the It Girl turned earth mother" as its new columnist.
"Becoming a mother was like becoming me, finally," Geldof told the magazine.
"After years of struggling to know myself, feeling lost at sea, rudderless and troubled, having babies through which to correct the multiple mistakes of my own traumatic childhood was beyond healing," said Geldof.
Her first son, Astala, is one and Phaedra will turn one on 24 April.
She had also spoken of how she owed her life to her children and said: "I am not about to let them down, not for anyone or anything."
After the birth of Astala in 2012, she told Elle magazine, "The minute I held him, it was like this missing piece of my life being put into place; everything started to heal."
She also spoke of the importance of creating a family for him to grow up in, saying, "Even if it's an archaic idea, I want Astala to have a mummy and daddy together for ever."
Her own mother Yates split with Bob Geldof and formed a relationship with INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, who died in 1997.
Geldof was just 11 when her own mother died from a heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41.
In September 2012, she revealed she had not been able to come to terms with her mother's death for several years.
Geldof had two sisters Fifi Trixibelle and Pixie and a younger half-sister Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof.
After moving to New York in 2008, where she married rock musician Max Drummey before separating six months later in early 2009, Geldof was briefly the editor of her own magazine, Disappear Here.
She told The Guardian that she started the magazine with former Loaded editor James Brown as she felt "hugely patronised" by women's magazines. It also targeted men, and featured a column from the late Tony Benn.
In a tribute on Elle magazine's website - where Geldof wrote one of her first columns - a former colleague at Nylon, Faran Krentcil, revealed she had given her the nickname "Princess Peach".
She said she would remember her for many "amazing things" including making Justin Timberlake teach her Spanish on camera during fashion week and offering paparazzi "a six-pack of beer as they followed her through the supermarket."
