Harry Kane joked with England boss Sam Allardyce over corner duty

Harry Kane says he has "had a bit of a laugh and a joke" with England manager Sam Allardyce about having to take corners under former boss Roy Hodgson.

England's corner routine at Euro 2016 came in for a lot of criticism, with Alan Shearer claiming it was "bizarre" that Kane was asked to take them.
Asked if he expected to take corners again, Kane said: "Probably not.
"We had a bit of a laugh and a joke with the manager about it, but it's something that happened."
England skipper Wayne Rooney took the corners during Sunday's 2018 World Cup qualifying win in Slovakia.
It was Allardyce's first game in charge after replacing Hodgson, who quit immediately following England's shock defeat to Iceland at Euro 2016.
"I am happy to be in the box and hopefully I will get a goal for it," added Tottenham forward Kane.
"Of course it was a disappointing moment in the summer, but it's football. It's what makes and breaks you as a player."
Adam Lallana's late strike against Slovakia helped Allardyce start his reign with a win but Kane struggled in a lone striker role.
His last goal for club or country came in a Euro 2016 warm-up game against Turkey on 22 May, but he is confident he will rediscover his goalscoring touch.
Kane failed to score in his first six Premier League games last season before going on to finish as the top-flight's top scorer with 25 goals.
"I managed to prove a lot of people wrong, so people will talk this year as well," he said. "It's part of football. It's what they're doing. I am confident in my ability."
Following England's failure at Euro 2016, Allardyce believes his squad are "a happy bunch, not a damaged bunch".
The former Sunderland boss said he detected a "little nervous tension" before the 1-0 win over Slovakia but added: "We have to be brave."
