The 23-year-old Liverpudlian secured the title in the +73kg category with victory over France's Gwladys Epangue, 31, in Chelyabinsk, Russia.
Last year, Walkden won +73kg gold in the European Championships in Baku but this is her first medal at world level.
"I'm the new heavyweight champion of the world and honestly, I'm so happy," she said. "It's unbelievable."
Sarah Stevenson won world titles for Britain at middleweight in 2001 and at welterweight in 2011.
Walkden, who trains in Manchester,  is nicknamed "Queen B" and is a housemate of London Olympic 2012 gold medallist Jade Jones.
Jones was beaten by Kimia Zenoorin of Iran in the quarter-finals of the -57kg division in Russia on Sunday.
New world champion Walkden has overcome two serious knee injuries in the last four years.
"To have had my knee troubles and to come back like this, it is such an emotional win," she said.
"It just shows it's all about your head and your heart as well."
