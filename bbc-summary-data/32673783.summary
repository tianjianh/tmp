Tories still hold Central Bedfordshire Council after count delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives have retained control in Central Bedfordshire after the count was delayed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tories have won six new seats to take their tally to 53, the Lib Dems have lost three seats and now have one, while Labour has two.
Three independent councillors will now serve on the council instead of six.
A council spokeswoman said the count was suspended so some "figures could be checked overnight" and it resumed at 10:00 BST.
There were 159 candidates for the authority's 59 seats.
