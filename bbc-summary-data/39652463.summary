She has agreed a one-year deal with top-flight side Vittsjo-Gik from Nigerian champions Rivers Angels.
It means the 25-year-old will be leaving one of Nigeria's biggest clubs.
"This is a big step for my career because the Swedish women's league is highly competitive," the defender told BBC Sport.
"It is a big opportunity for me, the club and the national team as well, so I thank Rivers Angels for blessing this move.
Ohale believes the chance to turn out at the very highest level was too good to turn down and she feels the right decision was taken for all concerned.
"I've won all the available trophies with Rivers Angels in Nigeria and the chance to compete with other top players can only bring out the best in me," she added
"My fellow international teammate Ngozi [Okobi] is already at the club, so I look forward to giving my best."
She started at Rivers Angels before switching to Delta Queens in 2010 winning the Nigerian Women's Premier League title in 2011 and 2012.
After a spell with United States' National Women's Soccer League side Houston Dash in 2014 in she returned to Rivers Angels for a second spell.
Ohale helped Nigeria to win the 2010, 2014 and 2016 Women's Africa Cup of Nations and has played at the last two World Cups..
