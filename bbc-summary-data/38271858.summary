[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 1-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Ball cancelled out Swindon's early opener as Fleetwood came from behind to draw at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ball, who was a product of Manchester City's academy, netted his ninth goal of the season which is more than double what he managed in the previous campaign.
Swindon took the lead after 12 minutes when Darnell Furlong's cross from the right wing found Luke Norris who directed his header past goalkeeper Alex Cairns from six yards.
However, their lead did not last long as the visitors were back on level terms 10 minutes later when winger Ashley Hunter's low delivery into the area was met by Ball from close range.
Swindon should have regained their lead when referee Darren Deadman pointed to the spot in the 49th minute after Jermaine Hylton was fouled by Fleetwood defender Nathan Pond.
But Michael Doughty's spot-kick was saved by Cairns.
