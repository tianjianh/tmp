Sophie Bray opened the scoring for England against the reigning European champions before Danson added a second.
Kristina Hillmann pulled one back for Germany but Danson added two more to seal an emphatic victory.
England will face Spain, who are also unbeaten, in Friday's semi-finals, while Germany play the Netherlands.
"Germany are a quality side so we knew we had to bring our A-game," said Reading's Danson.
"We're absolutely delighted with the win.
"It was a fantastic first half particularly. Going two goals up so early held us in good stead for the rest of the game."
Meanwhile, Scotland avoided finishing bottom of Pool B with a 3-1 win against Italy.
After a goalless first half, Leigh Fawcett scored just 51 seconds after half-time following a penalty corner before Becky Merchant doubled the lead on her 100th cap from close range.
Seconds later Chiara Tiddi halved Italy's deficit, only for Kareena Marshall to restore Scotland's two-goal advantage with a low shot from another penalty corner.
