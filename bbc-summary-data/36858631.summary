Review of counter-extremism strategy urged by committee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government should reconsider its strategy on fighting extremism because it risks making the situation worse, a parliamentary group has said.

The Joint Committee on Human Rights says ministers should bring in new laws only if there is found to be a "significant gap" in existing powers.
Its report said an assumption there was a link between jihadism and religious conservatism was unproven.
Ministers were warned against driving a "wedge" between communities.
The committee of MPs and peers also urged a review of the government's current Prevent counter-extremism strategy, which is designed to stop people from becoming radicalised.
Plans for a Counter-Extremism Bill were first announced in 2015 and were included in the Queen's Speech in May but the committee says the proposals seem to have stalled or even gone backwards.
The report says there was agreement that tackling terrorism was a priority, but not on how to combat extremism.
On proposed measures to tackle religious conservatism, the committee said these needed to be balanced with the right to freedom of speech.
The government, it adds, should aim "to tackle extremism that leads to violence".
New legislation posed two problems, said the committee - "either it will focus on Muslims, be seen as discriminatory and drive a wedge between communities, or it would operate indiscriminately and could be used against any groups who espouse conservative religious views".
Committee chairwoman Harriet Harman added: "Would applying counter-extremism measures to specifically Islamic religious conservatism in the cause of tackling violence be acceptable discrimination or would it give rise to justified grievance?
"The most precious asset in the fight against terrorism is the relationship between the authorities and the Muslim communities of this country.
"We must guard against any undermining of the relationship between the authorities and Muslim communities, which would make the fight against terrorism even harder."
A Home Office spokeswoman said: "Extremism causes terrorism and broader social harms including hate crime, honour-based violence and discrimination.
"That is why we published a counter-extremism strategy which confronts all forms of extremist ideology head-on, supports mainstream voices, and builds stronger and more cohesive communities.
"This broad counter-extremism agenda is distinct and complementary to our Prevent programme which safeguards those who may be vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism.
"Prevent is both challenging and vitally important work."
