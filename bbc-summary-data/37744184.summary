The Grade II-listed City Pool and Turkish Baths in Newcastle shut in 2013 as part of Â£100m council cuts.
Fusion Lifestyle Ltd plans to renovate the building and restore the baths which are set to reopen in 2018.
The charity leisure operator found the photos which include one of the construction of the entrance pillars before it opened for use in 1928.
Peter Kay, chief executive of Fusion Lifestyle, said: "We're so lucky to have rediscovered the amazing past of the baths and we're proud to give this historic building a proper future.
"The history of baths on this site goes back even further, to when famous [North East architect] John Dobson initially built private baths in 1838 at a cost of Â£9,500."
The facility, which opened on Northumberland Road in 1928, will be one of about a dozen left in operation.
Fusion has also taken over Newcastle City Hall, which was under threat of closure as part of a consultation into multimillion-pound budget cuts in the city.
It will be sub-leased it to the Newcastle Theatre Royal Trust, which will continue to operate it as a concert and entertainment venue.
