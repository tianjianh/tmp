The victim was assaulted on a path between Taghnevan and the Tullygally East Road shortly before midnight.
Police believe he was stabbed, kicked and punched.
"If it were not for the victim's quick actions to stem the bloodflow and, as usual, brilliant work from our NIAS colleagues, this could have been much worse," police said.
Pictures of the man's injuries were posted on the PSNI Craigavon Facebook page.
Police have appealed for anyone with information about the attack to contact them.
