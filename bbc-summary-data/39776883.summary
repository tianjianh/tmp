Kirsty Maxwell, from Livingston, died on Saturday in the tourist area in south east Spain.
It is thought that she was part of a group of more than 30 women who had travelled to the resort for a hen weekend.
A British man was arrested by police in Benidorm in connection with the incident, before being later released.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are supporting the family of a British national who sadly died in Benidorm on 29 April."
He added: "We are in contact with the local authorities following the arrest of a British man."
Mrs Maxwell's body is understood to be found near the swimming pool at the Apartamentos Payma on Saturday.
