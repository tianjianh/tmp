[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England playmaker Rangi Chase has had his contract terminated by Super League side Salford Red Devils following a 'disciplinary procedure'.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chase, who was mid-way through a four-year deal at the end of this season, was revealed as a 2016 signing by Leigh on BBC Radio Manchester, although the deal has not been formalised to date.
The 29-year-old had already been granted a free transfer by Salford.
He was suspended internally by the club in September pending the hearing.

The 2011 Man of Steel, who missed the final four games of the season because of that suspension, joined the Red Devils from Castleford for 2014 and scored seven tries in 17 league games in 2015.
The New Zealand-born half-back qualified for England on residential grounds in 2011 and has since gone on to win 11 caps, but has not featured since losing his place to Gareth Widdop for the 2013 World Cup semi-final defeat by the Kiwis.
Chase was banned for seven matches in April for a dangerous throw on Huddersfield forward Brett Ferres, but also showed off his skills during the campaign, notably with an assist for a Josh Griffin try against Hull FC.
