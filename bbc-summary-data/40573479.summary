New Giants coach Adam Keefe said he had no hesitation in signing Ferland.
"When you look at his résumé, you simply cannot pass him up," said Keefe.
"He provides leadership and has a great work ethic and is someone who has put up 20 plus goals a season everywhere he has been.
"He wants to win and that is exactly what we are looking for in a player.
"As for Sebastien Sylvestre, I'm told he is an extremely talented player who works hard. He is a player who we will look to develop and he is really excited to be coming to Belfast."
