The 20-year-old, who can also play at centre-half, has made 24 appearances for Boro since joining the club in August.
Ogilvie is yet to feature for Tottenham's first team, but was on the bench for a Europa League match at Benfica in March 2014.
Stevenage are 21st in League Two, eight points above the relegation zone.
