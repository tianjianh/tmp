The 28-year-old's time of 26 minutes 46.57 seconds wiped six seconds off Mohammed Mourhit's previous European record, dating back to 1999.
He also bettered Jon Brown's 13-year-old British record of 27:18.14.
"That was awesome. I wanted to break the British record," the Somalia-born Farah told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I was really confident and I knew if I could stay in the group I could work my way through and see what I could do on the last lap."
Farah, who won the 5,000 and 10,000m at last year's European Championships, finished just ahead of Ethiopia's Imane Merga, whose time of 26:48.35 was a new personal best.
"I want a world [championship] medal and showed here that if I keep working hard I will be in the mix," added Farah, whose previous fastest time was a 27:28.26 set last year.
"This is definitely a special track. If it wasn't for the crowds I would never have done this. With three laps to go I knew I had the chance for the record."
Farah appears to be benefitting from a move earlier this year to the United States where he began working in Oregon with Alberto Salazar, who won three successive New York marathons.
That was a truly world class performance from Mo beating a very strong field
"I wasn't even looking to win this race. I just wanted to run a good time. Alberto told me before the race I was ready to run under 27 minutes and I just used my patience," stated Farah.
Farah's performance earned some high praise from UK Athletics head coach Charles van Commenee.
"That was a truly world class performance from Mo beating a very strong field," he said.
"I am delighted for him. Not only did he destroy both the British and European records, he stood out in a global quality race and beat some of the world's top athletes.
"That is a positive indication as we move towards the World Championships and London 2012."
Another notable performance of the evening saw Kenya's Moses Mosop break the 30-year-old world record for the rarely run 30k.
The 25-year-old clocked a time of one hour 26 minutes 47.4 seconds, breaking the previous record of 1:29:18.8 set by Japan's Toshihiko Seko in 1981.
