Abdullahi Ahmed Jama Farah, 20, created a UK "hub of communication" for like-minded extremists, from his mother's Manchester home, the Old Bailey heard.
Following a trial he was found guilty of preparing for terrorist acts.
Jama Farah, of South Grove, Manchester helped Nur Hassan, 19, also of the city, get to Syria, the jury heard.
Farah is related to Zhara and Salma Halane, who at the age of 16 left their home in Chorlton in Manchester, in June 2014, and are believed to have married IS fighters.
Prosecutor Gareth Patterson told jurors it was clear Farah supported so-called IS from what was found on his computer and mobile phone.
As well as helping Nur Hassan travel to Syria, the court heard he had been in contact with friends abroad via messaging service Whatsapp and social media.
The jury convicted Farah, who is of Somali origin, for helping Hassan and for his communication with Khalil Raoufi who was killed in combat.
Farah was in contact with close friends Khalil Raoufi, Raphael Hostey, and Mohammed Javeed who headed from north west England to Syria on 6 October 2013, to join IS, the court heard.
Raoufi, who was also known as Abu Layth, was killed in February 2104 , Hostey or Al Qaqa, was shot in the foot.
Javeed, nicknamed Prinny, ended up in Iraq, where he blew himself up in a suicide attack.
The friends subsequently discussed "doing a prinny", the court heard.
Farah's cousin Ahmed Ibrahim Halane, from Manchester, went to Somalia in September 2013, where he is thought to have joined the terrorist group al-Shabaab.
Halane, brother of the "terror twins", is currently in Copenhagen, banned from returning to the UK.
During the trial, Farah denied any wrongdoing.
His defence claimed he was an over-excited teenager in contact with his friends and passing on phone numbers, concerned for their welfare.
Det Ch Supt Tony Mole, head of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: "Although he may not have been there committing these acts himself, his actions helped facilitate what they [his friends] were doing and I hope his conviction will send a message to all those who are even considering offering a helping hand to terrorists."
