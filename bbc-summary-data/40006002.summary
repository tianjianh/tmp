The blaze took hold of the Royal Victoria Hospital building at about 16:20.
Firefighters used six pumping appliances and breathing apparatus to battle the blaze. They were still at the scene a number of hours later.
A Scottish Fire and Rescue spokeswoman said there were no casualties in the incident.
The fire was reported by a significant number of people as smoke rose from the abandoned building.
The Royal Victoria Hospital was closed in 2012, but later temporarily reopened to deal with seasonal demand.
