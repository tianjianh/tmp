Television viewers of the Premier League clash between Arsenal and Tottenham were left frustrated as a power cut hit the north London stadium.

BT Sport confirmed a power outage caused a brief loss of pictures and sound in the dying minutes of the game at White Hart Lane.
The match, touted as the biggest north London derby of a generation, finished 2-2.
BT apologised and said it was "investigating the root cause".
A spokesman said: "We are sorry for the temporary loss of picture and sound. This was due to a loss of power at the stadium."
BT Sport quickly displayed a technical fault message on screen, and when the pictures returned - initially without accompanying sound - it was just in time for fans to see a last-ditch tackle from Tottenham's Kevin Wimmer which prevented Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey from scoring a potential winning goal.
After the match, presenter Jake Humphrey told viewers: "What a pleasure that was, apart from the couple of minutes that you lost and apologies again for that."
The draw earned Arsenal a vital point as Spurs missed the opportunity to go top of the Premier League.
Fans took to Twitter to vent their frustration at missing the crucial minutes of added time.
