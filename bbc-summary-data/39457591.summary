Kasabian's latest music video has been called "damaging" by a mental health organisation.

The video for You're In Love With A Psycho sees band members dancing around a mental institution with presenter Noel Fielding and Taboo actor Stephen Graham.
Mental health campaigners Time to Change said the video played into a "sad and tired" stereotype.
The BBC has contacted Kasabian for a response.
The video sees the celebrity stars and Kasabian band members wearing flesh-coloured hospital gowns and taking medication before gathering their fellow residents for an aerobics-inspired dance routine.
Time to Change, a movement trying to change public attitude towards people with mental health problems, said the video - combined with the use of the word psycho - was "unhelpful".
Singer Tom Meighan has previously talked about his own mental health. In an interview with Q magazine, he discussed the impact of a friend's death and how he made himself ill.
Director of Time to Change, Sue Baker, said: "As so many musicians have recently talked openly about their experiences of mental health problems it is disappointing to see this video.
"The use of the word 'psycho' in a song and accompanying music video featuring people pretending to be psychiatric inpatients is unhelpful, damaging and disappointing when society is moving on from this sad and tired stereotype."
She said while the harm may have been "unintentional, or misjudged irony", the video will "only serve to fuel stigma".
Ms Baker added: "If fans think it is OK to call people with mental health problems who have been psychiatric inpatients 'psychos', then we are turning back the tide of progress on public attitudes that are more respectful and less judgemental of people living with mental health problems.
"We are keen to work with the band and the music industry to help shift outdated stereotypes and stigma."
You're In Love With A Psycho is the first single from Kasabian's forthcoming sixth album, For Crying Out Loud.
