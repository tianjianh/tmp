Jersey transport review considers taxi-sharing service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A taxi-sharing service could be introduced in Jersey, under proposals being considered by the island's transport authority.

It is part of a taxi regulation review carried out by the States of Jersey Transport and Technical Services.
If implemented, it could allow people travelling to the same area or destination to share the cost.
The Taxi Drivers Association has sounded caution, claiming previous attempts have had mixed results.
"It's something that has to be handled very carefully," association president Mick Tostevin said.
"If people want to share a taxi to go to similar destinations, that's really got to come from the public themselves."
But David Dore, the director of taxi firm Red Cabs, said he would welcome a States-approved service which would offer cheaper fares.
"There's clearly a gap in the market for lower costs in taxis," he said.
Mr Dore also believes it could discourage illegal operations, such as a Facebook group which is currently being targeted by Jersey Police.
"We've heard a few horror stories about customers... sadly there's always people who will be taking advantage of circumstances," he said.
It is hoped the taxi review will be published later this month.
No-one from Jersey Police was available to comment on the sharing proposal.
