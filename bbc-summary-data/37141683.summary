Leeds City Council said the event would recognise the "fantastic performances" of Yorkshire's athletes in Rio.
Council leader Judith Blake said it would give the sportsmen and women the "recognition and appreciation they so fully deserve".
She said the date and full details of the event were still being finalised.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Manchester will host the main homecoming parade for Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes, while a second event will be held in London.
Both parades will take place in October.
Writing on Twitter, Leeds City Council's chief executive Tom Riordan said: "We've no problem with Manchester but we'll be doing a great, fitting homecoming in Leeds that our heroes deserve."
