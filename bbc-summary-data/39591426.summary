[SN]TITLE[SN]
Celtic players should dominate annual awards, says manager Brendan Rodgers

Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers expects the end-of-season player awards to reflect the dominance of his title-winning team.

PFA Scotland forms have been distributed to players to vote for their Player of the Year - an award Celtic have won three years in a row.
"I've got the best players," the Celtic manager said.
"You could go through the whole squad, players who have performed at a high level, consistently, in big games."
Rodgers has been impressed with several opposition players this season, particularly from Derek McInnes' Aberdeen.
He insists, though, that individually and collectively, his players have been the most effective as Celtic won their sixth consecutive league title.
"There are some very good players I've come across in the league, the likes of Johnny Hayes at Aberdeen," said Rodgers.
"I know him well. I took him across to England at Reading. Niall McGinn, Kenny McLean, these boys have been very good.
"But I look at my own and I wouldn't swap any of them for anyone."
Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths won the PFA Scotland award last season, with team-mates Stefan Johansen and Kris Commons topping the poll in the years previous.
Rodgers himself will be able to cast a vote in the manager of the year awards, won last year by Rangers' Mark Warburton, and he highlighted the work of several of his peers in the Premiership, including McInnes, Alan Archibald and Tommy Wright.
"There are guys up here I've been very impressed with and it's been great for me to meet people I hadn't known," the Celtic manager said.
"I only really knew Derek when I came up here and he's done an outstanding job with Aberdeen - how he's consistently got the players performing.
"Other managers in there, Alan at Partick Thistle - I said from early on, when they were bottom, that I was really impressed with their work and it's nice to see how they've grown and developed over the course of the season.
"I'm an admirer of Tommy at St Johnstone. He always does a great job."
Rodgers takes his unbeaten side to Dingwall on Sunday and he says there are likely to be changes to the starting line-up now that the title has been secured.
He insists that he will pick a strong team and not rest any players because there is the Scottish Cup semi-final against city rivals Rangers on the horizon.
"Between now and the end of the campaign, some of the players who have been on the outside will get some games and it's a chance to give one or two with knocks the right preparation," Rodgers said.
"There will be some changes through the course of the season, but I don't give up places just for the sake of it.
"If there's a young player who comes in, he has to earn his place in the team over a senior professional.
"The young players have to fight to stand out and then there's always possibilities they can play."
