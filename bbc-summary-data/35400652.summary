Call over 'accident blackspot' near Borders General Hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NHS Borders and Scottish Borders Council have called for decisive action over an "accident blackspot" at the junction to Borders General Hospital.

They said there had been seven injury accidents at the site since improvements were carried out in 2011.
The two organisations have written to the Scottish government asking it to help resolve the issue.
Transport Scotland is investigating the problems and hopes to have completed its studies by the end of March.
NHS chairman John Raine and SBC leader David Parker are behind the calls for action on the junction from the hospital to the Melrose bypass - the A6091 road.
"I have received considerable representation from staff and patients at the BGH about concerns at the road junction and the regular accidents that take place there," Mr Raine said.
"There are very real worries about the entrance to the BGH and it is completely unacceptable that the region's only hospital should have an accident blackspot at its entrance."
Mr Parker said "minor tweaks" had been made in 2012 but it was time for "something more substantial" to be done.
"The road junction at the BGH is in my ward, and as well as my own constituents who regularly raise concerns, a great many people from communities across the Borders have made representations to me about the unacceptable nature of the junction and the many accidents which happen there," he said.
As well as writing to Transport Minister Derek Mackay, the council and the health board have contacted local MPs and MSPs to raise the issue.
A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: "Road safety is a key priority and we can confirm the Borders General Hospital junction has been identified for investigation.
"Our operating company for the south east unit, Amey, are due to complete this road safety investigation by the end of March and we will consider any recommendations made once the report has been received."
