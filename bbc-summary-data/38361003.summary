[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 1-2 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Piero Mingoia's late strike handed Cambridge United a victory at Stevenage that kept them in the League Two play-off places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Boro have struggled at home this season, and it was easy to see why when Leon Legge was allowed a free run to powerfully head home Harrison Dunk's corner to give the visitors the lead.
An instant leveller almost came from Matt Godden, but Will Norris was alert enough to make a point-blank save before gathering the tame follow-up effort.
Ben Kennedy levelled the scores with a low curling shot early in the second half, with poor marking from a free-kick allowing him space to fire at goal.
The visitors came close to going in front a second time, but Luke Berry was denied by the inside of the post as the U's continued to search for a winner.
And that deciding goal finally came when Jamie Jones spilled a cross to Mingoia, who hammered the ball high into the net with less than 10 minutes remaining.
