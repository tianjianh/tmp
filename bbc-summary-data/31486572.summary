Super Mario better jumper than you think

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Despite his short, podgy frame, there's no denying Mario is blessed with extraordinary leaping skills.

Even Bowser would be impressed with his ability to bound through a world of floating coins and wide crevasses.
The American broadcaster PBS has tried to explain his gift. You might be impressed.
The Space Time Show worked out, based on the plumber's 3.5m jump, he lives in a world with eight times the Earth's gravity.
That's so strong, even the Solar System's biggest planet, Jupiter, doesn't have that much gravity.
(Even if it did, Mario wouldn't be able to jump on it because it's a gas planet, obvs.)
Low gravity - such as occurs on the Moon - allows great leaps with little effort. This meant that astronauts could jump around the lunar surface despite their heavy spacesuits.
That Mario can jump twice his own height in Super Mario World, shows the Italian must regularly hit the squat rack to leap as high and as quickly as he does.
He must also have a super heart, since a normal human heart wouldn't be able to pump blood around his body given the gravitation pull of his planet.
If the plumber lived on Earth - with its gravity - he could easily jump over six double-decker buses.
Hopefully Princess Peach will be grateful for all the training he puts in just to rescue her.
