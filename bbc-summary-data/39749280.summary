Doping in sport: International Tennis Federation increases budget for drug testing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is to be a significant increase in the amount of drug testing in tennis, and more samples will be stored for future analysis.

Up to 8,000 samples will now be taken every year, with those provided by the highest-ranked players the most likely to be placed in long-term storage.
There were 4,899 samples taken in 2016.
An anti-doping budget increase of over 50% to Â£3.48m will help "ensure tennis is and remains a clean sport", the International Tennis Federation said.
President David Haggerty added: "Protecting the integrity of tennis is an ongoing priority and these enhancements will make a positive contribution to achieving that."
The most recent high-profile case of doping in tennis came when Maria Sharapova was banned for 15 months.
The five-time Grand Slam winner, 30, returned from suspension at this week's Stuttgart Open, where she reached the semi-finals on Friday.
The former world number one was called "a cheat" by 2014 Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard on Thursday.
Sharapova said she was "way above" replying to criticism of her comeback by her rivals.
