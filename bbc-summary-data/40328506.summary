Fifty groups from across the country have received a share of £9.6m from the Big Lottery Fund Scotland (BLFS).

The money is aimed at supporting people and communities to "overcome challenging circumstances".
The biggest beneficiary in the latest round is Kirkcudbright Development Trust, which receives £850,000 to turn a former school into a community hub.
Maureen McGinn, who chairs the BLFS, said the money could "transform the lives of local people".
The Kirkcudbright project will see the transformation of the former Johnston Primary into a hub which incorporates a childcare centre, a tourist attraction, business units and an emergency service base.
The Glenkens Community and Arts Trust in Dumfries and Galloway has secured £148,772 while the Peeblesshire Youth Trust in the neighbouring Scottish Borders has been awarded £97,000.
