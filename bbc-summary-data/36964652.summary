Swansea City expect to announce at least one new signing in the coming days, says chairman Huw Jenkins.

Jenkins has already admitted Swansea need "at least two strikers" following the departures of Eder,Alberto Paloschi and Bafetimbi Gomis.
Tottenham forward Nacer Chadli and Leonardo Ulloa of Leicester have also been linked to the Liberty Stadium.
"We fully expect to make one or two additions in the next few days," said Jenkins.
"It was always going to be the case after the Euros that a lot of the transfer business would be done later than normal.
"It was always going to be a process of getting players out first so that we were in a position to take advantage of the transfer window and bring new players in.
"We also had to bring the numbers down in the squad to give the young players at the club the chance to progress and be involved in the first team.
"Coupled with one or two more experienced additions, we will be close to assembling a squad that will be ready for another competitive season in the Premier League."
There has been plenty of transfer speculation in the wake of American investment and rivals' interest in some of the Swans' star players.
The Premier League side have rejected a Â£10m bid from Everton for central defender Ashley Williams after the Wales and Swans captain was reported to be close to agreeing a move to Goodison Park.
"With the increased media coverage, especially the flood of speculation and stories on the internet, it is vital to try and keep the majority of our business behind closed doors wherever possible,'' said Jenkins.
"The more of our work that remains confidential, then the better chance we have of protecting our on-going negotiations and getting transfers over the finishing line.
"The more leaks we have and stories in the media, then the more chance there is of alerting other clubs and the transfer falling through.''
Jenkins also moved to reassure Swans fans after what he called a "frustrating summer" and hopes there will be more positive news to come after midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson and winger Nathan Dyer signed new four-year contracts with the club.
"This pre-season has been difficult with the majority of European players returning late from the Euros and the timescale involved in the change of club ownership,'' he said.
"But I can assure you that every person connected to this football club has been working non-stop to get the squad right in all areas to start the season."
