The woman was reported missing on the Aurora ship as it sailed from the Spanish city of La Coruna to Barcelona on Friday, P&O Cruises said.
The ship's crew were alerted and ordered an immediate search for the woman, who has not yet been named.
The Aurora left Southampton for a 14-night western Mediterranean cruise on 26 September.
A statement from P&O Cruises said: "Our care team is supporting the family and offering assistance."
The company confirmed all passengers on board were British.
It is understood that passengers were informed of the discovery of the body through an announcement from the ship's captain, Ian Hutley.
Pat Rodgers, who is on board the Aurora with her husband, said the water had been "very choppy" and fellow passengers were "sad and subdued".
She said: "The captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker at 8:10 BST and asked everyone to help keep a look-out.
"There have been planes and a helicopter circling overhead and the lifeboats are out."
She added: "The crew have been great. They are keeping things calm and the captain is giving frequent updates."
