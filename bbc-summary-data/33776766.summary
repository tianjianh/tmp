The farmers went to the Shrewsbury store on Sunday evening and gave away their purchases to members of the public.
It follows Arla, Britain's biggest milk co-operative, cutting the price by 0.8p per litre, making a litre cost 23.01p.
Many farmers say that amount is not enough for them to make a profit.
