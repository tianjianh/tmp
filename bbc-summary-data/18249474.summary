Greenland profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greenland is the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish dependent territory with limited self-government and its own parliament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denmark contributes two thirds of Greenland's budget revenue, the rest coming mainly from fishing. Potential oil, gas and rare earth mineral reserves have attracted prospecting firms.
Greenland enjoys perpetual daylight for two months each year but over 80% of the island is covered by an ice cap 4km thick in places. Global warming is feared to be causing the ice cover to melt increasingly fast but has also increased access to Greenland's mineral resources.
The USA has long seen Greenland as strategically important and established a radar base at Thule at the start of the Cold War.
The island's population is only 57,000. Inhabitants face severe social problems, notably unemployment, alcoholism and HIV/AIDS.
