Gillingham's relegation fears increased following a defeat by struggling Charlton at The Valley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ady Pennock's men had the first opportunity of the game after just five minutes when Cody McDonald was fed nicely by Lee Martin but could only hit the side-netting.
Charlton's first chance came through Nathan Byrne who saw his shot deflect wide.
The subsequent corner in the 20th minute by Ricky Holmes found the head of Jason Pearce to score his first of the season to give the Addicks the lead.
Karl Robinson's side then doubled their advantage after 31 minutes when Holmes fired home a lovely free-kick to secure his 11th goal of the season.
Gillingham could have pulled a goal back before half-time but Joe Quigley headed wide.
After the break, Charlton extended their lead when Jordan Botaka teed up Josh Magennis, who kept calm to convert from inside the penalty area.
The result leaves the Gills four points above the drop although they have played a game more than 21st-placed Port Vale.
