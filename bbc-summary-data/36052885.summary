Cardiff City: Russell Slade confident he deserves new deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russell Slade believes he deserves to stay on as Cardiff City manager - even if the club miss out on the play-offs.

The Bluebirds are five points outside the Championship top six with five games to play.
Talks over a new deal have yet to begin and, when asked if he felt he deserved one, Slade said: "Yes I do.
"It's been a difficult season, but we've managed to be competitive and play football that's got us up the table."
However, Slade said he was surprised by reports that Cardiff were set to reward him with a new contract.
"That was news to me. My focus is obviously on getting the club into the top six," he said.
"My relationship (with owner Vincent Tan) has always been strong. We were always going to sit down at or towards the end of the season to see where we're going.
"Anything that happens between now and then would remain private between the two parties.
"There's not a contract offer on the table at the moment, but obviously I would love to stay.
"It's been a difficult season at times, but we've remained competitive and credit to the team for that."
Slade confirmed Cardiff are hoping to complete a deal to sign striker Lex Immers on a permanent basis.
The Dutchman has scored five goals in 12 appearances on loan from Feyenoord.
"There's strong dialogue between the relevant parties," Slade said.
"Lex has done well here. The way he's adapted, he wants to remain here and we're looking at that and hoping to make progress.
"It would be one for the summer, we're confident of doing something."
Slade says Cardiff need to at least match sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday if they're to make the play offs. They face QPR on Saturday.
"I wouldn't say it's necessarily win or bust against QPR," he said.
"We have to match Sheffield Wednesday in the next two games. Then they go to Derby when we're at home and then we go to Sheffield.
"It's important we keep it alive and have a chance when we go to Wednesday. Things will be sorted there.
"If we need three points on the final day of the season, then we'll take that."
