Italian Forestieri, 26, has scored 21 goals in 61 appearances since joining the Owls from Watford in August 2015.
Hutchinson, 27, joined Wednesday from Chelsea in July 2014 and has made 68 league appearances.
Both players will now stay at Hillsborough until the end of the 2019-20 season.
Forestieri's previous deal was due to run out in 2019 and he was linked with a move away last summer after winning the club's player of the year award.
The Owls, losing play-off finalists last season, occupy the final Championship play-off position this campaign after just one defeat in their last nine league matches.
