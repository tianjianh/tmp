[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Ulster Gazette carries a poignant plea from the family of a Glenanne man found dead in Markethill, last June.

"Justice for James" reads the front-page headline. Police believe James Shields, 52, was the victim of a hit-and-run driver. No-one has been charged over his death.
His nephew, David Brooks, says the family are "still struggling" with their loss and has asked the community to help them find whoever was responsible.
The County Down Outlook features an interview with a mother who made what the paper calls "an alarming discovery".
Her account - headlined My daughter: the cyber-bully - relates how the police informed her that her teenage daughter was cyber-bullying online, using a mobile app that allows users to capture videos and pictures that delete themselves after a few seconds.
Police told her they were dealing with cases on a daily basis. The child has now been banned from her mobile phone by her mother for 10 days and is not allowed to use it in school or in her bedroom.
The mother said she wanted to warn other parents to be aware of the dangers.
Meanwhile, the names of 153 soldiers who died in World War One could be added to Ballymena's war memorial at the town's Galgorm Road park.
The Ballymena Times reports that when the obelisk was unveiled in 1924, the names of 495 soldiers from the town and the surrounding area were recorded.
However, researchers have found that many names were missing - it will cost in the region of Â£20,000 to include them, but the paper reports that this would be offset by a 75% grant.
It is understood a consultation will be held in September.
A plea by North Antrim MLA Jim Allister for a planning decision on a Â£15m hotel to be removed from council control makes the front page of the Coleraine Chronicle.
Mr Allister claims council officers had prior discussions with the developers and has written to the government department with oversight of planning suggesting the application is "called in".
The paper says he has already lodged private objections to the Portstewart scheme based on its potential impact on his nearby holiday home.
Causeway Coast and Glens Council has said it had a responsibility to work proactively with businesses seeking to invest in the borough.
It said: "Pre-application discussions are a central part of this process and are encouraged prior to the submission of proposed applications."
Tributes to a senior nurse who is credited with saving "countless lives" feature in the Tyrone Times.
Mark Quinn from Dungannon worked at South Tyrone Hospital and Craigavon for many years.
He had cancer and died last week, the paper reports. The North West Mountain Rescue Team are among the organisations who have expressed their condolences, with former colleagues describing him as a "true gentleman".
The front page of the Fermanagh Herald reports on an incident at Erne Integrated College in Enniskillen this month which resulted in one teenager being arrested and another suffering a back injury.
The paper says mystery surrounds what happened during the incident on 8 June, with unconfirmed reports that a stabbing had taken place being denied by the school principal Jimmy Jackson-Ware.
Police say a teenage boy who was arrested has been released pending a report to the Public Prosecution Service.
