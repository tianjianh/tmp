[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two drug dealers have been convicted of shooting dead a woman as she looked for them armed with a baseball bat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kerry Reeves, 26, died two days after being shot in the face outside flats in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in November.
Billy Johnson, 20, from Corby, Northamptonshire, and Charles Noble, 21, from London, were found guilty of Ms Reeve's murder.
A jury at Oxford Crown Court heard there had been "tension" between the defendants and some of her friends.
Both sides had a background of drugs, alcohol and violence and Johnson and Noble were heroin dealers, the court heard.
Jurors were told how Ms Reeves, armed with a metal baseball bat, and two of her friends had gone looking for the pair when they were ambushed by them outside the flats at Thornhill Walk, Abingdon on 3 November last year.
She was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after being shot, but died two days later.
Johnson and Noble are due to be sentenced on Tuesday.
