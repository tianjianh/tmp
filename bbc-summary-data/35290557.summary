[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Calvin Markall, 26, hit Hamid Ali Khan as he attempted to cross a road from his home to a playground in Riverside, Cardiff, in February 2015.
Markall, from Rumney, initially denied death by dangerous driving but changed his plea to guilty at Newport Crown Court on 7 January.
He was also banned from driving for three years.
The court heard witnesses estimated Markall was driving a white Audi S3 at up to 70mph on Ninian Park Road, a built-up area with a 30mph limit.
Markall drove away briefly after the incident and seemed "panicky", according to witnesses, but then returned to the scene and identified himself to police.
He told officers: "I'm just concerned about the boy," who he said appeared in the road adding: "There was no way I could stop."
After his arrest he told police: "I can't believe I've taken a life."
In mitigation, Robin Howat said Markall had removed his car from the scene in order to park it, and returned immediately, within nine minutes of the 999 call.
He said because of the width of the road, Markall would have had 1.5 seconds to react to Hamid crossing the road.
The court was told Markall was jailed for 10 years in prison for drugs offences in 2009, and had been released in December 2014.
The judge, Thomas Crowther QC, said no blame should be attached to Fitzalan High School pupil Hamid and the situation was "entirely Mr Markall's making" due to his speed.
A witness impact statement from Hamid's father Sarfaraz Khan was read in court and he said he felt no anger towards Markall, whose actions he described as "stupid" and "immature".
"Our whole family are completely devastated after our little angel Hamid passed away," he said.
"Every Friday at this time [when the incident happened] we always think about him and just hope he will walk through the door but this will never happen."
Sentencing Markall, Judge Crowther told him he had placed value on "status, image and thrills", and had enjoyed driving the white Audi around Cardiff.
He said: "Hamid was at the centre of a large family and was particularly close to his brother Yusef. His family is bereft.
"No sentence I can pass can repair the damage that's been caused or begin to value the life that's been thrown away."
He described the events as a "short course of utterly irresponsible driving" and said: "There was a substantial risk of danger."
However he noted Markall had shown "genuine remorse", adding: "Perhaps you, as I have, will marvel at the dignity and humanity of Hamid's father who says he feels no anger."
