[SN]TITLE[SN]
Singapore terms join Oxford English Dictionary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Several Singaporean and Hong Kong English terms, including "wah", "shiok" and "yum cha", are now officially recognised as acceptable English.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) added 19 Singaporean terms and 13 Hong Kong terms in its latest update.
"Wah" is an expression of delight or surprise, "shiok" means cool, and "yum cha" is a type of Chinese brunch.
Additions also include "blur", which means confused or ignorant, and "sabo", which means to harm or play a prank on.
The dictionary included formations of English that are mostly used in Singapore or Hong Kong.
For example, "compensated dating", a Hong Kong term, refers to the practice of teenage students providing companionship or sex in exchange for money or gifts.
And "Chinese helicopter" is a derogatory term referring to a Singaporean whose schooling was conducted in Mandarin Chinese and has limited knowledge of English.
The OED records the meaning and development of the English language.
It says that, for a word to qualify, there must be "several independent examples of the word being used, and also evidence the word has been in use for a reasonable amount of time".
