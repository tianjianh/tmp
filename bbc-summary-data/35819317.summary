The Briton, 31, who begins his title defence at the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday, posted videos on Snapchat of him travelling on a motorway.
It is illegal to use phones whilst driving in New Zealand.
Police reviewed the incident but will not be taking further action after citing a lack of "sufficient evidence".
"Auckland City Police will be taking no further action in relation to recent media publicity about Lewis Hamilton and his motorcycle journey in Auckland," a police spokesperson said.
"The video footage available does not provide us with sufficient enough evidence that an offence has occurred."
It is not the first time three-time world champion Hamilton has been involved in driving incidents.
The Briton was fined around £300 after performing car stunts for fans outside Melbourne's motor racing circuit, before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix.
He also had his driving licence suspended for a month in France in 2007 for speeding on a motorway.
And in November, Hamilton crashed his £1.6m super car in Monaco because "heavy partying" had left him tired.
