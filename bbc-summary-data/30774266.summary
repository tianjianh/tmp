What did the Golden Globes tell us about next month's Oscars?

As hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler said, it was a night to "celebrate all the movies North Korea was OK with".

Hollywood's finest - and Jennifer Lopez - descended on Los Angeles for the 2015 Golden Globes, as the film and television awards season kicked off.
The Globes, although highly desirable in their own right, are also historically good indicators of who'll walk away with a golden statuette at next month's Oscars.
So what did we learn this time around?
Eddie Redmayne is one of those really annoying people that everything seems easy for.
Disarmingly good-looking, Cambridge-educated and now a Golden Globe winner, you begin to wonder where it all went wrong.
The 32-year-old won best actor in a drama for his role as physicist Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.
And it has all the necessary ingredients for Academy Award success too.
Almost one in five of the best actor Oscars have gone to performers playing a character based on a real person, including the likes of Colin Firth as George VI in the King's Speech and Sean Penn as gay rights activist Harvey Milk.
Perhaps the most shocking revelation of the night came on the red carpet.
After a cinematic dry patch that's lasted a fair few years, many in the film industry had begun to wonder where exactly Catherine Zeta-Jones had disappeared to.
Well, it turns out she's been hiding in your phone, disguised as the dancing lady emoji.
With Hollywood fast running out of comic books to turn in to Hollywood blockbusters, perhaps Zeta-Jones is subtly manoeuvring herself to the front of the queue for the forthcoming release of The Emoji film.
Watch Shia LaBeouf follow suit next month by arriving at the Oscars with a monkey mask over his face.
For those not quite as forward thinking as Zeta-Jones, Sunday night marked a rare chance to give the old wedding dress a second outing.
At times the red carpet resembled a wedding exhibition, with a throng of A-listers waltzing their way down in all white.
Emily Blunt, Salma Hayek and Rosamund Pike all channelled their inner bride, while newly-married Amal Clooney donned a pair of white gloves.
Now obviously to repeat the trick and wear the same dress for next month's Oscars is not far from being an arrestable offence in downtown LA.
But you can be sure white will make a reappearance of some sorts, as no other colour shows off that Californian sun-kissed look quite like it.
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler did a fine job as co-hosts of the event for a third year.
From George Clooney to Bill Cosby, no-one was safe from the pair's quick wit and acid tongues.
But the pair saved their best gags of the night for North Korea, its leader Kim Jong-Un and Seth Rogen film The Interview.
"We celebrate all the great television shows we know and love and all the movies North Korea was OK with."
Making reference to the controversial comedy, they said North Korea called it: "Intolerable wanton act of terror, and that wasn't the worst review the movie got."
Hollywood doesn't like to be told what it can and can't do by anyone, so expect plenty more North Korean references by Oscar host Neil Patrick Harris in February.
