Residents say the cars lost control before mounting the pavement and left the trail of damage.
Emergency services received "multiple" 999 calls asking for help in Dunstable Road, Luton.
One resident who was affected said the road was "very dangerous" while another said it was used "like a race track".
Bedfordshire Police said they were called to the road, a dual carriageway, just after 23:00 GMT on Monday after the crash. No-one has been arrested.
Mary Collier, whose house was damaged, described the road as "very dangerous".
Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: ""[The first car] took my wall out, took the whole of the side of my car out, took my fence out, my neighbour's pillar and their front door.
"He smashed into their car which pushed it into the next neighbour's car and both their cars got damaged, plus the neighbour after that.
"Then there was another car that went up and it hit the green Astra and he ended up in their drive. [He's] totally written that car off and the third car went into the neighbour about six doors up, and damaged both their cars, wrote them off, broke their wall and everything."
"We see kids using this as like a racetrack now," he said.
East of England Ambulance Service confirmed it had taken two people to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital after receiving "multiple" calls.
