Drones considered for Whitehaven gull problem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council is considering using drones to tackle aggressive gulls which have snatched ice cream from children.

An eight-year-old boy in Whitehaven was left "traumatised" when a "seagull swooped down, took the ice cream out of his hand and off it went", Copeland Borough councillor Graham Roberts said.
"Anybody with any food near their face could have their nose or eye pecked," he said.
The drones spray nests with a chemical to stop eggs hatching.
Mr Roberts said council bosses were concerned the gulls could deter tourists and hit the harbour town's hospitality businesses.
He said: "Whitehaven's a lovely place to visit and we don't want incidents with seagulls to deter people from coming.
"People don't want to be in fear of being attacked by seagulls."
Spraying gull eggs by hand risks attack from the birds, Mr Roberts said.
The use of Drones is one of a number of options being discussed by the council on 27 August. Other options include acoustic electronic devices and manual egg-treating.
Mr Roberts added: "It's frightening. We've got to do something about it.
"Drones have been used in France quite successfully as have acoustic devices which can also be effective.
"The fact is we can't stand by while people are being hurt. As councillors we have to protect those we represent and people want action.
"Depending on the cost of using drones I think it's very likely we will begin using them within the next six months to a year."
