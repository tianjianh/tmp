[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inverness headquarters for Scottish Land Commission

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Land Commission is to be based in Inverness, bringing about 20 new jobs to the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five Land Commissioners, the Tenant Farming Commissioner and support staff will be headquartered at Longman House.
The commission will review law and policy, and make recommendations to the Scottish government.
Land Reform Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said she was "determined to ensure all of the people of Scotland can benefit from our land".
The commission is being set up as part of new legislation, the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016.
Its interim chief executive officer will be Hilary Pearce, a seconded Scottish government civil servant.
She will work on establishing the commission until summer 2017.
Ms Cunningham said: "This will provide approximately 20 new jobs in the area while providing a base that is easily accessible for all parts of Scotland.
"The city location symbolises that land reform is no longer an exclusively rural issue - we want to see people in our towns and cities reap the benefits of land reform too.
"The commission will have an important role reviewing policy and legislation, help to influence future developments relating the ownership of Scotland's land and how we ensure communities across Scotland realise their potential."
