Brain surgery patient found 30 miles from John Radcliffe ward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital patient who had undergone brain surgery was found 30 miles away after wandering off from a ward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Howe, 64, vanished from John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford at about 18:00 GMT on Sunday.
He was found by a member of the public 30 miles (48km) away in Reading shortly after 11:00 GMT on Monday.
Mr Howe's daughter, Zoe, said her father had been disoriented following his surgery.
She said he had been unable to explain how he got to Reading.
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said it was looking into the processes that were followed once it was established he was missing.
Catherine Stoddart, chief nurse for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: "Our priority was his safe return so that he can continue his care.
"The trust will be having an investigation into how Mr Howe was able to go missing."
Mr Howe is now back at the hospital being monitored.
