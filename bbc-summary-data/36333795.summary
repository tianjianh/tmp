The 25-year-old centre-back initially joined the club on loan from Brighton and Hove Albion in 2011.
Cook has made 35 appearances for Eddie Howe's side this term, scoring five goals.
"It was not a tough decision for me to stay. My family love it here and I love it here," Cook told the club website.
"The club is obviously still growing, so hopefully I can continue to be a part of that."
Cook signed for the Cherries permanently from Brighton in 2012 after a successful loan spell.
"It's great to be able to get this deal sorted so quickly and secure the future of such a key asset," added Bournemouth chief executive Neill Blake.
"He has been a fundamental part of the team's success this season and we look forward to sharing many more successful years together."
Bournemouth boss Howe confirmed the club rejected a Â£20m bid from West Ham for duo Matt Ritchie and Callum Wilson on Tuesday.
