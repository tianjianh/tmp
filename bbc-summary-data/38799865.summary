The 25 year-old joined the Championship side in June after a successful spell at National League Dover Athletic, where he scored 40 goals in 90 games.
Payne has yet to score after nine matches for the Tykes and told the Shrewsbury website that this move has come at the right time for him.
"I've learnt a lot and developed a lot at Barnsley," he said.
"Now I just need game time and some goals."
Shrewsbury are 19th in League One, two points from the relegation zone, and have struggled for goals this season with only 28 in 29 games.
Payne is the fourth striker to join Shrewsbury on loan in January, following Crystal Palace's Freddie Ladapo and West Bromwich Albion's Tyler Roberts, and Fulham's Stephen Humphrys.
