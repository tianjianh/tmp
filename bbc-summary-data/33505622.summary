Users angry at the terms being imposed on Greece appended the term to their tweets.
By 09:00 GMT on Monday morning the term had been tweeted over 377,000 times.
It was the most tweeted term in Germany and France:
Many using the hashtag were particularly critical of Germany's stance, and compared the current situation to the Nazi occupation of Greece during World War Two:
The originator of the hashtag was reportedly this tweet by a Spanish maths and physics teacher on Sunday evening:
The Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman referred to it in a blog post for the New York Times, published on Sunday.
"The trending hashtag ThisIsACoup is exactly right," he writes.
"This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief."
For those who disagree with Mr Krugman's assessment of the deal for Greece, there's always #ThisIsNotACoup as an alternative hashtag.
However #ThisIsNotACoup had been tweeted just 573 times by 09:30 GMT on Monday.
