Baker's Quay Gloucester redevelopment 'hangs in balance'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The redevelopment of an area of Gloucester Docks is in doubt following a blaze which destroyed a Grade-II listed building on the site in October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme at Baker's Quay to convert the site into a hotel, apartments, restaurants and a drive-thru cafe has received local authority backing.
Developers Rokeby Merchants intend to completely rebuild Provender Mill which was gutted in the fire.
But planning officers are unhappy with some aspects of the design proposal.
Rokeby Merchant's Adrian Goodall said the project "hangs in the balance" until the issues about balconies and cladding are resolved.
Gloucester City Council said the planned design is not "in keeping with the industrial heritage" of the location.
Mr Goodall said it is "worrying" and there will be a "tough two weeks ahead" trying to settle the matter before the company plans to start building work in the summer.
"We're right up on the line now in terms of timescales," he added.
