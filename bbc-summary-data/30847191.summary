NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said a faulty pump affected heating in the Southern General's surgical building between Saturday and Thursday.
Mobile heaters and a wall-mounted system were used to keep patients warm and blankets were issued when needed.
The health board said the system was now operating normally and temperatures did not drop below 18 degrees.
A statement from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: "The heating system in the Southern General's surgical building is operational today.
"There were issues with the heating system due to a faulty pump which required a replacement to be ordered. A new pump has now been installed and the system has been vented/bled.
"A wall-mounted background heating system has been utilised and temporary mobile heating was also provided. Blankets were also given to patients where required/requested."
The health board said air temperatures, taken routinely in the building during the affected period, ranged from "18 to 21 degrees".
It said that hot water from a separate central heating system also experienced a small drop in temperature.
