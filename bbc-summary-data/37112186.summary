The Dutch fighter, ranked number two, won by split decision to secure her fifth successive victory over Marshall.
"I thought I'd won the second round and the last round but when I looked at the scores it wasn't even close," said Marshall, 25, from Hartlepool.
"I didn't win a round. I didn't even get a vote in the third."
"She's a brilliant fighter so she deserves the medal. What can I say, I haven't got one; I'll probably carry on after this though."
Marshall was tipped to win gold at London 2012 but was beaten in the first round by Kazakh Marina Volnova.
Fontijn, 28, will now face China's Qian Li in Friday's semi-final (19:45 BST).
