The studios have been the base for hundreds of film and TV productions since they opened in 1958.
They have also been home to a number of Oscar-winning movies including Braveheart and My Left Foot.
Its shareholders, however, have said they believe the "time is right" for the sale.
Its board of directors said the studios were being placed on the market as "a going concern" - but said the sale would have "no impact" on the studio's day-to-day operations.
Majority shareholders - former accountant for U2, Ossie Kilkenny and Paul McGuinness, the band's former manager - have owned the studios for nearly three decades.
In a statement, the studios said the pair would "continue to explore a number of other individual business interests".
Over the years, Ardmore has played host to top names in the movie industry including Mel Gibson during the filming of Braveheart in 1995, as well as Daniel Day Lewis and Brenda Fricker, who starred in My Left Foot (1989).
Big-name directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard and Stanley Kubrick have also worked with the studios.
More recently it has produced TV shows such as The Tudors, Moone Boy and award-winning drama Penny Dreadful.
In total, productions at Ardmore have received 14 Oscars and a number of BAFTA, Golden Globe and Emmy awards.
Ardmore Film Studios is situated on 18 acres of land in Bray, County Wicklow, and is the largest studio on the island of Ireland.
Productions currently on site include The Professor and the Madman, and Into the Badlands.
In 2016, Ardmore expanded its site and opened a new 47,000 sq ft facility to provide extra studio space, in light of market demand.
