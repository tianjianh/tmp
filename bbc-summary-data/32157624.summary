Karen Davis is accused of disorderly behaviour and will appear at Port Pirie Magistrates Court at a later date.
In a statement, police said: "The woman's actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the expectation is that we take action.
"It isn't appropriate for anyone to expose themselves... Our community should be able to expect decency."
Davis was quoted in a local newspaper on Monday saying she looked at Google Maps "a lot" and wanted to feature on Street View.
"I got to tick something else off my bucket list. I met Sam Newman and now I am on Google Maps," she told the Adelaide Advertiser.
"There was no child harmed in the making, my children don't have to go to therapy because of it, I didn't give any old man a heart attack â€” that I'm aware of.
"I spoke to my 19-year old son before and he thinks it's funny as, my children don't have a problem with it at all.
"I'm going to try and go to court with a straight face and try not to laugh - I think it is a bit hilarious because it is so low scale in the criminal world."
Google has now pixelated the whole of Karen Davis' body in Street View.
The photos were taken two months ago.
Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Davis said people in her local community have been calling her a "bad mother" and "pure filth".
"They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies," she said.
She also said that she has a friend in the UK and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online.
"If he looks on there he will smile," she said.
Davis says she plans to do a topless skydive for her 40th birthday next year.
