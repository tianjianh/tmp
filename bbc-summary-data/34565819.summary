Israel-Palestinian violence: Kerry to meet Netanyahu and Abbas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US Secretary of State John Kerry is to meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders this week amid a surge in violence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven Israelis have died in knife and gun attacks by lone Palestinians that began earlier this month.
More than 40 Palestinians, including several attackers, have been killed.
On Sunday, at least six people were injured in a gun and knife attack at a bus station in the southern city of Beersheva, Israeli officials said. One attacker was killed, one injured.
Mr Kerry's announcement came as the Israeli military removed Jewish worshippers it said had illegally entered a religious site in the occupied West Bank.
Thirty Israelis arrived at Joseph's Tomb in the city of Nablus and were assaulted by Palestinians before being handed over to Israeli forces by Palestinian police, reports say.
"Later this week I will meet with [Israeli] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu because he will be in Germany... and then I will go to the region, I will meet with [Palestinian] President [Mahmoud] Abbas, I will meet King Abdullah [of Jordan] and others," Mr Kerry said at the UN cultural body Unesco's headquarters in Paris.
Mr Kerry said he would also hold meetings on Syria while in Europe.
His comments came as Israel and the US resumed talks in Jerusalem on future military aid that Mr Netanyahu suspended in protest over the nuclear deal the US and other world powers have agreed with Iran.
Israeli security forces have imposed tighter restrictions in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and there have been clashes with Palestinian protesters.
The upsurge in violence began in September when tensions at a flashpoint holy site in East Jerusalem revered by Jews and Muslims boiled over amid rumours Israel planned to relax long-standing rules to strengthen Jewish rights at the complex. Israel has repeatedly denied such claims.
There has been a spate of stabbings of Israelis - several of them fatal - by Palestinians since early October, and one apparent revenge stabbing by an Israeli. The attackers have struck in Jerusalem and central and northern Israel, and in the occupied West Bank. Israel has tightened security and its security forces have clashed with rioting Palestinians, leading to deaths on the Palestinian side. The violence has also spread to the border with Gaza.
After a period of relative quiet, violence between the two communities has spiralled since clashes erupted at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site in mid-September. It was fuelled by rumours among Palestinians that Israel was attempting to alter a long-standing religious arrangement governing the site. Israel repeatedly dismissed the rumours as incitement. Soon afterwards, two Israelis were shot dead by Palestinians in the West Bank and the stabbing attacks began. Both Israel and the Palestinian authorities have accused one another of doing nothing to protect each other's communities.
There have been two organised uprisings by Palestinians against Israeli occupation, in the 1980s and early 2000s. With peace talks moribund, some observers have questioned whether we are now seeing a third. The stabbing attacks seem to be opportunistic and although they have been praised by militant groups, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said Palestinians are not interested in a further escalation.
What is driving the latest violence?
