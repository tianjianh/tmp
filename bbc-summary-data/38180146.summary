Michael Hoey made sure of surviving the halfway cut with birdies on three of the last four holes in the second round of the Alfred Dunhill Championship.

Playing on a sponsor's invite in South Africa, the 37-year-old Belfast man is on four under par after a 71 on Friday.
After an encouraging start, Hoey's second round threatened to unravel as he dropped five shots in six holes.
But he recovered for a one-under-par round and lies seven shots behind leader, South African Brandon Stone.
Hoey has endured a dismal 2016 as he lost his European Tour card and then also missed out at the qualifying school in Spain.
However, he carded an opening five-birdie 69 on the Leonard Creek course on Thursday.
Ireland's Paul Dunne shared the lead along with defending champion Charl Schwartzel after day one but is now six off the pace, having followed his opening 66 with a round of 73.
Schwartzel was the early clubhouse leader after a 68 left him 10 under, but Stone's round of six-under 66 saw him move one shot ahead by the end of day two.
Darren Clarke was 10 over par after two rounds and missed the cut.
