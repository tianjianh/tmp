Janice McAleese ran the organisation from 2003 to 2007, resigning shortly before serious financial problems came to light.
The NI Audit Office has previously described her conduct as the worst it has seen from a senior public official.
The maximum period that someone can be banned from directorship is 15 years.
An audit report found Ms McAleese was involved in fabricating documents provided to a government department and her board of directors.
She also failed to disclose a personal relationship with a contractor who was paid Â£120,000 for a motocross bike event in Moneyglass, County Antrim.
