Bird flu: New case confirmed in County Tipperary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sixth case of bird flu in a wild bird in the Republic of Ireland since last year has been confirmed in County Tipperary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The latest case involved a whooper swan found in Nenagh.
It follows three previous cases in whooper swans this year, with two cases in Eurasian wigeons in December.
The first case in Northern Ireland - a swan found dead near Lough Beg, County Londonderry - was confirmed on Thursday.
In December, the Irish Department of Agriculture activated regulations requiring all poultry and captive birds to be kept within a secure building amid concerns over bird flu.
The public is advised not to handle dead or sick birds.
Avian influenza is a contagious disease that affects birds, including poultry: It can spread quickly, often proving fatal.
It can occur in both wild and farmed birds, but the threat to the public is said to be very low.
