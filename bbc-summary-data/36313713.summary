Leicester boss Richard Cockerill says Saturday's Premiership play-off semi-final at European champions Saracens is "a game you want to play in".

Sarries were crowned Europe's best for the first time at the weekend after beating French side Racing 92 21-9.
The London club have also finished top of the Premiership table in their bid to secure a domestic-Euro double.
"We lose, we go on holiday, we win, we have a chance of winning the title, which is our aim," said Cockerill.
"Everything rests on this weekend. It's all for us to do, but great motivation for us and the games you want to play in."
Leicester were 21-13 winners in their last encounter with Saracens, who are also defending Premiership champions, in March.
But they were beaten 26-6 at Allianz Park in January, underlining the size of their task, although the expected return of Manu Tuilagi, Mike Fitzgerald and Brendon O'Connor will boost selection options.
Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester: "We've been there a few times and never won on that plastic pitch and not played well enough.
"We know how tough it's going to be and they already have a trophy in the cabinet as European champions.
"But this is a different scenario, a semi-final, and a great opportunity for us. We know on our day we can beat anybody and we just have to get it right."
