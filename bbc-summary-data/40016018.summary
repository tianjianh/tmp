[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samuel McCuaig, 58, who is originally from North Lanarkshire but had been living in Devon, England, committed the offences between 1974 and 1979.
He was convicted at the High Court in Glasgow of raping the nine-year-old girl at a house in Coatbridge in 1976.
Jailing McCuaig for eight years, judge Lord Armstrong said his crimes were of a "particularly grievous nature".
The court heard that McCuaig had carried out the abuse on the girls over a period of several years in Coatbridge.
His defence QC Derek Ogg said his client had grown up in a "dysfunctional permissive environment" and continued to maintain his innocence.
However, McCuaig was convicted of raping the nine-year-old girl - a cousin of his other three victims - on one occasion during a 12-month period from February 1976.
He was also found guilty of indecently assaulting a teenage girl at a house in Coatbridge between 1975 and 1978.
He was further convicted of attempting to rape the teenager's nine-year-old sister during the same incident.
McCuaig was acquitted of two charges of raping the older girl prior to April 1974, when she was aged between 13 and 15, after the jury returned not proven verdicts.
Lord Armstrong said: "Three of your victims were aged between seven and 10 when you abused them. The fourth girl was 16. These offences are of a particularly grievous nature.
"According to the background report prepared, you lack insight into the impact of your actions on the victims and display little if any remorse."
