The agency said Movette had used "deceptive methods" to bill clients for the use of Google My Business - a free service provided by the US search firm.
Movette had been in business for two-and-a-half years before being wound up in the High Court.
It had received more than £500,000 in fees before the intervention.

"Now they hound me every day demanding money and threatening to send in bailiffs. They always ring on withheld number but the number to call back on is a premium number. Clearly it's a scam."
Another posted on business reviews website Trustpilot: "Complete liars, rude arrogant... they claim the verbal contracts are legally binding and cannot be cancelled. Do not believe them."
The Insolvency Service noted that Movette had operated a "very similar business" to another company - Online Platform Management Consultants Ltd - which had shut in April 2015 after operating from the same Manchester address.
