Wycombe Wanderers manager Gareth Ainsworth said there will be "no way we'll be resting" after Tuesday's 5-1 thrashing of Crewe in League Two.

The Chairboys won for only the third time in the league this campaign to move up to 19th in the table.
"We've had some tough times lately. We're at the wrong end of the table, I know that," said Ainsworth.
"I'll be doing everything I possibly can to build on this. One result doesn't make a season."
Sam Wood and Paris Cowan-Hall found the net for the first time this campaign to put Wycombe two ahead against the Alex before on-loan Southampton midfielder Dominic Gape scored his first professional goal to make it 3-0 before half-time.
Scott Kashket then added a brace on his home debut to make it 5-0 before a late Crewe consolation.
"I'm just really pleased we've got a win," Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio.
"But I won't get carried away. I didn't get too down when we got beat 4-1 (by Luton), I'm not going too get carried away when we win 5-1.
"I want to get ready for Exeter now and back this up. The fans were great, hopefully we've put a few more on the gate for Saturday and this club can start moving up the table.
"The second half of the season, I'm expecting to be stronger."
