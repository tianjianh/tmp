Captain Greig Laidlaw has urged Scotland to be "smart" in Saturday's second Test against Japan.

The Scots laboured to a 26-13 win over the Cherry Blossoms in Toyota City last weekend and face them again in Tokyo.
Both of Scotland's tries came while Japan had men in the sin-bin and Laidlaw racked up 16 points with six successful kicks out of six.
"We'll need to make some small tweaks within the game," the scrum-half told BBC Scotland.
"That's the beauty or the hard part of playing teams back-to-back. You don't want to be doing exactly the same things one week to the next.
"The flipside to that is I'm sure Japan will try and change a couple of things too. Defensively, we'll need to be smart."
Vern Cotter will name his Scotland team on Thursday, with several changes expected from the first Test.
Prop Alasdair Dickinson and centre Duncan Taylor have both been ruled out with injuries, with loose-head Rory Sutherland set for a first Test start, and either Peter Horne or the uncapped Huw Jones likely to replace Taylor.
Glasgow back-rower Josh Strauss could also come into the match-day squad.
Analysis of the first Test at Toyota Stadium revealed the Scots ran around 50% more than during a typical Six Nations match.
"It is a different game," said Laidlaw. "The fact that we coped well and came out with a victory was credit to the boys, especially in the heat.
"Vern's right on the boys' heels about staying in system and getting to the ball carrier quickly."
