Wilfried Bony says he will be totally focused on Swansea City's next two games despite his imminent departure on international duty.

Swansea's top scorer will aim to add to his eight Premier League goals this season in Monday's trip to Liverpool, and then away to QPR on New Year's Day.
The striker, 26, will then spend at least three weeks with Ivory Coast on African Cup of Nations duty.
"The most important thing is the games I have here," Bony said.
"If I don't play well then they will not call me for the national team.
"I have two more games [for Swansea], so I'm just thinking about that and let's see how it will be later.
"It will be a difficult game, Liverpool are still Liverpool. We will go there not to lose and we will see what result we can bring home."
Swansea head to Anfield on the back of two wins over the festive period, following up a 1-0 win at Hull City with victory by the same score at home to Aston Villa on Boxing Day.
The two clean sheets were helped by the goalkeeping of Lukasz Fabianski, with the Poland international producing a spectacular one-handed save to prevent Christian Benteke grabbing an equaliser for Villa.
"It's obviously very pleasing for the manager that's for sure, because we work so hard on the defensive part of our game," said the Swansea stopper.
"And it's really pleasing as well for our defensive unit... the way we've been playing so far in that department over the season so far."
Liverpool have stuttered this season and are three points behind Swansea, who are eighth in the Premier League table.
But the Reds came from behind to grab a draw against Arsenal and then got back to winning ways with victory at Burnley.
Fabianski admits the sale of Luis Suarez and the long-term injury to fellow striker Daniel Sturridge have affected Liverpool, but warns that they are still not to be taken lightly.
"They have plenty of players that can step up. They have a big squad, they made loads of signings," Fabianski added.
"Their season so far hasn't been the way they want it but they have very good players... still a strong squad, still a strong team, great players and we have to respect that."
