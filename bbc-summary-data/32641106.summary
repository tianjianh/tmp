Chris Green said his win with 19,744 votes over Labour's Julie Hilling, who received 18,943, was "just wonderful".
On a bad night for the Liberal Democrats, they lost Cheadle and Hazel Grove to the Tories and Manchester Withington to Labour.
Labour also held on to Heywood and Middleton, fending off a challenge from second-placed UKIP.
Tory William Wragg was elected to the Hazel Grove seat with 17,882 votes, defeating Liberal Democrat Lisa Smart, who received 11,330.
Conservative Mary Robinson won in Cheadle, securing 22,889 votes over Lib Dem Mark Hunter's 16,436, a swing of 9.2%.
Mr Hunter said: "Sometimes you have to accept that you can't swim against the national tide."
Manchester Withington was a significant victory for Labour in what was a hugely disappointing night for both them and the Lib Dems across the UK.
Jeff Smith secured victory with 26,843 votes over John Leech's 11,970, in a huge 17% swing.
Mr Leech had been the MP for Withington since 2005, although Labour held the seat for 18 years beforehand.
In the Greater Manchester constituency of Heywood and Middleton, Liz McInnes was re-elected with 20,926 votes, while John Bickley received 15,627.
The pair had previously squared off just seven months ago, when Ms McInnes won a by-election by only 617 votes.
That vote, in a traditionally safe seat held by Labour since 1983, came after incumbent Jim Dobbin's sudden death.
Elsewhere, Tameside has elected its first woman MP in its history with Angela Rayner holding onto Ashton-under-Lyne, with almost a 50% share of the vote.
Labour also increased its majority in Bolton South East, despite large UKIP gains, and held 21 Greater Manchester seats in total.
The Conservatives held Altrincham & Sale West and Bury North, but the Liberal Democrats have been wiped out in Greater Manchester.
