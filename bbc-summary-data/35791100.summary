[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling Fulham's winless streak extended to six games following an entertaining draw against Birmingham.

The visitors dominated early on and were rewarded when Rohan Ince's driven shot squeezed past Tomasz Kuszczak.
Michael Morrison's firm header from David Cotterill's accurate cross drew Blues level shortly after half-time.
Birmingham nearly won it late on as David Davis' shot hit the post before Clayton Donaldson fired the rebound over the crossbar.
The result meant Fulham dropped down to 21st place, just one point above the drop zone, while Birmingham remained ninth, six points off a play-off place.

Despite their poor recent form, Fulham flew out of the blocks as Emerson Hyndman and Scott Parker had great chances to open the scoring.
They were soon rewarded for their early dominance as Ince, on loan from Brighton, opened his account for the club.
On the stroke of half-time, Jonathan Spector's header from Cotterill's free-kick was magnificently saved by Marcus Bettinelli, but the keeper was helpless after the break to stop Morrison from equalising.
Fulham have won just twice in 15 games under Slavisa Jokanovic. The Serb, who led Watford to the Premier League last season, has eight games to keep his side from dropping into League One.
Birmingham City defender Michael Morrison:
"It's a little bit like the Wolves game, we've chucked everything at it.
"We've had chances again, it's just not falling for us at the moment and it's really disappointing.
"Unfortunately it doesn't seem like we can kill teams off at the moment."
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic:

"We were very competitive today. At this moment, we've got a month and a half until the end of the season.
"We played good football against a team in the top half, but we didn't win. It's a point and if you cannot win three, it's important you get one.
"Our future is in our hands and we'll fight until the last second. Let's be brave, intelligent and play with desire like we did today."
