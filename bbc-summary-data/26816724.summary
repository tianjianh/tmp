More Birmingham schools are under investigation over an alleged plot to oust head teachers, the Department for Education (Dfe) has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four schools were identified in an anonymous letter outlining plans to introduce more Islamic principles.
The Dfe said it was looking into claims the so-called Operation Trojan Horse scheme had targeted twelve schools.
Park View Education Trust, which runs three of the schools, has denied the allegations.
Officials from Ofsted have visited Park View, Nansen Primary and Golden Hillock schools, which are all part of the trust.
Park View governor Tahir Alam has denied any involvement in the letter  and said it "maligned" his reputation.
The Dfe said its own investigation into the claims was ongoing alongside Birmingham City Council's previously announced probe.
A Dfe spokesperson it would "take firm action" if it found standards were not being met.
"Where we become aware of issues of concern we will move quickly to resolve these," they added.
Authorities have yet to determine if the letter, apparently sent from someone in Birmingham to a contact in Bradford, is genuine.
The four-page document suggested methods for replacing senior staff and governors with people sympathetic to Islam.
It claimed responsibility for leadership changes at Adderley Primary, Saltley School, Park View School and Regents Park Community Primary School.
