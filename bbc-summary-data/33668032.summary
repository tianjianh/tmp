Women's Ashes: Rain means third ODI goes to reserve day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The third and final one-day international of the Women's Ashes series between England and Australia at Worcester will now take place on Monday after rain washed out Sunday's play.

The game was scheduled to start at 10:30 BST but persistent rain meant the umpires had to call off play at 13:50.
With ICC Women's Championship points as well as Women's Ashes points at stake, the match now goes into a reserve day.
Weather permitting, a full 50-over game will start at 10:30 BST on Monday.
No toss had been made or teams announced.
The series stands level at 2-2 on points, with a Test and three Twenty20 internationals to follow this game.
Rain also hampered Sunday's One-Day Cup fixture programme - with only two of the scheduled seven games starting on time.
