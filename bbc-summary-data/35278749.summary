RAF aircraft carried out four missions against the Islamic State group in Syria on Sunday, using Brimstone missiles for the first time.

The Brimstone strikes targeted a vehicle near Raqqa - a stronghold of IS - as well as the Omar oilfield in the east of Syria, said Downing Street.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK was "playing a key role" in the fight against IS, also known as Daesh.
Brimstone missiles are viewed as more accurate than their rivals.
Sold as the "most accurate precision strike product on the market", they are radar-guided and able to be used against targets moving at up to 70mph.
What is the Brimstone missile?
The UK and Saudi Arabia are the only two countries to have purchased Brimstones, and while laying out his case for British action against IS in Syria, David Cameron argued that their use would make a "meaningful difference" to the battle.
MPs voted in favour of extending UK action into Syria on 2 December, but strikes have so far been few in number.
RAF activity has instead been focused on Iraq - most recently in the battle for Ramadi - but it appears there has now been a surge of activity over Syria, said BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale.
In its latest update on UK actions against IS, the MoD outlined the four missions carried out on Sunday:
The MoD said the RAF also carried out a number of missions over Iraq last week, supporting troops on the ground, including destroying two machine-gun positions and two armoured personnel carriers near Ramadi.
The defence secretary said: "Britain is playing a key role in the fight against Daesh, whether helping Iraqi ground forces retake Ramadi or by striking targets near its Raqqa heartland.
"Our Reaper drones have now flown 1,000 missions against Daesh and we will maintain this tempo with RAF pilots flying day and night over Iraq and Syria."
He added: "The Royal Navy continues to support our allies as HMS St Albans will shortly join the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier group as we unite to destroy Daesh."
Mr Fallon said he would meet other coalition defence ministers next week "to plan the next stage of the strategy".
Meanwhile, the UK is helping to fund a United Nations mission to deliver aid to the besieged Syrian town of Madaya, where there are reports of people starving to death.
The Department for International Development said UK money would help provide food parcels, nutritional supplements, essential drugs and non-food items, such as tents, for up to 40,000 people.
