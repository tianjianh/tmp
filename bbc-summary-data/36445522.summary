Drunken priest suspended after kicking PC and trying to bite paramedic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A priest has been suspended after he admitted assaulting a police officer and a paramedic on a drunken night out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Reverend Gareth Jones swore at officers and claimed he had diplomatic immunity from the Vatican when he was arrested two weeks ago.
A paramedic found him passed out in his clerical clothes on Charing Cross Road, in Covent Garden, central London.
He had drunk three bottles of wine, several pints of beer, a number of gin and tonics and vodka.
Highbury Corner magistrates heard he kicked a paramedic twice in the leg before punching him and trying to bite him.
As police intervened, the priest from St Mary's Church in Ilford, east London, kicked an officer in the face, the court was told.
When asked which embassy would grant him diplomatic immunity, the Anglican priest said "the Vatican" and swore at officers.
Mr Jones now faces formal church disciplinary proceedings.
His lawyer, Dominic Hockley, told the court that Mr Jones had consumed about 53 units of alcohol before the incident and was seeking help to deal with alcoholism.
"To say that this incident has been a wake-up call would be an understatement," said Mr Hockley.
District Judge Robin McPhee ordered Mr Jones, who admitted two assaults, to pay £700 in fines, £200 in compensation each to the policeman and the paramedic, as well as £85 prosecution costs and a £35 victim surcharge.
A tweet from Mr Jones's account, posted on Thursday evening but subsequently deleted said: "The fire is lit."
A spokesman for the diocese of Chelmsford said: "We are deeply shocked by Mr Jones' behaviour.
"We suspended him from his duties as soon as we were notified of the incident.
"Now that the case has been concluded we have started proceedings under the terms of the Clergy Discipline Measure.
"We are holding all those affected by this serious incident in our prayers."
