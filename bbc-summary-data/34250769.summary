Cider producer Thistly Cross makes 'bucket for bottle' offer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An East Lothian cider maker is offering the public free cider or apple juice in exchange for spare apples.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thistly Cross is encouraging donations from large orchards and private gardens across Scotland.
The company said its "bucket for a bottle" scheme was part of an attempt to reduce waste, as many locally-grown apples would otherwise go unused.
Dunbar-based Thistly added that donations would be welcomed, provided the fruit was clean and rot-free.
It will accept most apple varieties, apart from crab apples.
Thistly head cider maker Peter Stuart said: "We have a tradition of using apples grown across Scotland from a wide range of sources including professional apple growers, schools, large estate owners and the general public who grow apples in their gardens at home.
"We even use apples donated from the grounds of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.
"Our popularity is increasing but Thistly can't make all the cider it wants to without the help of the public.
"Our unique system of using donated apples also eliminates the waste that is all too often associated with the food industry of modern times."
Donations can be delivered directly to the store at Belhaven Fruit Farm in Dunbar.
For those living further north, fruit can be handed in to a drop-off point at Gordon Castle in Moray.
