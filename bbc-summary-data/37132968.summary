Phil Edwards: Oxford United sign Burton Albion right-back on season-long loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United have signed right-back Phil Edwards from Burton Albion on a season-long loan deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edwards arrives at the League One club after full-back Christian Ribeiro required surgery on an ankle injury.
The 30-year-old was a regular in Burton's side which secured automatic promotion from League One last season.
"The opportunity came up to get some game time and that was behind the move," he told BBC Radio Oxford. "I'm looking forward to getting out there."
